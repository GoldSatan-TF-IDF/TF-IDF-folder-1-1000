hear me i hear you bill readability strength and tone okay shoot fine fine time gmt estimated position miles southsouthwest of tristan approximately miles southsouthwest of gough island what the hells wrong with your navigation bill cant you do better than that be exact you could be anywhere maybe i am fellah you should be here im flying blind dead blind i reckon the top of the overcast could be anything up to feet theres a knot gale im plugging right into the teeth of it air speed is down to knots planes guzzling gas whats your visibility nil i couldnt see another plane if it came into me its nine hours since takeoffand this ship can stay in the air for seventeen not at this rate though youre not going to crap out of the mission because of that are you bill who said i was crapping out you should be here to see for yourself this is one hell of a cockamamie search acoustical reconnaissance jeez all the acoustics i can hear is the sound of the goddam gale nothing on your antisub plot no malfunction of your electronic datagathering gear no intercept youre making my copilot piss himself laughing fellah i said you should be here this sort of flying is poker with everything wild there isnt a damn thing from here to cape horn not a ship not an island nothing its all sea and gale and icebergs as for a red sub what is your estimated time to the turn bill could be anything depends on how much gas she consumes how far south i get im at feet now ive been right down to and up to looking for easier conditions it dont make much difference to the gale hey wait a moment monitor crew report surface radar and navigation operator to pilot pilots voice resumes ive got a surface intercept on the radar can you believe it out here you sure bill its not a radar angel an iceberg no were holding the image its a ship for sure looks like a small one maybe its a sub sail bill im going down to investigate keep the line open fellah for sure monitor this section of the tape has been shortened it covers the descent of the orion through heavy overcast with nil visibility and force gale to zero altitude above sea surface there are no reports of instrument or mechanical failure from the aircraft pilots voice resumes three hundred feet two fifty two hundred clouds clearing its clear holy mother of god what is it bill what is it man its enough to blow your mind ive never seen anything like this bill report for chrissake sorry it took my breath away im at feet as far as i can see the water looks like calf slobber there are icebergs everywhere like huge meringues every goddam iceberg you ever saw whole clusters of em theres also one hell of a berg yeah its all one berg it goes back clean to the horizon youre crazy bill one berg that big im flying alongside it now its higher than our altitude the top of it is lost in the overcast what do you estimate its size to be bill i cant whadderyemean you cant see here fellah ive never seen a sea like this the whole oceans like a vast shivering liz pudding made out of icebergs the seas all slushy in between its steaming mist and fog and im manoeuvring round the shoulder of this great berg now there it is surface observation visual its a sub sail no hold it it is a boat a yacht a yacht do you hear here shes travelling fast too shes planing down the waves like a rollercoaster i can see her wake ill be over her in a moment say theres something wrong i can spot the sea through her sails theyre not ordinary sails theyre sails with slits in em looks like a kinda venetian blind turned wrong way up monitor what follows is a flight deck conversation between pilot and crew captain captain visual there starboard coming up out of the sea captain here missile alert stand by everyone emergency evasive drill underwatertoair missile tracking radar on jesus its too late weve bought the farm its going to catch us right up the ass v monitor tape returns to zero no further contact chapter windeater that should have been her name her sails were six pairs of lips parted now like a womans in passion six on the main six on the jib each pair seemed to drink in the wind swallow it and by some magic of aerodynamics regurgitate it as energy to thrust the yachts lean hull through the sea at speeds unheard of by conventional rigs both sails the main and the jib were unlike any others split into segments lengthwise to the top of the mast each strip had transverse battens fixed at intervals to make for easy handling this was a spaceage rig named the venetian rig in memory of the venetian republics great sailing past into the design of the windfilled dacron segments above my head had gone all that man had learned of aerodynamics solar energy in the form of wind was being converted into thrust in a way which made the conventional sail as out of date as the wright brothers first aeroplane compared to a concorde those dozen crossbattened strips of dacron had gunned me from cape horn to the cape of good hope in record time for a singlehanded sailor seamiles in twentysix days an average speed of seven knots now albatros and i were at the end of our journey at about in the morning i looked up the way i had checked those newfangled sails a thousand times during my race across the worlds wildest ocean suddenly the high rocky cliffs of the coastline backed by bushcovered hills opened like a gate about a mile away bearing about ten degrees was my landfall my homecoming from an epic journey these were the heads of knysna entrance to the small port on the capes southern coast where albatros had first taken the water she was the third sailing ship to carry the famous name the first had been a schooner which had brought a family of boatbuilders the thesens from norway to knysna over a century before the second had been a capetorio yacht race winner but my albatros had proved to be the fastest sailing boat afloat between cape horn and the cape the narrow dangerous entrance needed all my concentration it would not have done to pile albatros up on her home cliffs ahead lay a tricky outer and inner bar to negotiate further complicated by the peculiarities of the venetian rig its principal virtue was excellence in heavy weather below the towering cliffs the sails would be blanketed from the fresh southeaster and i marvelled again as i had done so many times on the voyage at the paradoxical sight of albatross burgee streaming in one direction forward while tufts of rope in the lee of the sail streamed in the opposite direction against the wind it was the embodiment of the aerodynamic magic of the venetian rig breakers threw up a menacing line of white between the towering headlands guarding the entrance channel in a moment i was among them the strong thrust of the wind disappeared below the cliffs it became fluky bouncing from high point to high point i held on however and then i was over the inner bar to where the narrow channel led into the lagoon beyond i was in the process of lining up the yachts seastained white hull for the last turn into the anchorage when i was deafened by the blast of horns hundreds of cars which i had not noticed before because of my concentration lined the eastern headland and the road flanking my route it seemed as if the whole population of knysna had turned out hooting shouting waving cheering then a fleet of motorboats appeared from nowhere men and women in holiday wear came alongside shouting congratulations and gawping at albatross seaswept cockpit and the salt stains trailing from the sail battens mute witnesses to half a dozen furious encounters with the roaring forties in my dark clothes and my unkempt monthold beard i felt like the flying dutchman himself the motorboats began sheepdogging albatros downchannel past leisure island a paradise of luxury homes and gardens standing among dark milkwood trees it seemed to me that not only albatross home port but the whole country was waiting when i stepped ashore on the jetty at thesens yard where albatros had been built there was a barrage of press camera flashes tv and movie cameras microphones were thrust in front of my face i was assaulted by scores of questions the venetian rig what was its secret speed best days run from all the shaking of wellwishers hands my arm felt as if i had pumped out albatross bilges for a week then after a brief respite knysnas pride in albatros and its hospitality overflowed at an official luncheon more interviews endless handshakes the blur of friendly anonymous admiring faces inevitably a local beauty queen found her way into a picture pose with me finally in the late afternoon i was the house guest of the reception committees chairman a yachting enthusiast named don mackay i was thankful to be whisked away from the neverending congratulations to his home on the summit of eastern head from which i overlooked the entrance channel i had sailed through that morning don was apologetic about the place its only the old pilot house he explained but i wanted the view when the harbour was still functioning commercially it used to be the spot from which the pilots could see what ships were approaching knysna from any direction it had a woodpanelled room whose octagonal sides consisted entirely of glass as high as the waist the panorama of ocean and mountain landwards was stupendous a telescope on a stand clipper ship prints on the walls a fullrigged model in a glass case mounted scenic charts of the coast and a flagstaff on the sogreen lawn beyond the windows made the pilot house comfortably suburbannautical dons whisky felt good i was exhausted i felt more like ninety years old than twentyseven every muscle every nerveendings was tired my mind was as flat as a sail in the doldrums don a sunburned redheaded giant of a man held out the whisky bottle for me to inspect like it he asked i looked at the label in surprise i thought it was genuine scotch no south african good as the original heather brew three ships the name seemed appropriate for the occasion i hope the occasions done i couldnt stand much more of it i wanted more than anything to be alone like a drunk with his bottle i said gruffly i hope youre not throwing another party for me now don looked uncomfortable and glanced at his watch not a party just one other guest friend of yours don hesitated his name is axel thomsen he jetted in early this morning and motored over to knysna from the airfield at george he collected a speeding fine on the way because he was so keen not to miss your arrival he got here literally in a jibboom ahead of albatros whats the rush don was cagey hell tell you himself hes late sheila dons wife appeared and saved him from further questions any woman looks beautiful after youve been a month alone at sea but sheila didnt need that distorted view to boost her good looks peter she said to me ill show you to your room if youd like to clean up before mr thomsen arrives my room youre staying surely i tried to laugh off their disappointment a fakir likes to get back to his bed of nails i think id rather sleep aboard albatros tonight ill come some other time if i may well keep you to that she said just then a car drew up on the driveway there was something in the glance that don shot in my direction which puzzled me here comes axel thomsen i hope youll like him he came forward and without any preliminaries took my hand congratulations captain rainier he said he had the most compelling pair of eyes i had ever seen he held my hand in a strong grip there was power in it power about the man himself he would draw people to himself like iron filings to a magnet his scrutiny of me was as keen as a wind off the drake passage he was of medium height only and looked about forty the clothes he wore light blue casual slacks and a kind of matching battle blouse emphasized his leanness a chinese white silk choker was secured at his throat by a yellow diamond pin he seemed to miss or simply override my resentment i was in one of the boats that came to cheer you on completing your magnificent feat i saw you bring your ship through that tricky entrance i didnt think it possible to manoeuvre any craft with the mainboom centred without adjustment to the sheets i hope youre now satisfied that its possible i retorted i think it must be because there are vents from the high pressure to the low pressure sides of the sail at such short intervals that the air flow turns round the back and still gives a high degree of lift even when its well beyond what would be the stall angle in a normal sail i realized how near the limit of fatigue i was when i heard myself rasp what are you trying to prove thomsen threw me a keen upandunder glance his reply was conciliatory nothing except one must understand what one is up against i have a rig which works better chapter thomsen stood there rocking on the balls of his feet as if inviting me to hit him verbally his eyes were searching mine assessing me then he pulled out a gold and black pack of perillys private blend and offered me one lighting it and his own with a tiny gold lighter in the shape of a dolphin i answered him repeating it by rote was too tired to be original the venetian rig is the first major advance in sail design for centuries it was invented by dr glauco corbellini an italian engineer thomsen made an impatient sweep with his cigarette i know all that what i want to know is how does it work the answer is on the board twentysix days four thousand two hundred miles that doesnt say how it handles easily its ideal for one man sailing alone it is simple it is fast it is highly efficient in strong winds how fast thomsen had a curious empathy which made me continue now i explained ill tell you right at the beginning of my run i struck a lucky slant just east of the horn he seemed to draw the story out of me what do you call a lucky slant sheila who had been present for the introductions slipped away when the conversation became technical don stood by drinking it in a gale sprang up out of nowhere as it does near the horn it hit fifty knots before i realized what was happening it was the first big test for the venetian rig it turned out to be a winner albatros was going like a bomb surfing up to twentyfive knots on the bigger rollers i shortened sail which was easy even in those conditions because each sail is a separate strip and there are quickrelease expansion buttons to facilitate things no reefing like ordinary sails the anenometer touched sixty knots shortly after thats its maximum calibration it was in fact gusting higher seventyfive knots perhaps so in order to make the best time i took albatros through the strait of le maire with the wind and tiderips in her favour i managed another four knots over the ground albatros was really moving however i had to get clear of the strait before the tide changed or else id have been in trouble as it was i made it by a whisker i managed with half an hour to spare thomsen was still eyeing me the strait of le maire is the most bloody dangerous place in the world in any craft most of all in a small yacht it may have been the whisky or perhaps the way thomsen seemed to relate to albatross achievements but i continued to talk describing how id cut through the jasons and the prevailing conditions which i admitted were fairly rough the man was showing so much interest in my account often interrupting me to put a very knowledgeable question to me that he began to intrigue me as did the reason for his presence i was particularly intrigued as to why he should know so much about the falklands and about a short cut through a group of remote galelashed islands at the other side of the earth of interest only to penguin fanciers and environmentalists thomsen brought his right fist into his left palm with a smack hells teeth you were as close to port stanley in the falklands as the jasons and i didnt know it he strode across to one of the big windows overlooking the anchorage the lagoon in the last light of the midsummers day was incomparably soft and lovely pearlgrey and otherworld against a backdrop of blue peaks and green forested slopes of the soaring outeniqua mountains catching the mood don said at this time of day a flock of wild ostriches comes down from the belvedere side and feeds on the prawns in the shallows they stay until the tide rises up to their bellies thomsen however had eyes only for albatros at anchor she looks very small big enough when youre only one bigger than a house when she pitchpoled and fell on top of me he took another drink from don arse over tip what happened listen im tired i began when a thought struck me i appreciate your enthusiasm and interest in albatros i dont know anything about you beyond your name whats it all about don looked uncomfortable mr thomsen is from the aaland isles as if that explained everything thomsen laughed you cant expect him to know anything as civilized as the aalands he grinned at me the aalands are a group in the baltic between finland and sweden i am a finn i was born in mariehamn the aalands capital so was gustav erickson the last great windjammer shipowner before world war ii he had some magnificent ships like the herzogin cecile for one even today people remember her thomsens amused glance at me was the sort that professionals swap in the company of amateurs finished up on the rocks in cornwall erickson was a relation of mine on my mothers side seamanship goes back centuries in the aalanders blood erickson drew his splendid crews mainly from the aaland isles even the advent of steam hasnt quite killed their love for sail there are still crews to be had there who would rather man a windjammer than a steamer thomsen did not look like a dreamer to me yet today windjammers are the stuff that dreams are made of don interrupted aaland is the home of the international association of cape horners men and women who have rounded the horn in sail dont forget to join the fraternity rainier thomsen added a little ironically he resumed in a different tone it is true the aaland isles are the last resort of what few windjammers remain in the nuclear age we aalanders still hanker after sail for sails sake although our reason and our pockets tell us it is dead there are still people who love dinosaurs i remarked he downed his drink he drank it on the rocks in a gulp it is a good comparison that the dinosaur was a complex creature complex and cumbersome he lacked mobility which means speed nowadays speed is equated with evolution the windjammer died because it was complex and cumbersome sail has a place even if a limited place today still i began albatros has proved what i am trying to say he broke in the venetian rig is simple it has speed corbellini had a touch of genius no i said you are trying to equate two things which cannot be compared the yacht and the commercial sailing vessel lets face it the cargocarrying windjammer is dead dead as the dinosaur what works for a small yacht doesnt necessarily work in a scaledup version in a big ship thomsen paused a long while before replying then he said decisively as if he had made up his mind about something or someone the venetian rig is not the only modern development in sail there is another which technically functions in exactly the opposite way in almost every respect nor is the windjammer dead i have taken a twenty million dollar gamble to prove it is not chapter all the circuits in my brain meshed like a switchboard in which suddenly the right connections have been made i knew now who thomsen was i knew why he was interested in sail if i had not been so punchdrunk with fatigue i should have been wise to his identity earlier jetwind i said youre the man who built jetwind right thats me now that the wraps were off his mystery guest don became vocal mr thomsen was visiting cape town he was dead keen to meet you a mutual yachting friend put us in touch thomsen brushed aside dons courtesies sail was what mattered in his scheme of things not social niceties the latent power i had noticed about the man was more in evidence now he said almost declaiming the facts jetwind is a seventeen thousand tonnes sixmasted sailing ship of the most revolutionary design that has ever appeared on the high seas she bears no resemblance to the oldtime clipper or windjammer the only thing she has in common with them is being powered by sail even her sails are not sails in the accepted sense they are aerodynamically perfect aerofoils there is no rigging no oldtime spiders web of ropes the masts are special alloy unstayed and streamlined actuated by hydraulic servomechanisms or locked in trim by a pushbutton on her bridge a single operator only is needed there is rollertype automatic sail furling and reefing it works by means of stainless steel runners along the yards every operation aboard jetwind is automated computers determine her optimum sailing angle and yard trim the design has been evolved over years and tested by the institut fur schiffbau in hamburg thousands of windtunnel tests went into the final design they call her the nuclearage marvel interjected don she is that thomsen agreed everything and more on passage she is weather routed to utilize the most favourable winds on her ongoing course data is fed by satellite twice a day into her computers conventional navigation went overboard with all the rest of the oldfashioned junk surrounding windjammers pushbutton prints from computers do it all at any moment of the day or night she can establish her position to within half a mile on any ocean all the captain has to do is to press a button and read a dial the sea isnt licked by pushbuttons and computers i observed the same goes for jetwinds unsupported masts and yards fiftytwo metres high ill withhold judgement until ive seen how jetwind performs in a southern ocean blow thomsen met my scepticism with obvious selfcontrol jetwind is as radical in construction as in conception we brought in aircraft manufacturers for the long lightweight masts their experience in assembling wing structures and understanding the stresses involved was what we needed not oldfashioned shipbuilding methods we reduced overhead costs by using offtheshelf aircraft mountings for the masts and yards as well it sounds like science fiction to me but seeing is believing thomsen did not raise his voice but the power which had brought jetwind to reality in the face of the sceptics and scoffers and put sail back on the high seas pulsed through his reply i am not a dreamer get that clear i am a businessman a shipowner nor is jetwind my brain child first and foremost my stake in jetwind is money the dream part belonged to a german engineer named wilhelm prolss that dream began a long time ago before world war ii prolss was attending a dryasdust business conference in hamburg the board room overlooked the harbour prolss was trying to keep awake through a dull discussion then under the window a tug went by towing an old fourmasted barque to the scrap yard it was a sight to make a sailor sad but prolss wasnt a sailor yet it triggered something deep inside his brain ten thousand years of mans skill and endeavour to conquer the sea lay behind that pathetic old ship going to the knackers he told himself was the sailing ship really so inefficient did mans use of the wind have to end tragically like that don refilled our glasses the twilight over the serene sweep of waters below us was as softly melancholy as the sight of prolsss doomed windjammer must have been thomsen enmeshed us in his narrative from that day for twentyone long years the idea of windpower incubated in prolsss mind finally he took his ideas to the institut fur schiffbau in hamburg the experts became sold on the idea for ten years scientists windtunnel tested examined redesigned perfected they made models radical spaceagelooking structures of masts yards sails hulls hydraulic machinery for furling the sails and trimming the masts and yards finally they came up with the design that became jetwind a spaceage sailing ship of seventeen thousand tonnes one hundred and fifty metres long masts fiftytwo metres high and a gigantic sail area of nine thousand four hundred and thirty square metres there had never been a ship like it before so youve rescued an endangered species i said the newage windjammer arises phoenixlike from the aaland isles you mock like the others have retorted thomsen vehemently you think i am a sentimentalist with sail in my genes i repeat i am a businessman true the sight of an old windjammer has the power to touch something deep inside me as it did prolss but he like me sublimated the thought into a concept as new as rocket travel im telling you that the great golden age of sail is dead dead the sailing ship was killed by four factors it needed large skilled crews and crews cost money it had limited manoeuvrability especially in congested ports where tugs were necessary and tugs cost money the sailers speed was low the windjammer had small hatches which were difficult and costly to load especially with the clutter and tangle of rigging jetwinds design disposes of each of these problems even a good businessman has been known to buy a pup i remarked thomsen kept his cool at my lack of acceptance as he must have done a thousand times before trying to convince critical audiences before the world fuel crisis the sailing ship as a commercial proposition was a nonstarter it was that crisis which put it back in business for half a century cheap fuel coal and oil put paid to the windjammer it simply could not compete it was slow expensive and passage times were anyones guess since each successive fuel crisis has made the sailing ship more commercially viable the actual breakeven point arrived when bunker fuel touched fifteen dollars a barrel today that price sounds like happy times would you believe it thomsen said the fate of the windjammer hinges on a fluctuation of a mere two dollars a barrel youre oversimplifying i replied as fuel prices rise so do your overhead construction costs the same applies to the windjammer as to motor ships maybe even more for a sailing ship which is a oneoff piece of construction that is a good point thomsen conceded i found it in practice during the eighteen months of jetwinds building everything cost more than the original tenders nevertheless the major factor in putting sailing ships back on the high seas is the cost of fuel wind is for free no matter how long or how short the voyage wind costs not one cent don said the papers say jetwind can do twentyfive knots in a full gale thomsen threw away his halfsmoked perilly impatiently you dont want to believe everything the media say he put in they always get it wrong dress up the facts for sensation jetwind wont cant attain twentyfive knots but she is capable of twentytwo no sailing ship has a speed i interrupted a speed potential yes but a speed no thomsen eyed me penetratingly you must have thought a lot about these questions before you undertook the record attempt in albatros at that stage the record also was only a potential i grinned he laughed with me touche unpredictable schedules killed the oldtime windjammer in this day and age things are different now you can keep your sailer moving because you know in advance where the wind is and where next its likely to blow best one no longer has to rely on the old sixth sense the clipper skippers were said to have the weather the wind is forecast for anywhere in the world any time the sailer can be directed literally hour by hour by satellite and other met data to where the best winds are what areas of calm to avoid and so on weather routing is now a science you look sceptical rainier you dont want to go overboard about it i answered weather routing has a place within limits its not the beall and endall i assure you the final decision remains the captains true thomsen answered yachts racing yachts in particular are comparable to the famous pacemaking clippers cutty sark thermopylae and the rest what interests me as a shipowner is not a vessel which is capable your speed potential rainier of limited bursts of speed like the cutty sark it is average service speed don said you make it all sound very down to earth that is the name of the game thomsen replied that is why i built jetwind i have put every voyage time of the cutty sark during her prime twenty years through the computer today she would be a nonstarter in competition with powered ships even with the price of bunker fuel being what it is at her best in the australian trade cutty sark averaged only six point five knots what interests me far more than the lovely clippers are the great iron squareriggers which went out from germany to chile for nitrates at the turn of the century that was when the day of the windjammer was in fact done there was a famous captain hilgendorf who averaged seven and a half knots in regular voyages for twenty years between hamburg and chile that is the sort of consistent speed which interests me as a shipowner then what do you expect from jetwind i asked to compete with powered vessels she has to have a service speed of between ten and twelve knots on any voyage he replied but make no mistake about her speed potential speed i should say she can achieve twentytwo knots in a force nine gale on any point of sailing she is at least sixty per cent faster than the great oldtimers like the legendary german nitrate fivemaster preussen she is a flier born and bred that rig of hers develops no less than forty thousand horsepower in a force nine gale about twothirds of the thrust of a world war ii light cruisers turbines shaped alongside wellproven fourmasted barques jetwind develops up to one hundred and eleven per cent more driving thrust to evaluate jetwinds design we carried out hundreds of simulated crossings of the atlantic in both directions we found she would average from ten to twelve knots eastward from america to europe and eight to nine knots in the opposite direction what about calms doldrums not even weather routing can stop the wind from not blowing in a flat calm jetwind has three small auxiliary dieseis of five hundred horsepower each they will drive her at eight knots and can also be used to power the hydraulic mechanisms for the masts and sails and to supply electricity to the ship she also has powered bow and stem thrusters for manoeuvring in port jetwind can spin on a dime using them in conjunction with her own sails don asked doesnt the screw act as a drag when she is under sail no answered thomsen it has a variable pitch and is housed in a nacelle which is retractable when not in use it is as different a concept from the old auxiliary as her sails are from a clippers i said jetwind sounds magnificent as a computer printout things that work in a windtunnel dont necessarily work in a southern ocean gale chapter as an answer thomsen threw down a photograph in front of me it was an aerial shot of jetwind leaving harbour taken from above her port bow it was an exciting novel sight as beautiful in its own right as any classic clipper there were six towering masts with gleaming light alloy yards white dacron sails were snuggled to each other to form an unbroken quintuple aerofoil the full height of each mast with hardly any space showing between them she had a lean hull painted dark green with a gold stripe there was not a crew man to be seen does that look like a paper ship thomsens voice was abrasive ive never seen a rig like that i said i wonder though how she steers without jibs or staysails you dont seem able to get the image of old sailing ships out of your mind he snapped back cant you see man she is new new as tomorrow youre saying what a thousand sceptics said when i originally planned jetwind every shipowner i approached for financial backing said its all very nice but hell man dont you feel what jetwind represents the new age of sail he went on his voice rising ive backed this hunch of mine to the time of twenty million dollars i tell you this rainier if jetwind is a success i intend to build a fleet of jetwinds five more ill show the doubters five more that means i need financial backers and backers have to be convinced why i asked myself had thomsen flown to knysna to meet me it wasnt as if i could offer him backing my total assets were a few seadamp clothes in albatross locker what happened to jetwinds attempt on the montevideocape record i asked i last heard of her in montevideo as albatros staged down the south american coast for the horn radio news has been out since i cleared the falklands the muscles round thomsens mouth went taut get me another drink will you don i need it so you havent heard about jetwind rainier no then let me clear the decks so to speak before i answer your question i built jetwind as a commercial proposition i built her in the firm belief that she can compete on near equal terms with steam or motor ships her maiden voyage was planned to be a shopwindow promotion i selected a route on which one can be pretty sure of the wind montevideo to cape town just right for bulk cargoes wheat maize ore coal it is also short enough to hold the publics interest three thousand six hundred and twenty nautical miles it used to take oldtime windjammers twenty days i gave orders that jetwind was to do it in thirteen an average of almost twelve knots jetwind made the run from the channel to the equator in fifteen days as good a time as any accomplished under sail she made another good run from the line to the river plate as she bloody well should have done with the wind and the currents all in her favour down the south american coast i had a firstrate skipper in mortensen if any skipper was capable of demonstrating jetwinds mettle it was him id given him strict orders not to open her up until he got on the montevideocape leg the ship was also in the process of shaking down although she had only minor teething troubles nothing to worry about mortensen said she handled sweetly a real thoroughbred he was happy with her was i asked thomsen could not control his agitation mortensen is dead everything has gone wrong since what happened thomsen lit another perilly but threw it away before he had taken more than one deep gulp of smoke jetwinds attempt on the record caught the public imagination the medias likewise every pressman radio commentator tv camera eye was upon her i had arranged a grandstand finish here in cape town in anticipation of it i flew out a dozen of the worlds top shipowners to meet the herald of the new age of sail and now here they are waiting one of them sir james hathaway is travelling with the ship he is a sail enthusiast if he backs me the others will follow like sheep sir james wanted to see for himself how jetwind handled at sea now i guess shipowners are more conservative even than sailors when it comes to accepting innovations i said i know how i felt when i was first confronted with the venetian rig mortensen got away to a flying start from montevideo thomsen went on i saw it on tv said don she looked splendid coming out of the river plate looked exploded thomsen she could have looked any way she liked so long as she had performed what happened then i asked mortensen was killed thats what he chose his wind carefully for the start and the expected ongoing weather for the cape jetwind took off like a bomb in three days she logged a thousand miles then he was killed how i couldnt havent got any details from anyone about how it actually happened jetwind has one of the finest communications systems afloat with mortensen all i had to do was to pick up a phone anywhere and i could speak to him all i can make out is that mortensen was killed in some kind of an accident involving the sail furling gear but from what youve told us any competent officer should have been able to press the right tit and sail her he spun round and glared at me and i saw how really touchy he was i wasnt trying to be funny i added you obviously had good backup men under mortensen what was to prevent them taking over and bringing the ship on to the cape he replied in a kind of snarl i handpicked every goddam one of them including the first officer anton grohman grohman his name rings a bell he made the headlines during the last round the world yacht race one of the boats was sinking off brazil he was nearby and rescued the crew in his schooner now i remember from what i recall grohman did a terrific job he did then thomsen added grimly i met him in germany while jetwind was being built he wanted a job he had all the qualifications and excellent references id already hired mortensen as captain but i had no doubts about grohmans abilities until he threw back the last of his drink until when i asked until grohman reported mortensens death and i instructed him to take command of jetwind and carry on to the cape the next thing i heard was that jetwind was heading for the falklands you must be joking captain rainier i wish to heaven i was any sailor worth his salt would know that such a diversion was plain mad i found myself sharing thomsens anger the falklands i repeated in disbelief if jetwind was a thousand miles off the south american coast on course for the cape grohman must have swung clean into the teeth of the prevailing winds and currents to head for the falklands he must have been crazy thomsen said bitterly thats what grohman did i would have given any skipper who did that the chop pronto i said thomsen went on the day mortensen was killed jetwind was running with a fresh southwesterly abeam one of her best points of sailing she was logging a steady sixteen knots in a rising sea weather routing reported a big low astern of her with the promise of a big blow enough wind to take grohman fast to gough which is halfway to the cape i know what conditions were because i spoke to mortensen a few hours before his death the prospect of a sustained storm thrilled mortensen he was piling on sail he hoped to achieve jetwinds theoretical maximum of twentytwo knots before it was over then thomsen collided with a table as he strode unseeingly about the room what he went on to say made his face leaner tougher and he himself taller than he really was grohman put the ship about and beat into the gale for days the falklands of all places why that is where jetwind is now in port stanley thats why i reacted the way i did when you told me youd been close to port stanley when you cut through the jasons in albatros who was the next man in line after grohman tideman john tideman royal navy adventure training school sailed round the horn three times he would know how to handle a fast ship why didnt you appoint tideman i told you after mortensens death i could not communicate with jetwind or i would have besides i didnt know wasnt told that jetwind had altered course the communications system seemed to go haywire the radio you mean no i know the radio was working because i checked back with weather routing the ship was still acknowledging weather advice but all i got were some cryptic telex messages when he was finally approaching the falklands something about formalities surrounding mortensens death a lot of crap but that isnt the end of the story once grohman reached port stanley the authorities held jetwind you mean arrested held is all i know investigations inquest into mortensens death i tried phoning for clarification if you want to blow a gasket just try phoning port stanley its absurd i replied the british authorities in port stanley it was not only the british who stalled he retorted it was the argentinians they also put their damned dago fingers in my jetwind operation but the falklands are british don said argentina doesnt give a damn thomsen snapped back they have claimed the islands for generations they even have their own name for them the malvinas i wish i knew what got into that fool grohman to put his nose into that thorny nest of international politics all he needed to do was to carry on to cape town when did all this happen i asked a week ago a week a week ago jetwind anchored in port stanley she was originally due in cape town five days ago and now shes harbourbound while a dozen of the worlds top shipping tycoons snigger in derision what does sir james hathaway say about this falklands business hes on the spot he is in a spot thomsen retorted he is being held in a kind of protective custody aboard jetwind the argentinian authorities have refused to allow him to return via the mainland a matter of bureaucratic red tape involving his travel permit he must be chewing the rudder pintles off jetwind every extra day he is shipbound in port stanley my chances of obtaining his financial backing diminish what about the other shipowners polite but increasingly sceptical about jetwind they bring up the old cliche something always happens to a sailing ship something did twenty million dollars worth of floating computerized gadgetry is tied up in an obscure port but im not beaten yet he said in a steely voice i said tersely you didnt come here to cry on my shoulder jetwind is still viable ive decided to send the shipowner party off on a cruise to gough island to gough what the hell for its only halfway from south america to the cape thats why ill show em still he went on gough is fifteen hundred and fifty nautical miles from the cape its two thousand one hundred and fifty miles from the falklands jetwind can cover that distance in a week if shes thrashed to the limit my party will be travelling aboard the south african research ship agulhas due to relieve the weather station on gough im planning to have jetwind intercept the agulhas and give a demonstration of her in full flight so to speak thatll get em theyll buy my project yet if they can see her like that ill convince hathaway too given the right skipper she can do it don obviously knew all about the jetwind drama he made a great fuss over thomsens empty glass he was clearly deeply concerned over the whole affair turning to face thomsen he said axel i think the time has come to tell our friend here the purpose of our meeting right said thomsen in an authoritative manner let me come to the point rainier i need a sailor a man with guts a man whos not afraid to take chances and pick up a challenge he came close to me with his fists clenched as if he meant to hit me and flinging a fist in my direction he said i need you chapter my state of exhaustion suddenly gave way to full alertness thomsens offer triggered off in my minds eye like a slowmotion repeat tv run some of the hazards i had survived in albatros in the southern ocean beneath me again was a green and white monster wave down whose side albatros had pitchpoled out of control with seventyfive knots of wind flattening its crest and searing the oceans surface raw white like an irradiated cancer exfoliating another mental picture followed an iceblue ocean in the vicinity of gough and on every side a convoy of huge tabular icebergs stretching to the horizon rearing and plunging like mobile casemates strangest of all however had been the swirling steamy mist surrounding the bergs it lent the scene an unreal mystical quality the quality of a dream a final image was the dreaded cape horn itself it had unveiled itself for an unprecedented halfhour of calm at the outset of albatross voyage i had lived out these sights alone the answer is no i said thomsen had been leaning towards me in that peculiar aggressive attitude now at my refusal he drew back don he said calmly would you go and get my briefcase from the car sheila appeared at the door at that moment don had sense enough to sweep her away with him thomsen eyed me i saw him for what he was tough prepared to fight for what he wanted his fancy diamond pin and dolphin lighter werent part of the real man so youre going to chicken out he said contemptuously i havent chickened in i retorted now look here mr thomsen ive been twentysix days alone at sea across the wildest ocean in the world im dead on my feet i need a rest dont give me that stuff rainier sure youve done a great job with albatros now theres an even greater job awaiting you with jetwind don and sheila reappeared don dumped thomsens briefcase and they beat a hurried retreat when they heard the drift of our discussion jetwind has lost so much time that its hopeless i began thomsen did not seem to be listening he pulled a plan from his briefcase and threw it in front of me look jetwind there has never been a ship like this before one hundred and twentyfive metres long twentyone in the beam nine deep look at her proportions six masts neither you nor anyone else has ever seen masts like those streamlined aerodynamic hydraulically trimmed perfect high tensile steel for the lower light alloy for the upper sections the masts are designed to offer minimum wind resistance shes beautiful shes fast by all thats holy man cant you feel what this ship is i could and i did but my appreciation was at a distance the distance of a drawingboard plan i had not experienced the real thing i thought her yards would be wider i remarked i was aware of thomsens keen scrutiny of me as my interest grew they have been criticized by comparison with those of the famous clippers they are as deep as the fastest but not as wide still that counts for nothing as ive said those old fliers are dead what matters here is the shape of the aerofoil that has been evolved by means of the windtunnel i studied the plan further i see shes got accommodation for passengers aye for twelve in the stern well out of your way on the bridge what do you mean out of my way i said no didnt i i was just generalizing noting the design closely i continued i dont care for all the clutter of bridge structure so far forard the position of it seems to be thought out in terms of a steamship the captain of a sailing ship must be able to see his sails in front i would have sited the bridge much further aft abaft the mainmast ijetwinds bridge is not so much a bridge in the accepted sense as a control centre replied thomsen an imperceptible change had crept into his voice his former aggressiveness had disappeared perhaps he was playing his fish far more skilfully than i gave him credit for data is fed into the controls and consoles in the wheelhouse from sensors computers and all the rest of the electronic gadgetry located in various parts of the ship and masts he explained sailing jetwind is not an operation like in an old windjammer where the skipper relied on his senses and experience his nerveends in jetwind are electronic they are twice as quick and ten times more accurate than human intuition id back my own senses against electronic sensors when it comes to a southern ocean squall i replied they come at you suddenly from any point of the compass they jump about like a hippedup bird in a disco it would be very difficult to catch jetwind aback thomsen countered her entire sailplan can be furled in twenty seconds flat it would take some squall to do better did mortensen establish that at sea or is it just another windtunnel printout windtunnel how much freeboard will jetwind have when shes fully laden i asked what do you have in mind anything to do with the bridge yes and no freeboard will be almost four metres thats precious little when it comes to beating closehauled in the roaring forties i answered shell be taking it green over her rails especially if shes being hard pushed that means a hell of a lot of sea will be coming over her lee rail its going to be worst at the spot where the bridge is located thats exactly where shell put her rail under any man on that long uncluttered deck will stand a pretty fair chance of being swept overboard if the bridge were further aft it would serve as a breakwater the exchange of technicalities was establishing a closer link between us i found myself being carried away thomsen laughed i cant get you away from thinking jn oldfashioned terms rainier youre visualizing a deckful of men pulleyhauling at a spiders web of ropes jetwind doesnt have any men on deck in a blow the crew mans stations either on the bridge or belowdecks forget the word windjammer thats what the oldtimers really were jammers into the wind jetwind is different in a windtunnel you keep saying that and it underlines my point that is why i built jetwind to prove the spaceage rig by trial at sea you talk as though there were only one revolutionary rig yours jetwinds what about the venetian rig i know i know he answered broodingly it was a major decision i faced in fact there are two splendid spaceage sail systems which are exactly opposite both are based on sound observation and scientific theory you cant fault either there is the contrast between a highly efficient wind flow in conditions of flow stability rarefied aerodynamics are beyond me i interrupted they should not be and must not be he replied impatiently the new age of sail is a young persons world everyone men and women involved in jetwind is young the scientists the aerodynamicists the engineers are all young you rainier are young wake up and go along with it right now i feel about a hundred i replied im clapped out as i said dead on my feet all this is aircraft talk pull yourself together went on thomsen in the same tone aerodynamics flow stability yes but aircraft no i grant you that when jetwind is beating upwind her sails are experiencing flow which is in some ways similar to air flow across an aircraft wing running downward is another story the comparison is much closer to a parachute than a wing you know the type of special multislotted ribbon parachute used to slow down jet fighters on landing thats where the similarity comes in all this balancing of pros and cons must have given you ulcers especially at the price of twenty million dollars the final and twentymillion dollar question was how much efficiency could be sacrificed to improve efficiency the aerofoil rig finally beat the venetian rig by a short head then hard luck stepped in and messed it all up hard luck hell he snapped it was a sonofabitch named grohman i can still make it but i need your help rainier you are my man i am offering you the captaincy of jetwind here and now i couldnt do justice to the job in my present state rubbish youre a sailor the old china clipper skippers went without sleep for three months racing home three months with only a catnap now and then in a deckchair lashed to the weather rail and youve been without proper sleep for only twentysix days its less than a tenhour flight from cape town to buenos aires you can sleep all the way recharge your batteries youll be as right as rain after that you can have a further nights sleep on the journey to the falklands thats more than enough for a sailor like you still i stalled fair enough however ive never even set eyes on your spaceage marvel by your own admission jetwind is a highly complex machine all pushbuttons and computers im a practical sailor i havent a clue how to operate her ill probably dismast her first time out as i temporized my eye fell upon thomsens photograph of jetwind the towering aerofoil sails and streamlined masts had a stylized beauty all of their own i remembered a similar strange exultation when i had first seen the venetian rigs reefing lines streaming contrary to the winds direction it had been a kind of mystic revelation of mans complete conquest of the wind thomsen waited for the kill now he saw he had me hesitating therell be a lot of delays i added lamely air tickets to arrange clearances connections and so on your seat is booked on the aerolineas argentinas boeing leaving cape town for buenos aires tomorrow from buenos aires you will fly to comodoro rivadavia in the south and onwards to the falklands you will have my full written authority to act as you think fit fire anyone hire anyone bribe anyone only for petes sake get going fatigue they say gives an extra dimension to perception it was not only the challenge which influenced my decision jetwind would i told myself give me the vehicle to prove whether the awesome thing i had sighted among the wild waters of the southern ocean was real or the substance of shadows a lone sailors hallucination ill do iti said chapter dinner began with champagne and ended with a telephone call whether or not sheila had anticipated that there would be something to celebrate as a result of thomsens meeting with me i am not sure but certainly the meal was a treat i might have dreamed about when chewing ships biscuits and raisins in albatross cockpit thomsen made handsome amends to sheila for his earlier unsociableness towards her blaming it on his anxiety to sign me up for jetwind i was reminded of my earlier impression of people being drawn to him like filings to a magnet certainly sheila warmed under his charisma we drank to jetwinds success in our euphoria we toasted the new golden age of sail suddenly thomsen put down his glass and eyed me peter he said youve overlooked a most important aspectpay frankly never thought of it i believe money is important what do you expect to be paid ive no idea i dont know what the jobs worth there is no real yardstick for this its a oneoff job special shortterm too you want me at gough in a week then another week or so after that to cape town he shed his affability like a shirt dont think that if you reach gough on schedule you can coast home to the cape the last leg is shorter your service speed is to be twelve knots that means under a week from gough the shorter the time the shorter my pay it seems on the contrary the quicker you make it the more i pay what do you suggest i will pay you five thousand dollars a day to flog the hide off jetwind for every day under a week you reach gough therell be a bonus often thousand dollars for every day less than a week you take from gough to cape town you earn another five thousand dollars either youre very reckless or very desperate i have already gambled twenty million on jetwind fm staking everything on you to put the project back into orbit its as simple as that what are a few thousand dollars more we drank to it looking back on the occasion i am inclined to think it was tension rather than alcohol which made thomsen loquacious he talked volubly all through the meal about the velocities angles and forces acting on a sailing ship the equilibrium of those forces the aerodynamic performance of jetwinds rig and the hydrodynamic performance of her hull he dilated on side forces and thrust components the damping effect of the seaway motions of a sailing ship compared to power he even got to sketching rough graphs and jotting down constellations of algebraic symbols it was all too esoterically technical for me don looked owlish sheila smiled a fixed hostess smile as thomsen brought his dissertation to an end he began a barrage of phone calls to london new york buenos aires cape town he seemed to be issuing orders in every direction concerning jetwind finally he became flushed and angry at not being able to raise port stanley all i craved was sleep i said my farewells don motored me to the jetty where i had moored albatross dinghy he and sheila had tried to persuade me to stay overnight with them finally thomsen accepted the guest room which had been prepared for me he and don were to call for me early and thomsen and i would fly to cape town i rowed out to albatros as i reached the yacht my hackles rose one does not spend a month alone in a boat listening to every creak of its structure without being able to sense a change on board in a flash i knew i was not alone the intruder was hidden by the cockpit overhang on the starboard side which housed albatross rather elementary instrument panel i took a heavy pin from the rail and vaulted inboard the man spun round and faced the improvised weapon if youve any ideas of souvenir hunting forget it i rapped out get below i mean to have a look at you the first thing i was aware of was the american accent these instruments are rube goldberg stuff what about critical sailing angles optimum course speed made good whats that to you i would have expected that sort of thing after this boats track record half of those instruments dont work any more they drank too much southern ocean my eyes were adapting to the darkness my visitor was shorter than me but square and stocky his dark hair cut unfashionably short was brushed back from the temples his chin was as square as his powerful shoulders and heavy brows completed the impression of determination and strength he wore a dark tightfitting sweatshirt and sneakers he seemed quite unconcerned about the fact that he was a trespasser i dont understand the downwind performance of the venetian rig he began you dont have to until weve sorted out why youre on board my boat below that doors not locked switch on the left okay he replied my question will keep till later he did as i said the cabin had a welcome familiar deepsea smell my captive looked round the guy who designed this must have been either a pinchgut or a monk he didnt look like a petty thief to me i liked his easy laugh as if he knew in advance that he would be exculpated humour ran from his mouth up into his brown eyes he held out his hand im paul brockton boy i thought the america cup twelves were pretty stark below but this he indicated the celllike spartan scantlings i thought you would have taken up a crashpad ashore rather than sleep here any more i said although now i wasnt convinced of my accusation is that why you took the opportunity to sneak aboard my boat he smiled and shook his head ive been waiting for you for about half an hour if id wanted i could have cased the whole boat and got the hell out again and youd never have been the wiser somehow i believed him he faced me with a half smile and a slight lift of his left eyebrow he reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out a pack of paul reveres i noted the ripple of powerful muscle under the closehugging fabric listen brockton i said ill give you the benefit of the doubt ive had people on my neck all day im dead beat i want some sleep and i intend to get it what do you want say it quickly i want your story and that of albatros you a newspaperman no american yachting journal the deep sea sailer im looking for an exclusive you reporters all are theres nothing new left to be told albatross record is on the board now thats all there is to it even for the experts who may read deep sea sailer theres always something hew if you know the right questions to ask i dont intend to answer any questions however clever nor do i intend to be interviewed when i came aboard i intended to make myself a cup of coffee before turning in you can stay and share it if you wish ill do more than that ill make it if youll tell me where things are he got the gas going and i sat on a locker seat you didnt come from america to write up albatros i said whats behind your visit brockton he fiddled wtih cups and sugar the big story was of course jetwind i flew out to cover her arrival in cape town the record attempt has aborted as you may have heard so logically albatros was the next best i heard about jetwind tonight he was very acute and tried to milk the line why tonight i had dinner with jetwinds owner axel thomsen i noticed him around during the day i wondered what he was doing in knysna pity jetwind had the makings of a winner shes faster than those america cup twelves you mentioned who says thomsen on paper she is at any rate windtunnel tests proved it is that a fact i was aboard courageous and independence when they worked out off marblehead back in they were engaged in a trial horse contest one against the other in preparation for the cup if you want to see every goddam thing optimized and then reoptimized take a look inside an america cup twelve none of them could do twentytwo knots in a force nine gale especially in the southern ocean jetwind can brockton contemplated me ive sailed with skippers like ted turner of courageous and lowell north of enterprise and if ever there are guys who can extract the last hundredth of a knot out of a hull its an america cup skipper they are refined highly sophisticated machines those twelves and therefore unsuited to the southern ocean could be with a gale on her quarter or beam jetwind is probably the fastest sailpowered hull ever to figure on the high seas by contrast a twelve is relatively slow downwind he answered you have to tack em at critical angles for best performance brockton screwed up his eyes you seem pretty sold on jetwind peter you wouldnt think youd just proved that the venetian rig is the fastest rig afloat albatros is a yacht jetwind is a ship i answered thats the difference paul i added taking him up on his use of first names perhaps i wanted to psych myself into believing in jetwind because deep down i was not sure of her true capabilities brockton whipped the milk off the stove to prevent it from boiling over if you look in the forard locker theres a bottle of navy rum i said it helps the coffee he found the bottle unscrewed the cap and sniffed boy that sure is nannygoat sweat we laughed about it brockton had an easy mantoman way keeps the icebergs down south at a respectable distance i remarked he brought the steaming mugs and put them in front of us on the swivel table from what i hear down south are the operative words for albatros you kept much further south than is customary customary what is customary any more paul what some old windjammer did or what modern techniques dictate i noted that i was echoing thomsen perhaps jetwind made one think like that you sure stuck your neck out in a little craft like this what was your track he asked i got up and pulled a metal object from a locker i handed it to brockton first take a look at that life harness hook from albatross cockpit see how its straightened out a wave did that he weighed the heavy hook in his hand and shook his head and you when the hook gave up i went overboard the next wave scooped me up and deposited me neatly back in the cockpit congratulations to your guardian angel thats what happens down south i replied sometimes maybe he brought me back to the subject of albatross track show me where this happened as i got out my track chart i wondered further about brockton if this was eliciting information the extraction process was certainly painless he pored over the chart for some minutes before he asked what made you choose such an unusual course it disregards the great circle route between cape horn and the cape wind i answered i had to have wind plenty of it all the time plus a current that would add speed to albatros i went north about the falklands on a favourable slant cut through the jasons to use the tiderips jeez the jasons thats the second time ive heard that exclamation tonight thomsen said the same thing it takes a sailor to know what it means and you also disregarded the biggest hazard of all ice ice isnt so hazardous if you keep a sharp lookout one man cant keep a sharp lookout for twentysix days on end you had to sleep sometimes sometimes i echoed youd never have made it in wintertime its still summer down there the bergs drift continually in the general direction of gough the warmer the seas the smaller they grow he pointed again at the chart he was close to me he was sweating even navy rum doesnt act that quick i froze when i saw the place he indicated it was about seamiles southwest of gough what took you here he was watching me closely wind i answered curtly i went where the best winds blew did you choose this course yourself or was it weather routed i resented his probing i sail by what i feel replied offhandedly not by what some boffin halfway across the world tells me what the weather should be where i am are these exact daytoday fixes marked on the chart no they were by guess and by god the relaxed air had gone out of our talk at the point youre interested in i hadnt had a proper sight for a week ah the remark might have meant something he followed it with a large gulp of rumlaced coffee his next query was phrased carefully the area where my magazine considers a story may lie is in your inner reaction to such a long voyage alone a study in depth so to say of the mind of the lone sailor did brockton know or suspect anything of my secret that he should have pinpointed the place where it had happened how could he i asked myself there had been no witnesses not one for a thousand miles i told myself i was becoming unnecessarily sensitive nevertheless i decided to fob brockton off listen paul i said as far as im concerned there isnt a story in lone sailor soulsearching if youre looking for a hard news story the jetwind record attempt is on again i am her hew captain thomsen offered me the job tonight tomorrow i fly to buenos aires from cape town and then on to the falklands my earlier inner questionings about brockton were revived by his overkill reaction to my news he gave me an allamerican grin and pumphandled me boy what a scoop thisll lick the ass off the other reporters sitting back in cape town playing crap games to pass the time of day i thought you wrote for the deep sea sailer not only he replied a small outfit like that couldnt afford to fly me out to the cape he seemed to take a sudden hold on himself as if aware of his overreaction and went on in his previous manner to which i had been attracted peter im glad for your sake if any man can make it you will nevertheless to reach gough from the falklands in a week is one hell of a tall order but youre the man to put the jetwind project back in orbit id like to be able to tell the world about it as it takes place what do you mean take me along in jetwind from what i hear shes got plenty of spare passenger accommodation a daybyday writeup of her progress will put the public back on thomsens side youre still riding the crest because of albatross run the two go together newswise he slipped the question it was only later that i remembered it i guess youll be taking the same route as in albatros i must have nodded agreement but primarily i was considering whether jetwind could afforda supernumerary aboard like a reporter i sensed his tenseness and attributed it to anxiety regarding my decision right you can come if you can wangle a seat aboard the plane tomorrow night if you cant its off i wont wait he laughed and said enthusiastically tm damn sure you wont peter youll get that flier moving the moment you step aboard i hope so meaning this is off the record i said and i gave a brief outline of captain mortensens death the socalled arrest of the ship and grohmans discussions on the mainland brockton stood abstracted until i reminded him youve got a lot of hard talking to do on the phone tonight paul if youre to tag along with me first for a connection to cape town in the morning and more important on aerolineas argentinas tomorrow night nothing is going to stop me being aboard those planes tomorrow nothing he asserted ill be sitting waiting here on the jetty first thing with my bags he started to leave then came back and said with such undisguised sincerity and warmth that i was glad i had decided to take him on peter youve given me a big big break bigger than you can guess maybe ill be able to tell you about it some day its more than i ever expected when i came aboard tonight remember that will you chapter i dreamed that jetwind was tearing out of control towards a monster iceberg her masts were without sails a great wind was hurling her along by thrust on the streamlined yards alone inside the bridge a computer was flashing and chattering insanely windtunnel negative windtunnel negative then the dial would clear itself and begin all over again in a kind of frenetic repeat printout the monster berg steaming and illdefined filled the entire horizon it had the evil menace of a nightmare i heard the pitch of the gale change jetwind accelerated i awoke in a sweat the airbrakes of the boeing of aerolineas argentinas were on it was their sound that had penetrated my eighthour sleep across the south atlantic from cape town to buenos aires now to find myself descending towards the great estuary of the river plate in broad sunlight we had taken off from cape town after midnight in a blustery southeaster had in itself the quality of a waking dream beyond the planes window on my right i spotted the luxury resort of ciudad de punta del este where i had tied up in albatros when staging south to cape horn the lighthouse with its tall round white masonry tower was unmistakable the sight of it again with sleep still fogging my senses made me wonder whether the intervening six weeks events had indeed taken place albatros the record jetwind however it was all real enough on landing so was the obstructionism of argentinian officialdom once they learned that brockton and i were bound for the falklands brockton had been as good as his promise in securing a seat next to me on the full aircraft i think it owed much to his command of spanish his fluency was certainly the key factor in smoothing the way for me to obtain a travel permit called a white card which all british subjects entering the falklands by air via the southern argentinian town of comodoro rivadavia are required to carry despite the fact that the falklands are british the argentinian authorities insist that they are rightfully argentinian territory and the white cards are a way of asserting this claim by bureaucratic harassment of british travellers at the mention of the falklands officials started the work to rule routine on brockton and me which left us well behind the other passengers further the name jetwind and the fact that i was her skipper turned obstructionism into thinly concealed hostility i was still suffering from sleep dosage withdrawal symptoms either i needed more or none at all it was only brocktons patience and his spanish which saved me from exploding after innumerable questions and much notetaking our white cards were finally issued we made our connecting plane by a whisker late that afternoon after a wearisome flight southwards when i finally came out of my heartofdarkness sleeping jag we arrived at the oilfield town of comodoro rivadavia jumpingoff point for the final leg next day to port stanley later brockton and i were drinking a glass of wine in the creepercovered patio of the spanish colonial austral hotel which contrasted nostalgically with the upstart modernism of the town itself centre of one of argentinas most important oilfields the towns streets had a superfluity of raw concrete walls most of which seemed to be graffitied with the same slogan in big red letters las malvinas son nuestras i was relaxed warm and comfortable in the secluded twilight the vino rosado was good if a trifle sweet for my palate i liked having brockton around our acquaintance was turning to friendship especially after the white card unpleasantness i was gratified that my first impressions of the man had proved correct robbie lund proprietor of the austral came to our table he was an amiable bigboned scot whose grandfather in common with hundreds of others of hebridean descent had settled southern patagonia towards the turn of the last century originally they had been kelpers in the falklands and later were responsible for the famous patagonian wool boom so youre the new skipper of jetwind he asked yes it surprises me how many people in argentina seem to know about the ship you wouldnt know why would you no a record attempt of that nature doesnt seem to be the sort of thing to create much popular feeling two kids appeared suddenly and lund said something to them in spanish indicating the entrance bell they shot off excitedly lund excused himself for the interruption and continued the conversation and you wouldnt know either mr brockton in spite of the fact that you speak spanish so well i guess not except that everyones hackles seemed to rise when jetwind was mentioned lund chose his words jetwind has kind of split public opinion down the middle in argentina he dropped his voice a hotelier has to be careful split left and right something of the bien aise went out of the evening you mean politically left and right aye i do who dragged politics into a neutral subject like a recordbreaking attempt you may well ask captain rainier you see jetwind is tied up in the falklands dont i know it the ship has become a kind of symbol if i may put it that way a symbol of what lund glanced about uneasily tfien replied hasnt your friend translated the slogans on the walls of the town theyve shot up like mushrooms ever since jetwind was known to be in port stanley brockton repeated the spanish las malvinas son nuestras the malvinas are ours as good nationalists they dont tolerate the name falklands the question of ownership of the falklands has been a point of friction for generations now the whole controversy has flared up again because jetwind was forced to make for port stanley forced who says forced i asked the ship was en route from montevideo to the cape when her captain was killed in an accident her first mate anton grohman turned and like a frightened rabbit made for port stanley lund sat down and stared that isnt the story that has been circulated in argentina now i see i replied grohman is an argentinian the falklands are a delicate political issue and grohman thought it would make good political capital brockton blew in the mouth of the wine bottle as if underscoring my remark it emitted an odd menacing hornlike sound whose side is he really on mr lund he asked lund replied thoughtfully captain grohman stopped over here a few days back on his way from the falklands grohman isnt jetwinds captain any longer i corrected him he was temporarily in charge after mortensens death lund contemplated me shrewdly it was a clever thing to call himself captain in the papers politically i mean a storm is being stirred up round jetwind a political captain makes a halfassed sailing captain said brockton if grohman is not aboard jetwind when i arrive tomorrowi sail without him i said the more i hear of him his intrigues and his political involvements the less i like him i wouldnt say grohman isnt a good sailor answered lund but hes a trueblue argentinian halfspanish halfscots in addition theres wild dangerous blood in him probably indian the mixture could produce strange characteristics thanks for the tip i replied but i think i know how to handle him lund flashed a grin at brockton i reckon you would the two youngsters suddenly appeared carrying a bell lund gave them some coins and handed the bell to me this ships bell comes from the wreck of an old barque which has lain beached in the straits of magellan for donkeys years her name was the ambassador the man who built her also happened to be named lund no relation that i know of i salvaged her bell a long time ago just for the hell of it now id like you to have it for jetwind i said jetwind has divided public opinion down here in the south were mostly of scots and british descent were on your side captain rainier the bells sort of to wish you good luck you manage to get that ship out of port stanley and youll have every mothers son in these parts doing a highland fling for you ill manage all right i said whos going to stop me lund was looking over my shoulder he made a quick silencing gesture and stood up i pivoted round a man was striding on to the patio he was carrying a silverhandled riding crop a rebenque the argentinians call it as i learned later the whiteness of his officers cap accentuated his swarthiness and dark overlarge penetrating eyes deep lines from nostril to chin might have been tooled into his lean cheeks by riding the pampas or standing sea watch he was young about my age but his ancient indian blood had made the handsome spaniard in him prematurely mature senor grohman said lund may i introduce captain peter rainier who i believe is taking over command of jetwind brockton and i were sitting next to one another lunds halfturned introductory gesture included us both grohman stopped short and slapped his leg with the whip which of you is rainier i remained still and regarded the angry face i said emphatically mister grohman lets get this straight i am captain rainier understand i heard brockton gasp robbie lund moved out of the line of possible crossfire on whose authority are you taking over i kept my cool despite his provocative air and tapping whip just pick up the nearest phone and call axel thomsen in cape town i have his number right here i was with him only last night hell be more than delighted to establish contact with the man who blew jetwinds chances hes been trying to get hold of you ever since you inexplicably put into port stanley that stopped his taptapping and his hectoring air i added if you want onthespot proof i have a letter of appointment signed by axel thomsen however i dont have to parade my credentials to you or anyone else i am captain of jetwind and i stay that way grohman shifted his ground at my tone he indicated brockton whos this man i could be anyone there was a strange note in brocktons voice which i was to recall later for the moment though i was fully preoccupied with grohman but i happen to be an american newspaperman sit down grohman i continued we have a lot to talk about lund seemed quite anxious to leave the battlefield and moved away grohman threw the ornate whip on the table like a gauntlet of defiance and sat down first i said to him get this absolutely clear mr thomsen didnt specifically ask me to fire you but he gave me blanket authority to do what i wished in the best interests of jetwind ill beach you here and now if you dont behave more like a ships officer than a mafia strongarm boy i dont like that whip get rid of it before anything else our eyes locked they seemed to stay that way for minutes watch out for that indian blood a bell rang at the back of my brain or hell come at you with a knife but he didnt although i was ready to hit him hard instead he pulled in his breath like a deep sigh as if hed reached some inner decision which hurt him but which was expedient he thrust the whip out of sight under the table his truculence had not wholly disappeared however he said if this mans a reporters i dont want him listening to a private conversation brockton halfrose hold it paul i told grohman he stays i indicated the bottle paul i added see if you can find us some scotch i cant stand more of that sweet stuff grohman seemed willing to take me up on any issues even argentinian wine it is the best wine we have that may be but it still doesnt make me like it its sweet and jammy ask robbie lund for scotch itll be a pleasure grinned brockton now then grohman i said when he had gone tor the moment well skip the motivation or lack of it which landed you in port stanley once there however your duty was to stick with the ship not to flipflap round south america where no one could contact you what in hells name made you leave his lean body started to surge forward in anger it cost him an effort to hold himself in check there was a kind of suppressed fire about the man i thought he could be dangerous with a little provocation nevertheless i had no intention of softsoaping him he chose his words i had an obligation to inform the argentinian authorities are you crazy an obligation to inform foreign authorities about jetwinds activities in a british port what the devil has jetwind got to do with argentina your authorities were difficult enough about granting my white card when they heard i was jetwinds new skipper that police officer will lose his job for granting it that jolted me how would you know it only happened this morning the slightest sneer tugged at the lefthand corner of his mouth i have friends it seems so grohman they seem more important than sticking to your job what is behind all this coming and going my tone needled him into replying just as paul arrived with the scotch grohman stuck to the wine he banged down his glass angrily i was doing what was right you do not understand or you do not even want to understand how delicate the political situation is over the question of the falklands theres enough about it written over every wall in town i observed las malvinas son nuestras he echoed heatedly who first sighted the falklands a century before the british ever came near a spaniard americo vespucci in brockton said over his glass vespucci wasnt a spaniard he was a florentine the derision in my snort was like throwing petrol on a fire to grohman now and then he stumbled to find an english word as his speech freewheeled angrily maybe maybe but he sailed for spain vespucci did it was also he who discovered the tierra san martin long before the british or americans nearly three centuries later tierra san martin i asked where now would that be he means what the rest of the world calls the antarctic peninsula brockton filled in ironically all nations agreed to standardize the name in the sixties except argentina i was glad to have paul to support me in this verbal duel he seemed to be particularly well informed for a newspaperman for a hundred and fifty years we have been wronged grohman went on knocking over the wine bottle with a vehement gesture of his left hand the malvinas originally belonged to spain they were stolen by the british after the spanish colonies in the new world had revolted against spain the malvinas passed legally to the new united provinces of la plata and we tried to occupy them legally brockton again came to my assistance you are oversimplifying friend the whole story is much more complicated than that and although i dont hold with british colonial methods in this case they were right brocktons cool assessment seemed merely to provoke grohman further it is not only the falklands that the british stole all the groups of islands on the southern flank of what you call the drake passage were stolen from argentina by britain who rightly owns what you americans call graham land or the south shetlands or the south orkneys we registered our claims in the properly recognized international way during world war ii when we left a formal document buried in a metal cylinder asserting our rights to the whole sector between twentyfive and sixtyeight degrees west and southwards of latitude sixty south brockton said roughly argentina waited until they thought they could catch britain with her pants down because of the war if i remember right however the british had sense enough to send a warship and remove all signs of argentinian occupancy and the emblems they planted it was typical of british aggression grohman began listen i interrupted i didnt come here to hear a lot of historical crap about who owns what all i know is that the falklands are british that my ship is held up there and that i mean to get her out falklands malvinas whatever you must understand that is why jetwind is detained grohman retorted in a group of argentinian patriots staged a token invasion by air of the falklands to reaffirm our claims to the islands argentina does not recognize british sovereignty the malvinas are ours that is why i went to the mainland i reported to the proper authorities the death of captain mortensen jetwind must remain in port stanley pending clarification of the circumstances of captain mortensens death that is why when he was killed i made for port stanley it is an argentinian matter go and tell that to the royal navy i retorted my attitude towards jetwinds first officer was clear he had committed a severe dereliction of duty towards his ships owner and i had yet to discover what lay behind his smokescreen of politicohistorical claptrap i was not prepared to accept his explanation at face value yet brockton surprised me he was deadly serious towards grohman and seemed to weigh judicially every word he said despite the fact that he himself seemed better armed with fact than the argentinian grohman turned contemptuous the royal navy do you remember do you remember your socalled research ship the shackleton snooping about in our waters with depthcharges and electronic gear aboard the argentinian destroyer almirante storni opened fire on it for illegal activities the shackleton turned and ran for port stanley that appears to be a common occurrence in these parts i remarked the british warship was probing our naval secrets rapped out grohman we opened fire legitimately when it refused to surrender once again brockton came to my rescue the shackleton was simply an oceanographic research ship measuring the extent of continental drift off the horn he said briskly your socalled depthcharges were seismic charges for use in sonic underwater observations the almirante storni demanded that she submit to arrest on the high seas the british captain quite rightly sought shelter in the nearest british port port stanley his ship holed up there until the storm blew over it was all part of argentinas continuing campaign of harassment over the falklands grohman looked as if he could have knifed brockton we have proclaimed a twohundredmile territorial limit round the malvinas he said therefore the british warship was inside argentinian territorial waters i drained my drink and got up i am not prepared to listen to any more of this nonsense i said tomorrow i fly to port stanley are you accompanying me grohman or are you staying here i am coming good well be on the same plane i intend taking jetwind to sea as soon as possible grohman gave an unamused smile you call my reasons nonsense you will see tomorrow they are not say what you mean man brockton had also risen to his feet apparently more concerned than i was at grohmans air of truculent triumph an argentinian warship the same almirante storni is at this moment on her way to port stanley to detain jetwind chapter i disbelieved him until next day our plane was over the ocean about an hour out from comodoro rivadavia heading for the falklands the scheduled flight time was about two and a half hours the obsolescent f argentina air force plane was grinding its way southeastwards the mainland was out of sight behind the day was clear and bright but the far horizon was a purplish line the menace of southern ocean weather the unsleeping threat of cape horn it looked a good day down on the surface only occasionally did i spot a white crest it was a rare inbetween day when the wind was making up its mind from which quarter to rip in next northwest or west i had just been handed a thin stale sandwich and a cardboard cup of synthetic fruit juice by a cabin dogsbody who sported an air force uniform and a rash of acne he like the rest of the fourman crew treated brockton and myself like patients with a highly infectious disease brockton had the windowseat next to me suddenly his stocky frame stiffened and his square jaw went rigid like a bull mastiff confronting the bull he dropped his voice below the level of the other passengers hearing grohman wasnt conning you peter look out there i was slow to pick up the ships profile against the mirror of water thats her the almirante storni brocktons voice was full of concern i craned forward to see out of the corner of my eye i noted one of the flying crew slide back the curtain into the cabin and beckon grohman into the cockpit grohman was sitting with a group of four fellowcountrymen at takeoff i had wondered what their business might be in stanley how can you tell at this distance i asked brockton in surprise he scraped at his jaw with his knuckles as if the quality of his shave worried him exunited states fletcher class he replied you can identify em anywhere by that high mast forard with the heavy stay on the port side it supports the radar gear when the destroyer rose on a wave i made out her distinguishing feature gives the ship a lopsided appearance i said how do you know though that shes the almirante storni the us turned over some fletchers to argentina in the fifties he said they were a pretty successful class they did a great job during the war odd mast or not youre sure shes the almirante storni sure the previous evening i had dismissed grohmans statement about the warships mission to detain jetwind as patriotic claptrap now the evidence on the sea below was irrefutable i said in an undertone shes square on course for the falklands yeah i reckon shell be off stanley during the night a fletchers best cruising speed is about fifteen knots i guess thats what shes doing now shes got no problems with either the sea or the weather you seem to know a hell of a lot about the fletcher class paul he appeared hardly to hear my comment he was concentrating so hard on the warship it was coming quickly into fuller view now served in em his jaw was set hard and his eyes were screwed up against the sea glare or against something else he swung away from his tight scrutiny of the warship what do you intend to do about it peter that was the question which had been avalanching through my mind from the moment paul had confirmed the ships identity until then i had been inclined to take all grohman had said about the falklandsargentina situation as emotional latin posturing and sabrerattling that warship heading determinedly towards the falklands however gave a different dimension to the problem the fact that grohman knew in advance that the destroyer was on its way added a sinister dimension to him as well as if to underscore my suspicions the pitch of the planes engines changed were going low muttered brockton what happens now the f was losing height all the passengers about fifteen of them were at the windows grohmans group of argentinians were laughing one of them turned and threw a strange look at me the f made a low run over the warship from astern the entire crew seemed to be on deck gesticulating a signal lamp on the bridge sparked small lightnings as we swept overhead i counted the armament four big guns and six smaller ones and banks of quadruple torpedotubes even a warship wouldnt fancy being at the receiving end of such hardware jetwind had only the wind for armour then the plane banked and this time came in from over the warships port bow the side on which the stay braced the high radar mast just abaft the bridge the crude almost lashup look of it acted as a catalyst to my brain jetwinds escape plan fell readymade into my mind i threw myself across brockton to get the best sight of the radar mast before the plane passed over i had to photograph every detail of it in my mind jetwinds life and mine would depend on it brockton looked astonished at my urgency i whispered what equipment is mounted on that mast quick search and tactical radar firecontrol for the guns any other backup radar no its all concentrated there her entire brain centre any other search gear visual i demanded no everythings electronic on the planes next pass i spotted officers grouped on the bridge the f roared over so low youd think she had been doing a victory roll perhaps she was in advance i drew back from the window my mind racing calculating angles times distances the height of jetwinds lower yards she might be able to pull it off if i tried to recall exact bearings for the narrow exit from port stanley seawards i could not i had consulted the chkrt only superficially the critical element would be wind lots of it from the right quarter a cape horn blow would suit me best whereas todays conditions would be useless however i reminded myself that such a day was usually the precursor to bad weather the f left the warship and settled on her previous course for port stanley i checked my watch it was we were due at stanley at that allowed me only half a day of daylight a long twilight and some of the night to organize jetwinds breakout any one of half a dozen imponderables could wreck the plan now formulating in my mind for instance where was jetwind moored in relation to the narrow entrance which locks the port of stanley proper from a larger outer harbour known as port william port william in turn led to the high seas had i the expertise to manoeuvre such a radically new type of ship as jetwind if she were say moored to a quayside or jetty that was the biggest gamble of all the stanley exit faced northsouth and if the wind were dead in jetwinds teeth i could never make it the wind would have to be either from the northwest or southwest or best of all from the west these thoughts scraped along my nerve edges i wanted to hurry hurry see what the situation was in stanley i felt as if i wanted to get out and push the lumbering f along and in our wake was the almirante storni steadily lessening the distance to port stanley that raised another critical question for my plan paul i asked are you sure that the warship will reach the approaches to stanley during the night he gave me a searching look at the abrupt tone of my question thats as i read it peter whats to stop her making port and tying up nothing except the crew is argentinian i believe the entrance is tricky in darkness otherwise shes got all the technical equipment to cope do you know stanley yourself no youre the big enchilada in these waters probably the biggest question shadowing my plan was would the argentinian warship choose to negotiate stanleys narrow dangerous entrance on her arrival or hold back until daylight whats your guess for an answer brockton nodded towards the group of argentinians whom grohman had just rejoined from the cockpit he said softly dont look so damn worried theyre not there seemed to be a holiday air about the party again i speculated who they could be they all looked tough and sunburned it was as much frustration at not having to hand the data i needed to work out my breakout plan as the colossal uncertainties surrounding it which ate like acid into me for the remainder of the flight its interminable slowness was relieved later only by the sight of the jason islands below beyond southeastwards loomed the mass of the two main islands of the falklands group itself and their scatter of several hundred satellite isles there was no indication westward the gale quarter of my wind of salvation paul and i had not spoken again now as if sensing my need to scrutinize and assess he silently swapped seats with me suddenly we were over stanley i was taken aback by the beauty of two things first the harbour itself snugged between low hills about seven and a half kilometres long and one and a half kilometres at its widest point beyond through a small gap between two low headlands not more than metres wide a broad waterway opened up between serrated coves leading to the high seas the rare sunny day painted the inner harbour bright cobalt the low hills on every side were exquisite pastel shades of grey green and purple pocked frequently with scrubby brown patches of a lowgrowing plant i had no eyes for natures beauty it was the loveliness of the manmade thing riding at anchor offshore which commanded all my attention jetwind i fell in love with her at first sight her long lean hull was dark green against the cobalt water her six masts were taller than the spire of the cathedral standing at the head of the main jetty and dominating the brightly coloured iron roofs blue red limegreen yellow which sloped down to the waterfront the sheen on jetwinds steel and light alloy masts and yards gave her a purposeful upandgo look the pilot circled over the harbour no doubt thinking he was treating his passengers my mind until now seething with frustration at want of information clicked like an activated electronic calculator unwittingly within a few minutes i was supplied with vital tactical information jetwind was moored about one and a half kilometres from the entrance gap rightly named the narrows the two high points flanking the entrance were high enough to block jetwind from the warships sight as she approached from seaward from my vantagepoint i could plot the entire breakout jetwind and the almirante stomi out of one anothers sight on either side of the narrows by virtue of the intervening range of hills except for the very tip of jetwinds masts this was too small a target for the destroyers radar to constitute a major danger it meant however that from the masthead the destroyer would be visible to jetwind while she remained invisible herself until she entered the narrows proper keeping jetwind out of view until the last possible moment would require splitsecond timing and manoeuvring the plane then circled the outer harbour port william before turning to approach the airfield on the western side of the town near the waters edge it banked for the landing it was from this direction that the wind must come i was relieved to note that there were no high hills to blanket its passage towards jetwind we made a bouncy touchdown and taxied to the airport building whose new yellow paint was beginning to peel from the onslaught of innumerable gales the planes arrival seemed to be the event of the week a bevy of land rovers lined the fence with adults and children gaping as the passengers filed into the terminal my first urgent task was to get aboard jetwind take a quick look around and then talk to the authorities i chafed at the delay when a lackadaisical but amiable customs officer wanted to know the background of robbie lunds bell the spaniards someone had mentioned had first named the falklands after our lady of solitude that was how it appeared to me unhurried utterly remote the bell seemed to interest the official far more than brocktons hardfabric businessmans black briefcase which he had kept at his feet during the flight the official cursorily checked it without examining the contents brockton and i lagged behind the rest of the passengers and his argentinian foursome were quickly cleared and disappeared brockton and i had few exchanges since our arrival i had enough to think about without making polite conversation paul seemed to realize it i liked the man for his silences as much as for his words it appeared to me however that when we finally reached the immigration desk he subtly jockeyed himself to be first in line he handed over his passport his bulk barred me from seeing the document the official was about to frank it then stopped just a moment sir he disappeared into an inner office he was away about five minutes and came back looking slightly flustered will you come this way please mr brockton paul went i stood around for about ten minutes becoming more and more impatient through the windows i saw the passengers being loaded into a closed land rover for transport to the town i noted too that the sky had become slightly hazier finally the official emerged whats the problem i asked he avoided my eyes no problem we dont get many americans in this part of the world thats all i surrendered my own passport the official examined the selection of albatros port clearances and then with added interest that of south africa what is the purpose of your visit to stanley sir i could just make out jetwind from where i stood i gestured jetwind im her new skipper he looked surprised but mr grohman is the captain ive just checked him through in my eagerness to be up and away my fury needed all my control to keep it from exploding i assure you he is not i am the man clammed up at my tone sorry sir i cannot discuss anything outside a passengers own personal affairs will you wait a moment same formula same delay same inscrutable politeness as for brockton what is wrong i demanded there is nothing wrong he replied blandly not yetv pauls ten minutes delay was stretched to twenty in my case the empty airport building felt as if our lady of solitude had moved in finally i was asked into the senior immigration officers sanctum in the falklands the pecking order among colonial officials is as rigid as diplomatic protocol he played the cards close to his chest you say you are the new captain of jetwind mr rainier youd think it was a crime considering the reaction it has brought both here and on the mainland so he was urbane you had no problems with your white card a little more than youre giving me he remained unruffled i could make things impossible you realize why should you i had not been asked to sit down the sio regarded me through a swirl of cigarette smoke i dont think you understand what an ah embarrassment your ship has been and continued to be to the authorities here captain if grohman had carried on to the cape none of this would have arisen it is our duty to cope with the situation as it has arisen i wonder if i may make a suggestion to you captain rainier im listening let me telephone mr ronald dawson who is chief magistrate perhaps we could arrange for you to meet in the course of the next few days i saw the double play diplomatic heeldragging a few days more delays what were they all playing at i shall be delighted as soon as possible today after lunch he appeared nonplussed at my hurry there is always plenty of time in the falklands captain rainier you will learn that i hope to your advantage everything inside me was crying out against this verbal fencing i kept my cool however with or without immigration clearance he acted surprised we have nothing against you captain you are a british subject you have a british passport but jetwind is a delicate political problem i trust you realize we want to guide you in making the correct decisions in addition of course there is a legal aspect concerning the late captain mortensen what is that i would be exceeding my functions if i discussed mr dawsons duties with you he returned he picked up the phone ronald i have with me captain rainier the new skipper of jetwind i heard an exclamation at the other end of the line my man laughed a little uneasily no of course not there is no reason not to he wants to see you he has suggested this afternoon after lunch but i have told him there was an interrupting crackle no of course i didnt realize you would like it that way today at two good ill inform captain rainier his suavity was a trifle bent when he spoke to me mr dawson agrees that the sooner you and he meet the better he got up stiffly and handed me my passport with the air of a diplomat handing an enemytobe an aidememoire good luck captain rainier and if i may give you a little offtherecord advice dont attempt anything rash with that ship you may get hurt ill remember that i joined paul who was waiting outside the airport building by a battered land rover truck which had been assigned to take us into town there was the faintest stir of wind from the west chapter welcome aboard sir john tidemans smile and jetwinds big digital bridge clock illuminated simultaneously it was one oclock two hours since i had landed the time reminded me forcibly that i had wasted those hours navigating official channels silted with latent obstructionism finally even the short boat journey from the public jetty to jetwinds mooring had assumed the length of a voyage tideman might have said welcome to wonderland the sight of jetwinds bridge bisected by the gleaming steel pillar of no mast overrode my chafing fret against time i had never seen a bridge like it a miracle of consoles instruments panels dials lights and switches inwardly i felt a pang of dismay if i were to bulldoze through my escape plan that night i had somehow to get the hang of the ships complicated technology within the next few hours brockton who had accompanied me from the shore said i thought id seen everything in sophisticated instrumentation aboard america cup twelves but this licks everything i liked tideman immediately for his modesty he was about my own age i guessed he had long hair and a viking beard fringing a lean jaw i visualized his place rather at the wheel of a deepsea racing yacht in oilskins and goggles against a southern ocean blow than in the customcut dark green uniform and white cap which were regulation rig for jetwinds officers he wore it with a certain insouciance it looks like a spaceage scenario but basically its relatively simple said tideman you dont want to let it overawe you i was at first i wouldnt even know where to start brockton replied tideman looked inquiringly at brockton he obviously did not understand pauls position aboard i explained briefly then i said give me a rundown on the main controls as quickly as you can i want to know what im doing soonest were sailing soon sir he asked eagerly i did not reply and he went on more formally i dont want to intrude on mr grohmans position as first officer sir perhaps id better call him he came aboard about an hour ago i am sure hes not aware that youre here i had noted the white decks the way the light alloy yards had been burnished and the general shipshape condition and bristolfashion of jetwind and it was tideman who had been in command for the days grohman had been away messing about on the mainland youve kept the ship in pretty good nick i answered you do the explaining he looked pleased and said shes ready for sea i warmed to him further when he said without flattery first my congratulations on your record in albatros sir i know what it implies no mention of his own three trips round the horn no attempt to sell his own abilities yet his seamanship was apparent in jetwinds splendid condition had he allowed the crew to become demoralized after their letdown from grohmans backtracking on the record it would have been reflected in the state of the ship in a remote port like stanley with no diversions that meant not an iron fist but a combination of respect and discipline tideman led brockton and me to three walkaround consoles grouped about the big stainless steel wheel the centre one was in the standard navigation position this is the actual nervecentre tideman explained he indicated six levers all in the off position these operate the hydraulic mechanisms for the six masts you can swing em or trim em to any angle or any way you like either in tandem or individually like this look behind you sir he eased over a lever and the high tensile steel mast structure started to swivel there was no noise no sense of power yet the thing weighed a score of tons and was fiftytwo metres high thats tuesday in action tideman said we can do the same for monday wednesday thursday and friday monday tuesday wednesday i echoed tideman laughed the names of the weekdays are just a gimmick but it makes the masts more personal than merely number one number two and so on i got the idea from the old great britain her six masts were known by the days of the week i had been aboard the great britain in a bristol drydock during her restoration after one of the worlds great salvage feats in when she was towed from the falklands to britain after lying as a hulk in stanley for over eighty years however tidemans information about the names of her masts was new to me nevertheless it was again brockton who surprised me by the extent of his knowledge about this remote part of the world he gestured beyond the narrows the inlet where the great britain lay beached isnt far beyond the gap sparrow cove its called well see it on our way out i pulled the discussion back to the present show me how the yards operate i told tideman all yards on every mast can be moved in unison or individually he went on personally i like em best trimmed in a slight spiral on the weather side my view is that it gives better results mr grohman disagrees go on telling me what you think i said he glanced at me keenly you can set the yard trim either manually to the angle you decide or you can hand over to the computer which will do the job for you or you can he indicated another switch work on manual override while the computer is in use just the same way as you drive a car on automatic you really cant go wrong the enclosed airconditioned bridge felt like a glasshouse to me i have to feel the wind i told tideman all this remote control and mollycoddling i gestured at the big windows several of which were stripheated to remain clear in freezing weather i had the same feeling at first agreed tideman it isnt what we cape homers are accustomed to it is surprising though how soon one adapts to it he indicated another bank of pushbuttons these are to set or to shorten sail the operation can be carried out on each mast separately from mainsail to royal or synchronized as with the other controls i remembered a remark of thomsens it took twenty seconds to furl everything i was told it doesnt seem possible say thirty seconds at the outside not much more he replied its faster than the fastest crack yachting crew can achieve the operation is so quick that its almost impossible to catch the ship aback tideman moved on to a closer smaller console he was slightly disdainful these are bridge commands to the diesels which operate the hydraulics the screw and supply power to the shipshe consumes a lot the escape plan was uppermost in my mind so no preliminary warming of the diesels is necessary then no driving the auxiliary engine to power the ship in times of calm is really their secondary purpose he went on the propeller nacelle complete can be raised into the hull when shes winddriven this is the switch its stowed that way now otherwise its mainly a question of pitch control over the screw has power been used much captain mortensen disliked the auxiliary as much as i do he answered if youre sailing a sailer sail it he said however these two powered gadgets here are pretty useful theres a sixton whitegill thruster in the bows and a pleuger four point seventon thruster at the stern using them you can make jetwind spin on a sixpence how long does it take to get jetwind under way it depends where shes lying of course at an open mooring like this one a few minutes a few minutes that was better than the best i had hoped for in regard to my breakout plan yes figuratively speaking the ships speed of manoeuvre took me aback to start with one doesnt have to take manpower into consideration everything is machinedriven the officer on duty alone operates the sail plan from this central situation he added with deliberate intention behind his words id like the opportunity to show you not yet anyway you couldnt with the wind as it is tideman however seemed to want to press the point jetwind is lying ideally at this moment theres a slight rim of water coming in through the narrows maybe half a knot her head is pointing right for the exit we could be up and away in minutes as i said how long i asked myself would jetwind take to cover approximately one and a half kilometres to the narrows what speed would she have worked up to in that distance would it be sufficient have enough power in other words to carry out my design against the almirante storni if the wind failed me when the time came i could make a criminal fool of myself and the ship depending on the wind as i said i replied aye depending on the wind he echoed but you know yourself sir that were close enough to the gale pattern of the horn for the weather to break from one of three directions only the northwest the west or the southwest in other words from the quarter which suited jetwinds sailing qualities best what do you make of the prospects at present i asked tideman hid his real opinion behind a smokescreen of technicalities jetwind was being weather routed from bracknell via portishead radio when we left montevideo for the cape he answered once we became harbourbound in stanley the service was discontinued he indicated a japan radio co facsimile weather chart recorder mounted forward on the bridge metbrack was supplying us with interpretation of satellite pictures of the weather ahead and astern of the ship thats also come to an end consequently i dont know whats now working up from the direction of the horn where did you learn all your expertise i asked a trifle ironically the royal navy has several highly specialized technical and communication courses fine i replied but when you were skippering yachts round the horn you didnt have all this scientific crap at your disposal you and your weather instinct had to be one jump ahead of the next squall or you wouldnt be here today thats the sort of opinion i value sorry he apologized selfconsciously but the same applies to you as it did in albatros i began to like tideman in the same way as i had brockton he gestured landwards sappers hill backed stanley and a long defile called moody valley entered the port on its western side from that haze id say we were in for a blow i reckon further that its blowing like the clappers at this moment over drake passage and the horn when do you think it could start here any time weather works up very suddenly a matter of hours i had tentatively set midnight as the breakout deadline i might even have to wait until dawn my actions would be governed by the almirante stornis with the logistics of my escape plan in mind i switched suddenly from weather to what must have seemed an irrelevant subject to tideman all the lower yardarms on all six masts are hinged arent they yes for loading theyre swung up out of the way of dockside cranes i wasnt considering loading the genius who had thought up jetwinds hinged yards never dreamed of the purpose to which i intended to put them demonstrate i ordered he fingered a switch with uncanny silence again the big streamlined yard above us folded flush against the mast in a matter of seconds tideman followed me with interest on a time check i reckon i would need just over one minute to furl all sail and stow the lower yards in place afterwards i said correct he answered i dont follow though in dock the sails would be furled already in dock yes there would be no purpose in the operation while the ship was travelling under sail except to knock out the almirante storni the test of lifting the lower yards completed the tactical plan in my mind it would require steel nerves and razoredged timing and above all good wind i must have lapsed into an abstracted silence because brockton began to talk to tideman about america cup trials the america cup triallists use a computer which gives a readout on the downwind leg for optimum speed made good he was saying the computers memory has been previously programmed with the best speed for each wind speed no computer ever sails a ship interrupted tideman the final decision is a mans and that man is the skipper agreed replied brockton yet data the computer supplies contributes critically to the ships performance by working out the optimum speed made good in other words the best course that will take the boat to the next waypoint plus the best sailing angle plus the best trim of each set of sails in reply tideman activated the readout dials on the last of the three big control consoles this is jetwinds own special box of tricks he said there are sensors on every mast from masthead to keel logging wind direction wind speed and apparent wind angles there are other sensors in the hull recording the ships speed drift rudder angle heel all this information is fed into a microprocessor inside the console and here are the answers more dials came alive apparent wind angle true wind angle true wind speed ships speed speed made good to windward it looks goddam good brockton said in admiration the ordinary sort of compass isnt sharp enough for the degree of sensitivity these readings require tideman went on jetwind has a special electronic dualaxis fluxgate compass which is linked to the autopilot listening to their technical conversation another link in my breakout strategy formed in my mind i would use brockton and his expertise i said in the face of all this i reckon sailing by the feel of the wind on your neck or cheek is out ive done both answered tideman youll find very soon what jetwinds is the more challenging way of sailing youre dealing he indicated the banks of the dials with real data you cant bluff yourself if the computer says the ship is sailing at only eighty per cent of what she is capable of thats it you have to accept it trying becomes much harder we found that with the twelves brockton added all data is subjected to interpretation the better the skipper the better the interpretation that goes for the skipper likewise when it comes to the final decisions even the electronic experts recognize that the human element is the final judge said tideman weve got a couple of small mobile handheld terminals which operate in the crows nest the idea behind them is to have manual input that is what the lookout himself is spotting to supplement what the electronics are recording the skipper can use this information in conjunction with the computer or by itself the method is especially valuable when youre conning the ship in confined waters where there are frequent and rapid changes of course we found it worked splendidly when we brought jetwind into montevideo through the mass of shoals and shallows of the river plate estuary confirmed waters shallows frequent and rapid changes of course it added up to the port stanley narrows what about navigation i asked apparently jetwind has everything that opens and shuts come here ill show you said tideman he led brockton and me to an office abaft the bridge on the way he paused at a bulkhead clustered with switches and readout lights control for the ships firealarms automatic extinguishers and crossflooding controls he explained there are five doors throughout the accommodation as well as watertight bulkheads all emergency doors are held open magnetically until they are released from here its a supersafety system and its backed up by monitors in case of ice damage to the hull the navigation room itself was like a spaceshot control centre focal instrument was a jrc satellite navigator which tideman explained could plot jetwinds position to within half a kilometre the instrument he added was automatic and gave highly accurate and continuous position fixes while the ship was under way there was also a nippon electric deepsea echo sounder a weather chart repeater from a bridge master instrument repeat readouts of the masthead anenometers relative wind speed and direction recorders in the adjoining radio room we surprised a fairhaired young man who seemed to be engaged in some esoteric ritual with a handheld electric radio and direction finder held over a chart tideman introduced him as arno a swede arnos enthusiasm for the equipment was unbounded it had been installed by marconi and he rattled off names like apollo main and reserve receivers seminal crystal unit two conqueror main transmitters seacall selective receiver siemens teleprinter with worldwide range there was of course radar in addition an exact twin of the decca set on the bridge i surveyed the instrumented room i realized what was bugging me as it had done on the bridge and in the navigation office all these superb instruments were dead not one of them was functioning because jetwind herself was not alive she was fast asleep in a godforsaken port at the backsideend of the world they needed a prince charming to light up their sophisticated faces not a prince charming i corrected myself the kiss of a force nine gale and a freewheeling sea that kiss i meant to give jetwind tonight chapter back on the bridge with tideman we had left brockton involved in technical conversation with arno i said youve demonstrated pushpull levers and toggle switches until my mind boggles what i really want to see now is the power plant the sails he consulted a bank of dials before answering it would be too risky while at anchor to set even a royal to demonstrate for you youve no idea how powerful even jetwinds small sails are given a light breeze only im not asking you to set any sails i want to go aloft and see for myself i added i would also like to inspect the place where captain mortensen met his accident for the first time since our introduction i felt a shadow of reserve ontidemans part he nodded at the mast towering through the roof of the bridge up there in tuesday number two mast topsl yard service bay lets go he seemed unwilling to take me aloft he said you cant see much while the sails are furled is there any particular point youd like explained the whole works everything is new to me i think the best person to do that is the sailmaker the aerodynamics are above my head fine i replied im in a hurry i have to go ashore soon give him a call tideman picked up an intercom phone and said to me not him sir her her what do you mean jetwinds number one sailmaker is a woman kay fenton a woman he held the phone poised why not mr thomsen discovered her when she was taking a sail and mast course at the stahlform yard in germany the worlds master mastmakers he enlisted her as a junior member of the schiffbau institutes design team shes been intimately concerned with the windtunnel testing of jetwind i looked at him questioningly so have you from the sound of it i thought youd joined the ship after shed been built no he replied i was involved at the design stage as well i didnt know the royal navy was as keen as all that on the lost art of sail i felt somehow that i had trodden on thin ice he replied impersonally we have the navy adventure school for sail trainees i sailed yachts belonging to the school round the world you mean skippered thats right they gave me the experience in sail necessary for jetwind something still eluded me about tideman as second officer i added he answered me a trifle defensively captain mortensen was a very fine sailor hed graduated in squareriggers and knew deepwatermen my background did not include them also he was from the aaland i sips you know what that implies holding the telephone still he asked shall i call kay yes tell her to come quickly he dialled s on the intercom and said to me while the instrument rang jetwinds phones are automatic all the main controlpoints have coderings s for sailmaker o for bridge officer of the deck e for engine room and so on we waited ill bet kay is stretched out fulllength on the deck stitching a sail he said you must visit the sailroom its big enough to house a whole sail spread out kays favourite habit is to lie down and work at them the phone came alive i heard a burst of background music and tideman said kay switch that damn thing down will you the skipper wants you there was a pause and he eyed me no the new skipper captain rainier yes hes on the bridge now at the double please you will have common ground with kay shes another cape horner tideman said was she one of the allwomen crew yachts in the last round the world no she was sailmaker in peripatetic ii there was one other girl aboard the navigator i reckon it must have been the round the worlder which threw kays marriage marriage and the deep sea dont go together shes divorced then aye the guy was a starchy upandcoming young london stockbroker i heard couldnt stand the absence and the adulation kay got over the race peripatetic finally finished sixth which was no mean feat is that all that broke it up kays not that sort aboard jetwind we sort of regard her as the old lady of the sea meaning well shes twentysix and thats a ripe old age amongst this crew their average age is twenty they even look upon me as the ancient mariner im twentyseven same as me jack our other sailmaker is really our old man of the sea hes thirty he grinned hes a wonderful practical sailmaker but he hasnt kays flair for the theory i myself dont understand half the maths she talks when she gets on to sail aerodynamics are there any more cape horners aboard aye four of my own lads from the adventure school then theres pierre roussouw who sailed with tabarly and the bosun jim yell as you probably realize a bosun in this sort of ship has a very special position there are only two officers apart from the captain grohman and myself yell is a sort of sergeantmajor not that this crew needs chasing but theyre fretting and the sooner we get to sea the better tidemans remarks about the chain of command made me wonder again where grohman was protocol required that he should have been on the bridge to greet me in the first place nevertheless i had resisted a temptation to summon him i wanted to find out about things without him around it seemed to me however that he was cocking a snook at me by his continued absence i said brusque with inner tension i hope they get their wish there is an argentinian destroyer on her way here to detain jetwind tideman stared at me in disbelief and then exclaimed detain that is my information she will arrive tonight or tomorrow i was saved from further explanation by kay fentons arrival i had been unprepared in the light of tidemans old lady of the sea description for the person who came quickly through the bridge door she was tallish with a mod style haircut which made her blonde hair lighter than it really was where it had been sunbleached above her ears the long legs of her black velvet corduroy pants were dotted with scraps of dacron sail thread her slim breasts were free under a green woollen shirt the pacific seemed to have left something of its blue in her wide eyes and cape horn something of its greyness the dampeddown turbulence at the back of them was her own she held out her hand to me as i gripped it we both laughed she had forgotten to remove her sailmakers leather palm im not really as hornyhanded as all that she said i welcomed the way she repeated the handshake after removing the palm i also liked the low modulation of her voice like her eyes it seemed to have a background of sadness she bypassed a whole ocean of social conventions by getting down to the subject which basically interested both of us you made the correlation between the theoretical performance of the venetian rig and its practical one look a bit battered captain rainier she said we tested your rig at the schiffbau institut if we had had albatross actual performance figures then we could well have plumped for a venetian rig for jetwind tideman added it takes a sailor to achieve albatross results kay then she asked me with the same eager air as tideman had shown previously now that youre here will we be sailing soon i dodged the question mr tideman has given me a rundown on jetwinds controls now i want to see the sails themselves the real power house i would also like to see the exact place where captain mortensen met with his accident she flashed a glance at tideman john his voice lacked any inflexion i considered youd be the best person aboard to explain the merits of the sails lets make it as quick as we can i said i have to see the chief magistrate shortly after lunch she gave tideman another inquiring look and then said a little uncertainly it appeared to me lets go after operating one of a bank of switches on a nearby console she led me down a ladder to a central well immediately abaft and under the wheelhouse itself the mast ran through it access to its interior was via a steel door which slotted into the curvature of the mast kay explained that this servicing door was held shut magnetically until released by the bridge control she had manipulated she put on the lights i was surprised at the diameter of the mast inside there was room for two people abreast although it narrowed higher up a steel ladder was clamped to the wall and a trunk of intertwined copper tubes which combined were thicker than my leg sprouted skywards out of sight above these were the hydraulic pipes to control the yards they were linked in twin each pair with dials and valves it looked more like a plumbers paradise regained than a ships mast come kay started up the ladder her sneakers made no sound on the rungs within seconds she had outpaced me up and up we went kay drawing ahead at every step finally out of breath i reached her perched in a compartment on what looked like a tiny steeplejacks seat this compartment was the juncture point of topsail yard and mainmast higher the diameter of the interior narrowed to become the topgallant mast and the material changed from high tensile steel to light alloy the topsail yardarm itself was largely hidden from view except via slits through which the sail rolled in and out along stainless steel runners kay followed my inquiring scrutiny of the gleaming mechanisms and valves these hydraulics are basically the same as are used to operate the rudders of large ships suitably adapted of course i said getting back my breath i heard youre called the old lady of the sea if old ladies go up ladders like that give me the advanced generation any day she laughed with a mixture of humour and reserve the guys all think im crazy i have an exercise routine i run up this ladder to the crows nest every morning before breakfast whats that in aid of all day i sit at a sewingmachine stitching sails or at a desk doing maths put simply the bottom doesnt benefit by it i gestured at the servicing compartment its most unusual feature was a pair of what looked like gigantic vertical rollerblinds about nine metres tall tightly wound with sail i suppose ill get used to it i said but at the moment it all seems like black magic to me strangest is having hollow masts theyre correctly termed unstayed rotatable profiled masts she answered seriously theyve been custommade by aircraft manufacturers she added with a touch of anxiety youre going to try and make time arent you sail her my brief is to reach gough island within a week i intend to she considered my statement for a moment then answered youll need all the luck isnt it a tradition that any sailor who has sighted cape horn will have good luck for the rest of his or her career her face became expressionless it didnt bring me luck meaning she shrugged and was silent then she resumed in a different tone altogether its also a legend that anyone rounding cape horn has the right to have a pig tattooed on the calf of the right leg her amusement had an infectious quality contrasting with her serious sombre air of a moment before i did she reached down and pulled up the leg of her corduroy pants there its mainly gone now it wasnt a real tattoo only a kind of selferadicating transfer her mood changed mercurially louis thought it was disgusting how could a lady go out to a party in london with a pig tattoo showing through her stocking louis husband ex i did it for a laugh strangely it was one of the things he battened on for the divorce i expect it was only a symptom the colour now in her cheeks had nothing to do with the effort of climbing the ladder why shouldnt i old grandfather fenton i remember him still had his whole forearm tattooed is that where your sailoring genes come from he wasnt a sailor he was a prospector she replied believe it or not he went and lived on gough island between the wars prospecting for diamonds those were the days when a ship might have called once in a year or never i never knew gough was anything but a weather station grandfathers expedition was long before it was inhabited maybe im a throwback to the old man perhaps its his same spirit of adventure which brings me here or made me sail round the world anyway itll be interesting to see gough her remark brought me back to the hard realities facing jetwind i replied a little offhandedly i dont intend to stop if you do see gough it would only be a glimpse from there ill be hightailing to the cape like a bat out of hell again she asked eagerly then were sailing soon i didnt say so but the race against time the week starts tomorrow i sensed that by being noncommittal i had lost her she said distantly john said you wanted to know about the sails i felt i needed her on my side for what lay ahead listen kay i said i intend to wring every knot every half knot out of this ship every mile of the way and its a long way im a ruleofthumb sailor youre the specialist i want you at my elbow to give advice when i helldrive jetwind automatics arent the answer as far as im concerned its the human flair which counts in my scheme of things her response was to draw up her knees to her chin squatting on the tiny circle of steel it made her look more sixteen than twentysix i looked down at her gripping an overhead catwalk which gave access to the yard and rollers then youve got to appreciate how different jetwind is from any ship that has gone before she said first i dont like the term sails i prefer aerofoils sails mean sails to me ill stick to sails then take a scientific look at the shape of the sails of an old racing china clipper and youll see the resemblance to an aircraft wing a slender trapezoid or triangle with a curvature parallel to the longitudinal axis therefore those ships were fast stick to onesyllable words and ill follow you those early clipper sails were efficient aerodynamically however as soon as ships became bigger the sails had to be split in order to be handled physically by their crews that destroyed their aerodynamics later windjammers looked super but aerodynamically speaking they were a nightmare hopelessly inefficient and as for that spiders web of rigging she gave a shudder it does awful things to one when you see them under test in a windtunnel they worked kay they also put some of mans most beautiful creations on the face of the ocean youre wrong she retorted vehemently its jetwind thats beautiful more beautiful than the best of them dont you appreciate the beauty of this sail plan an unbroken aerofoil from deck to truck not individual sails slopping about on their own but a single entity with all the grace and power of proved mathematics behind it as for jetwinds masts theres never been anything seen before on the high seas like the prolss mast you have to regard them and the sails as one propulsive unit we found by tests the optimum speed for a quite definite trim of the sails we also had to determine the optimum curvature of the yards by comparison with the sail force curves its the end result that concerns me kay seemed to have more data stored in her mind than a computer memory bank but however fascinating all this theory was my first problem was a practical one the logistics of jetwinds breakout i cut in on her rarefied theorizing kay whats jetwinds best point of sailing she answered without hesitation with the wind on the beam or slightly abaft the beam best strength gale force nine reefed down naturally relative course angle one hundred and thirtyfive degrees speed twentytwo knots i said on paper she burst out passionately cif anyone can get that out of her youre the man to do it you thrashed albatros across the face of the ocean as no man has ever thrashed a ship we heard it on the radio i added i intend to flog jetwind until she makes gough in a week or she falls apart at the seams provided you first manage to break out a voice nagged at the back of my mind kays voice vibrated still at her maximum the aerofoil sailplan delivers forty thousand horsepower youve only got to have the nerve and the guts to use it twentytwo knots under ideal conditions the almirante storni could bullet along at thirtyfive at full bore depending on the state of the sea she must never get the chance to use her speed advantage that was my scheme linked to my plan was the need to deploy all jetwinds power rapidly how fast could she accelerate from anchor to the ten knots i considered the minimum required could she work up to that speed in the mere kilometre and a half which separated her from where she lay now to the narrows did you ever carry out any flying start tests in your windtunnel i asked i dont follow you say for example i wanted to accelerate jetwind from a moored position to the maximum she could achieve under the wind conditions then prevailing how would i set about it what wind velocity are we talking about that was the kicker at its worst i must assume that the wind would be blowing only a moderate breeze of about sixteen knots by the early hours of the following morning anything above that would be a bonus in jetwinds favour say force three to four and the sea if she was moored it would be calm her eyes became abstracted and she murmured something to herself about side and thrust forces and angles of wind inflow then she asked incisively she would naturally be carrying all sail you bet i make it eleven knots at her best point of sailing eleven i had hoped only for ten if the wind were stronger than force three or four id have thrust in hand for my purpose yet kay still had not answered my question how soon could i draw on that amount of jetwinds speed i couldnt be more specific without revealing my plan i had no intention of doing so to anyone as for acceleration its not the sort of thing we tested for i changed the subject kay whats this curious waxy smell in here like furniture polish is it the hydraulic fluid she indicated one of the giant rollingpins dacron doesnt smell its not the sails themselves but whats on them she explained to protect them against infrared and ultraviolet ray sun damage they have a special kind of plastic coating you can imagine what a suit of sails like this costs mr thomsen asked the schiffbau institut to find some substance to protect the sails so a new flexible plastic was specially developed i looked about me this is where captain mortensen was killed isnt it the animation went from her face right here in this bay hes supposed to have been trapped between those two rollers supposed i cant understand how such a thing could have happened she said vehemently first the sail was supposed to have been jammed on its yardarm runners how at the schiffbau institut we carried out thousands of preliminary reefing and sailsetting tests under every simulated condition of wind mr grohman brought captain mortensen here to demonstrate a fault to him my mind leapt ahead to my coming interview with the chief magistrate you dont believe the account of the tragedy i didnt say that all i do say is that i cant understand how it could have happened the ship was making time in a rising sea and gale and we were all thrilled with the way she was performing then this she jumped off her perch and came close to me she indicated a switch on the mast wall apart from the bridge consoles theres a failsafe control right here all mr grohman had to do was to press this button and the rollers would have stopped and she indicated levers on the rollers themselves here are hand cranks as another emergency measure they operate the travelling runners manually in case of power failure there was no power fault what happened thats what mr thomsen keeps asking why did grohman make for the falklands when he could have carried on to the cape god oh god she exclaimed savagely it was awful jetwind was like a funeral ship he abandoned the record attempt and headed into the gale day after day forcing jetwind to go that way into that same godawful gale which would have blown us all the way to the cape i wish mr thomsen could hear you now i said and i gave her the gist of thomsens plans to try and recoup jetwinds prestige she plucked at a loose thread at the bottom of the sail roller her big eyes were full of controlled fury fine fine she exclaimed but when are we sailing every time i ask you when you dodge the question what sort of jinx is bugging jetwind i lit a cigarette after offering her one which she refused i had decided to treat her as an ally as an ally she had to know what was in my mind there is no jinx kay but theres something equally serious i said then i outlined grohmans remarks that jetwind would be detained the imminent arrival of the almirante storni the bureaucratic stalling port and finally my forthcoming interview with the chief magistrate in half an hour or so when i had finished she remained silent then she burst out what has jetwind to do with some obscure squabble between argentina and britain over the falklands shes a ship not a pawn in a petty political game shes my ship mine too kay youre not going to let them do it are you skipper keep her boxed up here to rot why dont you upanchor now right now and get the hell out of here before the destroyer can catch us the almirante storni is capable of thirtyfive knots i answered shed come after jetwind if i did shed catch us before wed gone a hundred miles what do you mean to do about it she demanded ill plan my strategy after ive seen the chief magistrate meanwhile what ive told you is between the two of us of course she said theres something important i failed to mention though theres an important failsafe system built into the masts for the ultimate emergency the ultimate emergency i echoed she gestured upwards yes in the unlikely event of jetwind being knocked down on her beamends by a squall selfdestructing explosive ring charges are built into the junction of the top and topgallant masts the charges are designed to blast away the topgallant masts either individually or together to enable the ship to right herself again that seems very drastic to me the masts cant be cut away because theres no rigging she went on the charges operate on the same principle as the ejector seat of an aircraft who fires the charges and from where youll see the chicken button as its called on the main bridge bulkhead its painted scarlet and to get at it one has first to break a glass like a firealarm things would have to be pretty far gone before one resorted to such extreme measures i said now a final question how does one get out on the yard itself from here theres this exit hatchway its held shut magnetically like the ships watertight bulkheads heres the switch first though i have to obtain permission from the officer of the deck she dialled o on a redpainted phone on a mast bracket i wondered why grohman hadnt used the instrument at the time of captain mortensens accident the sail rollers could have been halted via the bridge controls kay said john im opening the main topsl yardarm for the skipper to take a looksee okay the door slid open and we ducked through the yard itself was wide enough for kay to stand on she balanced without retorting to the safety grabhandles the vantagepoint gave me a magnificent view of both ship and anchorage the narrows entrance seemed perilously close between navy point and engineer point its twin land flanks the greygreen water was coming in from the deep ocean beyond the outer anchorage the sea had lost its brilliant cobalt of the morning neither headland was high none of the hillocks running east and west of them was as high as jetwinds maintruck therefore a lookout in the crows nest could see clean across the intervening land to what the almirante storni was up to then i turned round and looked astern stanley town with its brightly coloured tin roofs still reflected the sunlight which was now becoming increasingly hazy next my eyes went deckwards to admire jetwinds long lean hull i stopped short two of jetwinds big lifeboats were being swung out from the stern there was a group of men at each a third boat was already heading towards the main harbour jetty what goes on down there i demanded kay shook her head i ducked back through the hatchway picked up the phone and dialled tideman answered who gave orders for the boats to be put out i had half anticipated his answer mr grohman sir what are they supposed to be doing i wasnt sure that i had heard his reply correctly a picnic did you say a picnic aye aye sir a picnic rather an outing for the crew through the narrows to cape pembroke on the open sea recall those boats at once dyou hear from now on no boat or man is to leave this ship without my express permission understand chapter i banged down the phone kay was standing by uncertainly im going down to sort this out i snapped thanks for the conducted tour i have the picture now i started down the ladder before i had gone a rung or two she called skipper yes ill be invoking cape horn good luck for your interview this afternoon i was halfway out of the service bay my head and shoulders still showing i had a worms eye view of kay from the level of her ankles from that angle she seemed all long legs and big eyes there was something in those eyes that i needed the way things were crowding me our eyes locked for a long moment i said before i had consciously decided to involve her in the breakout kay im holding a skull session in my cabin tonight tideman and brockton will be there i would like you too she was very acute do they know not yet her expressive eyes became very thoughtful after you know the results of your interview with the magistrate with or without it makes no difference youre going to take the risk yes thats why i want the three of you i need your help and knowhow apart from your own she leaned down impetuously and touched my forehead with the tips of her fingers youll have to take the rap you know that i know that kay she went on looking at me then added ill troll for a blow tonight peter you do that kay she waited as if she expected me to say more i was tonguetied by all the cross currents i said tentatively ten tonight in my cabin with the others she nodded i hurried down the ladder to the bridge grohman was already there his slick jetwind uniform offset his aquiline spanish features i felt by comparison rather like a bumboat skipper in the black coldweather rig i had hastily bought in cape town tideman pretended to be consulting a switch panel brockton was in a neutral corner near the radio office door grohman tried to defuse the situation for he must have been aware of my orders lunch has been waiting sir if youd care to come im sure you would also like to meet other members of the crew i decided to play it cool and not precipitate a crisis you mean those that havent gone off on a picnic i retorted sarcastically lunch is off theres to be no picnic this isnt a bloody sunday school party grohman remained unruffled a trifle supercilious i understand you have already cancelled my orders about the boats picnic i exploded what does a fit young crew like jetwinds want with a picnic for crying out loud i suspected why grohman kept his control under my unequivocal stand he was playing from strength the strength of the destroyers approach i felt that the morale of the crew was being affected by being cooped up in port he replied evenly they needed a diversion i arranged an outing in the ships boats to cape pembroke theres a fine beach there where they can swim and camp overnight overnight i saw his game half jetwinds crew would be absent next day when the almirante storni made port it was a subtle method of immobilizing the ship not even automated jetwind could sail with only half her crew i cut his explanation short as of now the entire crew goes on regular sea watch four hours on four hours off plus the usual dogwatches all shoreleave is cancelled is that clear fortuitously grohman had given me the opportunity to put the crew on full alert without raising suspicions of a breakout it was a secrecy problem which had solved itself another unsolved was how to get a synoptic weather forecast from weather routing without revealing that i was preparing to put to sea i urgently needed to know what was happening to the weather in the sector of ocean between cape horn and the falklands but grohman was protesting the ladies circle has arranged a special movie show at the upland goose for those staying behind tonight and we shouldnt disappoint them the ladies circle can and bloody well will be disappointed i answered what is the upland goose anyhow its the one and only local pub tideman interjected forget it i snapped put em to work sailoring not cinemas is what a crew needs thats what they signed on for circumstances have changed since then commented grohman his temper was beginning to rise thanks to you i retaliated i intend to have my crew sharp and seamanlike in port as well as on the high seas grohman bit his up tideman said in his best officerofthewatch tone what are your orders about the boat that is already ashore sir what is it supposed to be doing collecting supplies for the picnic beer barbecue mutton and so on im going ashore myself in a few minutes i replied i want a small boat ill give the men at the jetty orders myself theres only one supermarket in the town grohman said the loss of that amount of trade will cause illfeeling if you suddenly cancel it youre very considerate about other peoples feelings mr grohman he rode the rebuke this is a small place you dont understand the situation it is not by my choice that jetwind is holed up here i retorted remember that this ships place is on the high seas not stagnating in this godforsaken little port a crews a crew and for me they work like a crew or else remember that too further youll take the decknow i told grohman i had done a quick mental calculation of watchtimes so that tideman would be on duty with me for the breakout get my boat alongside ill be back in an hour any questions i added rhetorically there werent any of course after that but paul who had stood outside the blast area intercepted me as i left the wheelhouse with tideman any objection if i go on casing the air waves with young arno peter i wanted to say id give anything for a weather intercept instead i replied okay paul i want a word with you when i come aboard again tideman and i set off down the deck as we passed no mast thursday where the engine room was situated tideman said in a casual tone quite different to his attitude on the bridge do you also want the diesels to go on sea or harbour duty did he suspect that had something in mind for the night full sea watch i replied at the stern men were securing the two boats i had recalled they fell silent as we approached but there didnt seem to be any anger or resentment directed at me the small outboard was bobbing under the counter i was just about to swing myself down a rope when a tall elderly man dressed in a fancy dude yachting outfit erupted from the companionway i knew at once it had to be sir james hathaway whose presence on board i had completely forgotten you the new skipper he barked damn well hope you can do better than that dago who got us into this godforsaken hole wait until axel gets to know about this confined to the ship disgraceful british territory too what the devil goes on here not even allowed to communicate with the outside world and what may i ask do you propose to do about it young man never thought much of sailing ships always trouble of one kind or another hed have gone on ranting had i not matched decibels with him sir james i shouted sir james just a minute please just a minute yes im the new skipper ive just arrived here my name is peter rainier and im just off to discuss matters with mr dawson the chief magistrate i have instruction from mr thomsen who appointed me not two days ago to get this ship out of this hole as you call it and i intend to do it now i have an appointment to keep and if youll forgive me i must go and without paying further attention to him i slid down into the waiting outboard kickstarted the motor and accelerated across the calm waters to the main jetty i tied up as a party of men laughing and joking came down the hill with their arms full of parcels i stopped one of them with cartons of beer under each arm he looked as big as the cathedral spire in the background i guessed he was one of tidemans sailorparatroopers im the new skipper i told the men im sorry lads but the partys off all that stuff will have to go back ill sign any receipts for the supermarkets benefit then get yourselves back aboard the big man hugged the cartons he asked with the same eagerness as tideman and kay had questioned me were sailing are we sir today demanded another i knew a good crew when i saw one these were the sort of men who wouldnt baulk at putting the gaskets on a sail in the wild icy bedlam of a southern ocean gale at midnight i evaded a direct reply im hurrying to an appointment uptown ill let you know no picnic either asked another he looked more like a machineman than a seaman you can go by yourself if you like i jollied him but i wont guarantee ill stop the ship and pick you up at cape pembroke as we pass by that raised a laugh i left the men arguing a little ruefully about lugging the stores back up the hill as i turned from the jetty past a row of soenglish red brick bowwindowed houses with green red and light blue roofs to walk the half mile or so to the magistrates office the machinemans voice reached me faintly that new skippers a bit of a bastard but i think i could go along with him it was more than i could say of mr ronald dawson the chief magistrates office situated at the western end of the harbour between the secretariat and the town hall overlooked what was known as the government jetty his office was dominated by a framed print of keith griffins fine painting of the ss great britain on her maiden voyage there was also a contrasting blowup photograph of the famous vessel lying derelict in sparrow cove just beyond the narrows before her historic salvage and restoration in an old ships mercury barometer nearly a metre long all glass and brass completed the nautical air of the office the rest of the atmosphere was provided by dawsons supercilious attitude his one concession to my being a fellow human being was his perfunctory handshake boxers in the ring do it more kindly when they are about to batter one another his eyes ranged over my workaday sailors rig my information is that you are to replace mr grohman as captain of jetwind јmy information is that grohman was never appointed to command the ship so i had it from the owner himself dawson had a way of drawing in the lefthand corner of his sandy moustache with his lower canine tooth after he had spoken as if sharpening his next words i said without mincing words grohman wasnt able to handle the situation after captain mortensens death he blew the record attempt and his own chances the canine tooth gnawed that is only a matter of opinion i shrugged i didnt come here to discuss the merits or impropriety of my first officers actions they enter very much into it captain rainier you may bluster and denigrate him but you fail to recognize the peculiar and particular circumstances prevailing in this part of the world there are some who consider him to have acted quite correctly if youre going to throw the argentinafalklands political situation at me youre wasting your time it has nothing to do with jetwind on the contrary jetwind has everything to do with it that is why i have summoned you here this afternoon mr grohman has a full understanding of the delicacy of the situation it appears you dont is that why he turned and scudded for port a thousand miles from any countrys territorial waters you make your opinion of mr grohman very clear captain because i fail to understand how a longstanding and nebulous territorial dispute can be used to justify what i regard as poor judgement and lack of command ability to put it mildly he said pointedly captain rainier the entire legal jurisdiction of the falklands dependencies is under my sole control that being so i would rule that mr grohman acted correctly since he had a murder on his hands murder i cannot of course anticipate the outcome of the inquest on captain mortensen but there is prima facie evidence of unnatural death of course it was unnatural i believe he was suffocated by being caught in the rollerfurling mechanism of the sails we shall of course hear expert evidence on that he replied judicially the true cause of death might have escaped an ordinary medical man but in this case i was fortunate in that sir william halldenton was my guest he eyed me to note what effect the namedropping had on me my silence expressed my knowledge of sir william halldenton sir william is a leading london pathologist he explained a good friend and a passionate philatelic expert you know of course of the falklands place in the realm of philately i didnt i was more interested in captain mortensens death sir william interested himself in the case when the body was brought in he established that death in fact was caused prior to the apparent suffocation in the sail roller there was a small bruise at the base of the neck which pointed to the fact that he was probably dead by the time he was enveloped by the sail he had most likely been struck by a blunt instrument i said marking time while i digested this news where is captain mortensens body now mr dawson indicated a building beyond the secretariat there in the hospital mortuary so grohman must either have known or suspected dawson lifted one shoulder it is not for me as presiding officer of the inquest to prejudge any witness dawsons news had thrown me a question ripped through my mind had i misjudged grohman as a treacherous bastard when he had in fact had justification with a murder on his hands who had murdered mortensen and why then i got a grip on my racing thoughts i reminded myself that grohman had been far from any authority on the high seas he as captain was the sole judge of the situation there had been no reason to sacrifice the record if he had suspected foul play he could have proceeded body and all to the cape well mr dawsons word gambit was that of a grandmaster who is sure of his kill i said more confidently than i felt at sea the ships master has complete authority if it took a topflight london specialist to pinpoint the cause of death grohman himself could not have realized it he might have had reason to suspect suspect someone in that case the captain has the right of arrest did he detain or question anyone has he aired his suspicions to you the grandmaster saw his game slipping away he said stiffly he would have been exceeding his duties to voice a mere opinion i felt i had regained firmer ground grohman is an argentinian who was temporarily captain of a ship registered in falmouth the falklands was the nearest british port interrupted dawson youre talking legalistically i retaliated the situation isnt as simple as that superficially it might have been simple had i not seen and heard the violent reaction on the mainland over jetwind or encountered the obstructionism of the argentinian officials nor could i forget grohmans air of triumph when i had provoked him into telling me that the almirante storni was on her way to detain jetwind you dont send a warship to hold a ship for a case of suspected murder dawson tried to shortcircuit the interview i am glad captain rainier that you agree the matter is not simple and that you have come round to my way of thinking on the contrary i have not i answered grohman knew well enough that by bringing the ship here he would raise a political hornets nest in fact that may well have been his purpose mr dawson was clearly taken aback by this suggestion you must not forget that argentina claims territorial waters of two hundred seamiles offshore and has filed claims with the united nations to these islands and all others for a considerable sector of the cape horn area ive heard the claims i interrupted theyre absurd argentina regards the falklands as argentinian territory he continued you have to accept that fact when you live in this part of the world therefore grohman brought the ship to what he regards as an argentinian port where then does your legal jurisdiction as a british official come in it means nothing from grohmans point of view i had dawson nailed and he knew it he slid out from under my attack the position of the falklands is an explosive issue and mr grohman is an argentinian i am happy to be able to tell you that tomorrow we are expecting an argentinian warship for a courtesy visit she is the almirante storni and captain julian irizar and i will have consultations over captain mortensens death what the devil has it to do with the argentinian navy he displayed longsuffering patience i have been attempting to convey to you that we have here a knifeedge situation which requires consultation and good neighbourliness in order to continue our modus vivendi i suppressed my intended retort if i played my fish right i could find out the almirante stornis time of arrival i said casually we spotted the warship from our plane on the way over when is she due in we have made special provision for her to tie up tomorrow morning early he answered she should reach the outer harbour of port william about ten tonight shell anchor there and come in later when its light enough the narrows are tricky in darkness and there is no official pilot in stanley id like to be up to see her come in i said hoping was keeping the inference out of my voice what time will she come through the narrows have an odd characteristic he said more readily apparently glad to ditch the subject of argentinafalklands relations the sky is generally clearest over the entrance at about two in the morning even when weather is working up port stanley is far enough south to be able to see landmarks quite clearly at that time when daylight comes the cloud cover usually closes in my guess is that the destroyer will negotiate the narrows in the early hours captain irizar knows the port well hes been here before he eyed me speculatively i hope in the interests of good neighbourliness that you will show captain irizar round your ship jetwind is quite a talking point i shall be delighted to show captain irizar my ship at close quarters i replied how close only dawn and the narrows would show what dawson had now revealed about the almirante stornis intended movements had sewn up all but the final link of my plan the weather and the wind i wanted to sick up at the rest of dawsons pontifical paperingover of the legalistic and diplomatic niceties what was the true reason behind grohmans decision to bring jetwind to the falklands beneath all his shadowboxing there was i was convinced some powerful secret motive i also meant to find that out once i had put a safe distance between jetwind and the argentinian warship i also had no illusions about the furore that would follow jetwinds breakout perhaps dawson took my silence for second thoughts he decided to exhibit a flabby iron fist you realize dont you captain that jetwind is required to stay in port until after this business of the inquest has been cleared up required by whom the law youve just said the place is so small it doesnt even have a harbour pilot i would have thought you would be perceptive enough to see through the presence of the almirante storni captain you mean you would tolerate the services of a foreign warship to detain jetwind i spoke of good neighbourliness he replied blandly i wondered whether the lefthand wisp of his moustache would survive if our conversation went on for much longer in this remote part of the world there might be services required and rendered in the interest of that good neighbourliness when there was no suitable ah instrument ready to ones own hand i get the message i said bluntly dawson rose to terminate the interview on what he obviously considered a winning note then i hope stanley will have jetwinds company for a while longer and you will forget about such things as recordbreaking in the greater interests of the region he forced a hand as limp as a wet sail upon me in token of his triumph i shall pass on your invitation to captain irizar tomorrow i thought of the night ahead maybe ill even see him myself i hurried through dawsons door into the clean air cleaner than i had left it an hour before it was keen the first knifeedge gust from the drake passage chapter by two bells in the middle watch nine oclock that night the wind was blowing fresh from the east across the anchorage jetwind lay with her head to it she tugged at her anchor cable as if eager to get going i was in the crows nest at the summit of no mast directly overhead of the bridge the mast i had visited with kay from my vantagepoint fiftytwo metres above the deck i could see the occasional surge from a white horse the wind was building up there was a lot more punch still to come there couldnt be enough for my business with the almirante storni i moved round to probe beyond the narrows into the waters of port williams outer anchorage where was the almirante storni any moment the warship should become visible a cloud fringed yellow along its edge by a track of reflected shore light whipped at zero feet across the quartet of low hills separating us from the outer anchorage these hills terminated at navy point the narrows western headland the cloud moved so fast that in no more than a couple of seconds it seemed to have blanketed the metre passage blacked out the navigation light on the opposite side at engineer point and obscured a trio of further low hills on the eastern side of the entrance gap then the cloud blacked out the crows nest itself the wipers were ineffectual against the thick vapour i cursed the cloud a visual sighting was the only way for me to spot the destroyer and give me the edge since my eyrie was a few metres higher than the highest of the intervening hills the warships radar might indeed pick up the tops of jetwinds masts but that would not be significant in a port with other ships about i put out the overhead light to extinguish any reflection from the crows nest windows and peered into the darkness if the destroyer came to anchor she would presumably display normal anchor lights was the destroyer already in port william was captain irizar playing possum with a blackedout ship i dismissed the idea captain irizar had no reason to suspect anything on jetwinds part i was staking everything on the almirante storni navigating the narrows in the small hours based on dawsons opinion that that would be the best time because of the local cloud peculiarity if on the other hand captain irizar decided to anchor further out at sea my breakout would abort because from that angle of approach he would spot jetwind and i was basing my entire plan on remaining invisible had to get out tonight and i had to prevent the almirante storni from pursuing me my nerves were too wroughtup to wait another hour for my council of war i decided to summon the team now i picked up the phone dialled kays cabin will you come to my quarters right away is there anything wrong you said ten oclock i know nothings wrong yet ill be right there brockton was not in his cabin but in the radio office with arno i decided to collect tideman from the bridge en route to the meeting i found the bridge with its lighted consoles and static dial lights like a stage waiting for the players to enter everything okay i asked tideman aye just checking the hydraulics all three diesels are operating ive put the time of our meeting forward its now he gave me a searching glance perhaps i was showing more tension than i was aware of he said to the helmsman one of his own sailorparatroopers ill be in the captains cabin call me if anything crops up aye aye sir my cabin reached via the chartroom and navigation office was beneath the starboard wing of the bridge kay and brockton were waiting the place was warm compared to the chill of the decks wooden panelling made it additionally snug it was quiet too no creak or murmur of the ships fabric penetrated the rubber buffer strips on the doors and sound insulation behind the panelling the accommodation was luxurious if id had time to enjoy it i locked the door and waved the three of them into comfortable seats while i leaned against my big desk kay had shed her working rig in favour of navy slacks and pale mauve blouse under a jerseyknit waistcoat whose cut emphasized the line of her breasts making her look twice as feminine im not going to beat about the bush i started off i intend taking the ship out tonight for a moment there was startled silence kay jumped up and hugged me spontaneously and brockton pumphandled my hand i always knew you were a oneway guy peter he exclaimed delightedly however my words seemed to produce most effect upon tideman he was looking directly at me when i made my announcement there was a splitsecond fire burst behind his eyes his face went taut like an instant facelift now he jerked out now i can be under way in ten minutes i laughed and shook my head kay was still close enough for me to detect a trace of perfume she said enthusiastically i thought i was keen to go john ten minutes tideman seemed oblivious of her and said to me whats our course to the cape whats our course brocktons momentary euphoria also vanished he repeated tidemans question yes the course peter youre all rather jumping the gun i said first i need your help each one of you i want to discuss the logistics of the breakout breakout repeated tideman thats a strong word and i mean it i answered listen i outlined my interview with dawson and his veiled threat to enlist the almirante storni against jetwind when i came to captain mortensens suspected murder kay looked very grave i felt all along that there was something about that socalled accident it was impossible as far as the furling mechanism was concerned she said murder only adds to our problems i pointed out it strengthens dawsons hand in fact it could in fact give him some justification for calling upon the almirante storni for assistance which means that the destroyer would pursue jetwind once captain irizar discovers the bird has flown added brockton until then tideman had been the perfect officer highly efficient deferential somewhat navyformal now the mettle of the man who on three occasions had bullwhipped racing yachts through the wildest seas in the world broke through he rose impatiently what the devil have we been waiting for weve lost hours the winds been good since this afternoon we could have been away on the high seas by now i was tempted also i replied but theres another consideration and i explained to kay and tideman with the help of brockton about grohmans angry exchange with me at comodoro rivadavia and its disturbing political undercurrents dawson is playing along in the interest of what he terms a modus vivendi between the falklands and argentina i added i dont know how grohman fits in however i believe hes playing some deep game of his own then why did you allow for four argentinians to join our crew as extra hands they can only complicate the issue said tideman what did you say i asked incredulously we didnt need any extra hands tideman added you must be joking i said certainly brought no one with me from the mainland say remember those guys with grohman in the plane peter asked brockton i felt the same surge of alarm as when i learned about grohmans proposed picnic it was another sinister straw in the wind kay added there wasnt room in the focsle for them with the rest of our crew grohman has housed them in the passenger accommodation i faced their stares and said tersely you have my word that i brought no crew with me then i asked tideman are the men sailors aye good ones too from what i could make out they speak only spanish maybe theyre crew from grohmans old schooner and he took them on when he thought he was going to be the skipper i said its too late now to send them ashore damn it without giving the game away besides thered be too many formalities apart from you three no one knows were sailing tonight i want to keep it that way were wasting our time with all this talk tideman said why dont we get the sail on jetwind now sorry john until the almirante storni actually puts her nose into the narrows jetwind does not budge why he looked at me as if i were mad whats behind the stalling asked brockton i looked at each in turn as i explained i summoned you here tonight because i felt i knew you well enough to trust you in an extreme situation equally i hope you will trust me im saying this because i realize that there are questions in your minds whose answers you will have to take on trust such as asked tideman i have taken a major decision for which i alone can assume the responsibility it is a captains decision i will tell you what i intend to do once the almirante storni shows up in the narrows i alone will have to take the rap for the consequences i do not wish to implicate you the matter is too serious if you dont know in advance you cannot be held responsible after the event who by asked kay international opinion for one i answered jetwind versus the falklands is a powder keg ready to explode dawson is trying to keep the lid on by appeasing argentina what i intend to do tonight will trigger the explosion its too late now for any of you three not to sail with the ship however youre free to withdraw from assisting me if you feel you cannot cooperate on the basis of being only half informed im with you naturally kays voice was tense the sooner we sail the happier ill be repeated tideman brockton said unhesitatingly i go whatever i warmed to him but a second later i found myself questioning his intentions when he struck what i felt was a false note oh boy what a story therell be no story yet i retorted no use of the ships communications either okay okay he said forget it now listen paul theres no sign yet of the warship ive just come from the crows nest thats to be your spot i want you there for the next couple of hours report the moment you sight the almirante storni my guess is that shell anchor in the main fairway just outside the narrows then the moment she upanchors after that i have to know i have a hunch that shell do so when the sky clears in the early hours as im told it does in these parts you can count on me all the way replied brockton fine i said thats not all youre an america cup expert youve watched those craft wring every knot out of a situation correction he smiled every hundredth of a knot timing is as hairline as that our own position is going to change like lightning i went on once this ship enters the narrows i want human as well as mathematical appraisal of the way things develop so youll use a portable analogue computer and give me every thirty seconds or every second if necessary manual feedin ill make any further decisions on the basis of what yon supply youll be one of the most vital elements in the entire breakout operation paul ill do it and not just for the hell of it peter tideman added i dont know whats on your mind peter but remember you have precious little room in which to manoeuvre in the narrows its only three hundred metres wide thats where i need you too kay none of us has any idea at this stage what the wind speed will be say at two oclock or whenever the destroyer makes her entry theres one hell of a lot of unknown quantities at this moment but i must have at least ten knots speed when we enter the narrows kays eyes became abstracted as they always seemed to when she was busy with a calculation its a hell of a short takeoff distance from anchor our harbour course is roughly a dogleg right the first is the longer part which will bring us to the southern entrance to the narrows then an almost rightangle change of direction to take us throughright jetwind keeps out of sight behind the intervening hills until the last moment before the narrows i added our masthead where paul will be stationed is a fraction higher than the hills so ill keep the royals stowed until the last possible moment so theres no chance of detection once i set them it will be too late the race will be on too late queried tideman voicing the question which was clearly in all their minds too late for what sorry thats the part of my plan you must take on blind trust if it fails its the end of jetwind and of me chapter there was a deathly silence which i broke theres something else im not inviting any opinions about it i want number two anchor cockbilled from the end of the foreyard from a couple of metres of chain tideman repeated the order as if to reassure himself he was hearing right kay and brockton stared in incredulous silence thats correct i said john that task is priority once you leave this cabin the crew is keen to get to sea but im afraid this business of the anchor will appear like a rankpulling exercise to them he said it seems if i may say so utterly purposeless especially following on your cancellation of the picnic the oldtimers had a name for it chipping the anchor cable i hope to change their minds before the night is out meanwhile my order stands do it will you john of course i wasnt speaking for myself but havent you forgotten grohman all this activity must give him an idea that something is up i certainly havent forgotten him take a look at the way ive arranged the watches hes off duty during the vital early hours once you give the order to make sail grohman and everyone else in the ship will know by that time it will be too late for him to do anything if indeed he is contemplating anything he knows this ship peter and hes a good sailor tideman went on one touch of the wrong button could upset everything we must consider grohman to be hostile because we dont know whats behind his political motivations i replied i cant take any chances but like it or not were stuck with grohman till we reach the cape tideman went on make no mistake im one hundred per cent behind the idea of getting to sea and your scheme to elude the almirante storni whatever it may be i dont want to sound as if im throwing cold water on it but where is it going to get us or jetwind what are you driving at we slip past the destroyer in the narrows fine she cant turn there its not wide enough all she does then is to carry on to where the inner port opens out make a uturn and come after us at full speed shell catch us before shes halfway to the open sea into the bargain you will have deliberately provoked counteraction id say it would be much better to slip away to sea at this very moment all three eyed me expectantly i was greatly tempted to take them into my confidence but the implications were too great i repeated to myself what i had said to myself before i alone would have to take the consequences i asked you earlier to take me on trust that is still what i say kay came tactfully to the rescue youre going to make one man aboard this ship very happy sir james hathaway i laughed ruefully when i talked to him earlier on i was surprised he didnt rip the panelling off the bulkheads kay steered tideman away from something else he seemed about to say was he still acting up and hopping mad lets say hed rather go to sea in a sieve than set foot in a sailing ship again let alone buy one he was keen enough while captain mortensen put her through her paces added tideman but of course once grohman took over it was a different matter everything always comes back to grohman brockton concluded i shrugged checked my watch and straightened up paul up you go to your perch in the crows nest report to me on the intercom the moment you spot lights in the main fairway bearing distance position if you have any doubts i guess i know a fletcher class lights as well as anyone afloat she may be rigged up differently than when she was us navy i replied i reckon her spot will be near ordnance point in the main fairway as ive just said why there asked tideman theres plenty of room elsewhere because at almost any other place one or both the beacon lights at navy point or engineer point are obscured they are essential for her entry in the fairway sector im talking about a ship can sight both lights at the same time i consider the almirante storni will anchor there to get an exact fix of her position later when its light enough to see both headlands shell navigate the narrows proper i hoped i wasnt talking myself into a tailcrmade plan which made no allowance for contingencies i swamped my doubts with more orders kay i want you to keep busy at your sums i want optimum readings and sail settings at intervals of every half an hour from now until we sail and after too clear wont it seem odd if im seen on the bridge working out calculations to no apparent purpose she replied use this cabin i said everything you need is here where is grohman now asked brockton he seemed to attach more importance to the argentinian than the rest of us probably in his cabin hes off watch now i replied i rounded off the briefing john ill take the bridge while you get on with rigging that anchor to the yard he laughed slavedriving a crew in the middle of the night in a cold wind a bucko mate from the past thats john tideman his mood was infectious now that the die was cast we all laughed with him which broke up the party and the tension the stress returned in the next hour however and mounted feverishly while i waited on the bridge for a sighting report from brockton the wheelhouse was quiet overbright from the strip lighting the banks of dials gazed back unwinkingly at me all except the anenometer readout which continued to log the winds rising strength twentyone knots then twentytwo suddenly twentyfive i resisted the temptation as the minutes dragged to check on brockton he knew his job i told myself i rejected the further temptation to pace up and down the bridge hornblowerlike the helmsman had nothing to do but watch me he lounged eyes halfshut on his high stool by the wheel three bells nothing from brockton kay came in i was glad to see her i kept her longer than the abstruse technicalities required when she had gone i found it harder than ever to sit out the long wait i even found myself sweating slightly the only distraction was the sound of tidemans anchor gang at work four bells half watch to pass the time i decided to familiarize myself further with the instrument consoles first the main cabinet the intercom buzzed making me jolt i stopped in my tracks at that moment kay entered through a rear door she too stopped our eyes met pauls voice vibrated warship navigation lights in the main fairway channel three white forward steaming light lower than sidelights and his navy formality cracked somewhat dont know why in hell shes showing it but it helps us shes displaying an amber quickflashing light about two metres above her after steaming light my throat was tight is she coming in paul whats her position exactly where you predicted in the fairway beyond the narrows hey wait what is it man shes mounted a white allround light amidships the steaming lights are out gee whizz shes anchored peter shes stopped youre sure sure as hell come up and see for yourself i will keep your eyes skinned paul report the slightest movement or change wait black out the crows nest the masthead will be visible from the destroyer i did so as soon as i spotted her skipper im sitting alone in the dark its getting goddam cold ill send you something hot ill have to piss over the yardarm hold it till a rain squall comes no one will know the difference kay fetched a vacuum flask of coffee for me to take to brockton on the ascent up the mast ladder the cold increased step by step if the wind kept mounting the rain would turn to sleet by morning i joined brockton and took a long look at the destroyer through the night glasses captain irizar might have been wanting to make quite sure we identified his vessel a bright light amidships usually carried only by moored submarines and an amber flashing light silhouetted the warships main distinguishing feature that heavy mast with its clutter of radar and firing gear supported by the clumsy stay all this was clearly visible since the destroyer had swung head to wind like jetwind and her port side was parallel with us between the two ships rose a range of low hills as i concentrated on the destroyer i made an assessment of how she would have to negotiate the narrows in order to comply with the rules of navigation the destroyer would have to keep over on the navy point side as i planned the escape we would then race through on the opposite flank or engineer point that would leave the warships stayed mast exposed to jetwind exposed and vulnerable a recurring low cloud squall jetted across my vision blotting out the almirante storni and everything else paul i said if dawson is right i reckon these squalls will come with fewer intervals between them as the night progresses should he be wrong im staking everything on his being right hes lived in port stanley for years the cloud clearance has to do with the wind heating itself as it pours down the hills it dissipates the cloud temporarily until the point is reached when the overall temperature becomes too low for the phenomenon to be effective brockton asked very quietly youre sure of what you plan to do when the almirante storni upanchors peter the consequences could be hell for a lot of people and things thats why i want to take all the responsibility on myself paul okay youre the boss i for one wouldnt mind sharing it nor would john or kay thanks i replied but i prefer to work it out alone anyway now we know where the destroyer has anchored theres no point in my hanging around here let me know the situation as soon as the squall has passed will do the four hours that followed were as nervewracking as a depthcharge hunt when a sub lies doggo and silent on the bottom of the sea not daring to breathe eight bells midnight change watch my watch tideman remained on duty with me his anchor job was completed the massive piece of metal dangling from the foreyard gave jetwind a lopsided appearance jim yell bosunquartermaster and top of tidemans adventure school team took over the wheel i would need the best and coolest helmsman for the job ahead the wind remained in the west quarter it was intensifying and becoming colder all the time by one oclock it was gusting over thirty knots a neargale that gave all the wind i needed the sky was clear of cloud the waves picked up size jetwind snubbed her anchor chain heaved short on my orders to the last few fathoms for a tearaway start the cards were all on the table with that strange camaraderie which crisis and the small hours seems to engender kay and i drew closer her calculations needed only minute onward adjustments we checked them a score of times until we knew them by heart on several occasions when i could stand the silence on the bridge no longer i went to her in my cabin we talked about her passage of cape horn in the round the world race my run in albatros of what a man thinks alone alone on a wide wide sea and what a woman thinks four bells half watch the intercom screeched pauls voice was excited get on the bitchbox and rouse out those sleeping sons of bitches below the almirante storni is on her way chapter hands to make sail i found myself shouting over the ships public address system pauls bitchbox as if i were roaring orders on an open deck in a gale all hands all hands at the double jim yell leapt to the wheel as if a shot of adrenalin had picked him up bodily from his loungingstool tideman moved swiftly to station at the big central walkaround console break out the anchor i ordered he spoke into a voicetube bridge here full power for all hydraulics he banged down the voicepipe and manipulated the sail and mast controls watching expectantly for my next command back all yards on numbers one and two masts trim numbers three four five and sixthreezero degrees off the wind make all sail to the topgallants no royals stern thruster full ahead port bow thruster full ahead starboard the purpose of my orders was to box jetwinds head hard round to face in exactly the opposite direction to which she now lay bow to the west wind i would employ the backed sails to swing her bows while the other sails in normal position gave her momentum forwards and sideways add to this ten tons of solid shove from the two thrusters and jetwind would pivot on her heels like a dancer she came alive as tidemans hands played the toggles and pushbuttons kay was at my side with her calculations i snapped into the biichbox mike captain here black out the ship no lights to be shown emergency illumination only tidemans racing fingers followed my commands next moment the bridge was dark except for the binnacle and greenyellow glow of the console dials i added black out the sidelights tideman hesitated fractionally the law of the sea required a sailing ship under way to carry red and green sidelights but unlike a steamship no white masthead lights this put me legally in the wrong in relation to the almirante storni out i repeated jetwind swung round like a racehorse being manoeuvred into its startingbox with only one idea in its head to streak the hell down the course the speed of the ships pivotturn was electrifying cut the bow and stern thrusters i ordered what depth of water under her i asked tideman he checked the fathomer nineeight metres making ninenine that meant deep enough but jetwind had a deep hull whose grip on the water could be supplemented by two dropkeels one in the bows and the other in the stern these could be raised and lowered at will nowhere was the anchorage deep enough to use them to advantage to allow for jetwinds natural depth i would in any event have to follow an irregular course to the narrows a slight deviation would ground the ship on the muddy sticky harbour bottom wind angle i asked twosevenzero true so far so good steer sixzero i told jim yell at the wheel handsomely as she comes to tideman brace all yards as she steadies the ship was in the final stage of completing her turn the great yards above swinging with it the thrust of over square metres of aerodynamic dacron was like shoveintheback acceleration it wasnt the sudden acceleration but a commotion which directed my attention behind me it was grohman he had hastily thrown on his clothes his shirt was not yet buttoned his previous neat rather sinister spanish grandee air had given way to a savage intensity reminiscent of a stooping giant condor his head and nose were thrust forward like the andean bird of prey his eyes above his stuhbled cheeks seemed to burn he came at me with his sleeves rolled roughly to the elbows like a fencer about to lunge did i hear hands to make sail it wasnt a question it was an accusation there was even more arrogance in it than he had displayed at comodoro rivadavia youre not on watch responded roughly and im the captain of this ship he behaved as if he hadnt heard youre taking the ship out youre damn right straight to the cape you cant sail without clearance says who its illegal the inquest my attention was on the compass needle steady as she goes i told jim yell hold her like that in manoeuvring the ship i missed the feel of the wind on the nape of my neck i wanted instinctively to tell yell to keep his eye on the weather leech of the foresail in order to steer by the wind instead i had to interpret a complex series of readouts before acting more accurate perhaps but much less human my blood was up jetwind had a wonderful racing feel there is nothing to match a ship which responds like that except perhaps planing fullbore down a southern ocean superwave my attention snapped back to grohman i told him briefly this is my responsibility i saw the cords in his throat knot anger blazed in his eyes then died as he said contemptuously the almirante storni is waiting outside you wont get past her she is not outside i replied she is on her way in you can have a closer look at her very soon as we go by for a moment he looked taken aback and then he laughed derisively all this upandaway action is very dashing like a movie he sneered it is also very unrealistic captain rainier the almirante storni will intercept you now or later it is an empty gesture he added with a touch of pomposity i wish to publicly dissociate myself from the illegality of your escape fine i retorted youve said it publicly do you also wish to be relieved of your duties publicly that shook him for a moment i thought he was about to make a dramatic exit from the bridge in haughty spanish style then a curious look crossed his face and he said i will announce my decision to the captain of the almirante storni you do that i rejoined he came closer to where i stood i ignored him and said over my shoulder to kay stand by will you in a moment ill want the optimum sail trim and rudder angles for the first mark ill also do a spot check with paul right away the destroyers movements would determine any counter measures that became necessary in my plan only paul could actually see what the warship was doing but grohman was not finished your actions are an insult to my countrys navy he threw at me let captain irizar tell me that not you you are an officer under my command either you go along with me or you dont take your choice now i repeat my protest you are risking the ship and its crew i protest ill log your protest officially now stand back i then consulted brockton via the intercom about the destroyers movements my immediate problem was to get the ship moving as fast as possible before turning headon to face the almirante storni in the narrows and get jetwind there to coincide with the warships arrival there were a series of predetermined marker points the summits of the four hillocks which lay on the spit of land between the inner and outer anchorages jetwinds first leg being downwind the optimum course was less critical than what paul could tell me about the warships movements paul whats new first waypoint goldsworthy rock abeam optimum speed made good five knots on course evaluation ninetyfive per cent of optimum performance some slight trim needed skip it i interrupted shes running near enough on target whats our friend up to shes burning enough lights to make her look like coney island he replied that flasher amidships is the complete giveaway any moment now shell be making her turn to approach the entrance hold it here she comes shes coming round round the warship was now obviously committing herself to the northern extremity of the narrows manoeuvring probably by the leading beacons on the mainland in order to pick her line through the gap from her present position she would be able to sight one light that of engineer point but the second opposite on navy point would be obscured while that light remained obscured we would remain invisible destroyer steadying on new course reported paul oneeightfive degrees that was the recommended approach to the port from seawards the move brought the almiranie storni facing bowon towards jetwinds port side i had a sudden fear about grohman giving the game away i wheeled round he was standing near the door leading to the radio office he seemed to have an air of controlled purpose i fixed him with a stare while i spoke to the radio operator by phone arno no transmissions without my express orders until the ship is clear of the land understood aye aye sir any signals coming in strong radar transmission sir relative bearing he rattled off a series of figures which confirmed that almirante storni was using an instrumented as well as visual approach nonetheless the destroyer was not yet fully committed to the narrows she was in deep water on its outer approaches i knew she drew five and a half metres and the depths all round her now were a comfortable ten to eleven metres this meant that she could if necessary still turn safely and intercept jetwind further towards the entrance gap however was where i aimed to put the cork in the bottle although the water was deep in the centre channel of the narrows over fifteen metres it fell away on either side close to both navy and engineer points to under five metres once in this channel the destroyer could not turn without grounding another hazard was a broad fringe of kelp along this shallow line if she did attempt a turn and tangled with the kelp her engine intakes would jam within minutes the kelp constituted a hazard for us as well i reminded myself grimly and even more so it fringed a lee shore the sailing ships traditional nightmare jetwind could easily be thrust helplessly against the land by the powerful wind which was now blowing from astern but would come abeam once she made her own turn to negotiate the narrows chapter jetwind drove on and gathered speed she had roughly a kilometre to go before making her turn into the narrows she was now between the first and second waypoints or shoreline markers paul i started wanting more information but he interrupted me what gives down there peter he burst out is this tub dragging lead from her ass youre only sailing seventyfive per cent of potential youll never make the narrows in time for the warship and shes running right on schedule at this rate shell be through before you make your approach turn give her the gun man kay saw the look on my face at pauls news in one stride i was at tidemans console six knots i read kay john i snapped somethings wrong she should be doing eight knots by now tideman indicated the wind direction indicator the winds changing its veered ten degrees astern weve struck a flat spot in her sailing performance kay added the winds too far aft for her to be at her best its almost dead astern now the after sails are blanketing those forard at this angle of wind said tideman the proper way to cope would be to tack downwind to increase her speed i cant tack in these confined waters i replied kay i hoped she might come up with some solution shes doing the best she can under the circumstances she replied stealing the wind perhaps my acute anxiety threw the fragment of old clipper lore to the forefront of my mind when the clippers found themselves in such a situation they reefed the sails aft to allow a flow of air to those in front i couldnt vouch for the aerodynamics of such a tactic but i knew it had worked there was no time now to discuss the merits of such a method reef all sails on number five and six masts aft i ordered tideman as his fingers reached for the control switches kay protested no peter no it wont work i would know in a moment paul i said give me a minutebyminute speed readout it was impossible to tell simply by feel whether my desperation throw had come off we waited then pauls voice came through six and a half knots was it working or was it purely a momentary fluctuation of wind which had won us the extra half knot wheres the destroyer paul abreast tussac point ah the cork was heading for the neck of the bottle where she was now the warship could still turn for a pursuit but within the next few hundred metres the shallows would lock her in shes slowing down to about four knots guess shes feeling her way then he exclaimed excitedly hey seven knots on the log picking up whats more after what seemed an eternity paul reported again eight and a half knots nearer nine second waypoint now abeam half a kilometre now to our turn then the direction of the wind would switch to abeam jetwinds best sailing conditions then i would throw in the full power of the after sails as well as the royals now reefed out of sight at her mastheads the time for concealment would then be over we would be in full view of the destroyer through the narrows entrance i gave kay a knowing smile and she responded with a thumbsup sign when i spoke again to paul my voice was hoarse with strain paul whats happening out there target half a kilometre maybe a little more north of the narrows the cork was in the bottle the warship could no longer turn to pursue us the two ships converged on the narrow gap from opposite directions the warship at four knots and jetwind driving along now at over ten waypoint three abeam reported paul the final marker the next crucial stage was our ninetydegree turn into the mouth of the narrows i waited the silent dark bridge waited grohman was drawn to the vicinity of the wheel by my terse orders suddenly a shore light stood out to port navy point my heart raced as i made out beyond it a white masthead light silhouetting upperworks and guns a flashing light also swept into view the almirante storni now she could see us grohman let out an oath in spanish there she is captain rainier it will be better for you to stop playing games now set the royals all sail all sail i ordered how far to our turn paul one hundred maybe a hundred and fifty metres speed ten and a half knots nudging eleven stand by i told jim yell at the wheel i felt him tense tidemans eyes left his instruments and he gave me a long inquiring look what i did next was anyones guess ready about i snapped turn it was paxil down helm jim yell spun the spokes steer zerozerofive kayquick she rapidfired our predetermined calculations i passed them on to tideman sail trim thirty degrees rudder angle thirty degrees course angle to true wind seventy degrees angle of inflow of sail ten degrees the low loom of engineer point and its light twin to navy point came up out of the half light fronted by the fatal barrier of kelp it wasnt more than metres away we must not be pushed sideways into it drift i inquired peremptorily ten degrees jetwind swung at right angles towards the mouth of the narrows the wind switched abeam then it happened i had not taken into account just how powerful were her aerofoils i felt the smash of the gale and her wild lunge all at once jetwind went over on her side the bridge canted steeply to starboard tideman kay grohman and myself were nearly thrown off our feet i grabbed a console and hung on kay how far can she go over nine degrees maximum tideman intoned levelly eight and a half degrees inclination let go something peter kay cried out half her freeboard is under shes going clean over but jetwind did not she spun round in a racing turn shook herself upright put her bows into one of the opensea rollers coming through the narrows in a burst of spray and leapt forward as if id thrown a throttle wide it was a fantastic exhilarating performance jetwind straightened still further as tideman adjusted the yards she tore at the gap twelve nearly thirteen knots all lights on i ordered burn all sidelights now i wanted the almirante storni to see jetwind it was part of my plan there was no doubt now that she had spotted us the warships silhouette elongated slightly as she turned aside a trifle to give jetwind legal right of way as little as she dared in that narrow channel paul i said tentatively yeah i myself am eyeballing the situation from now on jeez he let out a whoop whaddayaknow a warning flare fired from the destroyer bathed the choppy waters in a baleful glare the wind caught the floating light and carried it towards jetwind the climax and crucial stage of my plan was at hand in a minute or two the warship would be abeam navy point we raced on for the next metres or so to accelerate to maximum speed we were heading correctly as the rule of the road required on the side of the narrows opposite the warship jetwind was now logging fourteen knots soon she would make more under any circumstances the narrows would be a tight fit for two ships especially one being a sailer and travelling at jetwinds speed the warship itself was not doing more than five knots i set my secret plan in motion down helm a point and a half i snapped then to tideman brace up all yards two points next reef the maincourses on all masts up up up peter in gods name what are you doing kay exclaimed the checks and balances my plan required were razoredged stow all mainyards loading positions keep the foreyard as it is all lower yards were now flush with their masts as for cargo stowage except the foreyard from whose tip dangled the anchor youre going to ram her gasped tideman jetwind bulleted towards the almirante storni port side to port side the side supporting the staymast supporting her electronic search gear the idea may have been in grohmans mind all along certainly it was precipitated into action by tidemans exclamation out of the corner of my eye i saw his sudden movement he reached for the chicken button in its scarlet switchbox one touch of that button and the emergency explosive charges would blast away jetwinds topgallant and royal masts she would go wildly out of control then anything could happen grohmans fingers tugged at the clip securing the switchboxs glass panel grohman i must have yelled moved and hit him all at once certainly i have no recollection of three separate movements the blow caught him at the curve of his jaw and neck below his right ear he sprawled untidily in front of the helmsman keep your eyes on your course i said automatically with jim yell such a warning was superfluous i regained my balance and faced round tideman with iron will kept his eyes fixed on the warship ahead all the colour had gone from kays face jetwinds bow now pointed obliquely at almirante storms from that angle we would cut her in half just forard of her bridge i threw open jetwinds bridge window for maximum vision the warships siren screamed above the roar of the gale up helm half a point jetwinds knifing bow veered slightly away from its target high above it all of thirty metres of the foreyard projected over both sides of the ship i had to go in close for the yard and its killer anchor to do its job too close and both ships would sink after colliding too far and jetwinds game would be up port a couple of spokes tidemans choice of helmsman had been brilliant jim yell was licking his dry lips but standing up to my orders like the cool veteran he was jetwind drove at the warship hold her off i ordered yell just graze the destroyers stay with the yardarm when a collision seemed inevitable jetwind straightened out at the last moment the distance between the warships low side and jetwinds high storm gunnels appeared to be paper thin but jetwind headed past i saw an officer on the other bridge screaming and brandishing his fists all the time the warships siren whooped like mad the yardarm swept over the destroyers side i saw men on the bridge dive for cover as the anchor flailed at them they werent my target the anchor struck the warships steel deck in a shower of sparks as she rose on a wave it ricocheted high i shouted my orders as it struck the stay and snagged fast starboard two points hold her off there was a violent jerk for a moment i thought the stay mast would hold and the two ships passing each other at a combined speed of nearly twenty knots would be dragged together they hung for an undecided millisecond then the stay ripped loose a few millions worth of radar radio antennae and all the complex electronics of a modern warship were ripped out like a rotten tooth a shower of debris scattered along the torpedo and depthcharge platform aft jetwind was free the almirante storni fell astern blind helpless emasculated the silence was broken by pauls voice stunned and hoarse with admiration now the shit will hit the fan jetwind drove clear of the narrows clear for cape pembroke and the open sea beyond clear for gough and the cape chapter suspended first officer anton grohman on grounds of i stopped writing and stared at the ships formal log on grounds of what i looked round my cabin where the previous night we had held our council of war before jetwinds breakout it seemed light years away instead of a mere twelve hours the illusion of night was still present however because of the storm it was dark enough to need electric light grounds of dereliction of duty would any official inquiry consider that grohman had failed in his duty by trying to stop his captain carrying out a crazy outrageous action against a warship of a friendly power i scrapped the phrase and lit another cigarette i wanted to get shot of the grohman problem and return to jetwinds bridge in the insulated confines of the cabin i could not share in the splendid exhilaration of feeling the ship tear along at eighteen knots or hear the mad music of the mounting gale even the motion of the ship was damped it seemed even i was surprised at how steady a platform the deck presented her mighty sail plan i was carrying everything to royals was holding the ship against the bursting wave crests just as spoilers and aerofoils hold down a grand prix racer against a track we were clear of the land mass of the falklands now with the fortyknot gale holding abaft her starboard beam her best point of sailing jetwind seemed determined to show exactly what she was capable of blast grohman i sat down and wrote quickly without pausing to weigh the words too judicially on grounds of endangering the safety of the ship and the lives of the crew which i thought ironically had been exactly what pd done there was a peremptory knock at the cabin door come in it was grohman i snapped the log book shut i had already passed judgement on him i scarcely wanted to hear his story his quick move across to my desk had something of a south american jaguar in it lithe muscular sinister i could almost imagine muscles rippling under his tight black polonecked sweater the collar did not reach high enough to mask the bruise and swelling on his jawbone where i had hit him youre going ahead with this crazy business he blurted before i had time to speak listen i snapped i dont consider i owe you any more explanations as for an answer take a look at jetwinds course you are still in malvinas territorial waters i dont know what malvinas means i retorted sarcastically if you mean im in falklands territorial waters youve underestimated the distance jetwind has travelled were nearly a hundred and twenty miles eastnortheast of port stanley at this moment thats well outside anyones territorial waters malvinas territorial waters have been proclaimed as two hundred nautical miles the same applies to all argentinian waters listen grohman i said the sooner you forget all this crap about your countrys rights the better for your seagoing career its already cost you your job as first officer of jetwind youre as full of hangups about it as a fortyyearold virgin is about sex his eyes blazed i was reminded again of a predator he didnt seem to take in what i was saying about his shipboard position you you have insulted my countrys navy you have damaged one of our best ships in argentinian waters you have broken international law you have offended against my countrys honour most of all cut it out i broke in you talk like a character in a bloody spanish soap opera im on my way nothing you or your tinpot navy can do about it will stop me no he thrust his face at me and who is the great captain rainier my navy will come after you i gestured deckwards in this weather no destroyer could make even twelve knots the way the seas running without breaking herself in two youre still sailor enough to realize that moreover your precious almirante storni is a dockyard job for months to come longrange search aircraft will find you nonsense and you know it there isnt an orion closer than the nearest american base and thats the only plane capable of flying the distance jetwind will be before anything can be done not even an orion could fly safely through this weather or whats building up mercurially the anger seemed to drain completely out of him what remained was more sinister than his melodramatics you will pay for this captain rainier he said quietly you will pay for this i have suspended you as from last night on grounds of endangering the ship and the lives of those aboard i said shall i add insubordination he shrugged what the hell did you do it for i demanded if youd blasted away jetwinds topgallant masts there in the narrows wed have been into the rocks at engineer point before i could have done a thing his silence said everything i went on youre confined to your quarters as of now if you set foot outside your cabin ill have you locked ups you not tideman should have been in the royal navy which reminded me that tideman had been on the bridge all night like myself the feel of the great ship under our feet had banished all need for sleep and had thrown up those inner resources which only a cape horner can draw upon thats the way it is grohman i dismissed him at that moment arno the radio operator entered with a signal his enthusiasm caused him to give only the most perfunctory of knocks i still wonder how the course of events might have been otherwise precipitated had he paused long enough for me to have got rid of grohman arno of course could not guess that grohman had been fired arno was beaming with excitement weather routing report as you ordered sir portishead radio theyve been pretty smart about opening up their service to jetwind again thomsen had laid on for jetwind the skill of a special weather team at the bracknell meteorological service in britain its purpose was to advise and guide jetwind according to data gathered from the surface upper air and from satellite observations on the best route to steer wind sea and weatherwise bracknells weather routing is the finest in the world its communications match it portisheads signal read to rainier jetwind jwxs via portishead radio severe low at s w eastmoving knots now advise to fourfour south threezero west thence great circle to cape of good hope i snorted to myself bracknell was playing it safe suggesting the old conventional windjammer way to the cape from the horn that wasnt the way to break records that wasnt the way i had flogged albatros and albatross route was exactly the one i intended to helldrive jetwind where the great winds and the great storms were i could do without the fancy weather satellites with their sensors to measure surface temperatures the state of the wind and the state of the sea from hundreds of kilometres out in space i was what the weathermen called ground truth the guy on the spot the sailor who knew what was happening in his own surroundings i read on satellite pictures indicate worlds largest iceberg trolltunga either stranded or adrift in general area approx to miles southwest gough plus various large isolated drifting bergs these constitute major hazard strongly advise therefore against your original projected route metbrack h trolltunga like a film clip a film clip merged with a dream or a nightmare i relived what i had seen from albatross deck ice i did not know what had been ice or what had been hallucination rising clouds of vapour i did not know whether it had been vapour or the shadows of a lone sailors disordered mind and that other thing which i had seen i heard arnos voice as if from a long distance trolltunga sir i queried the word its a bit unusual but the repeat spelling was the same i looked up and saw him on the other side of the desk regarding me with a curious expression grohman was standing beside him he must have read the signal upsidedown the expression on his face wasnt curiosity it was naked murder you cant take jetwind that way he said almost pleadingly you must not at first i attributed grohmans expression and tone of voice to fear could it be that he was scared stiff his face was white his pallor against the blackness of his hair gave him a mortuary air had grohman in fact turned and run after captain mortensens death the three of us at my desk might have been a waxworks tableau for about twenty seconds surprise fear and contempt seared between us like a laser beam cutting into the dark places of three minds then in the distance like the end of a boxing round there came the imperative ring of an electric bell excuse me sir said arno thats my alarm another signals coming in he dived for the radio office grohmans voice was hoarse and constricted youd be advised to take the northerly route bracknell recommends it the other way its not safe the signal says so theres the biggest iceberg in the world i tried to hold his eyes while i picked up the phone but he evaded mine john i asked tideman on the bridge come down to my cabin right away i stood up and yelled grohman pull yourself together im going the way i choose trolltunga or no biggest bloody iceberg in the world whatever admixture of scottish spanish and indian blood ran in his veins produced a startling result i warn you do not take the trolltunga route i wasnt sure any longer about my diagnosis that he was frightened get out i snapped keep to your quarters if you want to be safe if i find you on the bridge or in any other of the operational areas ill put you in irons he whirled round and almost collided with tideman coming in with brockton brockton said after grohman had brushed past him that guy looks as if he could frag you peter ive just axed him make it official for my part put it in the poop sheet i have already then i tossed the metbrack signal across to tideman brockton read it over his shoulder the reaction from both men startled me it was as though a shot of adrenalin had passed through their veins i could almost feel their vibrations trolltunga tidemans eyes went very bright then as if seeking to regain control of himself without giving away his feelings he said casually i had set the computer to our gough position and cape destination through the automatic pilot it will make the first six alterations for a great circle course all that will have to be changed in the light of this whatever trolltunga meant to brockton the news caught him offbalance like tideman his coverup made him overarticulate trolltunga eh thats the biggest ice baby ever to come out of antarctica we located her first in the weddell sea from one of the old ess a satellites way back in i guess it was she was born big a hundred and three kilometres by sixty thats almost the size of the state of delaware and even after all these years of drifting about the southern ocean shes still the biggest fiftysix by twentythree kilometres i think it was the last time we measured her i stared at him id had my showdown with grohman he was bad news these two were good news on my side however i had finally to penetrate their cover they had a lot of explaining to do ordinary yachting journalists cannot usually handle highly sophisticated electronics and discuss the dimensions and origin of the worlds largest iceberg at the drop of a signal so to speak nor do they ordinarily lapse into navy jargon when their guard is down and what was trolltunga to tideman like icebergs fivesixths of the truth about them was concealed i went on matter of factly jetwind will follow the same route as albatros briefly im taking her eastnortheast until i cross the fiftydegree south line a little short of forty west from there on theres a oneknot current in our favour discovered it in albatros and we can count on a westerly or southwesterly gale almost continuously well intersect the trolltunga ice danger zone about six hundred miles southwest of gough after gough it will be a straight run to the finishing tape at the cape it was as if what i had just said had erased the strain of his long stint of duty from tidemans face he made a great effort to be noncommittal how many days have we scheduled to make gough about six and a half as of now good he said half to himself thats very good peter brockton said obliquely using a similar satisfied tone as tideman by the time you got to the trolltunga area in albatros you must have been pretty short on sleep peter i wondered what he was driving at i was he laughed a kind of tellmeallpal laugh just the sort of timelapse when lone sailors get tired enough to hallucinate and see their motherinlaw climbing up the mast or even spot an imaginary aircraft flying overhead he had given me the opening i was looking for sit down i said both of you have a lot of explaining to do i picked on brockton first paul said im ready to tell you about my hallucinations in return you tell me who you really are what do you mean you know perfectly well what i mean first however i want you both to know that i realize youre on my side youre no yachting magazine writer paul no journalist could possibly have handled all that sophisticated equipment the way you did the america cup trials he started cut it out i replied impatiently i dont believe it you dont act like a reporter and you dont talk like a reporter you havent written or filed a single story since you boarded albatros even in knysna you were much more interested in my socalled hallucinations than in reportage now youve given yourself away again you discuss trolltunga like an expert not many have ever heard of trolltunga except a few scientists or weathermen but youre able to give chapter and verse about the worlds biggest iceberg your detailed knowledge of the southern ocean is to say the least phenomenal a journalist has to know his beat rubbish paul journalists usually have no more than a working knowledge of their subjects as a group they lack indepth knowledge not you though so what you maintain the act fairly well normally but when the pressure mounts you give yourself away if you want to know youve something to do with the us navy he stood up and held out his hand you win fellah i am a navy man commander paul brockton glad to meet you peter that makes two naval men paul said tideman thanks for coming clean paul i added and now may i ask what is your function in these waters what im going to tell you is so classified that it could cost a man his life if he talked you have my word tideman nodded his agreement ever heard of lajes he asked the name had a familiar ring before i could crystallize my thoughts however tideman said the american atlantic base on the island of teceira in the azores correct where does lajes connect wtih jetwind and the southern ocean the azores are thousands of miles away ill come to that answered brockton near the main base at lajes is a village named agualva its so small that guess the hundred men of my command doubled its population overnight back at atlantic fleet command hq in norfolk virginia my men are rated officially as naval securities group activities go on we operate what is called a high frequency direction finding facility in plain language we monitor the movements of soviet vessels in the atlantic subs in particular we fly regular missions using orion ts way out across the central atlantic ridge and drop sonar buoys these relay the sound of ships engines to listeners at the agualva tracking station we also use other methods which the reds would give their eyeteeth to know in short you spy on the soviet fleet i said he nodded but tideman interrupted youre not telling us much thats new paul all this is pretty well known its also known that lajes provides staging and logistic support for the us sixth fleet lajes was very much in the headlines a while back when a lease agreement with portugal regarding the base was renewed brockton went on it was also in the headlines when the russians claimed to have discovered the site of the legendary atlantis not so far from lajes you may have seen a guy called dr andrei aksenov on tv announcing the news to the world we on lajes itself knew different the reds are so determined to find out about our methods that they hatched up the atlantis story as a cover to spy on lajes paul all i can say is that you are a helluva long way from base aboard jetwind thats what i am primarily interested in he dropped his voice as if fearful he might be overheard recently i and about twenty guys from naval securities group activities set up a secret listening base on tristan da cunha now were getting closer i exclaimed yeah he replied tristan is only two hundred and thirty nautical miles from gough island and jetwind is on her way to gough well be there in less than a week if we keep our present speed added tideman what made your group move to tristan i asked there was an impressive buildup of red signals emanating from this area replied brockton thoughtfully we havent yet been able to pinpoint the source you cant fly those big orions from tristan i said no airfield can take a plane like that anywhere between the cape and south america there is one but its a powerful long way away answered brockton on ascension island theres a big airfield there which was built during the war id say tristan itself is a flight of close on two thousand miles from ascension remarked tideman this buildup of signals brockton resumed naval signals i interrupted aye he said grimly naval signals navwag has em all on tape whats navwag i queried navy underwater sound reference laboratory to try and track the origin of the signals the navy fitted an orion with special electronic gear everything the latest the most top secret we filled her up with gas until it ran out of her wing tips every man aboard was a specialist twelve of them it constituted a top secret maximum range search acoustic intelligence and when i say maximum range i mean maximum range the orion could stay airborne for eighteen hours maybe even a little more i myself spoke to the pilot captain bill werner as the plane passed over tristan he gave me the okay no problems the orion kept going it entered the southern ocean airlaunched acoustical reconnaissance zone ssi what in hells that i demanded brockton was speaking fast and became agitated thats the secret zone where we suspected a red concentration werner ran into bad weather but he wasnt worried an orion is built to stand up to that sort of thing as if to emphasize what he was saying jetwind gave a sudden pitch i heard the crash of tons of water sluice along her deck then the planes last position was about six hundred nautical miles southsouthwest of gough about eight hundred and fifty from tristan brockton paused the only sound was jetwind shrugging off the waves i knew what was coming the orion vanished just like that tideman asked brockton held my eyes no it wasnt just like that we happen to have a taped inflight recording of the orions last moments was there a mayday signal no mayday no time for it i guess a missile got her there was a long silence brockton leaned towards me it was an accusing pose missile i repeated im asking you peter how should i know he replied choosing his words carefully its almost a month ago doesnt that mean anything to you peter should it i was at sea in albatros i wasnt in touch with the daily news this story didnt reach the newspapers he said grimly never will while group securities has any say why ask me then the time the place the distance theyre all right i dont follow but i did just before werner went in he had located a target with his searchwater radar searchwater is newer than tomorrows dawn werner went down to look very low under the cloud he made a visual sighting he reported a yacht moving fast under full sail tideman was staring at me now so what some of the yachts in the capeuruguay race returned from south america via gough it wasnt an ordinary yacht peter ive studied werners last words until i know em by heart this is what he said theyre not ordinary sails theyre sails with slits in em looks like a kinda venetian blind the wrong way up the seas reverberated along jetwinds hull well peter theres only one boat afloat that tallies with that description albatros there was another long silence jetwinds hull was starting to creak i averted my eyes from brocktonsaccusing stare to the ships speed repeater the needle was nudging twenty knots albatros brockton prompted i didnt reply directly did the pilot say what conditions were like yeah like i said i know every word werner said the whole oceans like a vast shivering liz pudding made of icebergs its all steaming with mist and fog still i stalled shivering liz its a navy phrase brockton explained still searching my face sort of gelatine pudding thats not a bad description i conceded thats the way it was paul all shivering liz i didnt ask about weather conditions he said i saw the plane go in i answered he gave a satisfied little sigh yet the weather and sea conditions are important to my story paul it was like a dream like the sort of hallucination you keep quizzing me about i thought i was hallucinating there couldnt be a plane not there i told myself at the time it was thousands of miles from anywhere there was ice all around mist the sea was steaming i couldnt distinguish what was ice and what was perhaps dream bill werners orion wasnt downed by a dream he retorted for a moment i relived that morning on the edge of sanity that morning of the shivering liz ocean the orion was starting to circle he must have spotted albatros then a vapour trail sprang up out of the sea from somewhere amongst the bergs i remember how the missiles vapour trail ducked and weaved and then homed in on the plane it hit a starboard inboard engine brockton nodded and repeated from the tape captain captain there starboard coming up out of the sea hammering the point home he asked and then there was nothing nothing you must have seen the plane crash as i said before i thought i was hallucinating the plane the missile everything was swallowed up by the mist and the bergs i saw nothing heard nothing you must have heard the noise of the crash or the explosion of the missile i repeat there was no sound the gale must have blown it away you didnt search for survivors you dont put a yacht about in that kind of sea to look for a figment of your imagination albatros kept going i was clear of the thick ice by afternoon at the time i thought it was my mind which had begun to clear yes i kept going hard tideman interrupted with a curious intonation in his question where did all this take place peter i dont know i hadnt had a position sight for days because of the storm night and day merged i managed to obtain a radio fix from gough a couple of days after the incident brockton persisted why didnt you report the orion affair to whom how did i know whose plane it was when i didnt even know whether id seen one imagine if i had radioed a report like that the isolation has sent him round the bend theyd have said rightly under the circumstances brockton jumped up if only you had we would have picked up the message on tristan we were monitoring every wavelength we could have nailed the bastard who did it now its too late where did that missile come from peter everything was shadowy and insubstantial i replied im still not sure whether i saw it happen or not it happened all right brockton retorted that lost orion and her crew were not a shadow why i asked if the orion was in fact shot down by a red missile should there be any russian naval interest in those waters the area jetwind is now heading for its utterly and totally unfrequented the last ship recorded before albatros was a british survey vessel which visited the south sandwich islands sixteen years earlier and the south sandwich group is a hell of a way south from where the orion crashed brocktons reaction surprised me he rounded on tideman there was steel in his voice john youve done a hell of a lot of close listening you havent spoken much i said earlier a man could die for what he has heard in this cabin today i dont buy your royal navy adventure school story the royal navy doesnt send its officers and men on pleasure cruises on yachts round the world just for them to catch a suntan by your own admission youve been three times round the horn youve also got some tough cookies here with you in jetwind youre not aboard jetwind simply in order to skyshoot your reputation as a sailor whats the name of your game chapter tideman reached into a pocket and threw on the desk what looked like a metalcased sliderule as you say paul men could die for what they heard in this cabin today he leaned forward and fiddled with the instrument the brass casing snapped open on a spring a steel blade nearly the length of a mans hand shot out tideman clinched the brass casing between his fingers now it doubled as a handle for a hellish weapon he smiled at me a microwave smile that had no warmth in it like your plane crash it makes no sound he said he addressed brockton sound or the lack of sound is the name of my game a yacht makes no sound it hasnt any engines to be picked up by a sonar buoy or by any other electronic marvel you drop from an orion even with every latest listening gadget you cant hear a yacht off cape horn from under the water brockton said i think i get it i dont i interjected sharply tideman gestured at brockton were in the same game our approach is different paul uses the latest sophisticated electronic techniques i use mans oldest friend the sail tracking what my function is to monitor the passage of red submarines rounding cape horn via the drake passage he replied levelly the royal navy yachts ive sailed there have been a cover sonar buoys are planted in advance by rn ships you remember hms endurance which sheepdogged the passage of the whitbread round the world yachts in those waters it was given out that she was there in case the yachts ran into trouble it was a bluff endurance and three other navy ships belong officially to the british antarctic survey so they have a legitimate purpose in hanging round the drake passage and cape horn their true function however is to plant secret sonar buoys which detect red subs negotiating the horn and relay their movements to monitoring instruments aboard services yachts such as mine the yacht is the perfect vehicle for the job silent immune from counterdetection by red subs underwater listening devices every one of the boats i have commanded has had enough secret equipment on board to make a russian spys mouth water i and four sailorparatroopers are a top secret team he toyed with the dagger i intend to see we remain top secret i got to hand it to you john said brockton slowly its an approach we never thought about were comradesinarms i guess he reached out and shook tidemans hand tideman seemed slightly embarrassed by the gesture the term comradesinarms implies an enemy i said what youre doing seems rather less hostilewatchdogs never retorted brockton the reds think in terms of sea denial we in the west in terms of sea control the red aim is to build a naval infrastructure round the entire world and theyre busy doing it i must have looked sceptical for he asserted lets take a look at the drake passage to start with got a chart handy i indicated one on my desk he spread it out it was on a small scale showing the top of south america cape horn the ocean southward to antarctica and the southern ocean as far as the cape of good hope brockton laid his hand across the sector south of cape horn the drake passage is five hundred nautical miles wide he said picking his words its what we call in terms of global naval strategy a choke point narrow easily controlled access points in the oceans such as the strait of hormuz leading from the persian gulf to the indian ocean or the gulf of aden and the horn of africa or again the straits of malacca at singapore or the cape of good hope all of them now red dominated broke in brockton hardly the cape i said no went on brockton sixty per cent of the wests oil flows round the cape what did the united states do when the red threat was directed towards it gave its tacit blessing to marxist regimes in angola and mozambique with their naval and air bases able to dominate the seaway one of the worlds most important feed routes pah it makes me want to throw up he looked indeed as if he wanted to throw up but he resumed the reds gain their naval objectives by establishing puppet regimes in states adjoining strategic choke points the way is then open for their naval squadrons and make no mistake there are one hell of a lot of them to block these routes the west is then forced to its knees and is subject to political blackmail its a technique theyve perfected i dont have to tell you the sorry story of each one of these global choke points you know it already the last one that still remains undominated is the drake passage its a freeforall submarine alley for american british and soviet nucleararmed subs yet its in mortal danger of going the way of those other choke points tideman added gravely the drake passage is not a straight logistics problem peter its greatly bedevilled and complicated by political factors you mean argentina argentina is up to the neck he answered you must get the overall picture clear the drake passage is dominated geographically to the northeast by the britishowned falklands islands and to the south by the south shetland islands which are also british as you know i want you to visualize the drake passage problem from the point of view of deepdiving nuclear subs hold it for a moment john brockton broke in im going to get something for you two to see if i dont come back within three minutes come and look for me with that dagger of yours john its as top secret as all that he jumped up and was gone neither tideman nor i knew how to handle the awkward silence which followed jetwind gave me the opportunity to shift to neutral ground so to speak the ship gave a heavy jar as the bow slammed into a wave the sea crashed along the deck both of us glanced automatically at the speed log twenty knots said tideman ive never had her so fast as this before she must be starting to steer like a bitch i replied i hope the wheel will hold her shes putting her head down deep she wont achieve her true maximum this way during the windtunnel tests i asked for staysails between the masts just for the sake of the steering he said the experts all opposed the idea aerodynamically inefficient they maintained i agree with that but it isnt the complete answer in relation to ship handling did kay agree too i think she went along with the majority because she couldnt argue against the scientific lineup without having the practical knowledge herself what this ship needs now is some sailoring knowhow then brockton reappeared i had never seen a chart like the one he smoothed out for us to examine it was made of tissuethin paper with a kind of silvered backing it didnt need the superscription zone ss top secret to tell me what it was all about undersea channels depths underwater mountain ranges and ocean bottom contours were all demarcated here and there a small cross in purple ink showed the location of an underwater electronic beacon it was a nuclear submarine chart of the drake passage both men craned over my shoulder brockton was breathing heavily he traced a clearly marked channel which negotiated a maze of underwater mountain peaks this is the route american subs use he explained as you see it runs zigzag through the centre section of the drake passage its roughly one thousand fathoms or two thousand metres deep it finally emerges here near south georgia in the east thats the sort of route the reds aim to seal tideman added the immediate cape horn area is no bet for the deepdiving subs its too shallow only a hundred fathoms in places they have to stay well south to negotiate the passage beyond diego ramirez island i said accordingly thats the route your yachts took aye he agreed that was the route brockton pointed again this time to a shallow area near the falklands this is the burdwood bank it is ninety nautical miles south of the falklands logistically its of great importance it completely blocks the northeastern approaches to the drake passage as far as nuclear subs are concerned why the bank is so shallow brockton replied its depth ranges from a mere fortysix to a hundred and fortyfive metres it would be straight suicide for a nuclear sub to attempt it weve got the whole area two hundred miles long and fifty wide taped with electronic sensors it seems to me that tactically speaking the west holds all the aces i said the entire area can be air and sea patrolled from the falklands or from the islands on the southern and eastern flanks i wish it were as simple as that answered tideman you forget that the land mass of south america at its southern tip belongs to two countries argentina and chile these two have carried on a border dispute for over a century it flared up recently over the ownership of three tiny islands claimed by chile which bar the eastern or atlantic entrance to the beagle channel one of the main waterways through th mass of islands near cape horn tiny little islands like that cant be of any value to anyone strategically or politically i objected you dont know these latin types peter said brockton theyd fight to their last drop of blood over a sombrero if that were an emotive issue the reason why those three little chilean islands are so important is a question of principle tideman explained argentina claims them according to the principle that she has the traditional right of access to the atlantic ocean chile equally claims right of access to the pacific chile maintains a small naval base in the beagle channel at puerto williams on one of the disputed islands i burst out laughing puerto williams a naval base what a joke i staged south to cape horn in albatros past puerto williams its a tinpot little anchorage with a couple of houses that makes no difference tideman said it is the principle argentina and chile are disputing the same thing applies to the falklands argentina is strongly antibritish as you no doubt gathered he went on with a slight smile that white card business is one of the pinpricks to keep the political pot boiling in addition said brockton sketching a large sector on the map argentina lays claim to all this vast area from the south sandwich islands in the atlantic in the east through to the pacific side of the drake passage plus all the islands along its southern flank think of those claims in terms of nuclear sub logistics and maybe something starts to stink said brockton complete control of the drake passage i suggested exactly said tideman plus the falklands themselves with an airfield which could be expanded to take heavy maritime reconnaissance planes you get the picture peter also as you know argentina has proclaimed a twohundredmile territorial limit round all the islands she claims that makes in their terms the drake passage argentinian waters add to that the entire seapassage you flew over between the south american mainland and the falklands they cant be serious i said its surely nothing more than a lot of flagwaving its a great deal more than that peter said tideman some years ago a party of argentinian patriots who styled themselves group condor staged a token invasion of the falklands after hijacking a plane and forcing it to crashland at stanley the incident was finally smoothed over diplomatically but its left a nasty aftertaste brockton laughed just wait and see what youve stirred up by mucking about with their almirante storni peter just an unfortunate accident you tell argentina that he replied wryly what washington is deeply concerned about is that the russians may attempt to instal a prored argentinian puppet regime in the falklands then with the cooperation of argentina a friendly soviet navy would effectively seal the drake passage the last major link in their global choke point chain would then be complete the united states and britain would then have been totally outmanoeuvred theres a price tag to everything i replied what is it in this case the price of argentinian cooperation would be support by russia for her claims to the falklandscape horn area as well as for her claims against chile in the same region backing for the principle of sole access to the south atlantic by argentina youve mentioned only argentina said what about the attitude of chile from the upited states point of view chile seems safe enough answered brockton the reactionary regime there is unlikely to cooperate with the reds there are no naval or air bases of any significance on chiles western pacific coast its too wild and rugged southwards which could counter closure of the drake passage by the soviet navy i eyed both men since were putting our cards on the table let me ask you both something paul why were you so keen to travel aboard jetwind he hesitated a fraction of a second i had to know exactly what you saw when the orion went in that doesnt mean you had to make the run from the falklands to the cape true he answered but as i said before a crack team from naval securities group activities was specially moved from the azores to tristan because of a buildup of red signals emanating from the southern ocean we lost out over the orions deep probe there are no ships at all in these waters no aircraft routes jetwind is a onceonly chance that something might turn up why should it your route stakes us right across the area were interested in you werent to know that when you first came aboard albatros you didnt even know then that i had been given command of jetwind he seemed a little taken aback by my crossquestioning all i had to go on was that last sighting by the orion of a yacht whose description fitted albatros i played it by ear from there what do you hope to learn still who knows i turned to tideman by hindsight later i realized that he had had time to work on his story while brockton was explaining his john your stampingground is cape horn by your own from it what do you hope to get out of jetwind you plus four paratroopers our navy got tipped off by the us navy of a buildup in the south atlantic he replied were even more handicapped by lack of ships and aircraft than the us were a shoestring outfit like paul im also taking a chance on something turning up there was an imperative knock at the door come in it was arno his face expressionless he gave me a halfformal salute as if to underline the importance of the signal he handed to me it was in plain language it was from the argentinian navy to rainier jetwind jwxs position i gasped our position was stated exactly as it was half an hour before i thought i hadbrushed jetwinds tracks clean return to port stanley immediately surrender to almirante storni noncompliance with this order will be followed by appropriate air and naval action i read the signal over to tideman and brockton tideman noted the position fix giveaway even before brockton how the hell could the argentinian navy possibly know our position it tallies with the satellite navigators readout barely half an hour ago i replied i mean to find out more about this do you intend to comply with the order asked brockton what the hell do you think i retorted its a bluff appropriate air and naval action i snorted derisively in this kind of storm this is the sort of weather to exploit the sailing ships builtin advantage over power were doing better all the time i mean to get even more out of this ship still once i get on the bridge good man tideman said with warm sincerity brockton paced the cabin excitedly well lick these red sonsofbitches yet just the three of us no goddam soviet fleet is going to seal the drake passage my reply was aimed at throwing a bucket of water over his fervour both of you talk as if theres a war on my remark had the desired effect on brockton his excitement vanished the gravity which took its place was all the more striking by contrast tideman nodded agreement when he said the war is on peter its not a shooting war yet its a silent war its a war of move and countermove deep under the oceans deep as the nuclear subs run the drake passage is the wests last great bastion i am at war john is at war i indicated the argentinian signal it looks as if jetwind is also at war chapter a radio phone call i had put through to thomsen in cape town broke up our meeting brockton and tideman left the cabin tideman under orders to get some rest as soon as i could relieve him on the bridge my news left thomsen ecstatic he brushed aside the implications of the almirante storni his enthusiasm was unbounded when he heard jetwinds progress and speed there was a tough pllshowthem admiration in his voice when i told him the route i was taking fastest but most perilous the trolltunga route i cut short his congratulations a lot could happen in miles to gough i told him before i rang off what i wanted most now was to icoax jetwind up to her maximum i made for the door as i reached it it was thrown open as if the gale had suddenly burst its way belowdecks it was sir james hathaway the impetus of his entry and a lurch from the ship caused him to stagger and trip over the old ships bell on the floor which robbie lund had given me at comodoro rivadavia sir james stood glaring at me and the bell as if torn between which he should curse first rainier why the devil do you hide yourself away ive been trying to get hold of you all morning i bit back my retort he was jetwinds potential purchaser i said as civilly as i could my job is to keep this ship moving that comes first maybe he wasnt used to being answered back but what i had to say seemed to mollify him he reached for my hand his grip was like a welterweights at a fight weighin it cost him an effort to say congratulations youve done well rainier yesterday i couldnt have imagined myself saying that to any skipper who took over this ship thanks everyone on board is full of what you did to that bloody dago warship there may be more people than those aboard talking about it soon i said the argentinian navy for example the hell with them he rejoined cheerfully the united nations included theyll blow it up and make capital of the incident before the international forum make no mistake lots of tubthumping from the reds into the bargain thats my view take it or leave it they wont leave it you can be sure his attention seemed divided between me and the old bell whered you get this from ships bells are my hobby i was surprised that he admitted to having any weakness i explained and he bent down and examined it ambassador you say she was a lund ship wasnt she its generations since that line went out of business sir james shipowning is an ongoing business he retorted saltily ships driven by fossil fuels such as oil are on their way out in the same way that coal killed the windjammer the next phase is the genuine saildriven aerodynamic cargo carrier thats why i became interested in jetwind i hope you still are interested he seemed to dance up and down with excitement drive her man show the world drive this bloody ship under whats she logging at this moment twenty knots but she can do better then why arent you doing better how much better three maybe a maximum of four if the gale rises above force ten and if im given the opportunity to get on my own bridge for a second i thought he would explode then he grinned i dont like anyone brushing me off but this once ill take it i didnt leave immediately i paused for a diplomatic minute or two to tell the irascible little so and so about the shipowners rendezvous thomsen had arranged at gough he appeared wary of my softer approach perhaps he thought i was trying to con him i added weather routings warning about trolltunga he considered me shrewdly why dont you deviate to miss the ice if i could sail albatros that way by my own devices then i can manage it with a ship full of electronic gadgetry i really believe you mean what you say rainier but that first officer of yours will let you down grohman he wont hes suspended thats what i like to hear if a man cant go along with your ideas theres only thing he gave one hand a mini karate chop with his other the axe he seemed a man of unpredictable switches of mood grohman having been disposed of so to speak his interest returned to the old bell have it for yourself i offered anything aboard this ship which hasnt got a computer attached belongs to the dark ages ill keep it in my quarters for good luck he said he hefted it up to go i was surprised at his strength he reminded me again of a cock robin boxer one always needs the luck at sea especially in a sailer i hurried up to the bridge the sea was a wild scene my instinct told me even before i consulted the anenometer that the wind speed was over fifty knots it was shearing off the overhanging crests of the rollers about ten metres high and throwing the foam and spray in streaks like a giant firemans hose the rollers themselves had a thudding killer punch to them each one a threat to the fleeing ship in the bows there was enough water and spray over jetwinds deck to match an antinuclear washdown system the ship was steady but lying over far almost to her full count of nine degrees if she were ambushed by a sudden gust she would go over on her beamends and never come up again kay was standing with tideman at the control consoles he had taken the royals off her she was down to top gallants kay looked worried as i joined them jetwind put her bows far down hundreds of tons of sea came sweeping along the deserted decks kay gave me a brief smile of welcome and said peter the slamming is slowing her down the resistance component of the seaway is getting bigger all the time in spite of the wind shes not travelling faster tideman added grimly gesturing forard look at that the next blow against the ships bow was like hitting a solid wall sweat poured down the helmsmans face he wore only a shirt and jeans they had big wet patches he compensated heavily on the wheel as the bows tried to break away shes very hard to hold any more he panted i cant keep her steady sir if any of the rudder controls go the ships had it tideman gave me an inquiring look kay i asked what sort of thrust is there on the sails i made the calculation about five minutes ago roughly about forty thousand horsepower but shes not getting the full benefit of that no shes not shes actually losing speed instead of picking it up if we could stop the slamming it would raise the speed i know theoretically whats happening but i dont know what the practical answer is what in theory is happening i questioned her with my eyes fixed on jetwinds sails a converter of solar energy into thrust thomsen had termed them here then was that process the sea white with fury the tearing overcast black with rage stooping so low at times that jetwinds royal masts were lost to sight the ocean itself raging uncontrollably i formulated orders radical unheardof orders jetwind is plunging violently in a pitching plane she was explaining thats the problem the movement is playing havoc with the aerodynamics as the bow falls into the trough of a wave there is an upward component of spanwise flow on all her foresails then as the bow hits the solid water of the next wave that flow is ended abruptly and replaced by a sudden downward component as her bow rises to that wave and so on jetwind could experience a stall like an aircraft brought about by the spanwise flow if this continues i interrupted her noting how the lower part of the forecourse was blanketed and went slack as jetwind dived deep into the troughs where is the main driving force centred kay answered unhesitatingly about fifteen to twenty metres above the deck jetwind crashed into a bigger roller it felt as unyielding as the berlin wall she cant take this sort of punishment very long tideman cautioned something must go stand by i ordered stand by to slack off the forecourse kay looked startled no way answered tideman you cant slack off jetwinds type of sails theyre fitted to form a single aerodynamic unit from truck to deck the thrust of the wind so high above the deck is ramming her bows down i said plus the fact that theres no lift forard plus no staysails added tideman whats the size of the forecourse i asked kay about two hundred square metres thats a lot of sail i said its the sail for the job of lifting her bows if we can get the wind under it and balloon it out you cant do anything with it began tideman raise the lower yard ten degrees port and starboard as for cargo loading i ordered theres only one way then the sail can go out like a balloon my oath exclaimed tideman whoever would have thought of that kay grabbed my arm in protest you cant do it peter itll wreck the effect of aerodynamic efficiency i looked into her eyes there are times at sea when you have to do what the sea calls for not the windtunnel i said gently i turned away from her puzzled resentful gaze carry on i told tideman his fingers manipulated the controls the great yard folded upwards halted the heavy dacron billowed the wind started to get underneath it give it another five degrees i said up went the yard again out ballooned the great sail the next wave rushed at jetwind with the solidity of a concrete tanktrap her bows rose shouldered aside the water there was no sickening slam tideman exclaimed youve lifted her bows two feet out of the water the quartermaster was grinning thats done it sir she steers like an angel now kay came close and took me impulsively by the upper arms her laugh had some tears in it youre youre a magician peter youre the best afloat since woodget skippered the cutty sark i wanted to kiss her but a ships bridge isnt the place i tried to laugh off her praise its just one of those things one learns at sea but she wouldnt have it and pointed to the speed reading shes making twentyone knots already jetwind did better during the day at times she nudged twentythree knots surfing i suspect a little on some of the biggest rollers she remained dry and safe tearing along as the wind reached force or nearly seventy knots the earlier sickening corkscrewing was gone now that the forecourse held her bows high there was no sun the twilight greyness of the storm was illuminated in a curious unreal way by the seas surface which the harrowing of the gale had seared white if there was growler ice about we would never have spotted it in that streaming whiteness before it ripped open jetwinds hull i didnt think about ice i kept her going and in the next twelve hours jetwind had put kilometres between herself and the last land ahead lay nothing but gough and trolltunga chapter i knew i was in love with kay when i saw her deathfall from the mainyard next day that morning death struck three times aboard jetwind i was on watch it was about seven bells am our speed had fallen slightly during the night but she was still logging a splendid eighteen knots the storm had eased but the ocean remained an awesome sight in the grey first half light the crests seemed steeper than before jetwind was putting her shoulder into them and every time her bows went down mountains of water swamped her long unbroken maindeck it was the sort of situation i had foreseen when i had criticized the decks lack of breakwaters to thomsen i had just spoken to jim yell the bosun on the intercom jims quarters were aft under the poop the bosun in a sailing ship occupies adifferent status from a bosun aboard a steam ship jim had almost officer standing since grohmans suspension and house arrest a much greater burden had been put on him i intended to use the halfhour before the relieving watch came on duty to inspect the afterpeak which housed the auxiliary engine nacelle the stern dropkeel and the steering gear i arranged to meet jim in the crews mess also aft near his own quarters i passed arnos office on my way and told him where i was going he eased the headphone clear of his blond hair and nodded it was the last i saw him alive kay and i almost collided as i started down the companionway from the bridge to the maindeck she had watched her moment with the seas coming aboard and had sprinted along the deck from her cabin in the stern the icy cold air contrasting with the airconditioned interior had brought colour to her cheeks she was wearing sneakers and a green and white tracksuit with a loose top it did nothing for her figure i was not to know then its importance in the forthcoming drama isnt it enough to sprint a hundred and fifty metres along a deck without running up and down the mast as well i joked she held on to the handrail and looked up at me i should never have let her go exercise is a sacred cow with me she smiled if its not milked every day it becomes sloppy there seems to be a strictly feminine undertone to this conversation she laughed and was about to reply but then exclaimed urgently watch out peter here it comes the water did not reach the top of the companionway where we were but swirled along the deck it was cold green hostile the big deck ports clanged as it flooded overboard this is my moment i said and started down i managed the deck without the lifelines an additional precaution was safety nets i barely had time to dodge up the quarterdeck companionway before the next roller swept the decks i glanced aloft before making my way inside there was ice on the burnished yards above jims cabin was the fourth down the passage as i passed his phone rang i answered in his absence the scream of terror was arnos the shot was someone elses arno arno i dropped the silent instrument and ran for jim yell he was standing smoking and talking to a seaman eating breakfast jim he spun round as i burst in i jerked my thumb in the direction of the bridge we both erupted on to the maindeck the nearest companionway to our objective was on the starboard side of the bridge but that was the weather side the side which was shipping hundreds of tons of water it created a waistdeep freezing barrier we hung on to the lifelines there was an interminable delay while we waited for the sea to drain its arno i explained hastily to jim he gave a scream there was a shot now run shouted jim we had reached no mast when jim grabbed me and pointed aloft kay was standing on the mainyard of the next mast forard no mast the one which bisected the bridge this was her daily run she was far out along the yard hanging on with one hand to a loading cable she spotted us gesticulated urgently forward seawards from our level nothing could be seen but the next wall of water waiting for jetwinds bows hang on sir i made an uncompromising gesture in response to kay i grabbed the lifeline and braced myself to my horror kay let go the cable and cupped her hands like a megaphone to her mouth ice a growler right ahead port hardaport the wave dealt a right cross to jetwinds jaw she gave a wicked lurch like a boxer absorbing a haymaker kay grabbed frantically for her support the yard was coated with ice i saw her feet slip she tried to regain her balance by tottering out along the yard her plan might have worked had there been no ice and no second lurch from the ship kay staggered a few steps beyond the line of the ships side then pitched overboard had she fallen from her original position nothing could have stopped her being smashed to pieces on the deck as it was she catapulted clear of the ship but a seas surface from a height of twenty metres is as hard as a deck she turned a complete circle in the air it was not a quick kill fall even as my mind went numb i sensed that she was falling more slowly than she should have the wind had got under her loose tracksuit top ballooning into the loosefitting pants as well it took a little less than five seconds for her to hit the water i followed her fall into the sea a human body is a puny thing it left no telltale splash where it hit the foamtorn surface as jetwind lifted again i caught a glimpse of a terrorstruck face with staring eyes only a few metres from the ships side i have no conscious memory of my actions during those brief seconds of her fall all i know is that i had ripped a lifebelt from the rail and was poised to throw it when her face showed again momentarily against the greywhite sea even as my mind registered the fact that she was still alive another thought supervened no human could live long in that icy ocean i hurled the lifebelt i could only pray that it would land near her i didnt pause to think about the next flood of water sweeping along the deck i took it up to the armpits how i reached the starboard bridge wing within seconds i shall never know i threw open the door the bridge watch tideman was there now stood frozen at my frenzied entry back the topsls numbers one and two masts man overboard no skipper gives an order like that in that sort of gale and sea unless he is mad or drunk it is a lifeordeath manoeuvre for a sailing ship like pulling a grand national steeplechaser up short while hell bent over beechers brook the ship running off before the wind would crash into the troughs of waves as big as hillocks that meant she would roll roll herself full of water roll the masts clean off her even if she survived she faced the same dangers a second time as she came round to pick up the rescue boat i was already shouting for a boat number four boat clear away volunteers it was a small fourman harbour runabout which was secured on the port or lee side of the quarterdeck i found jim yell at my elbow with two other of tidemans men he had conjured up from somewhere tideman held my eyes before obeying he was silently asking the unaskable question was it worth risking the ship and the lives of all aboard for the sake of one person who would already be starting to stiffen in the cold would it not be better rather to let her go one life for the sake of twentyeight one life for the sake of twenty million dollars worth of ship i never admired tideman more than at that moment when i did not respond he gave the kill order steadily helm down we four sprinted for the boat jim yell cut it loose and in a moment we seemed to be pitching among the breaking crests once clear of jetwinds stern the full fury of the storm struck us the light was as grey as a shroud i steered by guess and by god somewhere to windward kay was gasping out her life it was the very greyness of the storm which saved kay flare sir thereaway i was at the outboard tiller already the freezing metal was stripping my skin i got a sight of the selfigniting lifebelt flare that didnt mean to say kay was in it i guessed it to be a couple of hundred metres away separating the boat from it were hills of water i riveted my gaze in that direction then one of the men shouted the ship the ship sir christ shes going over maybe tideman alone was capable of saving her nine degrees was jetwinds theoretical maximum heel before things started to give she must have been superbly built to have stood up to twelve degrees in those killer troughs to my overwrought senses the sail plan seemed to flatten down almost parallel with the water would tideman blow away her topmasts with the ring charges it seemed the only way to save her now i tore my eyes away from the sight when jim yell shouted there there she is sir its her is she dead no saw her face the next wave intervened like disaster itself from its trough we had no sight of either jetwind or kay we went deep deep into icy whitelashed water when we soared to the crest baling frantically kay was only two waves away i hoped she could see us keep your eyes on her i yelled if jetwind were going to her death there was nothing any of us could do now afloat in that tiny boat would be only a way of prolonging our agony no wonder the old windjammer crews refused to learn to swim jim yell reached for an oar takeit easy jim youll smash in her face if that touches her hold the boat off till we can grab her shell be safe enough with me sir the flare pinpointed her position she was slumped over head down arms trailing her mouth and nose were perilously close to the water easy boys let her come down into the trough to us kay seemed to hang there at the summit but the lifebelt could not have taken more than a few moments to coast down towards us then our boat corkscrewed away for chrissake exclaimed one of the men dont lose her now i didnt though the tiller felt ready to take my arm out of its socket but i forced the boar in close kays face was white against the scarlet paint of the lifebelt blotches of purplishblue were forming round her mouth and eyes handsomely boys yell leaned outboard a man holding his legs and plucked kay lifebelt and all to safety i tried to steady my voice is there life in her jim for an answer she moaned and gagged seawater on the bottom boards take over the tiller i ordered pulling off my thick jersey and pants id already shed my oilskins the cold will kill her if we dont get her warm soon jim and i got rid of her soaking tracksuit we rolled her over on her face and tried to clear her lungs the roughness of the bucking boat platform helped our lifegiving massage she coughed and gagged repeatedly i picked her up she was as limp as a rag doll her eyes were staring i dont think she saw me shell make it never you worry yell consoled me with only my oilskins now i realized how perishing cold it was its warmth she needs i repeated i held her close to me to try and absorb some of my body heat theres not such a thing as a blanket aboard i suppose no sir not in a boat this size okay lets get back i said urgently head for the ship will you i said to the man at the tiller the tillerman made a gesture which took in the waves the wind the wide emptiness of the southern ocean ship sir there is no ship chapter there was no ship fear as icy as the gale plucked at me from the vantage height of the next wavecrest all that confronted us was an empty sea its foamcovered lips snarling for vengeance see anything jim i asked he levered himself to a standing position he tensed and said quickly ice sir close by a couple of hundred metres away to port his warning triggered a hope maybe it was the same growler kay had tried to warn me against before she had pitched overboard if that were so it could save usyeto how big big enough sir a growler i knew what he meant big enough to have ripped open jetwind growlers never float alone there must be others around if the ice were reduced to growler size it was probably because the sea was slightly warmer than i thought kay could live could we i tried to remember what they call in antarctica the wind chill factor how much the human body can stand at various wind speeds all i could recall was a ridiculous phrase about face protection being mandatory if it was the same growler that kay had spotted it could provide a marker the point from which jetwind started her turn into the eye of the gale that is if she hadnt rolled herself into eternity she might therefore be coming back in a wide circle to pick up the wind close the ice pardon sir asked jim yell is that wise if jetwind spots the growler on her radar shell steer clear of it he had not carried out my order but i wasnt going to pull my rank with a sailor of his calibre okay jim theres the lifebelt flare the ice will act as a mirror and give it ten times the range it otherwise would have one of the other men broke in excitedly there are also a couple of emergency flares in this locker sir we could shoot em off against the growler too good man i said i tried to imagine how tideman would act he would have everything furled except a couple of topgallants just enough to keep the ship from being pooped in order to have the maximum time to search for us over the previous area hed have every light aboard full on in the hope that we would spot him hed use rockets and flares jim yell edged the boat near the growler kay started to shudder i said to jim if the ship doesnt come soon shell die she wont be alone sir the rest of us cant last very long either the growler seemed almost a friend something stable amongst the gyrating waters one face angled away like the shape of a radar dish jim threw the lifebelt plus flare against its base the unreal light made our faces look like those of sacrificial victims kays was corpselike boat flare next sir fire away this flare was blue it blinded us careful keep the boat off i warned a bang against the growler and weve had it two minutes five minutes i was starting to shake with the cold seawater kay had gagged inside my oilskins froze on my chest try another flare sir not yet give the first one time one of the men exclaimed suddenly as the boat soared to a wavetop seems like a bit of a glow there astern sir could be another berg i replied cautiously keep an eye on it it is something the man insisted there something whitesquare tabular berg or topgallant we strained our eyes into the murk it was difficult to judge distances the grim uniformity of the water offered no scale two sir yelled the man excitedly its two its a couple of topgallants sir see anything jim yell managed to stand on the gunnel while the others supported him its them all right sir he shouted its the ship wait shes turning away that growlers scared her off fire another flare note the ships position the brilliant spurt of orangeyellow penetrated even my closed eyelids when the flare had burned down we fixed our eyes on the quarter where we had last seen the sails there they were shes answering sir a brilliant white flare rose from the still invisible hull i saw the angle of the sails diminish she was turning towards us tideman handled the rescue like a genius in minutes the hull appeared below the burnished streaming yards and masts which rose up out of the murk like the bright wings of an angel of salvation we burned our last flare the ship neared slowed then turned to give us a lee under the stern to bring the boat alongside tideman furled all sails except one topgallant his judgement of the balance of forces between the amount of sail necessary to keep the ship from being swamped and overshooting the boat was masterly one false move and jetwind could never have beaten back a second time they threw ropes down to us you and kay first sir kay couldnt be swung up alone for fear of her smashing against the ships side jim yell and i roped her fast to me we waited for the ships roll eager hands hauled us up and grabbed us get those men aboard quick i told the group on deck then cut the boat loose let it go aye aye sir i gave rapidfire orders for blankets towels and hotwater bottles for kay her cabin was close by in the stern accommodation one of the rescuers remarked you look pretty done in yourself sir let us carry her to the cabin no just get me some clothes anything warm wait a glass of hot rum too at the double sir ill be in her cabin i laid kay on her bunk i stripped the soaking icy undergarments off her i got to work towelling her dry and warm her nipples were purpled and crumpled like metal foil an old scar near her right groin had come lividly alive from the cold her head still lolled her colour was a blend of grey and blue she breathed i could not detect any telltale chokegurgle which would mean her lungs were full of water i paused only long enough in my liferestoring massage to renew my supply of towels and hotwater bottles the messenger thrust a pair of pants woollen shirt and jersey at me i whipped into the clothes the hot rum down my throat was worth more than any of them i turned kay over on her face she was still senseless i turned away to switch the heating to maximum when i returned to kay she had managed to roll herself over her body was now pink from my rough massage her eyes were open and conscious she extended her arms to me with a leadlike effort peter kay i took her under the armpits and held her to me her mouth was against mine her lips were cold but her tongue was warm my love my love i reached for the survival gear heaped on her bunk and chair kay smiled and shook her head not that just you i never got to her from down the corridor came the rattle of automatic fire chapter kays cabin was the second down the corridor there were four others between it and the crews diningsaloon at the end i yanked open the door and sprinted cordite smoke was wisping from the last doorway brocktons cabin i rushed in brocktons body had been almost cut in half at shoulder level by the blast he lay sprawled face down over the black briefcase he had had at his feet on the flight from the cape to the falklands my impetus almost impaled me on two stubby barrels of skeletonbutted uzis i grabbed the finning under the nearest one to save myself from falling it was hot the man who held it swept it free savagely i found myself looking into grohmans face before i could say anything the muzzle of the second submachinegun was jammed into my ribs from the other side the cabin was full of the bitter smell of death cordite and the killsweat of the two men in a flash i recognized grohmans companion as one of the men i had seen on the falklands plane crew additions grohman had called them to tideman back snarled grohman get back keep away from me i started towards the door grohman waved me against a side wall no tricks dont try and escape the shock of brocktons murder had left me momentarily speechless now the sight of the bulletridden body with blood starting to stain the carpet loosened my tongue you stinking murdering bastard grohman ill see you hang for this his gunbarrel had more warmth than his laugh the great captain rainier he sneered the man who kicks my countrys navy up the arse his swarthy face contorted shut up or ill kill you the corridor was filled with shouting men trying to see what was happening grohman said something in spanish to his bullyboy the man went at the crowd like a hooker in a rugby scrum leading his charge with his uzi brockton i shouted you killed paul brockton what had he ever done to you grohman kicked pauls body from where it lay across the attache case a filthy american spy he rasped look the hardfabric case which i had seen paul open several times for customs inspection obviously had a false bottom i caught a glimpse of electronics a mini speaker and what could have been a tiny transmitter do you know what that is demanded grohman it is called a racal datacom portable cipher terminal special to the united states navy that is a pocket cipher unit theres a fragment of the signal he was transmitting when i got him there is also an acoustic coupler and power supply the thought crashed through my mind had brockton revealed everything about himself to me what else beyond what he had told me had led him to insinuate himself aboard jetwind now i winced thinking of tideman he was in the same game as brockton did grohman suspect him too grohman captain grohman to you now rainier his grin was a deaths head one false move from you and youll join your friend shut up and listen this ship is now under command of group condor i am the leader the bridge and other key points have been occupied by my men there was a renewed commotion at the door i heard an oath from the thug with the gun and an angry voice what the devil is going on here i demand to know it was sir james hathaway grohman said in english to the guard dont hurt that man hes worth a million dollars sir james would not have got as far as the entrance had it not been for that warning he thrust himself inside lividfaced a million dollars what he stopped in his tracks at the sight of brockton group condor will ask a million dollars ransom for you grohman said in a sinister voice if it is not paid he indicated the dead man take him away he added to the guard lock him in his cabin get the girl bring her here by force if necessary the man started to frogmarch sir james away my concern was not for him leave kay fenton alone i snapped if you touch her ill kill you with my own hands my tone stopped the guard he looked questioningly at grohman i went on shes halfdrowned she needs care and above all rest youll kill her if you disturb her at this time it was a very touching rescue grohman sneered very romantic very brave just the sort of thing i would expect the great captain rainier to attempt against all the odds cut out the sarcasm i retorted were dealing with someones life a life that is precious to you i gathered myself to jump him my intention must have been obvious he aimed the uzi at my chest youll never reach me rainier he warned his fellow hijacker also switched his aim to me your gallant rescue cut right across the beginning of our operation continued grohman you nearly sank the ship in the process arnos last agonized cry now came back to me you killed amo i said that makes two murders arno could have lived but he wouldnt cooperate he was a key man in his position he could have endangered group condor is that what you call your group of murdering hijackers i retorted he flushed puerio sooner or later you will understand group condor then thinking perhaps that by arguing i was playing for time he ordered bluntly take that old goat away lock up the girl too for the moment shes worth more to us than he is shes only the sailmaker i expostulated ah he echoed only the sailmaker for what sails his jeer reduced me to silence what other game might kay also be playing i simply could not believe it clear the passageway grohman ordered as the thug marched sir james out in front of him no one is to leave their quarters from now on understood jim yell i thought wasnt the sort of man who would take kindly to being pushed around nor any others of the crew they were paratroopers trained to kill the rescue crew must be cared for i intervened theyve taken a beating well see that they dont come to any harm said grohman maliciously now get on the phone check with tideman on the bridge and no tricks he gestured at the uzi i stepped past brocktons body i noted in the cipher terminal case that there was a plug connection to link with the telephone it certainly was sophisticated equipment john i said when i had dialled the bridge tidemans voice was full of suppressed tension he said obviously marking time you got kay all right shes going to be fine i think im in pauls cabin in the stern yes i could imagine that neutral reply being forced out of him with a gun at his back taul is dead grohman made a silencing gesture i am on my way to the bridge with grohman tidemans voice was without inflexion ive got problems here in other words the takeover was complete everything functioning shipwise i mean aye keep her like that until i come ill do that discretion is the better part of valour grohman sneered further first the bridge then youll enjoy my own recent experience of being confined to quarters i am going to lock you up in the sickbay youll be safer there i want your cabin come jetwind was running like a greyhound newly back in its stride tideman was carrying a press of sail what puzzled me was that grohman made no move to interfere maybe that was why tideman had been left alive to handle the ship we made our way along the lifelines to the bridge via the radio office grohman behind me uzi at the ready arnos chair was now occupied by one of grohmans gang several alarms were buzzing away unanswered landajo who the devil wants us one of them is the radiotelephone the other is weather routings callsign answered the operator you expecting a call grohman asked of me possibly thomsen from cape town i replied you can explain this situation grohman let them buzz he told landajo you are not to reply to anyone total radio silence very good comrade comrade brocktons warning about the red threat in the southern ocean had become very real real enough for him to have paid with his life this is to be the only signal send this in our code landajo grohman switched into spanish the message was brief but i recognized the phrase las malvinas son nuestras you wont get away with this i told grohman international terrorism doesnt pay i did not appreciate how near the limit he was he struck at me with his open hand but i ducked before i could counterpunch he had stuck the automatic in my stomach dont try that again you bastard he rapped out when that signal is received a new era will begin the falklands will be ours again after a century and a half of british oppression i kept a contemptuous silence then he snapped weve wasted enough time tideman and the helmsman were on watch a triggerhappy hijacker stood guard at the rear of the bridge brandishing an automatic like grohmans he started nervously when we entered las malvinas son nuestras grohmans catchphrase relaxed the man immediately it must have been the gangs password for the hijacking tideman said grohman put the ship on automatic face this way you are at the wheel keep your eyes ahead if you turn you die tideman manipulated the controls then turned and came to us for all he knew he was about to be blasted into eternity what is all this about he asked coolly grohman indicated the uzi it is all about this do as he says john i warned tideman gave me a quick glance i could see the meaning behind it did grohman know his background stop the other gangman moved so that both he and grohman had clear fields of fire the slightly hysterical note returned to grohmans voice this ship is now under my command you and rainier will be locked up any attempt to escape and you will be shot i could see tidemans tension ease grofiman wasnt wise to him yes tidemans tone was completely neutral grohman ordered the guard search him ill hold your gun while you do it the two of them were as wary as if hunting leopards the passing of weapons between them was so quick it was almost sleightofhand there wasnt a chance of jumping either of them the man frisked tideman from a pocket he pulled out the sliderule which concealed the lethal blade he raised it inquiringly to grohman grohman said its for navigation put it back it cant hurt anyone when the search was over grohman returned the gunmans automatic then he backed to the ships intercom keeping his own weapon levelled on us bitchbox brockton had called it the recollection was like a stab to the heart grohman speaking he said i have taken over command of jetwind i am now the captain the ship is in the hands of group condor his voice rose we are liberation fighters the falkland islands the malvinas have groaned under the british yoke for a hundred and fifty years we group condor have come to liberate the oppressed populace this is a great hour for my country the capitalistcolonialist regime is about to end the islands will be returned to my people an argentinian regime based on equality for all will be installed under my leadership argentinian justice will replace the colonial tyranny which has suppressed the people for so long las malvinas son nuestras is that why you shot a harmless american reporter i said derisively when he had finished at the instrument brockton was a spy he shouted we caught him sending off a signal which would have wrecked our enterprise that was his death warrant he had to die enterprise thats a goddam funny word for murder and piracy grohman shrugged and went on in his hectoring tone when argentina freed itself from the colonial rule of spain the thieving british saw their opportunity in the upheaval which followed and stole the malvinas from us one american life is nothing beside that how can you and four gunmen hope to seize such a spreadout group of islands i asked you might perhaps get away with it for a while in a little place like port stanley also think of the international stink youll create grohman seemed amused youll see in a few days time it will take more than a few days for jetwind to beat back to the falklands into this gale i replied a few weeks more likely perhaps tideman felt that his continued silence was playing the situation a little too dumb he said ill back that up as a sailor the emphasis was on sailor shut up both of you retorted grohman dont argue with me im in command and what i say goes you are the enemies of las malvinas consider yourselves lucky that i do not shoot you out of hand but i will let you live provided you behave for a few days until we reach molot chapter molot was the riddle which bugged our long day in captivity in the ships sickbay the hospital was situated underneath the port wing of the bridge in exactly the same position but on the opposite side of my captains suite it had two curtainedoff cubicles and a minute double ward containing two surgical beds a glass partition separated the sickbay itself from an outer reception office designed for a medical orderly the sickbay did not seem to have had much use except as a junk room for ships odds and ends one of these was a survival suit stored on a hanger which tideman explained was used in icy seas for inspection of jetwind s drop keels molot i asked tideman for the hundredth time where the hell is molot it must be the base from which the attack on the falklands will be launched he replied thats about all i can guess but grohman is heading away from the falklands i pointed out hes kept jetwind going like a bomb all day away from his objective there is no land whatsoever between the falklands and gough island perhaps molot is a place we know by a different name like malvinas suggested tideman even then i dont get it grohman is holding jetwind on the course you selected for gough hes not doing it too badly either theres nothing wrong with his sailoring replied tideman hes sailing by computer maybe we could get an extra knot or two out of her manually the only possibility of land is the south sandwich group i went on but theyre far to the south of our present course south sandwich it might be said tideman but that doesnt mean much most of the islands are volcanic theyre all coated with ice being so near antarctica ive heard that the only way to land is by helicopter they would be totally unsuitable as a base what if molot is another name for gough no john gough is a south african weather station its important its the only weather station in the central part of the southern ocean group condor couldnt take it over without provoking a massive retaliation the same objection applies to tristan da cunha which is only a couple of hundred miles northwest of gough he answered if group condor occupied either of them it would prejudice the falklands attack in advance because the secret would be out also any assault force would then have to cross twentyone hundred miles of ocean in order to reach the falklands poor paul i said i wonder if he got wind of grohmans plans im in the same boat as paul tideman replied quietly grohman doesnt suspect a thing i reassured him if he had you wouldnt be here john youre also living on borrowed time peter until molot grohman said it all came back to molot when night came we were no nearer an answer suddenly the outer sickbay door opened kay i jumped up to go to her keep back grohman appeared behind her threatening with the uzi kay and i looked at one another for a long moment her eyes told me everything she was still pale but smiling the guard warily pitched her suitcase inside grohman looked strained holding down a crew of twentyeight could not have been easy shes to stay here he said briefly its not for the pleasure of your company let me assure you its because i cant spare one man solely to guard her what do you expect me to say to that i asked listen rainier he said angrily you and tideman are expendable understand the final decision does not rest with me or else youd have been overside already this woman is not in the same category she is valuable to us just as in another way sir james hathaway is valuable to us a million dollars will help finance group condors operations i deliberately tried to rattle him i would have been prepared to risk the second gun if i could have grabbed his automatic tideman i knew would back me to the hilt the hilt of that wicked dagger which he had managed to keep youre going back to the malvinas you say but youre heading in the opposite direction kay broke in what possible use can i be to group condor wholl pay a million dollars for me you are an expert in sail aerodynamics that is why you are valuable replied grohman sail aerodynamics she exclaimed what has that to do with killing and murder and unsuspecting attacks you play the innocent well said grohman but it doesnt wash at molot you will be transferred to soviet protection i have been notified that afterwards you will be transferred to kyyiv in russia itself where secret experiments are being conducted into sail aerodynamics i was stunned kay was speechless if grohman got wind of tidemans connection with the schiffbau instituts tests he was a dead man grohman looked triumphant perhaps it was his paranoid temperament which compelled him to boast of his superiority in the face of murder i have been to kyyiv he said we admit that the schiffbaus experiments are ahead of ours this ship proves it you will be a valuable asset to our research team kyyiv me i wont go grohman stroked the finning along the uzis barrel it was a catlike sinister gesture the decision is not mine whether to force you or not he said that rests with command at molot but i advise you not to push your luck too far soviet command you mean i asked he looked surprised who else nothing will make me go to some secret test ground in russia under threat kay burst out you have about three days to think it over before we reach moiot replied grohman think about it well senorita fenton you will be treated well if you cooperate otherwise he shrugged you bastard i said you crazy bastard he swung the automatic on me for a moment his eyes went killblank then he relaxed three days that is all you have rainier he backed out of the sickbay the guard took up his previous position behind the glass partition i felt as if i had been kicked in the stomach for fully a couple of minutes we all stood rooted finally i broke the silence ill put your case in a cubicle kay any particular choice the closer to you both the better i started to pick up the case and she said they let me bring my transistor radio it might help pass the time until molot she was close to tears what is molot peter john i wish we knew replied tideman weve been racking our brains all day she went into her cubicle i followed inside there was no need to say anything she came into my arms i could feel the dry sobs from her throat through her breasts against me her lips were a warm pulse of agony and denied ecstasy wet with tears just when ive found the man i want im to lose him she whispered brokenly why didnt you just let me go this morning it would have been better all round oh my love my darling i held her close and said those things which can only be said in the presence of new love finally her sobs quietened i said more to comfort her than with any plan in mind three days is a long time kay anything could happen before we reach molot molot she echoed how i hate that name already what is it what does it mean it has an evil ring like trolltunga its russian thats for sure what it means is as much a mystery as where it is then we joined tideman in the main ward he was listening to kays radio turning it every way to try and improve reception i had the cape town news he said it reported concern because no signals had been received from jetwind for a day there was an interview with thomsen i couldnt hear clearly something about no contact with the ship kay voiced the concern uppermost in all our minds john peter why should the russians be interested in me i havent any secrets tideman switchedoff the radio with a significant gesture he said gravely you have kay i secrets he waved us into a couple of hard chairs round a low table he opened a drawer by his bed and produced a pack of cards obviously provided for patients he nodded towards the watching sentry if we hold a discussion in the ordinary way im sure well rouse his suspicions he said quietly well pretend were playing cards ill explain kays hand was shaking when tideman dealt the first round secrets she repeated incredulously aye secrets kay remember when the schiffbau institut was making the final windtunnel tests of jetwinds sails and masts sure i was there she exclaimed you were there too thats where we met i was at the invitation of axel thomsen himself hed heard of my runs round the horn as a member of the british services adventure scheme and thought i might be able to contribute something practical to the theoretical tests i stressed the same thing to thomsen i interjected thats what probably made him interested in you as a skipper your practical experience in albatros he looked anxiously round the sickbay i take it this place isnt bugged is it if so we might as well say goodbye in the light of what im going to say now grohman hasnt had any opportunity i replied here goes then both of you know of course that jetwinds sails are made of dacron not canvas he stressed his statement so carefully that kay said of course john but thats no secret bacron is tougher and smoother and therefore more aerodynamically efficient than canvas kay was staring at him and he warned try and keep your eyes on your cards kay she gave a little shake of her head half reproach half incredulity dacron is also far more expensive than canvas tideman went on therefore it is worth protecting in a way canvas need not be jetwinds sails alone cost a fortune albatross dacron sails at the end of my run were as thin from sun damage as the ancient mariners ghost ships i said thats it sun damage he went on cjetwinds designers realized that to prevent sun damage from infrared and ultraviolet rays the sails would have to have a plastic coating you realize the problem this poses what plastic could stand up to the continual flexing reefing furling and endless changes in wind pressure there was also the problem of cracking and flaking the protective coating would have to withstand that also kay said i remember the headaches that caused but the schiffbau team came up trumps in the end it was brilliant inventiveness tideman went on the specialists evolved a completely new plastic in the polymer group the same chemical group as dacron itself it was named polyionosoprene the day we tested the new plastic and found that it absorbed infrared and microwaves was sensational i threw down a card at random on the table it was the top ace in the pack tideman gave value to the pause gathering up the pack and riffling the deck like a professional cardsharp the guard beyond the glass partition was lolling disinterested that absorption was due we believed though we couldnt prove it to an unknown chemical reaction occurring between the dacron and polyionosoprene that doesnt sound too dramatic john i was there kay added everyone seemed quite pleased but not overexcited at the discovery a slight smile broke the seriousness of tidemans explanation it was in fact one of the biggest strategic breakthroughs of the satellite age infrared and microwaves are the basic elements of american and russian spy satellites however infrared rays are strongly absorbed by water vapour with the result that a spy satellite cannot see through cloud which means restricting their use to cloudfree days he slapped down a card now here is polyionosoprene an artificial substance which similarly absorbs these rays kay looked dumbfounded i never guessed it was that important microwaves can actually penetrate water vapour cloud for example but the deeper they penetrate the poorer becomes the resolution of the sensor image continued tideman i still dont quite get it i said in the latest nimbus series of satellite using microwave instruments resolution is of the order of two hundred to three hundred metres in other words any object with a distinct water mass say an iceberg with dimensions smaller than this will not show up on the spy satellite scan i still dont get the connection with jetwind i said the combination of heavy cloud cover and polyionosoprenecoated sails renders this ship undetectable by spy satellite said tideman he gathered up the cards as a token gesture and reshuffled them polyionosoprenecoated sails also deflect most of what we call pecm passive electronic countermeasures which are used in the multisensor module installations of the latest american and russian highaltitude spyplanes he dealt the cards jetwinds secret makes her of top strategic significance in todays world kay still seemed dumbfounded remembers john when they told us in hamburg that polyionosoprene was a big commercial secret and we were not to talk about it i never dreamed it was anything as momentous as this now then tideman went on you paul and i discussed the importance of the drake passage as an antisubmarine choke point we shall never know how much brockton was in on what i am about to tell you now when i learned the facts about polyionosoprene i immediately thought of the drake passage where cloud cover is total for twentyfive days in the month a ship protected by polyionosoprene in those waters is almost undetectable by spy satellites even under light cloud cover conditions jetwind would show up on spy satellite instruments only as an amorphous white blob indistinguishable from innumerable icebergs in fact we have the biggest antisurveillance breakthrough since the first spyinthesky went into orbit kay made a helpless gesture they simply referred to the danger of industrial espionage what did you do about it i wanted to know i got back to london as fast as i could make it after toplevel discussions the navy decided to keep the tightest security watch over jetwinds proving voyage which was then scheduled to take place from montevideo to the cape how does mortensens murder tie up with what youre saying now i asked my guess is that grohmans molot command ordered him to kill him when the soviet navy lost track of jetwind lost track there was no secret about her position her journey was publicized throughout the world lost track from the sky satellite track i think something happened which sent a powerful shock through the red fleet but whykay asked this ship had to be stopped from going anywhere near this molot place in case the alleged soviet base was exposed i said ruefully and i too unwittingly headed for molot from the falklands i suppose thats why jetwind was hijacked she had to be stopped because she was invisible to red spy satellites grohman knew he was safe in the falklands thats why he holed up there after mortensens death then you came along and threw a spanner in the works he never bargained you would get past the warship which was meant to detain jetwind orders for which originated no doubt right back at soviet naval command hq god what a mess exclaimed kay keep your eyes on the cards tideman warned again john i cut in dont you think you exaggerate the whole situation grohman is just a puppet whose strings are being manipulated suppose he is to lead an attack on the falklands theres no way he can count on a force of any size all he can do is lead a small group of terrorists against stanley and occupy the place it would be a demonstration a gesture not an operation of international scope such as you have in mind unfortunately theres more to it thanthat the navys antisubmarine specialist team decided that if jetwind proved herself a fleet of five jetwinds would be built their true purpose would constitute the newest and most novel form of antisub weapon the projected fleet has even been given a name the cape horn patrol there was a long silence we threw down the cards mechanically unseeingly the operational area of the cape horn patrol would be the drake passage and its ocean approaches it has one overriding assignment to monitor the passage of nuclear submarines drake passage presents a unique problem in tactical detection which no major navy has yet mastered it is impossible because of the bad weather and lack of bases to monitor the passage of nuclear subs by conventional means if any navy attempted warship patrols of the passage they would be detected within hours by satellite powered ships are heatemitting they are easy game for infrared sensors in addition engines make a noise a giveaway to countersonar tracking by submarines submerged subs are out of satellite reach never forget that a nuclear sub is a noisy machine that is its achilles heel the latest soviet titanium class is fortunately for the west the noisiest of the lot what can jetwind do that they cant kay wanted to know jetwind being winddriven is the silent stalker the silent killer he said in southern ocean conditions she is fast faster than most warships can travel safely she also offers what no powered vessel can a stable operations platform her sails hold her hull down on the water so you see he said jetwind is in fact a fast silent satelliteundetectable weapon against nuclear subs in an area which also happens to be a naval choke point of major global strategic significance i said slowly now we have it john he shook his head at present something else alarms me rather did alarm me kay and i waited anxiously i was afraid that after the hijacking grohman might turn back to the falklands he said that would have put paid to jetwinds major proving test i felt my stomach muscles cramp is there more asked kay now even more alarmed he nodded i told you im pretty sure the reds panicked when they couldnt pinpoint jetwind by satellite the united states navy and britain have arranged a similar sort of test the us navy is diverting one of its latest seascan spy satellites to check on jetwind at a given place and time roughly four hundred miles southsouthwest of gough a little over three and a half days from now jetwind must pass at a point directly beneath the line of the seascan satellite this nadir position will offer the best test of her undetectability why select that particular spot in the southern ocean i asked because drifting icebergs and ocean and weather conditions are very similar to the drake passage he answered the location was very carefully chosen and if jetwind doesnt show up for the first time in many fake deals tideman lifted his head and looked squarely at kay and me the seascan is in transit from one secret destination to another dont know where he replied it is the onceonly time and place for the test no jetwind at the rendezvous no cape horn patrol its as simple as that the sailing ship will be dead for ever how much did paul know of this i wish id had time to find out he answered remember his intense interest in your socalled hallucinations they were supposed to have occurred roughly in the seascan rendezvous area he paused and added and thats where the orion crashed i have something to add i said something i didnt mention even to paul in regard to my hallucinations to this day im not sure whether i saw it or not tideman leaned forward his elbows banging on the table okay say it now what was it i thought i saw a submarine she wasnt moving she was at anchor moored loading something then she was swallowed up by the mist chapter weve got to retake the ship i was saying next morning to tideman what i seemed to have repeated a hundred times since the evening before tidemans revelations about jetwinds value as a spaceage weapon had left me with a feeling of bewilderment i had slept badly it was before breakfast in the sickbay and we were waiting for an early cape news bulletin radio reception on kays little set was improving the deduction was that we were shortening the distance to cape town there was no way of establishing our position even roughly tideman and i had speculated about it as frequently as i had reiterated my determination to recapture the ship we were aware that jetwind hadnt altered course and was still following my planned route to gough we were also able to estimate her speed to within a couple of knots grohman kept her going like a train the strain of his long vigil was telling on our guard he would fidget in his seat then take a pace or two up and down the outer glasspartitioned office keeping himself alert until his relief arrived tideman nodded in his direction to get at him we have somehow to get past that glass partition as things stand we have no hope of a surprise they hold all the trumps i agreed all but one he answered he thrust his hand into his sliderule pocket this keep that hidden for petes sake i said weve got to find or create the opportunity to use it its not only our lives that are at stake there are all the other consequences im also desperately worried what theyll do to kay i dont like the sound of kyyiv either he replied if they got their hands on her at molot i fear shes done for meaning he sidestepped a direct answer it was better she should know jetwinds secret if the pressure becomes too great she could always break down and confess not knowing and playing the genuine innocent might only lead to something worse i got up and made for the partition like a lion trapped in a cage up came the sentrys automatic peter leave it here comes the cape news it took a great effort to pull myself away there is concern in cape town shipping circles regarding the whereabouts of the missing sailing ship jetwind which began an attempt on the falklandscape record some days ago said the suave tones of the woman newsreader all attempts to establish communication with the ship have failed the owner mr axel thomsen told our news staff this morning that he is worried about the safety of the ship which encountered a storm of hurricane proportions shortly after leaving port stanley weather satellite photographs confirm that a storm of unusual intensity is still raging along the route captain rainier decided to take to gough island captain rainier had been warned by weather experts not to follow this course i cant stand this holierthanthou itoldyouso crap i exclaimed angrily if they only guessed what was going on no one could guess peter replied tideman i tried to defuse my frustration this amounts to the fact that grohman is keeping radio silence doesnt it wouldnt you in his shoes with the stakes involved the bulletin went on mr thomsen adds that south african naval headquarters has informed him that the area where jetwind was last reported is well outside the range of longrange maritime reconnaissance aircraft nevertheless if nothing is heard today from the missing ship the south african research vessel agulhas which is now on a routine replenishment voyage to our weather station on gough island may be diverted to search for jetwind the agulhas is equipped with two helicopters which would enable a wide area of ocean to be covered there was an interruption grohman had arrived in the outside office with him was the guards relief looking the freshest of the three grohman carrying his automatic unlocked the door he was strained and unshaven if i was short on sleep he was shorter kay emerged from her cubicle i said you just missed an interesting news bulletin grohman everyone is getting pretty worried about jetwind the people who matter arent worried he retorted i went on trying to needle him your radio silence is proving counterproductive you didnt hear what the radio had to say dont play games he snarled landajo tapes all the main news bulletins i can hear them at my leisure i kept silent his nerves were too ragged to take it finally he snapped out with it what did the news say if nothing is heard today from jetwind the agulhas will divert from gough and search the southern ocean with helicopters you lie he exploded you are making this up you can check its on tape you said so yourself i pushed home my verbal attack that means that theyll locate molot grohman what will your bosses in the soviet fleet say when they find out youve blown their cover the eyes of the world are already focused on this section of the southern ocean because of jetwind you havent been nearly clever enough i should shoot you he snarled its too late i replied with more bravado than i felt youve started something you cant reverse searchers will be here soon like a swarm of bees i felt grohman was against the ropes psychologically speaking he said defensively if i had sent a mayday they would have been here in any event you should simply have carried on as if nothing had happened i persisted just pretended you were me i doubt whether if youd tried it thomsen would have fallen for a yarn about a second jetwind skipper having died by accident dont mock me you bastard there is still time to put the search off the scent go ahead i said youre the skipper rainier he said in a way which was more sinister than his histrionics molot command has instructed me to deliver you unharmed it might be a lot easier for you if i could tell them you had been cooperative as it ishe shrugged kay broke in get this clear will not cooperate under duress or any other way i go along with peter and john whatever those are very big words sneered grohman we shall see at molot we knew what had been in his mind regarding the search for jetwind when we heard the lunchtime news bulletin there is news at last of the sea drama being enacted in the southern ocean around the spaceage windjammer jetwind naval headquarters at silvermine cape town reports that a faint garbled radio message was picked up this morning from the ship it appears that she has been partially dismasted and that there have been casualties as a result of the accident casualties accident expostulated kay the signal stated that the ship was in no immediate need of assistance and gave her position as fiftytwo degrees south thirtynine degrees west near the island of south georgia south georgia exclaimed tideman the island of south georgia is approximately seven hundred miles eastsoutheast of jetwinds startingpoint in the falkland islands which means that the ship must have been driven considerably offcourse by the hurricane which damaged her at this stage no further details are available what is grohman up to kay asked its a red herring to stave off a possible search i said he hopes itll give him the breathingspace he needs to reach molot the experts wont be put off by a fake distress signal like that surely wont they smell a rat asked kay in the light of his assurance that jetwind is in no immediate danger no one is going to mount an expensive dangerous search far away from the main shipping lanes i said peter john we must do something we cant just let the situation slide we cant go on like this waiting just waiting keep calm kay said tideman gently the guy who wins in a hijacking is the one who can keep his nerve the longest just how corrosive that tension could be we discovered throughout the interminable afternoon there was nothing to do nothing to read we played what tideman called sillybuggers card games inconsequential timewasting which we tried to enliven by wagering impossible sums the attempt was not a success the nightmare of molot overshadowed everything we could not wait for the main dinnertime news bulletin from cape town no further messages have been received from the missing sailing ship jetwind making for south georgia it reported shipping experts believe that the vessel may try and reach the sheltered harbour of king edward cove where the old grytviken whaling station is situated this is now occupied by the british antarctic survey so far all attempts by the surveys radio zbh to contact the damaged vessel have failed until some positive information is received the survey replenishment ship agulhas will continue to gough island as scheduled without mounting a special search as was originally planned grohman pulled it off i exclaimed there goes our last outside chance the bulletin continued mr axel thomsen jetwinds owner was interviewed today on the fate of his unique attempt to reinstate the sailing ship as an ocean cargo carrier this is the second mishap which has hit jetwind he said i think the ship must be jinxed mr thomsen added that he would remain in cape town until specific news had been received about the ship and would then return overseas he added that he was bitterly disappointed at the failure of jetwind if the ship could be repaired he added he would decide whether or not to sell it that is if there is anyone left who is still interested in sailing ships mr thomsen said high overhead the towering aerodynamics of thomsens spaceage marvel thrust her along at seventeen knots through a force eight gale and dark confused sea towards her goal fateor molot chapter it was molot it was the most colossal spectacle i have ever seen grohmans arrival on schedule was a tribute to the magnificent way the automatics had handled jetwind although he had been lucky with the wind it was the afternoon of the third day of our captivity perhaps it was mainly tidemans diagnosis that the winner in a hostage snatch was the one who kept his nerve the longest that kept us going that and our endless and sometimes futilely impractical plans to retake the ship which we formulated and reformulated as the hours and the guards presence leaned on us the worst aspect was that we had nothing to keep us occupied an adjunct to our plotting like prisoners of war doing mental mathematical calculations to prevent them from going mad was our attempts to estimate jetwinds speed course and destination the gale had fluctuated between forces seven and nine neither tideman nor i needed instruments to judge that only once did jetwind slow there was a curious hiatus one afternoon when the wind fell to a light northwesterly breeze and the ship rolled heavily in the rough swell then the wind backed strongly and jetwind put on her sevenleague boots again the course was the big poser we know jetwind still headed eastnortheast from the suns position through the porthole often however it was obscured by cloud world interest in jetwind became progressively less as the days passed at first there was some comment on the radio bulletins about the lack of further information however a report that the british antarctic survey ship rrs john biscoe would shortly be leaving south georgia and would traverse the area from which jetwind had supposedly radioed seemed to kill the drama in the medias eyes our guards had remained supervigilant but we saw almost nothing of grohman on one of his rare visits i had tried to rattle him by accusing him of throwing the bodies of brockton and arno overboard his reply had been had he the discretion he would have done so as it was they were being kept in deepfreeze for clinical examination at molot this answer had started new trains of speculation clinical examination postulated a base with facilities now it was late in the afternoon watch kay tideman and i were trying to kill the uhkillable time suddenly kay exclaimed whats happening a second guard had entered the glassedoff section the sentry himself seemed surprised the newcomer gestured in our direction he was strung about with spare uzi magazines and there were two grenades at his belt he opened the door come the two hijackers conducted us along a passageway leading to the navigation and chart offices and finally to the bridge there i paid no attention to grohman i had eyes only for what lay ahead of the ship by all thats holy exclaimed tideman softly in albatros it had been a hallucination a dream now it was a living nightmare the entire ocean was a fantasy in foggy blue white and pearl with no clear demarcation between greengrey sea pale horizon and grey overcast the misty reality was the same as before the two groups of piledup icebergs were the same so was one great isolated berg which rode alone and whose resemblance to a cunarder had made me doubt my senses when i had sighted it from albatross cockpit the two assemblages of bergs tumbled together to form a kind of gigantic gateway to what lay behind undefined as yet vast murky secret molot grohman was amused at our thunderstruck silence its not on any chart i said doubtfully chart or no chart it was engraved in my memory it was there out to starboard inside the huge entrance that i had seen the orion vanish into a noworld of water vapour ice and sky further in still i had sighted the submarine kay found her voice molot what does it mean hammer replied grohman the hammer and the sickle added tideman grohman chuckled molot is on the chart if you have the right chart he brought one out from under his arm hed obviously been waiting for the question the typical need for exhibitionism of the paranoiac i did not need to understand the russian lettering it was the soviet fleets nuclear submarine chart of the southern ocean tideman gaped grohman indicated a position i could not follow the russian scale at a guess the place was about six hundred nautical miles southsouthwest of gough island molot he repeated he waved to the spectacle outside as if to underscore what he was telling us molot there is no land i expostulated there cant be it would have been discovered years ago it is not land answered grohman it was not land we were after molot is a seamount a series of shallowwater shoals it is the shape of a huge triangle the sides measure thirtyone by twentynine by eighteen kilometres no one has ever suspected that such a place exists of course they havent except the red fleet grohman retorted contemptuously what do you think was the true purpose of years of patient oceanographical research carried out by soviet ships in the southern ocean whales plankton studies no the purpose of our search was strategic and we found what we were looking for molot tideman and i had our attention focused on the chart we did not see what caused kay to utter a further gasp of amazement some freak of cold air interacting with warm vapour drew aside the mist curtain for a moment a single monster iceberg stretched from horizon to horizon it blocked our entire view of the ocean to port as far as the eye could reach it had the characteristic tabular shape of the antarctic iceberg but i had never seen anything to approach it in size it towered some five hundred metres out of the water although this giant was the centrepiece the rest of the panorama was equally breathtaking groups of smaller bergs giants in themselves but puny by comparison with the monster scattered the ocean ahead and on both sides of jetwind now moving under reduced sail the barrier of ice was already having a taming effect on the swells at the approaches to the bases grohman said it is the biggest iceberg ever seen in the southern ocean trolltunga i exclaimed yes trolltunga he repeated kay stared at the great berg as if mesmerized and shivered i remembered her premonition of evil when she first heard the name trolltunga youre seeing trolltunga only in old age grohman continued repeating what i had already heard from brockton it was first spotted by an american satellite in the weddell sea as long as fifteen years ago now it is only about half its original dimension trolltunga has taken all those years to drift north from the main antarctic ice shelf and it has lost size as it passed gradually into warmer seas now as you can see it is fast fast exclaimed tideman what do you mean fast the nearest comparison to alolot i can make is the burdwood bank off the malvinas your falklands he answered there every season are gigantic accumulatdons of icebergs which have grounded in the shallow water after breaking free of the antarctic pack dont forget molots present position is still within the limits of drifting packice trolltunga has rested stationary here for years it forms the entire southwestern barrier of the base it prompted the question which had been in my mind ever since the day in albatros i had imagined i was suffering from hallucinations how is the fog formed the icebergs themselves are not enough to generate it i told you molot is a seamount said grohman it is a section of a highly unstable oceanfloor volcanic pattern which stretches southwestwards from the vicinity of gough towards the horn you remember that some years ago tristan da cunha was almost destroyed by a volcanic eruption molot has the same characteristics except that its volcanic crater lies just below the seas surface we have established that it is alive but it is not active in the sense that it is liable to blow up at any moment the underwater volcanic action in contact with the cold sea surrounding the icebergs causes the fog you keep saying we do you belong to the soviet navy i ventured while he had been explaining the physical features of molot grohmans earlier hectoring paranoid attitude towards us had abated now my question seemed to fuel it afresh i am a patriot an argentinian he snapped i am going to recapture the malvinas the falklands for argentina thats a tall order i observed you think so he sneered listen for years i have led group condor which began purely as a patriotic society under my leadership it became a paramilitary body then finally a military strike force but alone we could not mount an attack against the malvinas so we grouped ourselves with the superpower most likely to help us the soviet from molot here i will lead my assault force against the malvinas a warning bell rang at the back of my mind why are you telling us all this grohman it is top secret information i didnt like the way he laughed why shouldnt you know you will never live to tell that goes for tideman as well as for the woman i think kyyiv is about as securitysafe as siberia i decided to play further on his deepseated mania in order to elicit more information how does jetwind come into all this there was the danger that on her run from montevideo to the cape she would divert and discover molot so that is why you murdered captain mortensen tideman added anyway the great circle course from montevideo passes hundreds of miles away from here grohmans eyes went from tideman to me they were merciless you are only tiny pawns in a big game so was mortensen his life didnt count for a damn beside the big issues there was a danger that he might go south into the molot area to look for better winds i was planted aboard jetwind in the first place a long time ago when she was building to hold a watching brief just in case it proved to be a very wise precaution i recalled tidemans guess that the soviet navy might have suspected that jetwind was not merely a new type of sailing ship but a vessel of strategic significance grohmans next words bore it out he said in a quiet sinister voice this ship has a secret and we mean to find it out i went cold inside had jetwinds picture after leaving montevideo as we had speculated indeed failed to register on a red spy satellite sensor because of her polyionosoprenecoated sails and in consequence precipitated the order to grohman to kill mortensen and take the ship to safety in the falklands pending the group condor attack the jigsaw seemed to fit what grohman added made me certain it also frightened me the woman knows what it is he said at kyyiv we will extract it kay went white im only a sailmaker she exclaimed only a sailmaker he mocked we shall see there are ways of extracting the unextractable senorita there is nothing to know grohman i snapped his face suffused with rage you tell me that you listen you interfere in everything you nearly caused the entire attack plan to abort my orders were to wait in port stanley in jetwind until the main body of group condor arrived for me to seize the place just to make sure my country sent the almirante storni i laughed he swung on me so violently i thought he was about to use the uzi laughwhile you have the time he snarled soon you will regret what you did to the almirante storni tideman stepped in to try and defuse the tension he played on grohmans illusions of grandeur the soviet navys oceanographic ships have combed the indian ocean for years he said likewise they must have charted every seamount and shoal in the southern ocean from what you say it seemed as if tideman had pressed the right button grohman calmed down have you asked yourself why he asked rhetorically obvious safe routes for nuclear subs replied tideman as you say the obvious deduction grohman retorted with an air of contempt it is what we wanted the west to think what else i interjected he asked obliquely have you ever heard of jellified fuel he did not wait for us to venture an answer the soviet fleet uses it it is a type of fuel ideally suited to submarines it minimizes vapour pressure and is easily relinquished it does away with all need for the elaborate array of fleet replenishment tenders and refuelling points in midocean which are subjected to monitoring by spy satellites and spy planes stored underwater in a base which is secure shallow and cold jellified fuel gives the submarine the red submarine that is to say a range without limit molot i exclaimed yes molot he said triumphantly supply ships dump large plastic containers of jellified fuel which are cached away at molot safe from detection beneath the surface the shoals of this seamount could not be bettered for our purpose our submarines are guided to the dumps by means of underwater electronic markers once the fuel is scooped up by a submarine the process of reliquification is easy by having this base the way is open from molot to choose our point of attack anywhere in the southern ocean the drake passage the cape oil route the malvinas anywhere we wish the malvinas is the initial operation to be mounted from molot the first anyone will be aware of it will be when the attack squadron with group condor appears in the narrows i knew now that the submarine i had seen from albatros had been no hallucination grohmans words told me what it had been busy doing refuelling with jellified fuel the secret was so momentous that the orion had had to pay with its life merely because of its presence near molot brockton had been in deeper waters than he had suspected molot was safe from detection by virtue of its remoteness and the wildest seas and weather on the face of the oceans no shipmaster in his senses would risk approaching that protecting screen of icebergs even if by some offchance he should be so distant from all recognized sea routes most valuable of all to the red fleet was that canopy of foggy vapour it effectively created an impenetrable screen to spy satellite surveillance molot was the dagger aimed at the heart of the west chapter the blade of that dagger lay unsheathed when jetwind rounded trolltungas ice headland as high and impressive as cape horn itself it was a soviet naval squadron it was a gutroiling exhibition of the iron fist i spotted the submarine the shape of its elongated fin was the same as i had sighted from albatros now in addition i was aware of its strange camouflage colour bluish mauve with the hull darker it was the colour of the antarctic halfnight it was so tideman told me later a radar picket sub a whiskey canvas bag class the odd name sprang from the way the soviet fleet had tried to mask the conningtower from the eyes of western observers by means of a coy canvas cover moored alongside was a big deadly kashinclass destroyer even at our distance from the warship the gaggle of four twin missile surfacetoair launchers plus four other single launchers was clearly visible she mounted heavy guns as well the snouts of quintuple torpedotubes bared their teeth over the ships side sheltering under this formidable weaponry was the vessel responsible for the discovery of molot itself the oceanographic survey ship akademik kurchatov her eight heavy masts made her quite distinctive one was in the bow two immediately forard of the bridge another immediately abaft with a mass of heavy gear and aerials others were sited at various points but a triangular gantrytype with a big derrick rigged on heavy cables left no doubt that the akademik kurchatovs work was in the ocean deeps dwarfing the squadron however was a massive squarelooking vessel over thirty thousand tonnes i reckoned with a huge steel gantry running athwartships between an armoured enclosed superstructure over her bow and stern her sloping steel antisplinter upperworks tall lattice mast forard strung with sophisticated search and firing radar antennae twin sam missile launchers and eight mm and mm guns left no doubt that the berezina could defend herself as well as fulfil her purpose which was to act as fleet replenishment unit to the red navy hundreds of men appeared on the superstructure of the berezina when jetwind came in sight group condor shorten sail topsails only it seemed that we were about to join the fleet at anchor i could not fault grohmans handling of jetwind operating the consoles controls was jim yell the bosun who had helped me rescue kay he had obviously been dragooned into the job at pistolpoint he was new to it all thumbs grohmans automatic at his back wasnt a help yells handling was not quick enough for grohman he gave an oath at the bosuns awkwardness waved him aside with the gun barrel and took over the manoeuvre himself jetwind edged past the ice cape four explosions rang out grohman and the other hijackers nerves must have been shot to react so violently both dropped into a firing crouch the shots originated from the ice headland we were passing i saw spurts of ice chips fly our escape plan from molot did not come to mind fully fledged as had jetwinds plan to elude the almirante storni however the sound of the explosions the sight of a small naval pinnace moored at the foot of the iceberg and the formidable array of red seapower riding at anchor in the stormy uncertain light were the ingredients of the mix consciously it was a daring impossibility subconsciously my mind began to freewheel in retrospect i was not aware of my thought processes all i noted at the time was a small group of men in heavy clothing emerging from a tent on the summit of trolltunga and making for the site of the explosions thats quite a heros welcome for you i told grohman derisively he straightened up truculently i cant be too careful they must be testing something up there landajo the radio operator appeared on the bridge and spoke excitedly to grohman grohman spoke into the shiptoship radio microphone i presume he used russian he conversed haltingly and finally nodded up helm back the fore and main stand by to let go the anchor he ordered i made a quick check of wind sea and the nature of the mooring in case i was returned to immediate captivity the wind had more south than southwest in it this meant it was blowing almost straight into the molot entrance jetwind had not penetrated far enough into the holding ground to get the full benefit of a lee from the ice cape situated to port however the fleet anchorage protected by the bulk of trolltunga was snug enough the ice made a huge semicircular arc forming an embayment the place was shallow as grohman had outlined the secret of the jellied fuel dump jetwind lay about three kilometres from the fleet banks of fog into which the warships merged and reappeared drifted across my line of vision the eastern flank of molot the side away from trolltunga was obviously the clearway to the open sea for at least half a dozen kilometres i could make out small stranded buoys during the momentary fog clearances they provided natural markers through the shoals like channel buoys let go the anchor cable roared out senorita grohmans eyes were hard you will come with me he addressed me you and tideman will stay here i have ordered that if you make any attempt to interfere with the controls you will be shot is that clear peter kay appealed desperately to me it was blind rage and love and i lunged at grohman maybe hed been expecting this the blast from the automatic seemed to go off in my face i felt the cordite grains sear my left cheek i spun round stunned caught a glimpse of a finned barrel clubbing at my head and then everything went black i dont know for how long i was out when i came round tideman was propping me up i felt as if the whole of jetwinds tophammer had clouted my head the bridge was empty except for grohmans stooge with his finger on the trigger of his gun kay wheres kay take it easy peter said tideman that was a stupid thing to do youre lucky to be still alive i felt sick and dizzy john where is she tideman hefted me to my feet there he pointed to the fleet the agony in my head was nothing to the sight of jetwinds boat heading towards the akademik kurchatov which was moored nearer jetwind than the rest of the squadron he said quietly i think you should make up your mind to the fact that you wont see kay again i staggered to the starboard wing of the bridge and watched the disappearing boat did she finally give in i asked at last she fought like a wildcat they had to rope her to get her into the boat now i had only a distant sight of her receding into the fog the way to kyyiv the way to hell there are four of them in the boat i remarked yes grohman took another of his gang along the fourth is sir james the mists swirling across my brain resembled those about the fleet like them there were clear patches worth a million dollars grohman has gone for orders from molot command we can only wait and see when he returns another round of small explosions reverberated from trolltunga what the hell are they doing explosion seismology is the name for it grohman said after consulting hq explained tideman a party of red scientists are using small charges to measure acoustically the thickness of trolltunga below the water level i spotted one of the group leaving the pinnace with an armful of fresh charges the idea tugged at the back of my mind how far is that pinnace from jetwind john he eyed me three cables a trifle more maybe five hundred metres about that explosion seismology i turned over the words slowly thoughtfully tideman watched me waiting for an explanation as yet my plan was too nebulous to formulate in words as we stood the sun suddenly broke through the storm clouds the sunset mist swirled and flowed and ebbed like pink foam from a lungshot molot became even more unreal the ice was bluewhite the grey lengths of the warships were tinged with red the colour of their ensigns soon the long antarctic summer night would begin a night which never really got dark the boat with kay vanished behind the akademik kurchatov the subs moving exclaimed tideman his keen eye had spotted the narrowing of the sails angle against the white backdrop of trolltunga shes coming out he added no i replied shes heading for the fleet replenisher the sub edged towards her big sister which warship housed the faceless molot command the sub neared the berezina the gantry look exclaimed tideman my muzziness was passing i could focus again the cut from grohmans blow was small and did not bleed much but the bruise felt the size of trolltunga a section of the berezinas prominent athwartships gantry slid out of its housing to reach over the sea like a horizontal crane then cables with massive hooks attached spilled into the water watch said tideman excitedly this is something no westerner has ever witnessed the fleets fuelling theyre bringing up the jellifjed fuel from the undersea dump tens of thousands of hectolitres of jellified fuel each massive container in itself a bomb big enough to sink a ship molot itself the whole anchorage a more gigantic bomb still it only needed a trigger to detonate it and then my plan was born i knew how i would attempt it but it would kill kay that was the thought which lacerated my mind for the nest hour while tideman and i stood viewing the fleet begin its refuelling operation the soundless process was punctuated at intervals by the detonation of more seisinic charges from trolltunga the mystic halflight of the antarctic twilight the swirls of mist and cloud the ice skyscrapers brooding over the red fleets secret base in an ocean as remote as the moons sea of storms made the scene as unreal in its own way as the one i had witnessed from albatros progress was much slower than i had anticipated floodlights sprang up aboard the berezina and akademik kurchatov strange reflections flickered off the ice and the bluegrey hulls of the squadron the artificial light added a further dimension of unreality to the macabre scene a mother sickling her brood with dragons blood the time to strike was when the babes were at the fuelling teats tonight but kay what about kay i jumped off my stool in agitation by now i had largely shaken off the effects of grohmans blow the sentry followed my movements with his automatic cool it peter warned tideman in a low voice dont attempt anything again he broke off staring at the warships what is it john jetwinds boat its coming back there are several more men in the boat than grohman left with added tideman the craft sheered off its course and made for the scientists pinnace at the foot of trolltunga then one of grohmans crew made his way laboriously up to the tent party above it seemed to take an excruciating time for him to reach the summit finally he returned to the boat theyre coming our way it looks as if kay and hathaway are coming back exclaimed tideman the boat finally tied up alongside jetwind now i could go ahead with kay back i would set match to fuse of my plan the moment grohman stepped on jetwinds deck kay climbed aboard under guard her progress to the bridge along the maindeck took a light year to my impatient senses then she was with me when a person walks in from the dead words are not enough grohman had no need to guard us at that moment i did not even notice him i came to earth when he ordered abruptly take them away lock them up he snapped something further in spanish at the sentry who had a halfsmoked cigarillo between his lips the man sullenly ground out the smoke with his foot grohman addressed us no smoking even at this distance from the fuel orders from command one spark and up would go the ships is that clear too clear grohman it is the heart of my plan he added molot command has even stopped the scientists firing their charges during the operation because of the risk the ships are taking their time about it i remarked just you hope for the sake of your skins that it goes on for long was his comeback make no mistake youre not coming along with group condor he cradled the gun and spoke briefly to the guard you couldnt call it a smile which crossed his face he went on if the english capitalist has his ransom paid it will be a condition of his release that he keeps his mouth shut we have seen the operation tideman and i i pointed out his reply sent my stomach nerves into a spasm dead men tell no tales the rest of jetwinds crew will be given the option of cooperating with us and keeping their mouths shut or else you two have got till the fleet has finished refuelling how long is that why shouldnt you know he asked cynically operation molot has been advanced the squadron sails tomorrow morning after the stir over jetwinds disappearance command considers it unwise to delay the fleet dares not risk detection there is still the possibility of a chance interception the attack must and will come like a bolt from the blue if there is local resistance the almirante storni will support group condor in crushing it kay took a step towards grohman you can shoot me along with peter and john she blazed id rather die than play along with terrorists who are planning to murder innocent civilians and seize their homes grohman said speculatively i believe you mean what you say senorita you can do what you wish i will not cooperate you are a fool senorita retorted grohman do not love a man like this let him go there are plenty more men you can save your life have a good life even at kyyiv thats my business kay answered hotly take them away he snapped then he added something in spanish to the guard there was no mistaking the threat in his voice nor the way it cowed the man he repeated it in english for our benefit i have warned him that if any one of you attempts any funny business he will be shot tomorrow with you chapter this is my plan kay tideman and i were back again in the sickbay i waited only long enough for the guard to settle behind the glass partition before sitting the others down at the table the pretence of playing cards was agonizing guillotine victims did it with more aplomb but they had no hope of escape we are going to escape i added tonight kays fan of cards trembled even tidemans iron control cracked how he demanded for pitys sake how it is tonight or never i answered our one big chance our only chance is while the fleet is occupied fuelling peter kay started to remonstrate try to remember you are supposed to be playing cards i reminded her you know what to expect if that gorilla out there suspects us its his neck as well as ours i intend it to be his go on said tideman quietly i made a pretence of trumping a card i intend to blow up the fleet tidemans incredulity backed by the authority of a naval officer was shattering kay broke the ensuing silence her tone said everything i have never seen so many guns or so many men as there are in the squadron group condor alone must number five or six hundred peter what you propose is totally and wholly impossible even if you werent imprisoned added tideman i tried to muster my words calmly despite my excitement soon every ship will be engaged in refuelling i said the fleet will figuratively speaking have its pants down never will it be more vulnerable the ships will be surrounded by tens of thousands of hectolitres of highly explosive jellified fuel molot command itself is nervous no smoking even here aboard jetwind kilometres away no seismic explosions allowed on trolltunga either whats in your mind peter asked tideman molot anchorage is one gigantic readytodetonate bomb one match would do it you could escape that way if you had a kamikaze deathwish but youd go up in smoke too answered tideman nevertheless i thought i detected slightly less scepticism aboard the pinnace is the scientists supply of explosive charges i went on i intend seizing the pinnace i will set the charges on a time fuse i will direct the boat at the fleet the charges will blow up will go the fuel up will go the fleet j am not going to stand by and watch you commit suicide protested kay i smiled despite my tension the pinnace will be unmanned i will aim her at the fleet by locking the tiller a bullseye isnt called for a target that size is too big to miss a flash anywhere near the fuel container will do the trick its a good idea peter said tideman but it remains only an idea there are far too many practical steps inbetween that it doesnt take account of the principle is excellent your logistics are nonexistent what steps i guessed what was coming let us assume for the sake of argument that somehow you managed to escape from the sickbay past a guard with an automatic weapon past another similarly armed on the bridge past grohman himself kay added grohman brought two extra men back with him from the fleet to reinforce those aboard jetwind that makes six guards plus himself youve got to get from jetwind to the pinnace how tideman resumed by boat their automatics would cut you and the boat in half before you got clear of the ship also the pinnace is within range of the ak rifles the new guards have they have the power even if the uzis dont forget it peter i wasnt thinking of using a boat and besides they wouldnt dare shoot because of the danger of an explosion please peter this is just talking kay said agitatedly its simply killing time listen to johns advice forget it i went on i need you two to win control of the bridge for as long as it will take me to climb up to jetwinds topgallant masts well work out the precise time then i addressed tideman want you to fire the chicken button on the bridge and blast away number two topgallant mast directly overhead ring charges the ultimate emergency he exclaimed thats it i replied the ultimate emergency those charges are meant to blow away jetwinds tophamper if ever she went over on her beamends in a storm i intend using them for another type of emergency kay looked horrified and you where will you be peter inside the crows nest above the site of the charges the detonations will project the mast and me clear of the ship the same principle as a pilots ejector seat the way the ships head is lying at present and the direction of the wind will pitch the mast towards the pinnace the mast is hollow so itll float for a while ill reach the pinnace from it you know my plan from that point onwards youll be killed protested kay the blast inside the confined space will kill you selfdestruct charges like that are precisely calibrated to do their job and their job only i answered in this case its to chop off the mast at a given point and throw it clear the force of the explosion will be directed outward not inward where i will be the structure of the crows nest in itself will be an additional protection this is plain crazy went on kay i wont let you do it peter no experiments were ever carried out to establish how far the masts would be thrown by the ring charges its designed purely as a lastthrow emergency ill have to take the risk kay id like to hear what else you have in mind peter said tideman speculatively before you do so however you might remember something else the sea temperature especially close to trolltunga is close to freezing point you wont survive for more than a couple of minutes in it after the mast blastoff even if the rest of your plan succeeds deal another round of cards i told him dont either of you look up in surprise when i speak the next step in my scheme is probably the most crucial of all its the way i aim to break out of the sickbay kay gathered up the cards like a sleepwalker tideman dealt in the sickbay theres that antiexposure survival suit for inspecting jetwinds drop keels and underwater propeller nacelle we moved it into the cubicle next to kays its hanging there still thats what i intend to wear to overcome the problem of the nearfreezing water tideman gave a silent whistle through his teeth you half convince me man the antiexposure visor will protect my face and eyes against flash from the ring charges i continued the suit is foamlined which will help give me a soft landing when the mast hits the water ill swim from the floating mast to the pinnace fuse the charges and send the boat on its way to the fleet then i can swim back to jetwind in safety its not far it might just work peter it just could work tidemans sceptical questioning had changed to a vibrant excited undertone we must be careful not to betray ourselves to the guard by any action or gesture i warned hes the joker in the pack there was a nearsob in kays voice we cant get past him we can i said this is how again the survival suit is the key ive often accompanied you to your cubicle kay the guard is accustomed to it now as soon as weve finished this discussion you and i will go there john will stay here pretending to be listening to the radio theres only a curtain between your cubicle and the empty one we slip next door you help me into the survival suit it takes less than a minute you said john back you go into your cubicle kay then after a while you join john at the radio ill be missing after a time the guard is certain to wonder about me you can leave your cubicles outer curtain drawn so he can see for himself that im not there the idea is to draw him into the sickbay where will you be all this time asked kay in an anguished tone where the survival suit always hangs up against number two cubicle wall i said arms outstretched just like a suit on a hanger the guard will see your face he must protested kay no before you leave you will pull the helmet right down over the visor which normally leaves only the nose and eyes visible it will restrict my range of vision but i cant help that in addition ill hang my head the rest of the suit is so shapeless that the guard wont suspect that its occupied then tideman demanded ill want your sliderule dagger i said as matter of factly as a man can when thinking of a sudden knifethrust to an unsuspecting victims heart the suit is unwieldy so ill have only one chance to finish the guard in the cubicle after that its up to you to grab his automatic and cope with him further if necessary any chance shots will bring the rest of the gang at the double said tideman action must be silent at that stage kay shuddered and glanced involuntarily at the sentry he was staring the other way probably yearning for a smoke i wont be able to move fast in the survival suit i continued john youve got to take the bridge guard by surprise you must keep control while i get up aloft to the topgallant mast this is not going to work said kay emphatically youre both assuming that the bridge is the only place which is occupied by the gang with the reinforcements grohman brought there are now three group condors in the stern keeping watch over the crew theres another in the engine room then theres grohman himself where will he be as soon as shooting starts on the bridge the gang will converge on it john against how many he wont stand a chance i had earlier realized the discrepancy of forces involved i had rather pushed the risk to one side when thinking through the logistics and splitsecond timing of the operation thats part of the risk i started but she stopped me the odds are too long for success what do you suggest i asked ill give you a more sporting chance you kay i want to rush the bridge with john i was about to protest but tideman interjected i agree while john is accounting for the guard ill make for the hydraulics control panel kay i said impatiently the hydraulics can come later kays eyes were bright she went on lets run over the position of various members of the gang three in the stern one in the engine room another on the bridge and finally our sickbay guard grohman could be anywhere but lets assume he will be in your cabin peter when our attack goes in at the slightest sound of trouble hell be out like a rocket plus uzi i remarked i intended stopping all of them from getting into orbit like a rocket or anything else she said whats in your mind demanded tideman incredulously jetwind is practically unsinkable she replied she has the most elaborate system of watertight bulkheads in case of damage bridge stern engine room the accommodation the hull the hulls in no danger i exclaimed the captains and officers quarters can be isolated in an emergency she went on your soundproof cabin doors double as bulkheads as you know all emergency doors are held open magnetically until they are released by a master switch on the bridge one touch and the whole ship can be sealed off she emphasized her words sealed off equally sealed in the gang can be effectively sealed in good girl tideman exclaimed excitedly heavens what a brainwave kay i said youre wonderful youve levelled the odds in our favour were going to make this operation work it will i hope catch everyone offbalance well play the detail by ear as we go so far so good said tideman lets assume were in command of the ship and your part of the plan is working youve aimed the pinnace loaded with the fusedup charges at the fleet what next your job john is to have jetwind poised to hightail the moment i get back aboard cut the anchor free if necessary manoeuvre ready to take off youll have the time while im making my way back from trolltunga a lot depends on how fast the pinnace travels said tideman if our own craft of the same type are any criterion it will cruise at something like seven or eight knots which means in turn it will tkke roughly fifteen minutes to reach the red ships once i start to move jetwind the fleet is sure to spot her we know grohman has orders not to move theyll suspect the hijack has misfired the reds are triggerhappy a couple of mm shells from the sposobny or a missile will put paid to jetwind the fleet has castrated itself already i answered no ship dare fire the flash would detonate the fuel in the same way that the pinnace will tideman riffled the cards in his excitement and repeated my words were going to make this operation work i want jetwind pointing northeast when i get back aboard from the pinnace i went on shes lying roughly facing south now head to wind northeast echoed tideman past the fleet what will be happening to it at that stage its too risky peter rather head south altogether clear of molot we dont know the location of molots shoals remember the stranded icebergs will guide us they mark the main exit channel to the open sea but objected tideman its a waste of time to attempt to beat the wind i went on if it holds as it is now jetwind will enjoy her best point of sailing the way i aim to go why the hurry demanded tideman the fleet wont be able to chase us if everything goes according to plan there is need for hurry i said what do you mean tomorrow jetwind has an appointment with seascan you still intend to keep the rendezvous id overlooked that tideman exclaimed in amazement of course then jetwind has another appointment at gough with thomsens party of shipping tycoons with any luck ill keep both tideman forgot himself as far as to throw down his cards and stare at me youre a devil for punishment peter kay asked quietly when do we start all three of us had now put down our cards the guard still lolled aimlessly the uzi sinister and black lay on the table only as far as his reach now i replied give me the dagger john chapter i do not clearly remember tideman palming me the lethal sliderule from his pocket or my leaving the sickbay the nervestretched takeoff to the operation produced a kind of amnesic blank in my mind i surfaced in kays cubicle with her lips and her body against mine she was shaking with emotion like a loose backstay in a gale darling my darling she whispered i cant let you i wont let you this is plain suicide youre not even seeing me youre so preoccupied i love you i want you im going to lose you i kissed her tried to soothe her even kamikazes have their moment of glory my darling her mouth sought mine it was salty with tears theres no glory in a burst from an automatic she sobbed whats the alternative i asked being led like sheep to the slaughter her head fell on my chest what chance did our love get she asked brokenly a week a fall overboard being imprisoned together with this awful shadow hanging over us and now i kissed her fair hair and combed it back past her ears with my thumbs there was no time my darling either then or now a final convulsive sob shook her body then she took control of herself she eased me away from her dont kiss me goodbye she said her head turned aside i cant handle it and it is goodbye i said nothing already part of my mind was focused on the guard the survival suit hung like a crucified monster on its hanger it had big ungainly boots which were integral with the legs the suit came in one size only and it was made of a substance called foam neoprene the latest in survival gear tideman had told me that the manufacturer claimed one could get into the suit in half a minute key feature of the outfit was a sealing zipper which had been developed for the united states space programme silently i handed kay the dagger indicating that she should not meddle with the blade release the suit certainly bore out the makers claims with kays assistance i was into it in what seemed seconds almost immediately the insulation made me sweat perhaps fear of being surprised by the guard also had something to do with it the visor and cap came last by pulling the cap forward and tilting my head my face was hidden in that position however i could see nothing of anyone above waistlevel finally kay clasped my fingers round the dagger they were as ungainly as bandaged bananas i wondered whether i would ever be able to trigger the blade release my success depended on one lightningquick stroke before the guard suspected the suit had an occupant if i fumbled even for a second i was done then kay was gone i maintained the hanger pose slumped head down arms out time ceased to pass my sole clock to mark the passage of the minutes or was it hours was the drip of my sweat the suit became a sauna i could not hear because of the waterproof cap i dared not raise my head in case the next moment found the guard there the next moment he was my sight of him was like a cutoff television camera shot a trigger hand a finned barrel a pair of legs a firing crouch the muzzle held steadied on the suit on me i waited for the shot a blob of sweat chased itself inside my neck down my chest past my stomach i felt every millimetre of its progress no shot the guards torso swung away feet followed his boots were a boxers anklehugging type now my fingers inside the glove were slippery with sweat i flexed them for the stroke the guards toes swivelled a boxer dodging a knockdown punch couldnt have matched their speed they pointed straight at me had the gunman heard had he seen i froze if that was the word in a bath of sweat maybe he had caught animallike some vibration of my rolling tension perhaps he even smelt my fear i kept my head low my eyes unsighted slowly slowly i watched his knees ease their tension slowly slowly that ontarget barrel shifted away from my guts i did not know how long i could keep every muscle tight as a fencewire without one making an involuntary giveaway ripple sweat cascaded down my knifefingers the guards toes pivoted ninety degrees his back was towards me now perhaps the switchblade gave a click on release perhaps my body movements beat it by a millisecond or perhaps he only sensed rather than heard anything whatever it was he was already turning left shoulder following the uzi round when i lurched at him there wasnt time for the orthodox overhand dagger thrust the clumsy suit would not have allowed it it was a low savage upandunder to the heart the jar up my arm could have been a glance off the uzis breech or the bone armour of his ribcage i fell on him enveloped him a crude parody of a rugby smothertackle my knife hand skewered him if he screamed or uttered any sound i did not hear it we cannoned off a partition wall pitched into the main sickbay carrying the curtain with us i had a momentary sight of the uzi being snatched up by another hand tidemans the guard and i lay facetoface i on top i was grateful for my visor the mans mouth was contorted telltale pink sprayed from it blurring the perspex he gave a final convulsion and was still it was kay with shaking hands who freed my cap tideman knelt a pace away with the automatics barrel trained on the guards head there was no need he was dead quick i rapped out the bridge both of you there was no direct access to the bridge from the sickbay the wheelhouse radio office chartroom and pilot office were all situated on the floor above us the route from sickbay to bridge was along a corridor running athwartships flanked by officers cabins at the far end was the captains suite there were twin upward companionways one to port the other to starboard these ladders debouched from our level into a central well immediately abaft the wheelhouse itself this well was bisected by no mast which i now intended to climb via the servicing door which kay and i had used during our first ascent the whole of this well area could be isolated in an emergency by means of watertight bulkheads in short the central well was the junction of all routes to the bridge tideman and kay started to the sickbay door john i said in ten minutes no sooner no later you will blow the mast charges is that understood aye replied tideman whatever good luck the two sprinted off i ballooned along the corridor in their wake i felt like a grotesque carnival figure that is where the resemblance to fun ended the knife was bloodied to the hilt i lost tideman and kay at the first ladder to the mastwell i negotiated it with the nimbleness of a baby elephant i found myself in the well itself the mast towered in front of me like a burnished liftshaft the access door was shut it had a type of fancy quickrelease presscatch my banana fingers fluffed it i shifted hands with the dagger tried again i felt it yield open sound poured down from the floor above a burst of automatic fire then shorter staccato the mast was relaying the sound of the bridge action one two single shots the uzi seemed to appear from the direction of the captains suite before the man a seeking black muzzle the unmistakable heavy finning a hand on the trigger grohman why didnt he blast me i shall never know he could not have missed at less than four metres i think it must have been the sight of the ludicrous apparition which froze his finger or perhaps it was the sight of that bloody dagger in that moment of arrested time i realized that kay had failed in her part she had not reached the hydraulics console in time to throw the vital bulkheads switch which would have caged grohman and the other group condors those last isolated rattattats from above could have been her epitaph my savage despair at the attacks misfire gave me the courage to stand there facing my killer for a splitsecond long enough to ensure that he would come up the mast after me i slammed the door shut a sirenlike whoop reverberated everywhere emergency alarm kay had managed the bulkhead switch but it was too late grohman had escaped the trap i fumbled with the lock of the mast door against it from outside came a savage battering it wasnt done by hand it was a magazine full of mm shells the emergency siren told me that my part of the plan was still on i had to get aloft climb with feet like snowshoes a suit the size of a hangover and mittened hands could scarcely feel through the visor and cap i left loose against the nape of my neck it would only take a second to zip them into place when the mast blasted off i couldnt climb with my weapon hand encumbered so i put the dagger between my teeth and hefted my leg on to the first rung the confined space rang with two or three concussions grohman was trying to shoot open the lock carefully aiming individual shots i levered myself up the ladder the going was tougher than i had expected until i managed the rhythm of lifting the feet and understanding their nonfeel against the rungs i was certain grohman would pick me off before i reached the level of the lower mainyard all he would have to do once he had blasted open the door was to fire straight upwards i presented the perfect target against groups of lights fitted for servicing purposes at the juncture of each yard with the mast the first group was at the lower mainyard i had to reach them before grohman broke in the door i fought my way up there was another rattle of shots from below heavy slugs began to tear through the door and were banging about at the foot of the ladder grohman wasnt inside yet the group of four naked electric bulbs was close i threw myself up at them one foot slipped and i hung on by my right hand the mast door crashed open i glanced down grohman brought the uzi to his shoulder i was clambering directly above him like a bird waiting to be picked off a branch it is difficult to fire straight overhead my position allowed him no angle however slight he would either have to lean completely backwards or lie on his back to aim in that brief interval while he gathered his aim i made the remaining rungs to the lights i swiped madly with my heavy paw there was a crash of breaking glass a blinding flash of shortcircuiting electrics then everything went dark a general failsafe switch tripped out the rest of the overhead lights inside the mast i hurled myself up fumbling slipping panting there was an earripping jangle of sound the blackness below was polkadotted with red malice the interior of the mast seemed full of ricocheting bullets grohman was firing wild he was hoping that the lethal spray would somehow find its target but the shots were all landing below me he wasnt getting his angle of fire the shattering sound cut off i guessed the magazine was empty after that prolonged burst to change it would give me a few precious moments up up jetwinds yards were spaced at five equal intervals of ten and a half metres up the mast the mast itself towered fiftythree metres above the deck i had now covered the first ten and a half metres the mast was divided into three sections the lower mast the topmast and the topgallant it was this latter which contained the ring charges at its juncture with the topmast thirtyfour and a half metres above deck the interior profile of the mast was elliptical and diminished progressively the higher one went at the point where each of the six yardarms joined the mast there was a servicing compartment apart from a maze of pipes and valves the main feature of these compartments was a pair of massive vertical rollers each ten and a half metres in length on which the sails were rolled in along tracks like a giant roller blind the bottom compartment whose lights i had just smashed was the largest it measured about two and threequarter metres long and was about half that broad a steel catwalk extending from the main ladder enabled technicians to stand and work i hesitated for a moment on this catwalk its open grille provided no protection against a volley from underneath there was a metallic clinking from below what was grohman up to he hadnt fired off the uzis full forty rounds there was another snap and clink then unmistakable the clack of a magazine being rammed home i knew enough about the uzi to realize that the big fortyrounder was too heavy to climb with he had substituted for it a smaller twentyfive rounder that still didnt account for all the delay another series of clicks reached me he was probably unhitching the skeleton butt converting the weapon into a compact manoeuvrable automatic pistol he was taking his time he was very sure of me pinned without hope of escape inside an evernarrowing field of fire i could see faint antarctic nightlight filtering in through the chinks through which the sails rolled and unrolled urgently i looked for some weapon from the heel of each roller projected what looked like an oldfashioned car crank id seen these before manual backup cranks in case the powerdriven mechanism failed by which the sails were furled i wrenched it from its socket and peered down below was darkness i could not see grohmans position but i heard faint movements i dropped the heavy bar and leapt upward again there was a thud and a savage oath for an answer a shot whanged and whined from side to side inside the mast the initial impact of the slug was much too close for comfort i deduced from this that grohman could now raise the automatic to a deadlier elevation i hadnt gone more than a couple of metres when the thought crashed home on me at the next yardarm bay i would have to stand and fight it was the last bay before the juncture of the topmast and topgallant where the ring charges were sited how much was left of the ten minutes until tideman fired them i hurried upwards grohman hadnt fired again i suspected that he was holding back until he thought i was trapped at the crows nest and the top if i were going to use the dagger i would need elbow room provided just above my head in the catwalk of the next bay i hauled myself on to the next set of steel gratings now my second enemy was the light coming through the gaps between the sail rollers i blocked some of the light by standing back against it but the upper sectionstill emitted a giveaway glow how to fool grohman into believing that i was still climbing perhaps if i pitched another crankhandle but i was afraid that if i moved he would see me against the light while i stood still where i was i was tolerably safe the automatic clanked against the ladder god he was close i even thought i could hear his rapid breathing i felt round desperately my hand touched something metallic that felt like a small dumbbell it must have a function in snugging home the sail into the roller i tried to insinuate myself between the two sail rollers in the same way as according to grohmans lies captain mortensen had died perhaps the dumbbell was the blunt instrument whose mark the london pathologist had detected i tossed the heavy metal thing carefully through the catwalk ladder opening at the same moment i thrust myself back first between the two sailcovered rollers there was a cry an oath a scrabbling of feet and a jangle of gun against rung from the sound of it grohman must have slipped and fallen a few rungs i could plainly hear his rasping breath this time he did not waste ammunition the silence that followed was more guttearing than noise i could picture the man in the darkness steadying up getting a grip on his fury before elevating the uzi into a firing position the gun would have to be held well above his head if he didnt want to blind or maim himself the volley came a cutoff sixrounder it crashed and screamed through the confined space there were also noises high above some slugs must have travelled all the way up to the masthead if i had been on the ladder id have been ripped apart from backside to neck there were more flashes of flame from the muzzle i could almost reach down and touch them i took the knife from between my teeth and got a firm grip of the haft my moment would come as grohman came into the bay at catwalk level there the uzis handiness would be at its most limited the light was dim elusive the grating poised crisscross like a steel trap waiting for grohmans head redpainted stopcock valves glowed danger signals copper hydraulic tubes writhed like disembowelled viscera i waited it wasnt grohmans head that came first i heard a grunt then his right hand clutching the uzi swung up and over on to the catwalk he wasnt much more than a metre from my funkhole my reflexes were swifter than my thinking in a flash i was out i stamped on the uzi pinning the gunhand to the gratings theyd been right in choosing grohman to lead group condor he was tough he could take it that booted foot must have hurt like hell he didnt make the mistake of releasing the weapon instead he used my ankle to lever himself into a fighting position his head and body seemed to explode out of the opening crank and bullwhanger had done more damage than i thought blood was pouring from a long gash across his head with his free hand he swept my other foot from under me i crashed beside him on the gratings he rolled sideways with catlike agility i followed with survivalsuit agility now the gun was under him equally the knife was trapped under my own bulk i pawed at him with a right fist but even a punchdrunk palooka could have dodged the blow grohman jackknifed on to his hunkersthe uzi must have been heavier than i guessed or else my first savage stamp must have damaged his wrist more than i or he thought he hadnt the strength in his right hand alone to raise the barrel fully to aim it wavered wandered offtarget a target bigger than a house the split second more he needed to get his left round to heft up the uzi to fire was too long i threw the knife it stuck out from his adams apple he just knelt there with the uzi raised to blast me with that obscene brass haft projecting from his throat then he pitched forward through the ladder gap i heard the body hit the bottom of the mast and the single shot that went off he must have hung on to the trigger even in death i crouched on the catwalk gulping air i seemed to be swimming inside a suit of sweat my muscles kicked from reaction time the ring charges twentyone metres seventy feet to go i threw myself at the rungs the antiblast cap i stopped jerked cap and visor over my head and face securing the sealing zipper with my outsize fingers seemed to take a year up i was still scrambling feverishly blindly in darkness on the upper masthead side of the topgallant bay heading for the crows nest when the charges blew my first thought from the concussions hammerblow was that i had slipped and fallen the entire length of the mast pilots who eject to safety are heroes circus human cannons have a soft ride compared to mine from jetwind the cap and visor saved my eardreams from blast my eyes from flash and my lungs from compression all i knew was that one moment i was battling upwards and the next i felt a vertebraeripping punch in the back the detonation pinned me like a fly against the steel rungs the detached mast cartwheeled high into the air the water was to be my cushion on splashdown i will never believe it provides cosmonauts with a soft landing the jar when the tube of light alloy hit the sea was certainly almost as bad as takeoff between the two there was a merciful timewarp of oblivion i became aware of water glinting inside the floating mast a circle of light showed at the severed end it was filling fast i knew i had to get out faster before it sank i crept towards the opening on all fours through icy water which deepened at every pace theni was out chapter there was no horizon everything was a neutral white panicked i thought irrationally that i had been blinded by the mast charges then i realized the reason for my whiteout vision ahead and above me towered a skyscraper of ice five hundred metres high i had been catapulted so near trolltunga that i had to turn on my side to get a view of the top i trod water got my bearings the lighted fleet was to my right jetwind at my back ahead was the pinnace perhaps a hundred metres away an easy swim the water was icier than a mortuary slab without the survival suit i would have been gasping my last i started for the pinnace i had gone only a few clumsy dogpaddle strokes towards my objective when a searchlight stabbed out from the sposobny towards jetwind the bulk of the berezina sprang into silhouette in front of the light the searchlight inhibited in range because of the fogginess picked out a splash near jetwinds bows the anchor had gone tideman was wasting no time i almost ceased paddling the sight of the sailsetting was so beautiful an ethereal quintuple bank of white mounted up on jetwinds foremast clean as a swans breast against the bluewhite night sail on four other masts followed not on the ships full number tideman wasnt risking the structure of number two after the ring charges blast then the foreyards went aback tideman was emulating the manoeuvre i had used to spin jetwind round in port stanley like an angry hornets nest coming alive beam after beam leapt out from the fleet spotlighting the lovely fabric of the sailer they had heard the concussion of the ring charges what now i propelled myself towards the pinnace the whole anchorage was ablaze with hostile light i felt sure someone would spot my giveaway splashing my hand grabbed the pinnaces gunnel i yanked my clumsy body aboard and my head came up on the summit of trolltunga a group of men were gesticulating and yelling although i could not hear the sound it wasnt at the searchlights it was at me how long would the fastest of them take to race down the cliff would he have a gun the thought goaded me i crawled on all fours to a locker in the bows i fumbled at the latch i was about as nimble as a whale stranded on a reef i finally managed to open it there it was there was no mistaking the characteristic boxexplosives time fuses were already mounted in the heads of the charges these were about the size of half a brick each fuse setting had a pointer a gnarled rotatable screw and numbers punched at intervals i read fums asxx what the devil did it mean i dragged out the box the trolltunga men were slipping and sliding down the cliff like crosscountry runners i took a blind guess as to how to set the fuses on six charges i set aside on two of them i would set the firing pointer to the first digit on the next two to the second and on the final pair to the third what if i blew myself up i set my teeth turned the first pointer to nothing happened i fused its twin charge rapidly i followed with the other four now i yanked the startingcord of the engine it was an inboard type i prayed that it wasnt too cold it fired first time i unmoored the pinnace and motored clear of the cliff at low throttle jetwind had almost completed her turn and her bows now pointed slightly at an angle to the fleet that was our escape direction northeast i manoeuvred the pinnace to aim at a gap between the berezina and sposobny i hauled the explosives box well into the open to ensure maximum flash effect i stopped in my tracks a boat was being lowered from the enclosed stern section of the berezina i caught the reflection of gun barrels as a party of men jumped from the deck overhang into the boat would the cuttingout party reach jetwind before my firecraft slipped in among the fleet i jammed the pinnaces throttle wide and threw myself into the sea i paddled frantically for jetwind i willed tideman to break out without waiting for me he could not have failed to see the boardingparty as if in response jetwinds after yards also were backed in order to mark time waiting for me i thrashed and flailed onwards then i was against jetwinds side and a rope was in the water beside me i snatched it up snicked the loop under my arms on the rail above jim yell was grinning and gesturing once he was certain i was secure he raised an arm to the bridge that was the signal tideman had been waiting for even before yell had dragged me inboard and freed me of my suit i could feel the sternway come off the ship and the beginning of headway take its place you were great sir yell burst out well lick em yet i ran to the rail without the suit i felt as light as a disembodied ghost wheres their boat it was there all right but it was not coming at jetwind it was heading towards the pinnace i stared in disbelief and anguish i was brought to earth by a muffled tattat from jetwinds stern yell spun on his heel the gang is still fighting it out aft ive got to help i sprinted up a bridge ladder i saw kay first for the eternity of one second our eyes locked neither of us said anything there was no need tideman stood at the control consoles the bloodied mess that had been the bridge guard lay in one corner course as ordered peter same route tideman asked without any show of agitation aye get the sails on the damaged mast also think it will take it we need all the speed we can get youve seen the boat party i have theyve sheered away from the pinnace theyre coming this way exclaimed kay i guessed what had happened when the boarding party had got close enough and seen the pinnace unmanned they had decided on jetwind as their primary target they knew as we knew that with all the fuel about they dared not risk a long shot oh jesus i was accustomed to tideman never raising his voice under almost any provocation his breathed imprecation was as shattering as a closeup burst of automatic fire look he exclaimed look at the sub the bluehull with its bluemauve sail was swinging at its mooring near the destroyer its snout was turning deliberately menacingly slowly pointing towards jetwind shes going to fire she cant risk it compressed air has no flash tideman replied torpedoes are fired by compressed air it took jetwind twenty to thirty seconds to set sail the damaged number two mast sails were in the process of slotting home the other backed yards were swinging into position to pick up the wind on jetwinds starboard quarter as yet the ship was barely under way with half one mast missing perhaps we accounted for the maximum scheduled time of thirty seconds they were not thirty seconds they were thirty years jetwind seemed to hang the subs nose swung at her round round there was a faint quiver through the hull as the wind gripped the aerofoils was jetwind moving at all there tideman pointed there was a white burst at the subs bows she was chancing a shot in a surfaced position perhaps the torpedomen were overeager perhaps the skipper had miscalculated the running depth in molots shallow waters as it was the silverwhite tube leapt into the air then it plummeted back again in a flurry tideman said unemotionally shooting is tricky when they run shallow like that half my mind noted one fact jetwind was moving the other half seemed paralysed fixated on the torpedos progress give her two points of starboard helm the long gleaming menace leaped clear of the water again it shimmied nosedived that leap gave away its target course it would i saw intercept jetwind a little onwards as she gathered speed what a sub commander could not know was a windjammers power to brake back the foremast all aback tideman threw the toggle switches jetwind stopped as if held by a drag parachute the torpedos trail streaked under jetwinds bows now it headed straight for trolltunga it seemed to flash over the intervening distance i had laboured across in a matter of seconds it detonated against the ice cliff it was not the concussion of a warhead filled with torpex tnt cyclonite and aluminium powder which stunned and raped our sense of hearing it was trolltunga years of drifting years of antarctic weathering attrition years of southern ocean corrosion had shaken the interior architectural structure of the monster iceberg perhaps the final deepdown pummelling on the ironbound tips of molot seamount had also contributed to its inner breakup perhaps that very disintegration had been the reason why the red scientists had been eager to probe its secrets whatever it was the torpedo completed the process it was its coup de grace the warheads explosion was a puny thing compared to what followed trolltunga split rolled buckled fell apart in a thousand fragments each tearing at the other like cannibal killer whales there was a stupendous broadside of sound as the iceberg writhed in its deathagony heaving twisting convulsing ice platforms the size of islands clumping and inverting as if activated by vast unknown sources of energy only the last few kilometres of iceberg were visible to us it was anyones guess what was happening to the main body out of sight in the fog i tore my eyes from the sight the sub the world might be falling apart but that red skipper knew his job his target was jetwind and he meant to get her the submarines bluemauve bows steadied on target this time he did not mean to miss brace those yards quick as i shouted the order i wondered if the sound of my voice was audible to tideman only a metre or two away even as i got out the words i knew it was too late i had halted jetwind she could never gain enough way in time to evade the next shot the cuttingout boat broke clear of the fleet what the torpedo didnt do the boarding party would finish the light of the searchlights was reflecting off their weapons kays fingers bit into my arm look the pinnaces sparkle of orange flame in the heart of the fleet was insignificant compared to the tumultuous spectacle of trolltunga molot exploded one moment there were ships and men living things moving plotting aiming the next they all stood still in death in front of our eyes the world of molot gave a single hideous orgasmic jerk and then stopped like a movie freeze everything pulsed in blinding relief for one explosive moment then the flames reached up into the overcast i had sense enough to remember the danger of jetwinds sail plan being exposed to a whirlwind blast of concussion i scarcely recognized my own voice get the sails off her furl everything the shockwave passed like a wind out of hell it arrived moments before the minor tidal wave trolltunga threw up i thought it would roll the masts out of the ship before i dared risk setting a couple of steadying topgallants the burning fuel on the water drew a merciful curtain of thick black smoke over what was happening to the trapped ships as jetwind edged past the blazing holocaust to the escape route there was a brighter stab from amongst the blackness and we saw catherine wheels of exploding ammunition cartwheeling high into the air jetwinds crew on deck heard screams from the men of group condor from deep inside the flames they told me later but on the enclosed bridge we were shut off from them course noreast i ordered tideman follow the iceberg channel his face was grim and withdrawn he operated the console switches like an automaton kay came and hid her face against my chest she did not speak her dry sobs said everything then the fueloil smut on the bridge windscreen cleared and the wind came clean and fresh jetwind was free chapter captain on the bridge the harsh voice of the intercom rasped through the gathering taking place in the crews dayroom which was situated over the stern the summons was from the substitute radio operator one of tidemans men named greg jim yell had been left temporarily in command on the bridge everyone else who could be spared from their duties was attending the gettogether both kay and tideman were present the selfappointed master of ceremonies was sir james hathaway it was the morning after the molot breakout there was enough flying overcast downhorizon astern to blot out the last traces of the pall of smoke over the secret bass jetwind was making a fair fifteen knots in the racing seas i was pushing her hard carrying everything i could but jetwind wasnt at her best the missing mast which had catapulted me clear had created an imbalance in the sail plan aerodynamics it had also affected the steering she needed watching all the time to prevent a maverick sheer when a biggerthanusual wave boiled under her counter jetwind wasnt at her best nor was i a bitter selfreproaching reaction had set in once jetwind had skated clear of the last of the shoalmarker icebergs and the flaring pyre had dimmed astern to a glowing pink and finally to a sooty blackness indistinguishable from storm wrack the clearingup of grohmans corpse and those of the two guards had been the final straw the rest of the gang had surrendered i could not help thinking eyeing grohmans contorted face that perhaps he had died easily compared to the hundreds of others i had sent to a fiery diabolical end with my own hands in war my action would have been justified but this was peace of a kind those who might have escaped the fire would have been mortified by the ice i could not decide which was worse i i alone was responsible kay tried to talk me out of my mood even her warmth and love were not enough the reality was like coming back to earth after a high i could not share the smiling euphoria of everyone on board i had reminded tideman when he too had come to my rescue that the molot deathorglory breakout might have saved our skins and secured the falklands flank of the drake passage but who would ever know or believe the implications neither argentina nor russia would admit that group condor had ever existed who but grand admiral sergei gorshkov head of the soviet fleet and his staff would be aware of the loss of two warships and two fleet auxiliaries molot had been a victory as secret as the wild wastes where it had taken place my slough of despond bit keenest over seascan i reproached myself for failing to make the rendezvous when the spy satellite would be at nadir overhead to prove beyond all doubt that jetwind was invisible to infrared and microwave surveillance the rendezvous was still an impossible near halfdays sail away at jetwinds maximum speed perhaps the way i was flogging the guts out of the ship now was symptomatic of my sense of failure because i knew in my heart that unless jetwinds protective secret were sealed and delivered by actual observation test there would never be another ship of her kind built no cape horn patrol no commercial fleet either after what he had been through sir james would i felt certain be only too glad never to set eyes on a sailing ship again for these reasons i had stalled off signalling thomsen in detail about the happenings i had merely despatched a cryptic message saying the ship was safe and on her way to gough for the rest how much or how little should i tell him if officialdom got word of jetwinds exploits the questions would become intolerable what too should i do with the bodies of arno brockton grohman and the two guards bury them at sea on the basis that their secrets would remain safe until the sea gave up her dead or continue to convey them to the cape in the sickbay where now they all lay shrouded i dodged the question by telling myself that jetwind could not afford the time to stop for a mass sea burial because by some extreme of luck there was still an outside chance that jetwind might make the seascan rendezvous and while that chance existed i meant to keep her going in my heart however i knew she never would i had been so withdrawn from the general life of the ship that i missed the preparations which must have preceded the ceremony i was now confronted with the fact that it was in the crews dayroom meant that tideman had not organized it less than twenty minutes previously i had been astonished on the bridge to have been handed a written invitation by one of tidemans paratroopers one of the men who had finally disarmed the last of the group condors the invitation read sir james hathaway and the officers and crew of jetwind request your presence without fail at a function in the crews dayroom to be held at sharp i had been more astonished still at the sight which had greeted me on arrival the dayroom was a kind of recreation room above the afterpeak adjoining the crews mess big portholes gave a splendid sight of jetwinds creaming wake beneath them a table had been arranged its centrepiece was robbie lunds old ships bell presiding like a chairman at a board meeting was sir james flanked by kay and tideman there was a burst of applause as i entered it was led by a smiling sir james who came forward and conducted me to a seat next to kay if my mood had not been so black i would have realized that i had never seen her look so lovely perhaps sir james had got to the top because he was something of a showman as well as a businessman he reached for the bell which had been hastily mounted between two wooden blocks and struck it with the clapper at that moment as if on cue the bitchbox came alive captain on the bridge however sir james was not to be put off he gestured me back into my seat as i rose to go this is more important the bridge can do without you for a couple of minutes there was a burst of applause from the men my reaction said the blood is on my hands not yours sir james resumed his showmans attitude gentlemen and kay fenton they were in the mood to laugh and they laughed at his singling out kay there is no need to tell you why we are gathered here but for the record i want to say that all of us yes each one of us owes our being here at all to the superhuman courage and personal effort of captain rainier that means in fact our lives i couldnt handle it i wanted to excuse myself get away from the grins and acclaim sir james silenced his audience with another stroke on the bell this bell hung for many years on a windjammer wreck near cape horn he said it is a relic of the days of sail when cape horn was one of the great ocean routes of theworld from the time it ceased to be until jetwind took the water the sailing ship was a thing of the past i speculated what might be coming you all know that this voyage was to have been the acid test of whether the sailing ship was to make a comeback in the twentieth century whether it could become a viable economic proposition when bunker fuel has made powership operation a highly questionable one sir james wasnt the man to lose his captive audience in their adulatory mood by giving them a lecture on ship economics he turned to me i and this audience have had no time to arrange a formal presentation but we ask you to place this old cape horn bell in a place of honour in jetwind as a token of our admiration and a symbol of the reopening of the oncegreat ocean route neither i nor anyone else fathomed his meaning he was aware of it but he was as i have said a showman he waited long enough to let our puzzlement take root then he drew a sheet of paper from his pocket he addressed me his eyes were sparkling by contrast with the formality of his words captain rainier i wish to request official permission to have this signal transmitted before i could respond he went on it is addressed to my shipowner colleagues aboard the agulhas i qjuote the contents propose immediate formation fiftymillion dollar consortium for construction fleet of aerodynamic sailing ships based on design and peformance factors jetwind i personally am satisfied i couldnt believe my ears i found myself on my feet sir james was pumphandling me kay and tideman led the congratulatory queue the bitchbox cut in imperatively i was startled out of the mood of the ceremony by the note in the operators voice captain on the bridge sir urgent radar sighting plane fortyfive miles bearing red zerozeronine degrees coming up fast heading our way sir it was there all right there was no mistaking the decisive blip on the big decca radar screen when tideman kay and i reached the bridge at the double what do you make of it i asked greg shes big and shes stuffed with electronic gear how do you deduce that she started transmitting like the clappers a minute back he replied she must have picked us up on her radar radar tideman interjected greg laughed deprecatingly id say a lot of other sophisticated gadgets as well what is she signalling i demanded cant say sir code all i know is that that sort of sending isnt commercial i asked tideman calling up the other dogs for the kill do you think greg asked tideman is there anything to suggest that the plane is in contact with a ship nearby a warship i added the faint green of the screen with its revolving rangefinder washed across gregs face he concentrated a while and then said shes changing course a little sheering off sniffing the bait i asked tideman again kay said quietly i thought wed finished with all that greg manipulated his instruments theres another transmitter coming in range he listened carefully again before answering its coming a long way thats for sure thats all i can tell its in code too whats the planes range now i asked he checked against the calibrations twentythree nautical miles i had a sudden thought can you establish the altitude low very low under a hundred metres i dont like it peter tideman said if it were a longrange search plane looking for us it wouldnt cruise at such a low altitude because itd be guzzling fuel it would stay high until it picked up a surface contact and only then descend unless it comes from a carrier perhaps thats where the code answer is coming from kay formulated the fears which were in both our minds perhaps its a plane looking for for group condor and the red squadron it cant be that i replied the plane would know the exact location of molot and wouldnt need to search i spoke to greg whats the direction of approach of the aircraft northnortheast sir the adrenalin which had seeped out of me after the molot debacle was back in my veins maybe jetwind hadnt won after all the screen with its regular blip exercised a kind of hypnotic effect the four of us went silent the target came closer closer at twelve miles it hesitated moved sideways the hunter sniffing the trap further who was the hunter greg broke the silence she sees us for sure visually surely not i mean by means of whatever fancy equipment shes using shes casing us twelve miles thats beyond immediate seatoair missile range murmured tideman shes playing it very carefully any way of contacting the plane i asked greg if she speaks ive got all the taps ready open silence again washed through the radar office on a background wing of electricity then i was startled by a voice it was so loud it seemed right at my elbow this is a t orion of the united states tracking and control group speaking identify yourself immediately use this wavelength i warn you not to try any tricks i activated the uhf microphone we used for shiptoship conversations sailing ship jetwind captain rainier speaking rainier well ill be goddamned to hell the voice lost some of its suspicious offhand note youre rainier the guy whos been giving us the runaround all over the southern ocean are you from naval securities group activities the pilot clammed up what do you know about nsga paul brockton was my friend there was a short silence then the pilot answered in a different friendly voice mine too yeah this ships from nsga put paul on the line will you hes aboard but hes dead paul dead i killed the man who killed him if that helps it doesnt paul was a regular guy i was still too raw over pauls death and the other killings to want to talk about them instead there were a hundred questions unanswered about the presence of the american longdistance maritime search plane what are you doing in these waters he replied tersely with one word jetwind half the world wants to know whats happened to you so does the other half the boys behind the scenes what do you mean if you were pauls friend i guess he told you something that bridged a lot of conversational gaps i get you i replied but i dont understand why you should come searching here a position signal was sent off from jetwind days back saying she was dismasted and in no need of assistance there was a snort of derision from the pilot you cant dipsydoodle nsga with a decoy signal fellah we werent born yesterday the group on tristan was on full alert so paul had got enough of his secret signal away to sound the alarm before grohmans burst had killed him that kind of halfmayday didnt decieve us whoever sent it was a fool the transmission time was long enough for us to get a position fix when we compared that with where jetwind claimed to be we smelt stinking fish to nsga the stink was to high heaven it wasnt you who sent that corny signal i guess no it wasnt me but why the timelag why didnt the orion come sooner you could have saved a lot of lives lives he echoed lives i repeated that part of the story will keep for the present why didnt you come the logistics for mounting a search take time so do the decisions nsga had to be convinced it took a few days to arrange after jetwind failed to respond to our signals youre also a helluva long way from anywhere this plane has been airborne since yesterday ive flown all the way down the big pond thousands of miles from lajes in the azores you were pauls friend so i can tell you secrets yes from lajes refuelled ascension they had to send an aenal tanker ahead specially to have the gas waiting for me maximum load tacdifips missions translate please temporary active duty in a flying status involving operational flights operational the pilots reply was terse this flight is operational fellah im armed with every sort of goodie in case of trouble im coming in now for a visual intercept i also want to see you im changing over to the bridge mike ill let you know when i sight you okay come i told kay and tideman we went to the bridge i opened a window in front of the wheel and took the microphone from its hook theres the plane exclaimed kay visibility was medium kay spotted the t emerging from a cloud to the northeast i imagined it approached watchfully as if the pilot still did not wholly credit jetwinds bona fides i recalled his remark about the punch of goodies the orion packed the wires in behindthescenes secret counsels must have burned over jetwinds disappearance the pilot exclaimed suddenly i see you say youre beautiful jetwind dont touch me or ill scream i liked the way the pilot laughed then he added says youre also damaged youre missing part of a mast i was in a fight when paul was killed no later what i tell you about it id like to be on the record can you tape this conversation the pilot laughed without humour this flights operational top secret everything youve said already is on the reel youre important tristan as monitoring us as a backup now tell me about your blowoff blowoff that fight i couldnt think where i should begin i tried to muster the facts i said marking time i have five dead men aboard the pilots voice held admiration who else was on your shit list fellah a soviet kashinclass destroyer a whiskey bag sub a fleet replenishment vessel an oceanographic survey ship an assault force of about five hundred men named group condor i gave him a brief rundown on molot i went back to jetwinds hijacking and the plan to seize the falklands i sketched pauls death and how we had escaped the almirante storni i explained how i had sacrificed jetwinds mast when i had finished the pilot exclaimed in an awed voice sweet mother of jesus all this and molot too dosvidanya whats that supposed to mean its russian for goodbye dosvidanyal it was as good an epitaph as any for that blazing hell of burning liquifying fuel which had been molot there was a silence then the pilot said got a fix for this place molot where you played clinker boy id better go check and see if theres anything left aye here it is i had made a special point of fixing the location of the secret base by means of jetwinds satellite navigator as the ship had broken clear of the last of the shoals i dont expect youll see much though the fire must have burned itself out by now the pilots voice cut me short with a shout sub sub sub sub action stations i froze kay shrank against me dear heaven no not now not after what weve been through tideman leapt as if galvanized to the bridge windows searching the surrounding sea the pilots voice rose shes surfacing alongside you to starboard im going in after her tidemans sight was phenomenal there she is he seemed to point grab the mike from me and snap on its energizer button all in one motion hold it orion holdit that subs british there was nothing to show that there was a submarine running parallel with jetwind let alone identifying marks look flying antenna only the british superbs have it hold it i say roared tideman into the mikenow i saw two high swells chased each other in their trough for one brief second i spotted the top of a black sail periscope extended rust showed redly against the black paintwork had been stripped by abrasive speed in the abysmal deeps of the drake passage this was one of the lean musclemen of the nuclear age had the seascan rendezvous come off jetwind equally lean in her own way but with the priceless attribute of silence would have become her killer the orion was wheeling like an eagle ready to swoop shes signalling exclaimed the pilot codes okay shes kosher whaddyer know kay snapped tideman fetch greg quick light signal kay sprinted off light signal i echoed a light signal from a nuclear sub aye its rarely used only then for top secret subtoship exchanges when the coast is clear no chance of interception orion the subs putting out a light signal yes i said a light signal ill keep you informed he rounded on greg who had arrived with kay read it greg a bright eye of light winked from the periscope tip from among the grey waves admiralty to rainier jetwind top secret seascan rendezvous was at gmt was i interrupted was youve got it wrong man the rendezvous is only this afternoon get a repeat greg blinked his handlamp at the sub the sub responded quick as automatic fire greg mouthed the words signal correct as sent i am ordered to inform you that the seascan intercept took place at gmt this morning results were satisfactory nearly two hours ago i couldnt believe it nor could tideman or kay i managed to say ask the sub why the change of plan greg repeated after the light c owing to the uncertainty following the apparent disappearance of jetwind the united states navy in consultation with the admiralty decided to divert the surveillance satellite slightly from its original track and accordingly advance the rendezvous schedule nadir was at gmt today kay tideman and i stood transfixed theres more coming sir said the signalman no cargohaul life for you jetwind the admiralty directs me to convey its congratulations to the flagship of the cape horn patrol
