peter robinson aftermath book in the inspector banks series to richard and barbara good friends and gracious hosts the evil that men do lives after them william shakespeare julius caesar prologue they locked her in the cage when she started to bleed tom was already there hed been there for three days and had stopped crying now he was still shivering though it was february there was no heat in the cellar and both of them were naked there would be no food either she knew not for a long time not until she got so hungry that she felt as if she were being eaten from the inside it wasnt the first time she had been locked in the cage but this time was different from the others before it had always been because shed done something wrong or hadnt done what they wanted her to do this time it was different it was because of what she had become and she was really scared as soon as they had shut the door at the top of the stairs the darkness wrapped itself around her like fur she could feel it rubbing against her skin the way a cat rubs against your legs she began to shiver more than anything she hated the cage more than the blows more than the humiliations but she wouldnt cry she never cried she didnt know how the smell was terrible they didnt have a toilet to go to only the bucket in the corner which they would only be allowed to empty when they were let out and who knew when that would be but worse even than the smell were the little scratching sounds that started when she had been locked up only a few minutes soon she knew it would come the tickle of sharp little feet across her legs or her stomach if she dared to lie down the first time she had tried to keep moving and making noise all the time to keep them away but in the end she had become exhausted and fallen asleep not caring how many there were or what they did she could tell in the dark by the way they moved and their weight whether they were rats or mice the rats were the worst one had even bitten her once she held tom and tried to comfort him making them both a little warmer if truth be told she could have done with a little comforting herself but there was nobody to comfort her mice scuttled across her feet occasionally she flicked her legs out and heard one squeak as it hit the wall she could hear music from upstairs loud with the bass making the bars of the cage rattle she closed her eyes and tried to find a beautiful retreat deep inside her mind a place where everything was warm and golden and the sea that washed up on the sands was deep blue the water warm and lovely as sunlight when she jumped in but she couldnt find it couldnt find that sandy beach and blue sea that garden full of bright flowers or that cool green forest in summer when she closed her eyes all she could find was darkness shot with red distant mutterings cries and an appalling sense of dread she drifted in and out of sleep becoming oblivious to the mice and rats she didnt know how long shed been there before she heard noises upstairs different noises the music had ended a long time ago and everything was silent apart from the scratching and toms breathing she thought she heard a car pull up outside voices another car then she heard someone walking across the floor upstairs a curse suddenly all hell broke loose upstairs it sounded as if someone was battering at the door with a tree trunk then there was a crunching sound followed by a loud bang as the front door caved in tom was awake now whimpering in her arms she heard shouting and what sounded like dozens of pairs of grownups feet running around upstairs after what seemed like an eternity she heard someone prise open the lock to the cellar door a little light spilled in but not much and there wasnt a bulb down there more voices then came the lances of bright torchlight coming closer so close they hurt her eyes and she had to shield them with her hand then the beam held her and a strange voice cried oh god oh my god maggie forrest wasnt sleeping well so it didnt surprise her when the voices woke her shortly before four oclock one morning in early may even though she had made sure before she went to bed that all the windows in the house were shut fast if it hadnt been the voices it would have been something else a car door slamming as someone set off for an early shift the first train rattling across the bridge the neighbors dog old wood creaking somewhere in the house the fridge clicking on and off a pan or a glass shifting on the draining board or perhaps one of the noises of the night the kind that made her wake in a cold sweat with a thudding heart and gasp for breath as if she were drowning not sleeping the man she called mr bones clicking up and down the hill with his cane the scratching at the front door the tortured child screaming in the distance or a nightmare she was just too jumpy these days she told herself trying to laugh it off but there they were again definitely voices one loud and masculine maggie got out of bed and padded over to the window the street called the hill ran up the northern slope of the broad valley and where maggie lived about halfway up just above the railway bridge the houses on the eastern side of the street stood atop a twentyfoot rise that sloped down to the pavement in a profusion of shrubs and small trees sometimes the undergrowth and foliage seemed so thick she could hardly find her way along the path to the pavement maggies bedroom window looked over the houses on the western side of the hill and beyond a patchwork landscape of housing estates arterial roads warehouses factory chimneys and fields stretching through bradford and halifax all the way to the pennines some days maggie would sit for hours and look at the view thinking about the odd chain of events that had brought her here now though in the predawn light the distant necklaces and clusters of amber streetlights took on a ghostly aspect as if the city werent quite real yet maggie stood at her window and looked across the street she could swear there was a hall light on directly opposite in lucys house and when she heard the voice again she suddenly felt all her premonitions had been true it was terrys voice and he was shouting at lucy she couldnt hear what he was saying then she heard a scream the sound of glass breaking and a thud lucy maggie dragged herself out of her paralysis and with trembling hands she picked up the bedside telephone and dialed probationary police constable janet taylor stood by her patrol car and watched the silver bmw burn shielding her eyes from its glare standing upwind of the foulsmelling smoke her partner pc dennis morrisey stood beside her one or two spectators were peeping out of their bedroom windows but nobody else seemed very interested burning cars werent exactly a novelty on this estate even at four oclock in the morning orange and red flames with deep inner hues of blue and green and occasional tentacles of violet twisted into the darkness sending up palls of thick black smoke even upwind janet could smell the burning rubber and plastic it was giving her a headache and she knew her uniform and her hair would reek of it for days the leading firefighter gary cullen walked over to join them it was dennis he spoke to of course he always did they were mates what do you think joyriders dennis nodded toward the car we checked the number plate stolen from a nice middleclass residential street in heaton moor manchester earlier this evening why here then dunno could be a connection a grudge or something someone giving a little demonstration of his feelings drugs even but thats for the lads upstairs to work out theyre the ones paid to have brains were done for now everything safe under control what if theres a body in the boot dennis laughed itll be welldone by now wont it hang on a minute thats our radio isnt it janet walked over to the car ill get it she said over her shoulder control to threefivefour come in please threefivefour over janet picked up the radio threefivefour to control over domestic dispute reported taking place at number thirtyfive the hill repeat threefive the hill can you respond over christ thought janet a bloody domestic no copper in her right mind liked domestics especially at this time in the morning will do she sighed looking at her watch eta three minutes she called over to dennis who held up his hand and spoke a few more words to gary cullen before responding they were both laughing when dennis returned to the car tell him that joke did you janet asked settling behind the wheel which ones that dennis asked all innocence janet started the car and sped to the main road you know the one about the blonde giving her first blow job i dont know what youre talking about only i heard you telling it to that new pc back at the station the lad who hasnt started shaving yet you ought to give the poor lad a chance to make his own mind up about women den instead of poisoning his mind right off the bat the centrifugal force almost threw them off the road as janet took the roundabout at the top of the hill too fast dennis grasped the dashboard and hung on for dear life jesus christ women drivers its only a joke have you got no sense of humor janet smiled to herself as she slowed and curbcrawled down the hill looking for number anyway im getting sick of this dennis said sick of what my driving that too mostly though its your constant bitching its got so a bloke cant say whats on his mind these days not if hes got a mind like a sewer thats pollution anyway its changing times den and we have to change with them or well end up like the dinosaurs by the way about that mole what mole you know the one on your cheek next to your nose the one with all the hairs growing out of it dennis put his hand up to his cheek what about it id get it seen to quick if i were you it looks cancerous to me ah number thirtyfive here we are she pulled over to the right side of the road and came to a halt a few yards past the house it was a small detached residence built of redbrick and sandstone between a plot of allotments and a row of shops it wasnt much bigger than a cottage with a slate roof lowwalled garden and a modern garage attached at the right at the moment all was quiet theres a light on in the hall janet said shall we have a dekko still fingering his mole dennis sighed and muttered something she took to be assent janet got out of the car first and walked up the path aware of him dragging his feet behind her the garden was overgrown and she had to push twigs and shrubbery aside as she walked a little adrenaline had leaked into her system put her on super alert as it always did with domestics the reason most cops hated them was that you never knew what was going to happen as likely as not youd pull the husband off the wife and then the wife would take his side and start bashing you with a rolling pin janet paused by the door still all quiet apart from denniss stertorous breathing behind her it was too early yet for people to be going to work and most of the late night revelers had passed out by now somewhere in the distance the first birds began to chatter sparrows most likely janet thought mice with wings seeing no doorbell janet knocked on the door no response came from inside she knocked harder the hammering seemed to echo up and down the street still no response next janet went down on her knees and looked through the letter box she could just make out a figure sprawled on the floor at the bottom of the stairs a womans figure that was probable cause enough for forced entry lets go in she said dennis tried the handle locked then gesturing for janet to stand out of the way he charged it with his shoulder poor technique she thought shed have reared back and used her foot but dennis was a secondrow rugby forward she reminded herself and his shoulders had been pushed up against so many arseholes in their time that they had to be strong the door crashed open on first contact and dennis cannonballed into the hallway grabbing hold of the bottom of the banister to stop himself from tripping over the still figure that lay there janet was right behind him but she had the advantage of walking in at a more dignified pace she shut the door as best she could knelt beside the woman on the floor and felt for a pulse weak but steady one side of her face was bathed in blood my god janet muttered den you okay fine you take care of her ill have a look around dennis headed upstairs for once janet didnt mind being told what to do nor did she mind that dennis automatically assumed it was a womans work to tend the injured while the man went in search of heroic glory well she minded but she felt a real concern for the victim here so she didnt want to make an issue of it bastard she thought whoever did this its okay love she said even though she suspected the woman couldnt hear her well get you an ambulance just hold on most of the blood seemed to be coming from one deep cut just above her left ear janet noticed though there was also a little smeared around the nose and lips punches by the looks of it there were also broken glass and daffodils scattered all around her along with a damp patch on the carpet janet took her personal radio from her belt hook and called for an ambulance she was lucky it worked on the hill personal uhf radios had much less range than the vhf models fitted in cars and were notoriously subject to black spots of patchy reception dennis came downstairs shaking his head bastards not hiding up there he said he handed janet a blanket pillow and towel nodding to the woman for her janet eased the pillow under the womans head covered her gently with the blanket and applied the towel to the seeping wound on her temple well i never she thought full of surprises our den think hes done a runner she asked dunno ill have a look in the back you stay with her till the ambulance arrives before janet could say anything dennis headed off toward the back of the house he hadnt been gone more than a minute or so when she heard him call out janet come here and have a look at this hurry up it could be important curious janet looked at the injured woman the bleeding had stopped and there was nothing else she could do even so she was reluctant to leave the poor woman alone come on dennis called again hurry up janet took one last look at the prone figure and walked toward the back of the house the kitchen was in darkness down here she couldnt see dennis but she knew that his voice came from downstairs through an open door to her right three steps led down to a landing lit by a bare bulb there was another door most likely to the garage she thought and around the corner were the steps down to the cellar dennis was standing there near the bottom in front of a third door on it was pinned a poster of a naked woman she lay back on a brass bed with her legs wide open fingers tugging at the edges of her vagina smiling down over her large breasts at the viewer inviting beckoning him inside dennis stood before it grinning bastard janet hissed wheres your sense of humor its not funny what do you think it means i dont know janet could see light under the door faint and flickering as if from a faulty bulb she also noticed a peculiar odor whats that smell she asked how should i know rising damp drains but it smelled like decay to janet decay and sandalwood incense she gave a little shudder shall we go in she was whispering without knowing why i think wed better janet walked ahead of him almost on tiptoe down the final few steps the adrenaline was really pumping in her veins now slowly she reached out and tried the door locked she moved aside and dennis used his foot this time the lock splintered and the door swung open dennis stood aside bowed from the waist in a parody of gentlemanly courtesy and said ladies first with dennis only inches behind her janet stepped into the cellar she barely had time to register her first impressions of the small room mirrors dozens of lit candles surrounding a mattress on the floor a girl on the mattress naked and bound something yellow around her neck the terrible smell stronger despite the incense like blocked drains and rotten meat crude charcoal drawings on the whitewashed walls before it happened he came from somewhere behind them from one of the cellars dark corners dennis turned to meet him reaching for his baton but he was too slow the machete slashed first across his cheek slicing it open from the eye to the lips before dennis had time to put his hand up to stanch the blood or register the pain the man slashed again this time across the side of his throat dennis made a gurgling sound and went to his knees eyes wide open warm blood gushed across janets face and sprayed on to the whitewashed walls in swirling abstract patterns the hot stink of it made her gag she had no time to think you never did when it really happened all she knew was that she couldnt do anything for dennis not yet there was still the man with the knife to deal with hang on dennis she pleaded silently hang on the man still seemed intent on hacking at dennis not finished yet and that gave janet enough time to slip out her sidehandled baton she had just managed to grip the handle so that the baton ran protectively along the outside of her arm when he made his first lunge at her he seemed shocked and surprised when his blade didnt sink into flesh and bone but was instead deflected by the hard baton that gave janet the opening she needed bugger technique and training she swung out and caught him on the temple his eyes rolled back and he slumped against the wall but he didnt go down she moved in closer and cracked down on the wrist of his knife hand she heard something break he cried out and the machete fell to the floor janet kicked it away into a far corner then she took the fully extended baton with both hands swung and caught him on the side of the head again he tried to go after his machete but she hit him again as hard as she could on the back of his head and then again on his cheek and once more at the base of his skull he reared up still on his knees spouting obscenities at her and she lashed out one more time cracking his temple he fell against the wall where the back of his head left a long dark smear on the whitewash as he slid down and rested there legs extended pink foam bubbled at the side of his mouth then stopped janet hit him once more a twohanded blow on the top of his skull then she took out her handcuffs and secured him to one of the pipes running along the bottom of the wall he groaned and stirred so she hit him once more twohanded on the top of the skull when he fell silent she went over to dennis he was still twitching but the spurts of blood from his wound were getting weaker janet struggled to remember her first aid training she made a compress from her handkerchief and pressed it tight against the severed artery trying to nip the ends together next she tried to make the call on her personal radio officer in urgent need of assistance but it was no good all she got was static a black spot nothing to do now but sit and wait for the ambulance to arrive she could hardly move go outside not with dennis like this she couldnt leave him so janet sat crosslegged and rested denniss head on her lap cradling him and muttering nonsense in his ear the ambulance would come soon she told him he would be fine just wait and see but it seemed that no matter how tightly she held the compress blood leaked through to her uniform she could feel its warmth on her fingers her belly and thighs please dennis she prayed please hang on above lucys house maggie could see the crescent sliver of a new moon and the faint silver thread it drew around the old moons darkness the old moon in the new moons arms an ill omen sailors believed that the sight of it especially through glass presaged a storm and much loss of life maggie shivered she wasnt superstitious but there was something chilling about the sight something that reached out and touched her from way back in time when people paid more attention to cosmic events such as the cycles of the moon she looked back down at the house and saw the police car arrive heard the woman officer knock and call out then saw her male partner charge the door after that maggie heard nothing for a while perhaps five or ten minutes until she fancied she heard a heartrending keening wail from deep inside the bowels of house but it could have been her imagination the sky was a lighter blue now and the dawn chorus had struck up maybe it was a bird but she knew that no bird sounded so desolate or godforsaken as that cry not even the loon on a lake or the curlew up on the moors maggie rubbed the back of her neck and kept watching seconds later an ambulance pulled up then another police car then paramedics the ambulance attendants left the front door open and maggie could see them kneeling by someone in the hall someone covered with a fawn blanket they lifted the figure on to a wheeled stretcher and pushed her down the path to the ambulance back doors open and waiting it all happened so quickly that maggie couldnt see clearly who it was but she thought she could glimpse lucys jetblack hair spread out against a white pillow so it was as she had thought she gnawed at her thumbnail should she have done something sooner she had certainly had her suspicions but could she somehow have prevented this what could she have done next to arrive looked like a plainclothes police officer he was soon followed by five or six men who put on disposable white overalls before they went inside the house someone also put up white and blue tape across the front gate and blocked off a long stretch of the pavement including the nearest bus stop and the entire side of the road number stood on reducing the hill to one lane of traffic in order to make room for police vehicles and ambulances maggie wondered what was going on surely they wouldnt go to all this trouble unless it was something really serious was lucy dead had terry finally killed her perhaps that was it that would make them pay attention as the daylight grew the scene became even stranger more police cars arrived and another ambulance as the attendants wheeled a second stretcher out the first morning bus went down the hill and obscured maggies view she could see the passengers turn their heads the ones on her side of the road standing up to get a look at what was happening but she couldnt see who lay on the stretcher only that two policemen got in after it next a hunched figure shrouded in a blanket stumbled down the path supported on each side by uniformed policemen at first maggie had no idea who it was a woman she thought from her general outline and the cut of her dark hair then she thought she glimpsed the dark blue uniform the policewoman breath caught in her throat what could have happened to change her so much so fast by now there was far more activity than maggie had ever thought the scene of a domestic argument could engender at least half a dozen police cars had arrived some of them unmarked a wiry man with closely cropped dark hair got out of a blue renault and walked into the house as if he owned the place another man who went in looked like a doctor at least he carried a black bag and had that selfimportant air about him people up and down the hill were going to work now driving their cars out of their garages or waiting for the bus at the temporary bus stop someone from the depot had put up little knots of them gathered by the house watching but the police came over and moved them on maggie looked at her watch halfpast six she had been kneeling at the window for two and a half hours yet she felt as if she had been watching a quick succession of events as if it had been done by timelapse photography when she got to her feet she heard her knees crack and the broadloom carpet had made deep red crisscross marks on her skin there was far less activity outside the house now just the police guards and the detectives coming and going standing on the pavement to smoke shake their heads and talk in low voices the knot of haphazardly parked cars outside lucys house caused traffic backups weary and confused maggie threw on jeans and a tshirt and went downstairs to make a cup of tea and some toast as she filled the kettle she noticed that her hand was shaking they would want to talk to her no doubt about that and when they did what would she tell them acting detective superintendent alan banks acting because his immediate boss detective superintendent gristhorpe had shattered his ankle while working on his drystone wall and would be off work for at least a couple of months signed the first officers log at the gate took a deep breath and walked into the hill shortly after six oclock that morning householders lucy payne age twentytwo loan officer at the local natwest branch up near the shopping precinct and her husband terence payne age twentyeight schoolteacher at silverhill comprehensive no kids no criminal record to all intents and purposes an idyllic successful young couple married just one year all the lights were on in the house and the sceneofthecrime were already at work dressed as banks was in the obligatory white sterile overalls overshoes gloves and hoods they looked like some sort of phantom housecleaning crew banks thought dusting vacuuming scraping up samples packaging labeling banks paused a moment in the hall to get the feel of the place it seemed an ordinary enough middleclass home the ribbed coralpink wallpaper looked new carpeted stairs to the right led up to the bedrooms if anything the place smelled a bit too much of lemon air freshener the only thing that seemed out of place was the rustcolored stain on the cream hall carpet lucy payne currently under observation by both doctors and police in leeds general infirmary just down the corridor from where her husband terence payne was fighting for his life banks hadnt a lot of sympathy to spare for him pc dennis morrisey had lost his struggle for life far more quickly and there was a dead girl in the cellar too most of this information banks had got from detective chief inspector ken blackstone over his mobile on the way to leeds the rest from talking to the paramedics and the ambulance crew outside the first phone call to his gratly cottage the one that woke him from the shallow troubled and restless sleep that seemed to be his lot these days had come shortly after halfpast four and he had showered thrown on some clothes and jumped in his car a cd of zelenka trios had helped him keep calm on the way and discouraged him from taking outrageous risks with his driving on the a all in all the eightymile drive had taken him about an hour and a half and if he hadnt had too many other things on his mind during the first part of his journey he might have admired the coming of a beautiful may dawn over the yorkshire dales rare enough so far that spring as it was he saw little but the road ahead and barely even heard the music by the time he got to the leeds ring road the mondaymorning rush hour was already under way circumventing the bloodstains and daffodils on the hall carpet banks walked to the back of the house he noticed someone had been sick in the kitchen sink one of the ambulance crew said the soco busy going through the drawers and cupboards first time out poor sod were lucky he made it back up here and didnt puke all over the scene christ what did he have for breakfast looks like thai red curry and chips to me banks took the stairs down to the cellar on his way he noted the door to the garage very handy if you wanted to bring someone into the house without being seen someone you had abducted perhaps drugged or knocked unconscious banks opened the door and had a quick glance at the car it was a dark fourdoor vectra with an s registration the last three letters were ngv not local he made a note to have someone run it through the dvla at swansea he could hear voices down in the cellar see cameras flashing that would be luke selkirk their hotshot crime scene photographer fresh from his armysponsored training course up at catterick camp where he had been learning how to photograph scenes of terrorist bombings not that his special skill would be needed today but it was good to know you were working with a highly trained professional one of the best the stone steps were worn in places the walls were whitewashed brick someone had put more white and blue tape across the open door at the bottom an inner crime scene nobody would get beyond that until banks luke the doctor and the socos had done their jobs banks paused at the threshold and sniffed the smell was bad decomposition mold incense and the sweet metallic whiff of fresh blood he ducked under the tape and walked inside and the horror of the scene hit him with such force that he staggered back a couple of inches it wasnt that he hadnt seen worse he had much worse the disemboweled soho prostitute dawn whadden a decapitated petty thief called william grant the partly eaten body parts of a young barmaid called colleen dickens bodies shredded by shotgun blasts and slit open by knives he remembered all their names but that wasnt the point he had come to learn over the years it wasnt a matter of blood and guts of intestines poking out of the stomach of missing limbs or of deep gashes flapping open in an obscene parody of mouths that wasnt what really got you when it came right down to it that was just the outward aspect you could if you tried hard convince yourself that a crime scene like this one was a movie set or a theater during rehearsals and that the bodies were merely props the blood fake no what got to him most of all was the pity of it all the deep empathy he had come to feel with the victims of crimes he investigated and he hadnt become more callous more inured to it all over the years as many did and as he had once thought he would each new one was like a raw wound reopening especially something like this he could keep it all in check keep the bile down in his rumbling gut and do his job but it ate away at him from the inside like acid and kept him awake at night pain and fear and despair permeated these walls like the factory grime had crusted the old city buildings only this kind of horror couldnt be sandblasted away seven people in the cramped cellar five of them alive and two dead this was going to be a logistical and forensic nightmare someone had turned an overhead light on just a bare bulb but candles still flickered all over the place from the doorway banks could see the doctor bent over the pale body on the mattress a girl the only outward signs of violence were a few cuts and bruises a bloody nose and a length of yellow plastic clothesline around her neck she lay spreadeagled on the soiled mattress her hands tied with the same yellow plastic line to metal pegs someone had set into the concrete floor blood from pc morriseys severed artery had sprayed across her ankles and shins some flies had managed to get in the cellar and three of them were buzzing around the blood clotted under her nose there seemed to be some sort of rash or blistering around her mouth her face was pale and bluish in death the rest of her body white under the bulbs glare what made it all so much worse were the large mirrors on the ceiling and two of the walls that multiplied the scene like a funfair trick who turned the overhead light on banks asked ambulance men said luke selkirk they were first on the scene after pcs taylor and morrisey okay well leave it on for the time being get a better idea of what were dealing with but i want the original scene photographed too later just the candlelight luke nodded by the way this is faye mctavish my new assistant faye was a slight pale waiflike woman early twenties perhaps with a stud through her nostril and almost no hips at all the old heavy pentax she had slung around her neck looked too big for her to hold steady but she managed it well enough pleased to meet you faye said banks shaking hands only wish it could be in better circumstances me too banks turned to the body on the mattress he knew who she was kimberley myers age fifteen missing since friday night when she had failed to return from a youthclub dance only a quarter of a mile from her home she had been a pretty girl with the characteristic long blond hair and slim athletic figure of all the victims now her dead eyes stared up at the mirror on the ceiling as if looking for answers to her suffering dried semen glistened on her pubic hair and blood semen and blood the old old story why was it always the pretty young girls these monsters took banks asked himself for the hundredth time oh he knew all the pat answers he knew that women and children made easier victims because they were physically weaker more easily cowed and subdued by male strength just as he knew that prostitutes and runaways made easy victims too because they were less likely to be missed than someone from a nice home like kimberley but it was much more than that there was always a deep dark sexual aspect to these sorts of things and to be the right kind of object for whoever had done this the victim needed not only to be weaker but needed breasts and a vagina too available for her tormentors pleasure and ultimate desecration and perhaps some aura of youth and innocence it was despoilation of innocence men killed other men for many reasons by the thousands in wartime but in crimes like this the victim always had to be a woman the first officer on the scene had had the foresight to mark out a narrow pathway on the floor with tape so that people wouldnt walk all over the place and destroy evidence but after what had happened with pcs morrisey and taylor it was probably too late for that anyway pc dennis morrisey lay curled on his side in a pool of blood on the concrete floor his blood had also sprayed over part of the wall and one of the mirrors rivaling in its pattern anything jackson pollock had ever painted the rest of the whitewashed walls were covered with either pornographic images ripped from magazines or childish obscene stick figures of men with enormous phalluses like the cerne giant drawn in colored chalk mixed in with these were a number of crudely drawn occult symbols and grinning skulls there was another pool of blood by the wall next to the door and a long dark smear on the whitewash terence payne luke selkirks camera flashed and snapped banks out of his trancelike state faye was wielding her camcorder now the other man in the room turned and spoke for the first time detective chief inspector ken blackstone of the west yorkshire police looking immaculate as ever even in his protective clothing gray hair curled over his ears and his wirerimmed glasses magnified his sharp eyes alan he said in a voice like a sigh like a fucking abattoir isnt it a fine start to the week when did you get here four fortyfour blackstone lived out lawnswood way and it wouldnt have taken him more than half an hour to get to the hill if that banks heading the north yorkshire team was glad that blackstone was running west yorkshires part of their joint operation dubbed the chameleon squad because the killer thus far had managed to adapt blend into the night and go unnoticed often working together involved ego problems and incompatible personalities but banks and blackstone had known each other for eight or nine years and had always worked well together they got on socially too with a mutual fondness for pubs indian food and female jazz singers have you talked to the paramedics banks asked yes said blackstone they said they checked the girl for signs of life and found none so they left her undisturbed pc morrisey was dead too terence payne was handcuffed to the pipe over there his head was badly beaten but he was still breathing so they carted him off to hospital sharpish theres been some contamination of the scene mostly to the position of morriseys body but its minimal given the unusual circumstances trouble is ken weve got two crime scenes overlapping here maybe three if you count what happened to payne he paused four if you count lucy payne upstairs thatll cause problems wheres stefan detective sergeant stefan nowak was their crime scene cocoordinator new to the western division hq in eastvale and brought into the team by banks who had been quickly impressed by his abilities banks didnt envy stefan his job right now around somewhere said blackstone last time i saw him he was heading upstairs anything more you can tell me ken not much really thatll have to wait until we can talk to pc taylor in more detail when might that be later today the paramedics took her off shes being treated for shock im not bloody surprised have they yes theyve bagged her clothes and the police surgeons been to the hospital to do the necessary which meant taking fingernail scrapings and swabs from her hands among other things one thing it was easy to forget and a thing everyone might want to forget was that for the moment probationary pc janet taylor wasnt a hero she was a suspect in a case of excessive use of force very nasty indeed how does it look to you ken banks asked gut feeling as if they surprised payne down here cornered him he came at them fast and somehow struck pc morrisey with that he pointed to a bloodstained machete on the floor by the wall you can see morriseys been slashed two or three times pc taylor must have had time enough to get her baton out and use it on payne she did the right thing alan he must have been coming at her like a bloody maniac she had to defend herself selfdefense not for us to decide said banks whats the damage to payne fractured skull multiple fractures shame still if he dies it might save the courts a bit of money and a lot of grief in the long run what about his wife way it looks is he hit her with a vase on the stairs and she fell down mild concussion a bit of bruising other than that theres no serious damage shes lucky it wasnt heavy crystal or she might have been in the same boat as her husband anyway shes still out and theyre keeping an eye on her but shell be fine dc hodgkins is at the hospital now banks looked around the room again with its flickering candles mirrors and obscene cartoons he noticed shards of glass on the mattress near the body and realized when he saw his own image in one of them that they were from a broken mirror seven years bad luck hendrixs roomful of mirrors would never sound quite the same again the doctor looked up from his examination for the first time since banks had entered the cellar got up off his knees and walked over to them dr ian mackenzie home office pathologist he said holding his hand out to banks who shook it dr mackenzie was a heavily built man with a full head of brown hair parted and combed a fleshy nose and a gap between his upper front teeth always a sign of luck that banks remembered his mother once telling him maybe it would counteract the broken mirror what can you tell us banks asked the presence of petechial hemorrhages bruising of the throat and cyanosis all indicate death by strangulation most likely ligature strangulation by that yellow clothesline around her throat but i wont be able to tell you for certain until after the postmortem any evidence of sexual activity some vaginal and anal tearing what looks like semen stains but you can see that for yourself again ill be able to tell you more later time of death recent very recent theres hardly any hypostasis yet rigor hasnt started and shes still warm how long two or three hours at an estimate banks looked at his watch sometime after three then not long before the domestic dispute that drove the woman over the road to dial banks cursed if the call had come in just a short while earlier maybe only minutes or an hour then they might have saved kimberley on the other hand the timing was interesting for the questions it raised about the reasons for the dispute what about that rash around her mouth chloroform at a guess probably used in abducting her maybe even for keeping her sedated though there are much more pleasant ways banks glanced at kimberleys body i dont think our man was overly concerned about being pleasant do you doctor is chloroform easily available pretty much its used as a solvent but its not the cause of death i wouldnt say so no cant be absolutely certain until after the postmortem of course but if it is the cause wed expect to find more severe blistering in the esophagus and there would also be noticeable liver damage when can you get to her barring a motorway pileup i should be able to schedule the postmortems to start this afternoon dr mackenzie said were pretty busy as it is but well there are priorities he looked at kimberley then at pc morrisey he died of blood loss by the looks of it severed both his carotid artery and jugular vein very nasty but quick apparently his partner did what she could but it was too late tell her she shouldnt blame herself hadnt a chance thanks doctor said banks appreciate it if you could do the pm on kimberley first of course dr mackenzie left to make arrangements and luke selkirk and faye mctavish continued to take photographs and video banks and blackstone stood in silence taking in the scene there wasnt much more to see but what there was wouldnt vanish quickly from their memories where does that door over there lead to banks pointed to a door in the wall beside the mattress dont know said blackstone havent had a chance to look yet lets have a butchers then banks walked over and tried the handle it wasnt locked slowly he opened the heavy wooden door to another smaller room this one with a dirt floor the smell was much worse in there he felt for an overhead light switch but couldnt locate one he sent blackstone to get a torch and tried to make out what he could in the overspill of light from the main cellar as his eyes adjusted to the darkness in the room banks thought he could see little clumps of mushrooms growing here and there from the earth then he realized oh christ he said slumping back against the wall the nearest clump wasnt mushrooms at all it was a cluster of human toes poking through the dirt after a quick breakfast and an interview with two police detectives about her call maggie felt the urge to go for a walk there wasnt much chance of getting any work done for a while anyway what with all the excitement over the road though she knew she would try later right now she was restless and needed to blow the cobwebs out the detectives had stuck mostly to factual questions and she hadnt told them anything about lucy but she sensed that one of them at least didnt seem satisfied with her answers they would be back she still didnt know what the hell was going on the policemen who talked to her had given away nothing of course had not even told her how lucy was and the local news on the radio was hardly illuminating either all they could say at this stage was that a member of the public and a police officer had been injured earlier that morning and that took second place to the ongoing story about the local girl kimberley myers who had vanished on her way home from a youthclub dance on friday evening as she walked down the front steps past the fuchsias which would soon be flowering and drooping their heavy purplepink bells over the path maggie saw the activity at number was increasing and neighbors had gathered in little knots on the pavement which had now been roped off from the road several men wearing white overalls and carrying shovels sieves and buckets got out of a van and hurried down the garden path oh look called out one of the neighbors hes got his bucket and spade must be off to blackpool but nobody laughed like maggie everyone was coming to realize that something very nasty indeed had happened at the hill about ten yards away across from the narrow walled lane that separated it from number was a row of shops pizza takeaway hairdresser minimart newsagent fish and chips and several uniformed officers stood arguing with the shopkeepers they probably wanted to open up maggie guessed plainclothes police officers sat on the front wall talking and smoking radios crackled the area had fast begun to resemble the site of a natural disaster as if a train had crashed or an earthquake had struck maggie remembered seeing the aftermath of the earthquake in los angeles when she went there once with bill before they were married a flattened apartment building three stories reduced in seconds to two fissures in the roads part of the freeway collapsed though there was no visible damage here it felt the same had the same shellshocked aura even though they didnt know what had happened yet the people were stunned were counting the cost there was a pall of apprehension over the community and a deep sense of terror at what destructive power the hand of god might have unleashed they knew that something momentous had occurred on their doorsteps already maggie sensed life in the neighborhood would never be the same maggie turned left and walked down the hill under the railway bridge at the bottom was a small artificial pond in the midst of the housing estates and business parks it wasnt much but it was better than nothing at least she could sit on a bench by the water and feed the ducks watch the people walking their dogs it was safe too an important consideration in this part of the city where old large houses such as the one maggie was staying in rubbed shoulders with the newer rougher council estates burglary was rife and murder not unknown but down by the pond the double deckers ran by on the main road just a few yards away and enough ordinary people came to walk their dogs that maggie never felt isolated or threatened attacks occurred in broad daylight she knew but she still felt close enough to safety down there it was a warm pleasant morning the sun was out but the brisk breeze made it necessary to wear a light jacket occasionally a high cloud drifted over the sun blocking the light for a second or two and casting shadows on the waters surface there was something very soothing about feeding ducks maggie thought almost trancelike not for the ducks of course who seemed to have no concept of what sharing meant you tossed the bread they scooted toward it quacked and fought as maggie crumbled the stale bread between her fingers and tossed it into the water she recalled her first meeting with lucy payne just a couple of months ago she had been in town shopping for art supplies that day a remarkably warm day for march then shed been to borders on briggate to buy some books and afterward she found herself wandering through the victoria quarter down toward kirkgate market when she bumped into lucy coming the other way they had seen each other before in the street and at the local shops and they had always said hello partly through inclination and partly through her shyness getting out and meeting people never having been one of her strong points maggie had no friends in her new world apart from claire toth her neighbors schoolgirl daughter who seemed to have adopted her lucy payne she soon found out was a kindred spirit perhaps because they were both out of their natural habitat like compatriots meeting in a foreign land they stopped and spoke to each other lucy said it was her day off work and she was doing a bit of shopping maggie suggested a cup of tea or coffee at the harvey nichols outdoor café and lucy said shed love to so they sat and rested their feet their parcels on the ground lucy noticed the names on the bags maggie was carrying including harvey nichols and said something about not having the nerve to go inside such a posh place her own packages it soon became clear were from british home stores and c amp a maggie had come across this reluctance in northern people before had heard all the stories about how youd never get the typical leeds anorakandflatcap crowd into an upmarket store like harvey nichols but it still surprised her to hear lucy admit to this this was because maggie thought lucy was such a strikingly attractive and elegant woman with her glossy black ravenswing hair tumbling down to the small of her back and the kind of figure men buy magazines to look at pictures of lucy was tall and fullbreasted with a waist that curved in and hips that curved out in the right proportion and the simple yellow dress she was wearing under a light jacket that day emphasized her figure without broadcasting it out loud and it also drew attention to her shapely legs she didnt wear much makeup she didnt need to her pale complexion was smooth as a reflection in a mirror her black eyebrows arched cheekbones high in her oval face her eyes were black with flintlike chips scattered around inside them that caught the light like quartz crystals as she looked around the waiter came over and maggie asked lucy if she would like a cappuccino lucy said shed never had one before and wasnt quite sure what it was but she would give it a try maggie asked for two cappuccinos when lucy took her first sip she got froth on her lips which she dabbed at with a serviette you cant take me anywhere she laughed dont be silly said maggie no i mean it thats what terry always says she was very softspoken the way maggie had been for a while after she left bill maggie was just about to say that terry was a fool but she held her tongue insulting lucys husband on their first meeting wouldnt be very polite at all what do you think of the cappuccino she asked its very nice lucy took another sip where are you from she asked im not being too nosy am i its just that your accent not at all no im from toronto canada no wonder youre so sophisticated ive never been any further than the lake district maggie laughed toronto sophisticated see said lucy pouting a little youre laughing at me already no no im not maggie said honestly im not its just that well i suppose its all a matter of perspective isnt it what do you mean if i were to tell a new yorker that toronto is sophisticated shed laugh in my face the best thing they can say about the place is that its clean and safe well thats something to be proud of isnt it leeds is neither it doesnt seem so bad to me why did you leave i mean why did you come here maggie frowned and fumbled for a cigarette she still cursed herself for a fool for starting to smoke at thirty when she had managed to avoid the evil weed her whole life of course she could blame it on the stress though in the end it had only contributed more to that stress she remembered the first time bill had smelled smoke on her breath that quickasaflash change from concerned husband to monster face as she had called it but smoking wasnt that bad even her shrink said it wasnt such a terrible idea to have the occasional cigarette as a crutch for the time being she could always stop later when she felt better able to cope again so why did you come here lucy persisted i dont mean to be nosy but im interested was it a new job not exactly what i do i can do anywhere what is it im a graphic artist i illustrate books mostly childrens books at the moment im working on a new edition of grimms fairy tales oh that sounds fascinating said lucy i was terrible at art in school i cant even draw a matchstick figure she laughed and put her hand over her mouth so why are you here maggie struggled with herself for a moment stalling then a strange thing happened to her a sense of inner chains and straps loosening giving her space and a feeling of floating sitting there in the victoria quarter smoking and drinking cappuccino with lucy she felt an immediate and unheralded surge of affection for this young woman she hardly knew she wanted the two of them to be friends could see them talking about their problems just like this giving each other sympathy and advice just as she had with alicia back in toronto lucy with her gaucheness her naïve charm inspired a sort of emotional confidence in maggie this was someone she felt with whom she would be safe more than that though maggie may have been the more sophisticated of the two she sensed that they shared more than it appeared the truth was difficult for her to admit to but she felt the overwhelming need to tell someone other than her psychologist and why not lucy what is it lucy said you look so sad do i oh nothing look my husband and i maggie said stumbling over the words as if her tongue were the size of a steak i er we split up she felt her mouth drying up despite the loosened bonds this was still far more difficult than she had thought it would be she sipped some more coffee lucy frowned im sorry but why move so far away lots of people split up and they dont move countries unless hes oh my god she gave her cheek a little slap lucy i think youve just put your foot in it again maggie couldnt help allowing herself a thin smile even though lucy had touched upon the painful truth its all right she said yes he was abusive yes he hit me you can say im running away its true certainly for a while i dont even want to be in the same country as him the vehemence of her words when they came out surprised even maggie herself a strange look came into lucys eyes then she glanced around again as if looking for someone only anonymous shoppers drifted up and down the arcade under the stainedglass roof packages in hands lucy touched maggies arm with her fingertips and maggie felt a little shiver run through her almost like a reflex action to pull away a moment ago she had thought it would do her good to admit to someone to share what happened with another woman but now she wasnt so sure she felt too naked too raw im sorry if it embarrasses you maggie said with a hard edge to her voice but you did ask oh no said lucy grasping maggies wrist her grip was surprisingly strong her hands cool please dont think that i asked for it i always do its my fault but it doesnt embarrass me its just i dont know what to say i mean you you seem so bright so in control yes thats exactly what i thought how could something like that happen to someone like me doesnt it only happen to other women poor less fortunate uneducated stupid women how long lucy asked i mean how long did i let it go on before i left yes two years and dont ask me how i could let it go on for so long either i dont know im still working on that one with the shrink i see lucy paused taking it all in what made you leave him in the end maggie paused a moment then went on one day he just went too far she said he broke my jaw and two ribs did some damage to my insides it put me in hospital while i was there i filed assault charges and do you know what as soon as id done it i wanted to drop them but the police wouldnt let me what do you mean i dont know what its like over here but in canada its out of your hands if you bring assault charges you cant just change your mind and drop them anyway there was a restraining order against him nothing happened for a couple of weeks then he came around to the house with flowers wanting to talk what did you do i kept the chain on i wouldnt let him in he was in one of his contrite moods pleading and wheedling promising on his mothers grave hed done it before and broken his promise every time anyway then he became threatening and abusive he started hammering at the door and calling me names i called the police they arrested him he came back again stalking me then a friend suggested i move away for a while the further the better i knew about the house on the hill ruth and charles everett own the place do you know them lucy shook her head ive seen them around not for a while though no you wouldnt have charles was offered a years appointment at columbia university in new york starting in january ruth went with him how did you know them ruth and i are in the same line of work its a fairly small world but why leeds maggie smiled why not first there was the house just waiting for me and my parents came from yorkshire i was born here rawdon but we left when i was a little girl anyway it seemed the ideal solution so youre living across the road in that big house all alone all alone i thought i hadnt seen anyone else coming and going to be honest lucy youre pretty much the first person ive spoken to since i got here apart from my shrink and my agent that is its not that people arent friendly ive just been well standoffish i suppose a bit distant lucys hand still rested on maggies forearm though she wasnt gripping at all now that makes sense after what youve been through did he follow you over here i dont think so i dont think he knows where i am ive had a few latenight hangup calls but i honestly dont know if theyre from him i dont think they are all my friends back there swore they wouldnt tell him where i was and he doesnt know ruth and charles he had little interest in my career i doubt that he knows im in england though i wouldnt put it past him to find out maggie needed to change the subject she could hear the ringing in her ears feel the arcade spinning and her jaw aching the coloredglass roof above her shifting like a kaleidoscope her neck muscles stiffening the way they always did when she thought about bill for too long psychosomatic the shrink said as if that did her any good she asked lucy about herself i dont really have any friends either lucy said she stirred her spoon around the dregs of her cappuccino froth i suppose i was always rather shy even at school i never know what to say to people then she laughed i dont have much of a life either just work at the bank home taking care of terry we havent been married a year yet he doesnt like me to go out by myself even today my day off if he knew that reminds me she looked at her watch and seemed to become agitated thank you very much for the coffee maggie i really have to go i have to get the bus back before school comes out terrys a teacher you see now it was maggies turn to grasp lucys arm and stop her from leaving so abruptly what is it lucy she asked lucy just looked away lucy its nothing its just what you were saying earlier she lowered her voice and looked around the arcade before going on i know what you mean but i cant talk about it now terry hits you no not like i mean hes very strict its for my own good she looked maggie in the eye you dont know me im a wayward child terry has to discipline me wayward maggie thought discipline what strange and alarming words to use he has to keep you in check control you yes she stood up again look i must go its been wonderful talking to you i hope we can be friends i do too said maggie we really have to talk again theres help you know lucy flashed her a wan smile and hurried off toward vicar lane after lucy had gone maggie sat stunned her hand shaking as she drained her cup the milky foam was dry and cold against her lips lucy a fellow victim maggie couldnt believe it this strong healthy beautiful woman a victim just like slight weak elfin maggie surely it couldnt be possible but hadnt she sensed something about lucy some kinship something they had in common that must be it that was what she hadnt wanted to talk to the police about that morning she knew that she might have to depending on how serious things were but she wanted to put off the moment for as long as she could thinking of lucy maggie remembered the one thing she had learned about domestic abuse so far it doesnt matter who you are it can still happen to you alicia and all her other close friends back home had expressed their wonder at how such a bright intelligent successful caring educated woman like maggie could fall victim to a wife beater like bill she had seen the expressions on their faces noticed their conversations hush and shift when she walked in the room there must be something wrong with her they were all saying and that was what she had thought too still thought to some extent because to all intents and purposes bill too was bright intelligent caring educated and successful until he got his monster face on that is but only maggie saw him like that and it was odd she thought that nobody had thought to ask why an intelligent wealthy successful lawyer like bill should feel the need to hit a woman almost a foot shorter and at least eighty pounds lighter than he was even when the police came that time he was hammering at her door she could tell they were making excuses for him he was driven out of his mind by his wifes unreasonable action in taking out a restraining order against him he was just upset because his marriage had broken up and his wife wouldnt give him a chance to make it up excuses excuses maggie was the only one who knew what he could be like every day she thanked god they had no kids which was what she was thinking about as she drifted back to the present to feeding the ducks on the pond lucy was a fellow sufferer and now terry had put her in hospital maggie felt responsible as if she should have done something lord knows she had tried after lucys subsequent tale of physical and psychological abuse at the hands of her husband had unfolded during their many furtive meetings over coffee and biscuits with maggie sworn to absolute secrecy she should have done something but unlike most people maggie knew exactly what it was like she knew lucys position knew that the best she could do was try to persuade her to seek professional help to leave terry which she did try to do but lucy wouldnt leave him she said she had nowhere to go and no one to go to a common enough excuse and it made perfect sense where do you go when you walk out on your life maggie had been lucky she had the friends to rally around her and come up with at least a temporary solution most women in her position were not so fortunate lucy also said that her marriage was so new that she felt she had to give it a chance give it some time she couldnt just walk out on it she wanted to work harder at it another common response from women in her position maggie knew but all she could do was point out that it wasnt going to get any better no matter what she did that terry wasnt going to change and that it would come to her leaving sooner or later so why not leave sooner and spare herself the beatings but no lucy wanted to stick it out awhile longer at least a little while terry was so nice afterward so good to her he bought her presents flowers swore he would never do it again that he would change it made maggie sick to hear all this literally as she once vomited the minute lucy left the house the same damn reasons and excuses she had given herself and those few close friends who knew about her situation all along but she listened what else could she do lucy needed a friend and for better or for worse maggie was it now this maggie tossed the last crumbs of bread into the pond she aimed for the scruffiest littlest ugliest duckling of them all the one way at the back that hadnt been able to get at the feast so far it made no difference the bread landed only inches from his beak but before he could get to it the others had paddled over in a ferocious pack and snapped it right from under his mouth banks wanted to get a look at the whole interior of the hill before the socos started ripping it apart he didnt know what it would tell him but he needed to get the feel of it downstairs in addition to the kitchen with its small dining area there was only a living room containing a threepiece suite stereo system television video and a small bookcase though the room was decorated with the same feminine touch as the hallway frilly lace curtains coralpink wallpaper thickpile carpet cream ceiling with ornate cornices the videos in the cabinet under the tv set reflected masculine tastes action films tape after tape of the simpsons a collection of horror and science fiction films including the whole alien and scream series along with some true classics such as the wicker man the original cat people curse of the demon and a boxed set of david cronenberg films banks poked around but could find no porn nothing homemade maybe the socos would have better luck when they took the house apart the cds were an odd mix there was some classical mostly classic fm compilations and a bestofmozart set but there were also some rap heavy metal and countryandwestern cds eclectic tastes the books were also mixed beauty manuals readers digest condensed specials needlecraft techniques romances occult and true crime of the more graphic variety tabloidstyle biographies of famous serial killers and mass murderers the room showed one or two signs of untidiness yesterdays evening paper spread over the coffee table a couple of videos left out of their boxes but on the whole it was clean and neat there were also a number of knickknacks around the place the sort of things that bankss mother wouldnt have in the house because they made dusting more difficult porcelain figures of fairytale characters and animals in the dining room there was a large glassfronted cabinet filled with royal doulton chinaware probably a wedding present banks guessed upstairs were two bedrooms the smaller one used as a home office along with a toilet and bathroom no shower just sink and tub both toilet and bathroom were spotless the porcelain shining bright the air heavy with the scent of lavender banks glanced around the plug holes but saw only polished chrome not a trace of blood or hair their computer expert david preece sat in the office clacking away at the computer keys a large filing cabinet stood in the corner it would have to be emptied its contents transferred to the exhibits room at millgarth anything yet dave banks asked preece pushed his glasses back up his nose and turned nothing much just a few pornographic web sites bookmarked chat rooms that sort of thing nothing illegal yet by the looks of it keep at it banks walked into the master bedroom the color scheme seemed to continue the ocean theme but instead of coral it was sea blue azure cobalt cerulean annie cabbot would know the exact shade her father being an artist but to banks it was just blue like the walls of his living room though a shade or two darker the queensize bed was covered by a fluffedup black duvet the bedroom suite was assembleityourself blond scandinavian pine another television set stood on a stand at the bottom of the bed the cabinet held a collection of softcore porn if the labels were to believed but still nothing illegal or homemade no kiddie stuff or animals so the paynes were into porn videos so what so were more than half the households in the country banks was willing to bet but more than half the households in the country didnt go around abducting and killing young girls some lucky young dc was going to have to sit down and watch the lot from start to finish to verify that the contents matched the titles banks poked around in the wardrobe suits shirts dresses shoes mostly womens nothing he wouldnt have expected they would all have to be bagged by the socos and examined in minute detail there were plenty of knickknacks in the bedroom too limoges cases musical jewelry boxes lacquered handpainted boxes the room took its musky rose and aniseed scent banks noticed from a bowl of potpourri on the laundry hamper under the window the bedroom faced the hill and when banks parted the lace curtains and looked out of the window he could see the houses atop the rise over the street half hidden by shrubs and trees he could also see the activity below on the street he turned and looked around the room again finding it somehow depressing in its absolute sterility it could have been ordered from a color supplement and assembled yesterday the whole house except for the cellar of course had that feel to it pretty contemporary the sort of place where the upandcoming young middleclass couple about town should be living so ordinary but empty with a sigh he went back downstairs kelly diane matthews went missing during the new years eve party in roundhay park leeds she was seventeen years old five feet three inches tall and weighed just seven stones she lived in alwoodley and attended allerton high school kelly had two younger sisters ashley age nine and nicola age thirteen the call to the local police station came in at am on the first of january mr and mrs matthews were worried that their daughter hadnt come home that night they had been to a party themselves and hadnt arrived back until almost am they noticed that kelly wasnt home yet but werent too worried because she was with friends and they knew that these new years parties were likely to go on until the wee hours they also knew she had plenty of money for a taxi they were both tired and a little tipsy after their own party they told the police so they went straight to bed when they awoke the following morning and found that kellys bed had still not been slept in they became worried she had never done anything like this before first they telephoned the parents of the two girlfriends she had gone with reliable in their estimation both kellys friends alex kirk and jessica bradley had arrived home shortly after two in the morning then adrian matthews rang the police pc rearden who took the call picked up on the genuine concern in mr matthewss voice and sent an officer around immediately kellys parents said they last saw her around seven oclock on the thirtyfirst of december when she went to meet her friends she was wearing blue jeans white trainers a thick cableknit jumper and a threequarterlength suede jacket when questioned later kellys friends said that the group had become separated during the fireworks display but nobody was too concerned after all there were thousands of people about buses were running late and the taxis were touting for business adrian and gillian matthews werent rich but they were comfortably off adrian oversaw the computer systems of a large retail operation and gillian was assistant manager of a city center building society branch they owned a georgianstyle semidetached house not far from eccup reservoir in an area of the city closer to parks golf courses and the countryside than to factories warehouses and grim terraces of backtobacks according to her friends and teachers kelly was a bright personable responsible girl who got consistently high marks and was certain to land in the university of her choice at the moment cambridge where she intended to read law kelly was also her schools champion sprinter she had beautiful goldblond hair which she wore long and she liked clothes dancing pop music and sports she was also fond of classical music and quite an accomplished pianist it soon became clear to the investigating officer that kelly matthews was a most unlikely teenage runaway and he instituted a search of the park when three days later the search parties had found nothing they called it off in the meantime police had also interviewed hundreds of revelers some of whom said they thought theyd seen her with a man and others with a woman taxi drivers and bus drivers were also questioned to no avail a week after kelly disappeared her shoulder bag was found in some bushes near the park in it were her keys a diary cosmetics a hairbrush and a purse containing over thirtyfive pounds and some loose change her diary yielded no clues the last entry on the thirtyfirst of december was a brief list of new years resolutions help mum more around the house practice piano every day be nicer to my little sisters banks stripped off his protective clothing leaned against his car out in the street and lit a cigarette it was going to be a hot sunny day he could tell only the occasional high cloud scudding across the blue sky on a light breeze and he would be spending most of it indoors either at the scene or at millgarth he ignored the people on the other side of the road who stopped to stare and shut his ears to the honking horns from the snarl of cars up the hill which had now been blocked off completely by the local traffic police the press had arrived banks could see them straining at the barriers banks had known it would come to this eventually or to something very much like this from the first moment he had agreed to head the north yorkshire half of the twocounty task force into the series of disappearances five young women in all three from west yorkshire and two from north yorkshire the west yorkshire assistant chief constable crime was in overall charge but he was at county headquarters in wakefield so banks and blackstone rarely saw him they reported directly to the head of cid area commander philip hartnell at millgarth in leeds who was the official senior investigating officer but who left them to get on with the job the main incident room was also at millgarth under banks and blackstone came several detective inspectors a whole host of detective constables and sergeants culled from both west and north county forces skilled civilian employees crime scene coordinator ds stefan nowak and acting as consultant psychologist dr jenny fuller who had studied offender profiling in america with the national center for the analysis of violent crime at the fbi academy in quantico virginia and didnt look a bit like jodie foster jenny had also studied with paul britton in leicester and was recognized as one of the rising stars in the relatively new field of psychology combined with police work banks had worked with jenny fuller on his very first case in eastvale and they had become close friends almost more but something always seemed to get in their way it was probably for the best banks told himself though he often couldnt convince himself of that when he looked at her jenny had such lips as you rarely saw on anyone but a pouting french sex symbol her figure tapered and bulged in all the right places and her clothes usually expensive clothes silky mostly in green and russet just seemed to flow over her it was that liquefaction of her clothes that the poet herrick wrote about the dirty old devil banks had come across herrick in a poetry anthology he was working his way through having felt a disturbing ignorance in such matters for years lines like herricks stuck with him as did the one about sweet disorder in the dress which made him think of ds annie cabbot for some reason annie wasnt so obviously beautiful in the way jenny was not as voluptuous not the kind to draw wolf whistles on the street but she had a deep quiet sort of beauty that appealed very much to banks unfortunately because of his new and onerous responsibilities he hadnt seen much of annie lately and had found himself because of the case spending more and more time with jenny realizing that the old feelings that odd and immediate spark between them had never gone away nothing had happened as such but it had been touch and go on occasion annie was also consumed with her work she had found a detective inspectors position open in western divisions complaints and discipline department and had taken it because it was the first opportunity that came up it wasnt ideal and it certainly didnt win her any popularity contests but it was a necessary step in the ladder she had set out to climb and banks had encouraged her to go for it dc karen hodgkins edged her little gray nissan through the opening the police made in the barrier for her and broke off bankss chain of thought she got out and walked over karen had proved an energetic and ambitious worker throughout the whole investigation and banks fancied she would go far if she developed a flair for police politics she reminded him a bit of susan gay his old dc now a ds in cirencester but she had fewer sharp edges and seemed more sure of herself whats the situation banks asked her not much change sir lucy paynes under sedation the doctor says we wont be able to talk to her until tomorrow have lucy and her husband been fingerprinted yes sir what about her clothes banks had suggested that they take the clothes lucy payne had been wearing for forensic examination after all she wouldnt be needing them in hospital they should be at the lab by now sir good what was she wearing nightie and a dressing gown what about terence payne hows he doing hanging on but they say that even if he does recover he might be you know a vegetable there might be serious brain damage theyve found skull fragments stuck in his brain it seems well go on the doctors saying that it seems the pc who subdued him used a bit more than reasonable force he was very angry was he indeed christ banks could see a court case looming if payne survived with brain damage best let ac hartnell worry about it that was what acs were put on this earth for after all hows pc taylor coping shes at home sir a friends with her female pc from killingbeck okay karen i want you to act as hospital liaison for the time being any change in the status of the patients either of them and i want to know immediately thats your responsibility okay yes sir and were going to need a family liaison officer he gestured toward the house kimberleys parents need to be told before they hear it on the news we also need to arrange for them to identify the body ill do it sir good of you to offer karen but youve got your hands full already and its a thankless task karen hodgkins headed back to her car if truth be told banks didnt think karen had the right bedside manner for a family liaison officer he could picture the scene the parents disbelief their outpouring of grief karens embarrassment and brusqueness no he would send rolypoly jonesy dc jones might be a slob but he had sympathy and concern leaking out of every pore he should have been a vicar one of the problems with drawing a team from such a wide radius banks thought was that you could never get to know the individual officers well enough which didnt help when it came to handing out assignments you needed the right person for the right job in police work and one wrong decision could screw up an investigation banks just wasnt used to running such a huge team and the problems of coordination had given him more than one headache in fact the whole matter of responsibility was weighing very heavily on his mind he didnt feel competent to deal with it all to keep so many balls up in the air at once he had already made more than one minor mistake and mishandled a few situations with personnel so much so that he was beginning to think his people skills were especially low it was easier working with a small team annie winsome jackman sergeant hatchley where he could keep track of every little detail in his mind this was more like the kind of work he had done on the met down in london only there he had been a mere constable or sergeant given the orders rather than giving them even as an inspector down there toward the end he had never had to deal with this level of responsibility banks had just lit his second cigarette when another car came through the barrier and dr jenny fuller jumped out struggling with a briefcase and an overstuffed leather shoulder bag hurrying as usual as if she were late for an important meeting her tousled red mane cascaded over her shoulders and her eyes were the green of grass after a summer shower the freckles crowsfeet and slightly crooked nose that she always complained ruined her looks only made her appear more attractive and more human morning jenny banks greeted her stefans waiting inside you ready whats that yorkshire foreplay no thats are you awake jenny forced a smile glad to see youre on form even at this ungodly hour banks looked at his watch jenny ive been up since halfpast four its nearly eight now my point exactly she said ungodly she looked toward the house apprehension flitted across her features its bad isnt it very coming in with me no ive seen enough besides id better go and put ac hartnell in the picture or hell have my guts for garters jenny took a deep breath and seemed to gird herself right she said lay on macduff im ready and she walked in area commander philip hartnells office was as befitted his rank large it was also quite bare ac hartnell didnt believe in making himself at home there this the place seemed to shout is an office and an office only there was a carpet of course an area commander merited a carpet one filing cabinet a bookcase full of technical and procedural manuals and on his desk beside the virgin blotter a sleek black laptop computer and a single buff file folder that was it no family photographs nothing but a map of the city on the wall and a view of the openair market and the bus station from his window the tower of leeds parish church poking up beyond the railway embankment alan sit down he greeted banks tea coffee banks ran his hand over his scalp wouldnt mind a black coffee if its no trouble not at all hartnell phoned for coffee and leaned back in his chair it squeaked when he moved must get this bloody thing oiled he said hartnell was about ten years younger than banks which put him in his late thirties he had benefited from the accelerated promotion scheme which was meant to give bright young lads like him a chance at command before they became doddering old farts banks hadnt been on such a track he had worked his way up the old way the hard way and like many others who had done so he tended to be suspicious of the fast trackers who had learned everything but the nittygritty downanddirty of policing the odd thing was that banks liked phil hartnell he had an easygoing manner was an intelligent and caring copper and let the men under his command get on with their jobs banks had had regular meetings with him over the course of the chameleon investigation and while hartnell had made a few suggestions some of them useful he had never once tried to interfere and question bankss judgment in appearance goodlooking tall and with the tapered upper body of a casual weight lifter hartnell was also reputed to be a bit of a ladies man still unmarried and tipped to remain that way for a while yet thank you very much tell me what were in for he said to banks a shit storm if you ask me banks told him about what they had found so far in the cellar at number the hill and the condition of the three survivors hartnell listened the tip of his finger touched to his lips theres not much doubt hes our man then the chameleon not much thats good then at least thats something we can congratulate ourselves on weve got a serial killer off the streets it wasnt down to us just pure luck the paynes happened to have a domestic disagreement and a neighbor heard and called the police hartnell stretched his arms out behind his head a twinkle came to his grayblue eyes you know alan the amount of shit we get poured on us when luck goes against us or when we seem to be making no progress at all no matter how many manhours we put in id say were entitled to claim a victory this time and maybe even crow a little about it its all in the spin if you say so i do alan i do their coffee arrived and both took a moment to sip it tasted wonderful to banks who hadnt got his usual three or four cups down his gullet that morning but we do have a potentially serious problem dont we hartnell went on banks nodded pc taylor indeed he tapped the file folder probationary pc janet taylor he looked away a moment toward the window i knew dennis morrisey by the way not well but i knew him solid sort of bloke seems hes been around for years well miss him what about pc taylor cant say i know her have the proper procedures been followed yes no statement yet no okay hartnell got up and stared out of the window for a few moments his back to banks when he spoke again he didnt turn round you know as well as i do alan that protocol demands the police complaints authority brings in an investigator from a neighboring force to deal with a problem like this there mustnt even be the slightest hint of a coverup of special treatment naturally id like nothing better than to deal with it myself dennis was one of ours after all as is pc taylor but its not on the cards he turned and walked back over to his chair can you imagine what a field day the press will have especially if payne dies heroic pc brings down serial killer and ends up being charged with using excessive force even if its excusable homicide its still the dogs breakfast as far as were concerned and what with the hadleigh case before the court right now true enough banks like every other policeman had had to deal more than once with the outrage of men and women who had seriously hurt or killed criminals in defense of their families and property and then found themselves under arrest for assault or worse murder at the moment the country was awaiting the jurys verdict on a farmer called john hadleigh who had used his shotgun on an unarmed sixteenyearold burglar killing the lad hadleigh lived on a remote farm in devon and his house had been broken into once before just over a year ago at which time he had been beaten as well as robbed the young burglar had a record as long as your arm but that didnt matter what mattered most was that the pattern of shotgun pellets covered part of the side and the back indicating that the boy had been turning to run away as the gun was fired an unopened flickknife was found in his pocket the case had been generating sensational headlines for a couple of weeks and would be with the jury in a matter of days an investigation didnt mean that pc janet taylor would lose her job or go to jail fortunately there were higher authorities such as judges and chief constables who had to make decisions on such matters as those but there was no denying that it could have a negative effect on her police career well its my problem said hartnell rubbing his forehead but its a decision that has to be made very quickly naturally as i said id like to keep it with us but i cant do that he paused and looked at banks on the other hand pc taylor is west yorkshire and it seems to me that north yorkshire might reasonably be considered a neighboring force true said banks beginning to get that sinking feeling that would help keep it as close as we can dont you think i suppose so said banks as a matter of fact acc mclaughlins an old friend of mine it might be worthwhile my having a word hows your complaints and discipline department know anyone up there banks swallowed it didnt matter what he said if the matter went to western divisions complaints and discipline the burden would almost certainly land in annie cabbots lap it was a small department annie was the only detective inspector and banks happened to know that her boss detective superintendent chambers was a lazy sod with a particular dislike of female detectives making their way up the ranks annie was the new kid on the block and she was also a woman not a hope of her getting out of this one banks could almost see the bastard rubbing his hands for glee when the order came down dont you think it might seem just a bit too close to home he said maybe greater manchester or lincolnshire would be better not at all said hartnell this way we get to be seen to do the right thing while still keeping it pretty close to us surely you must know someone in the department someone wholl realize its in his best interests to keep you informed detective superintendent chambers is in charge said banks im sure hell find someone suitable to assign hartnell smiled well ill have a word with ron this morning and well see where it gets us shall we fine said banks thinking shell kill me shell kill me even though it wasnt his fault jenny fuller noted with distaste the obscene poster as she went through the cellar door with ds stefan nowak right behind her then she put her feelings aside and viewed it dispassionately as a piece of evidence which it was it marked the keeper of the portal to the dark underworld where terence payne could immerse himself in what he loved most in life domination sexual power murder once he had got beyond this obscene guardian the rules that normally governed human behavior no longer applied jenny and stefan were alone in the cellar now alone with the dead she felt like a voyeur which she was she also felt like a fraud as if nothing she could say or do would be of any use she almost felt like holding stefans hand almost behind her stefan switched off the overhead light and made jenny jump sorry it wasnt on at first he explained one of the ambulance crew turned it on so they could see what they were dealing with and it just got left on jennys heartbeat returned to normal she could smell incense along with other odors she had no desire to dwell on so this was his working environment hallowed churchlike several of the candles had burned down by now and some of them were guttering out but a dozen or more still flickered multiplied into hundreds by the arrangement of mirrors without the overhead light jenny could hardly make out the dead policemans body on the floor which was probably a blessing and the candlelight softened the impact of the girls body gave her skin such a reddishgold hue that jenny could have almost believed kimberley alive were it not for the preternatural stillness of her body and the way her eyes stared up into the overhead mirror nobody home mirrors no matter where jenny looked she could see several reflections of herself stefan and the girl on the mattress muted in the flickering candlelight he likes to watch himself at work she thought could that be the only way he feels real watching himself doing it wheres the camcorder she asked luke selkirks no i dont mean the police camera i mean his paynes we havent found a camcorder why look at the setup stefan this is a man who likes to look at himself in action itd surprise me a great deal if he didnt keep some record of his actions wouldnt it you now you come to mention it yes said stefan that sort of things par for the course in sex killings some sort of memento a trophy and usually also some sort of visual aid to help him relive the experience before the next one well know more when the teams finished with the house jenny followed the phosphorescent tape that marked the path to the anteroom where the bodies lay still untouched awaiting the socos in the light of stefans torch her glance took in the toes sticking through the earth and what looked like a finger perhaps a nose a kneecap his menagerie of death planted trophies his garden stefan shifted beside her and she realized she had been holding his arm digging in hard with her nails they went back into the candlelit cellar as jenny stood over kimberley noting the wounds small cuts and scratch marks she couldnt help herself but found she was weeping silent tears damp against her cheek she wiped her eyes with the back of one hand hoping stefan didnt notice if he did he was gentleman enough not to say anything suddenly she wanted to leave it wasnt just the sight of kimberley myers on the mattress or the smell of incense and blood the images flickering in mirrors and candlelight but the combination of all these elements made her feel claustrophobic and nauseated standing there observing this horror with stefan she didnt want to be here with him or with any man feeling the things she did it felt obscene and it was an obscenity performed by man upon woman trying to conceal her trembling she touched stefans arm ive seen enough down here for now she said lets go id like to have a look around the rest of the house stefan nodded and turned back to the stairs jenny had the damnedest sensation that he knew exactly what she was feeling bloody hell she thought the sixth sense she could do without right now life was complicated enough with the usual five at work she followed stefan past the poster up the worn stone stairs annie got much on right now as a matter of fact im wearing a midlength navyblue skirt red shoes and a white silk blouse do you want to know about my underwear dont tempt me i take it youre alone in the office all on my little lonesome listen annie ive got something to tell you warn you about actually banks was sitting in his car outside the payne house talking on his mobile the mortuary wagon had taken the bodies away and kimberleys stunned parents had identified her body the socos had located two more bodies so far in the anteroom both of them in so advanced a state of decomposition that it was impossible to make visual identification dental records would have to be checked dna sampled and checked against the parents it would all take time another team was still combing through the house boxing up papers accounts bills receipts snapshots letters anything and everything banks listened to the silence after he had finished explaining the assignment he thought annie would be getting in the near future he had decided that the best way to deal with it was to try to put it in a positive light convince annie that she would be good for the job and that it was the right job for her he didnt imagine he would have much success but it was worth a try he counted the beats one two three four then the explosion came hes doing what is this some kind of sick joke alan no joke because if it is you can knock it off right now its not funny its no joke annie im serious and if you think about it for a minute youll see what a great idea it is if i thought about it for the rest of my life it still wouldnt seem like a great idea how dare he you know theres no way i can come out of this looking good if i prove a case against her then every cop and every member of the public hates my guts if i dont prove a case the press screams coverup no they wont have you any idea of what sort of monster terence payne is theyll be whooping for joy that populist justice is served at last some of them perhaps but not the ones i read or you for that matter annie its not going to bury you itll be in the hands of the cps well before that stage youre not judge jury and executioner you know youre just a humble investigator trying to get the facts right how can that harm you was it you who suggested me in the first place did you give hartnell my name tell him id be the best one for the job i cant believe youd do this to me alan i thought you liked me i do and i havent done anything ac hartnell came up with it all by himself and you and i both know whatll happen as soon as it gets into detective superintendent chamberss hands well at least were agreed on that you know the fat bastards been chomping at the bit all week because he hasnt been able to find anything really messy for me to do for crying out loud alan couldnt you do something like what suggest he hand it over to lancashire or derbyshire anything i tried but his mind was made up he knows acc mclaughlin besides this way he thinks i can hold on to some degree of control over the investigation well he can bloody well think again about that annie you can do some good here for yourself for the public interest dont try appealing to my better nature i havent got one why are you resisting so strongly because its a crap job and you know it at least give me the courtesy of not trying to softsoap me banks sighed im only the advance warning dont kill the messenger thats what messengers are for youre saying ive no choice theres always a choice yeah the right one and the wrong one dont worry i wont make a fuss but youd better be right about the consequences trust me im right and youll respect me in the morning sure look about the morning im going back to gratly tonight ill be late but maybe you could come over or i could drop by your place on my way what for a quickie doesnt have to be that quick way im sleeping these days it could take all night no way i need my beauty sleep remember ive got to be up bright and early in the morning to drive to leeds bye banks held the silent mobile to his ear for a few moments then put it back in his pocket christ he thought you handled that one really well alan didnt you people skills samantha jane foster eighteen years old five feet five and seven stone three pounds was a firstyear english student at the university of bradford her parents lived in leighton buzzard where julian foster was a chartered accountant and teresa foster a local gp samantha had one older brother alistair unemployed and a younger sister chloe still at school on the evening of the twentysixth of february samantha attended a poetry reading in a pub near the university campus and left alone for her bedsit at about elevenfifteen she lived just off great horton road about a quarter of a mile away when she didnt turn up for her weekend job in the city center waterstones bookshop one of her coworkers penelope hall became worried and called at the bedsit during her lunch break samantha was reliable she later told the police and if she wasnt going to come in to work because of illness she would always ring this time she hadnt worried that samantha might be seriously ill penelope managed to persuade the landlord to open the bedsit door nobody home there was a very good chance that the bradford police might not have taken samantha fosters disappearance seriously at least not so quickly had it not been for the shoulder bag that a conscientious student had found in the street and handed in after midnight the previous evening it contained a poetry anthology called new blood a slim volume of poetry signed to samantha between whose silky thighs i would love to rest my head and give silver tongue and dated by the poet michael stringer who had read in the pub the previous evening a spiral notebook full of poetic jottings observations reflections on life and literature including what looked to the desk officer like descriptions of hallucinogenic states and outofbody experiences a halfsmoked packet of benson amp hedges a red packet of rizzla cigarette papers and a small plastic bag of marijuana less than a quarter of an ounce a green disposable cigarette lighter three loose tampons a set of keys a personal cd player with a tracy chapman cd inside it a little bag of cosmetics and a purse containing fifteen pounds in cash a credit card student union card shop receipts for books and cds and various other sundry items given the two occurrences an abandoned shoulder bag and a missing girl especially as the young dc who was given the assignment remembered something similar had happened in roundhay park leeds on new years eve the inquiry began that very morning with calls to samanthas parents and close friends none of whom had seen her or heard of any change in her plans or normal routine for a brief time michael stringer the poet who had been reading his work at the pub became a suspect given the inscription he had written in his book of poems for her but a number of witnesses said he carried on drinking in the city center and had to be helped back to his hotel around threethirty in the morning the hotel staff assured the police that he hadnt seen the light of day again until teatime the following day inquiries around the university turned up one possible witness who thought she saw samantha talking to someone through a car window at least the girl had long blond hair and was wearing the same clothes samantha was when she left the pub jeans black calfhigh boots and a long flapping overcoat the car was dark in color and the witness remembered the three last letters on the number plate because they formed her own initials kathryn wendy thurlow she said she had no reason to believe that there was any problem at the time so she crossed over to her street and carried on to her own flat the last two letters of a car number plate indicate the origin of its registration and wt signifies leeds the dvla at swansea were able to supply a list of over a thousand possibles as kathryn hadnt been able to narrow the search down to make or even color and the owners were interviewed by bradford cid nothing came of it all the searches and interviews that followed turned up nothing more about samantha fosters disappearance and rumblings were starting on the police tomtoms two disappearances almost two months and about fifteen miles apart were enough to set off a few alarm bells but not a fullblown panic samantha didnt have many friends but those she did have were loyal and devoted to her in particular angela firth ryan conner and abha gupta who were all devastated by her disappearance according to them samantha was a very serious sort of girl given to long reflective silences and gnomic utterances with no time for small talk sports and television she had a level head on her shoulders though they insisted and everyone said she wasnt the type to go off with a stranger on a whim no matter how much she talked about the importance of experiencing life to the full when the police suggested that samantha might have wandered off under the influence of drugs her friends said it was unlikely yes they admitted she liked to smoke a joint occasionally she said it helped her with her writing but she didnt do any harder drugs she also didnt drink much and couldnt have had more than two or three glasses of wine the entire evening she didnt have a boyfriend at the moment and didnt seem interested in acquiring one no she wasnt gay but she had spoken of exploring sexual experiences with other women samantha might appear unconventional in some ways angela explained but she had a lot more common sense than people sometimes imagined on first impressions she was just not frivolous and she was interested in a lot of things other people laughed at or dismissed according to her professors samantha was an eccentric student with a tendency to spend too much of her time reading outside the syllabus but one of her tutors who had published some verse himself said that he had hopes she might make a fine poet one day if she could cultivate a little more selfdiscipline in her technique samanthas interests so abha gupta said included art poetry nature eastern religions psychic experiences and death banks and ken blackstone drove out to the greyhound a lowbeamed rustic pub with toby jugs all around the plate racks in the village of tong about fifteen minutes from the crime scene it was going on for two oclock and neither of them had eaten yet that day banks hadnt eaten much in the past two days in fact ever since he had heard of the fifth missing teenager in the wee hours of saturday morning over the past two months he had sometimes thought his head would explode under pressure of the sheer amount of detail he carried around in it he would awaken in the early hours of the morning at three or four oclock and the thoughts would spin around his mind and prevent him from going back to sleep instead he would get up and brew a pot of tea and sit at the pine kitchen table in his pajamas making notes for the day ahead as the sun came up and spilled its liquid honey light through the high window or rain lashed against the panes these were lonely quiet hours and while he had got used to even embraced solitude sometimes he missed his previous life with sandra and the kids in the eastvale semi but sandra was gone about to marry sean and the kids had grown up and were living their own lives tracy was in her second year at the university of leeds and brian was touring the country with his rock band going from strength to strength after the great reviews their first independently produced cd had received banks had neglected them both he realized over the past couple of months especially his daughter they ordered the last two portions of lamb stew and rice and pints of tetleys bitter at the bar it was warm enough to sit outside at one of the tables next to the cricket field a local team was out practicing and the comforting sound of leather on willow punctuated their conversation banks lit a cigarette and told blackstone about ac hartnell giving north yorkshire the pc taylor investigation and his certainty that it would go to annie shell love that said blackstone shes already made her feelings quite clear youve told her i tried to put a positive spin on it to make her feel better but it sort of backfired blackstone smiled are you two still an item i think so sort of but half the time im not sure to be honest shes very elusive ah the sweet mystery of woman something like that maybe youre expecting too much of her what do you mean i dont know sometimes when a man loses his wife he starts looking for a new one in the first woman who shows any interest in him marriage is the last thing on my mind ken if you say so i do i havent bloody time for a start talking about marriage how do you think the wife lucy payne fits in blackstone asked i dont know she must have known i mean she was living with the bloke maybe but you saw the way things were set up back there payne could have sneaked anyone in through the garage and taken them straight into the cellar if he kept the place locked and barred nobody need have known it was pretty well soundproofed im sorry but you cant convince me that a woman lives with a killer who does what payne did and she hasnt a clue said blackstone what does he do get up after dinner and tell her hes just off down to the basement to play with a teenage girl hes abducted he doesnt have to tell her anything but she must be involved even if she wasnt his accomplice she must at least have suspected something someone gave the cricket ball a hell of a whack and a cheer went up from the field banks stubbed out his cigarette youre probably right anyway if theres anything at all to connect lucy payne to what happened in the cellar well find out for the moment shes not going anywhere remember though unless we find out differently wed better remember that shes a victim first and foremost the soco teams might be spending weeks at the scene banks knew and very soon number the hill would resemble a house undergoing major structural renovations they would be taking in metal detectors laser lights infrared uv highpowered vacuums and pneumatic drills they would be collecting fingerprints flaked skin fibers dried secretions hairs paint chips visa bills letters books and personal papers they would strip the carpets and punch holes in the walls break up the cellar and garage floors and dig up the gardens and everything they gathered perhaps more than a thousand exhibits would have to be tagged entered in holmes and stored in the evidence room at millgarth their meals arrived and they tucked right in waving away the occasional fly the stew was hearty and mildly spiced after a few mouthfuls blackstone shook his head slowly funny paynes got no form dont you think most of them have something odd in their background waving their willies at schoolkids or a touch of sexual assault more than his jobs worth maybe hes just been lucky blackstone paused or weve not been doing our jobs properly remember that series of rapes out seacroft way two years or so back the seacroft rapist yes i remember reading about it we never did catch him you know you think it might have been payne possible isnt it the rapes stopped then girls started disappearing dna semen samples the seacroft rapist was an excretor and he didnt bother wearing a condom then check them against paynes and check where he was living at the time oh we will we will by the way blackstone went on one of the dcs who interviewed maggie forrest the woman who phoned in the domestic got the impression that she wasnt telling him everything oh what did he say that she seemed deliberately vague holding back she admitted she knew the paynes but said she knew nothing about them anyway he didnt think she was telling the complete truth as far as her relationship with lucy payne went he thinks theyre a lot closer than she would admit ill talk to her later said banks glancing at his watch he looked around at the blue sky the white and pink blossoms drifting from the trees the men in white on the cricket pitch christ ken i could sit here all afternoon he said but id better get back to the house to check on developments as she had feared maggie was unable to concentrate on her work for the rest of that day and alternated between watching the police activity out of her bedroom window and listening to the local radio for news reports what came through was scant enough until the area commander in charge of the case gave a press conference in which he confirmed that they had found the body of kimberley myers and that it appeared she had been strangled more than that he wouldnt say except that the case was under investigation forensic experts were on the scene and more details would be available shortly he stressed that the investigation was not yet over and appealed for anyone who had seen kimberley after eleven oclock on friday evening to come forward when the knock on her door and the familiar call its all right its only me came after halfpast three maggie felt relieved for some reason she had been worried about claire she knew that she went to the same school as kimberley myers and that terence payne was a teacher there she hadnt seen claire since kimberleys disappearance but imagined she must have been frantic with worry the two were about the same age and surely must know each other claire toth often called on her way home from school as she lived two doors down both her parents worked and her mother didnt get home until about halfpast four maggie also suspected that ruth and charles had suggested claires visits as a sneaky way of keeping an eye on her curious about the newcomer claire had first just dropped in to say hello then intrigued by maggies accent and her work she had become a regular visitor maggie didnt mind claire was a good kid and a breath of fresh air though she talked a mile a minute and maggie often felt exhausted when she left i dont think ive ever felt so awful claire said dropping her backpack on the living room floor and plunking herself down on the sofa legs akimbo this was odd for a start as she usually headed straight for the kitchen to the milk and chocolate chip cookies maggie fed her she pulled back her long tresses and tucked them behind her ears she was wearing her school uniform green blazer and skirt white blouse and gray socks which had slipped down around her ankles she had a couple of spots on her chin maggie noticed bad diet or time of the month you know it was all around school by lunchtime do you know mr payne hes my biology teacher and he lives across the street from us how could he the pervert when i think of what must have been going through his mind while he was teaching us about reproductive systems and dissecting frogs and all that stuff ugh she gave a shudder claire we dont know that he did anything yet all we know is that mr and mrs payne had a fight and that he hit her but theyve found kims body havent they and there wouldnt be all those policemen over the road if all hed done was hit his wife would there if all hed done was hit his wife maggie was often amazed at the casual acceptance of domestic violence even by a girlchild such as claire true enough she didnt mean it the way it sounded and would be horrified if she knew the details of maggies life back in toronto but still the language came so easily hit his wife minor not important youre quite right she said it is more than that but we dont know that mr payne was responsible for what happened to kimberley someone else might have done it no its him hes the one he killed all those girls he killed kim claire started crying and maggie felt awkward she found a box of tissues and went to sit next to her on the sofa claire buried her head in maggies shoulder and sobbed her thin veneer of teenage cool stripped away in a second im sorry she said sniffling i dont usually act like such a baby what is it maggie asked still stroking her hair what is it claire you can tell me you were her friend werent you kims claires lip trembled i just feel so awful i can understand that but you dont you cant dont you see see what that it was my fault it was my fault that kim got killed i should have been with her on friday i should have been with her and when claire buried her face in maggies shoulder again there came a loud knock at the door di annie cabbot sat at her desk still cursing banks under her breath and wishing she had never accepted the appointment to complaints and discipline even though it had been the only divisional opening available for her at the level of inspector after passing her boards of course she could have stayed in cid as a detective sergeant or gone back to uniform for a while as an inspector in traffic but she had decided that c amp d would be a worthwhile temporary step up until a suitable position became available in cid which banks had assured her wouldnt be long the western division was still undergoing some structural reorganization part of which involved staffing levels and for the moment cid was taking a backseat to more visible onthestreet and inyourface policing but their day would come this way at least she would gain experience at the rank of inspector the one good thing about the new appointment was her office western division had taken over the building adjoining the old tudorfronted headquarters part of the same structure knocked through the walls and redone the interior while annie didnt have a large room to herself like detective superintendent chambers she did have a partitioned space in the general area which gave her some degree of privacy and looked out over the marketplace like bankss office beyond her frostedglass compartment sat the two detective sergeants and three constables who along with annie and chambers made up the entire western division complaints and discipline department after all police corruption was hardly a hot issue around eastvale and about the most serious case she had worked on so far was that of a beat policeman accepting free toasted teacakes from the golden grill it turned out that he had been going out with one of the waitresses there and she was finding the way to his heart another waitress had become jealous and reported the matter to complaints and discipline it probably wasnt fair to blame banks annie thought standing at the window and looking down on the busy square and perhaps she was only doing so because of the vague dissatisfaction with their relationship that she was already feeling she didnt know what it was or why only that she was beginning to feel a little uncomfortable with it they hadnt seen each other that often because of the chameleon case of course and banks had sometimes been so tired that he fallen asleep even before but it wasnt that that bothered her so much as the easy familiarity their relationship seemed to be attaining when they were together they were behaving more and more like an old married couple and annie for one didnt want that ironic as it seemed the comfort and familiarity were making her feel distinctly uncomfortable all they needed was the slippers and the fireplace come to think of it in bankss cottage they even had those too annies phone rang it was detective superintendent chambers summoning her to his office next door she knocked and went in when he said enter the way he liked it chambers sat behind his messy desk a big man with the waistcoat buttons of his pinstripe suit stretched tight across his chest and belly she didnt know if his tie was covered with food stains or if it was supposed to look that way he had the kind of face that seemed to be wearing a perpetual sneer and small piggy eyes that annie felt undress her as she walked in his complexion was like a slab of beef and his lips were fleshy wet and red annie always half expected him to start drooling and slobbering as he spoke but he hadnt done it yet not one drop of saliva had found its way on to his green blotter he had a home counties accent which he seemed to think made him posh ah di cabbot please be seated sir annie sat as comfortably as she could careful to make certain that her skirt didnt ride too high over her thighs if shed known before she left for work that she was going to be summoned to see chambers she would have worn trousers ive just been handed a most interesting assignment chambers went on most interesting indeed one that i think will be right up your alley as they say annie had the advantage of him but didnt want to let it show assignment sir yes its about time you started pulling your weight around here di cabbot how long have you been with us now two months and in that time youve accomplished the case of constable chaplin and the toasted teacakes sir scandal narrowly averted a satisfactory resolution all around if i might say so chambers reddened yes well this one might just take the edge off your attitude inspector sir annie raised her eyebrows she couldnt stop herself baiting chambers he had the kind of arrogant selfimportant bearing that cried out for pricking she knew it could be bad for her career but even with the rekindling of her ambition annie had sworn to herself that her career wasnt worth anything if it cost her her soul besides she had an odd sort of faith that good coppers like banks detective superintendent gristhorpe and acc mclaughlin might have more say in her future than pillocks like chambers who everyone knew was a lazy slob just waiting for retirement still she hadnt been a lot more careful with banks at first either and it was only her good fortune that he had been charmed and seduced by her insubordination rather than angered by it gristhorpe poor man was a saint and she hardly ever saw red ron mclaughlin so she didnt get a chance to piss him off yes chambers went on warming to his task i think youll find this one a bit different from toasted teacakes thisll wipe the grin off your face perhaps youd care to tell me about it sir chambers tossed a thin folder toward her it slipped off the edge of the desk on to annies knees and then to the floor before she could catch it she didnt want to bend over and pick it up so that chambers could have a birdseye view of her knickers so she left it where it was chamberss eyes narrowed and they stared at one another for a few seconds but finally he eased himself out of his chair and picked it up himself the effort made his face red he slammed the file down harder on the desk in front of her seems a probationary pc in west yorkshire has overdone it a bit with her baton and they want us to look into it trouble is the chappie she overdid it with is suspected to be that chameleon killer theyve been after for a while which as im sure even you will realize puts a different complexion on things he tapped the folder the details such as they are at the moment are all in there do you think you can handle it no problem said annie on the contrary said chambers i think therell be plenty of problems itll be what they call a highprofile case and because of that my name will be on it im sure you understand that we cant have a mere inspector still wet behind the ears running a case of this importance if thats the case said annie why dont you investigate it yourself because i happen to be too busy at the moment said chambers with a twisted grin besides why own a dog and bark yourself absolutely why indeed of course said annie who happened to know that chambers couldnt investigate his way out of a paper bag i understand completely i thought you would chambers stroked one of his chins and as my names on it i want no cockups in fact if any heads roll over this business yours will be the first remember im only a hairsbreadth away from retirement so the last thing on my mind is career advancement you on the other hand well im sure you catch my drift annie nodded youll be reporting to me directly of course chambers went on daily reports required except in the event of any major developments in which case youre to report to me immediately understood i wouldnt have it any other way said annie chambers narrowed his eyes at her one day that mouth of yours will get you into serious trouble young lady so my father told me chambers grunted and shifted his weight in his chair theres one more thing yes i dont like the way this assignment was delivered to me theres something fishy about it what do you mean sir i dont know chambers frowned acting detective superintendent banks from cid is running our part of the chameleon investigation isnt he annie nodded and if my memory serves me well you used to work with him as a ds before coming over here didnt you again annie nodded well it might be nothing said chambers looking away from her at a point high on the wall summat and nowt as they say up here but on the other hand sir keep an eye on him play your cards close to your chest he looked at her chest as he spoke and annie gave an involuntary shudder she stood up and walked over to the door and another thing di cabbot annie turned sir chambers smirked this banks watch out for him hes got the reputation for being a bit of a ladies man in case you dont know that already annie felt herself flush as she left the office banks followed maggie forrest into the living room with its dark wainscoting and brooding landscapes in heavy gilt frames on the walls the room faced west and the lateafternoon sun cast dancing shadows of twisted foliage on the far walls it was not a feminine room but more like the kind to which the men withdrew for port and cigars in bbc period dramas and banks sensed that maggie was uncomfortable in it though he wasnt quite certain what gave him that impression noticing a whiff of smoke in the air and a couple of cigarette ends in the ashtray banks lit up offering maggie a silk cut she accepted he looked at the schoolgirl on the sofa head lowered bare knees close together one of them scabbed from a recent fall thumb in her mouth arent you going to introduce us he asked maggie detective banks acting detective superintendent detective superintendent banks this is claire toth a neighbor pleased to meet you claire said banks claire looked up at him and mumbled hello then she took a crumpled packet of ten embassy regal from her blazer pocket and joined the adult smokers banks knew this was no time for lectures on the dangers of smoking something was clearly wrong he could see by her red eyes and the streaks on her face that she had been crying ive missed something he said anyone care to fill me in claire went to school with kimberley myers said maggie naturally shes upset claire grew edgy her eyes flitting all over the place she took short nervous puffs on the cigarette holding it affectedly straight out with her first two fingers vertical letting go as she puffed then closing her fingers she didnt seem to be inhaling just doing it to look and act grown up banks thought or perhaps even to feel grown up because only god knew what turbulent feelings must be churning inside claire right now and it would only get worse he remembered tracys reaction to the murder of an eastvale girl deborah harrison just a few years ago they hadnt even known each other well had come from differing social backgrounds but they were about the same age and they had met and talked on several occasions banks had tried to protect tracy from the truth for as long as he could but in the end the best he could do was comfort her she was lucky she got over it in time some never do kim was my best friend claire said and i let her down what makes you think that banks asked claire flicked her eyes toward maggie as if seeking permission maggie nodded almost imperceptibly she was an attractive woman banks noticed not so much physically with the slightly long nose and pointed chin though he also admired her elfin looks and her trim boyish figure but it was the air of kindness and intelligence about her that struck him he could see it in her eyes and there was an artists grace in the economy of her simplest movements such as flicking ash from her cigarette in her large hands with the long tapered fingers i should have been with her claire said but i wasnt were you at the dance banks asked claire nodded and bit her lip did you see kimberley there kim i always called her kim all right kim did you see kim there we went together its not far just up past the roundabout and along town street near the rugby ground i know where you mean said banks its the congregational church opposite silverhill comprehensive right yes so you went to the dance together yes we walked up there and and take your time said banks noticing that she was about to cry again claire took a final puff at her cigarette then stubbed it out she didnt do a good job and the ashes continued to smolder she sniffled we were going to walk home together i mean people had said you know it was on the radio and television and my father told me we had to be careful stick together banks had been responsible for the warnings there was a fine line between panic and caution he knew and while he wanted to avert the kind of widespread paranoia that the yorkshire ripper case had whipped up for years in the early eighties he also wanted to make it clear that young women should be cautious after dark but short of instituting a curfew you cant force people to be careful what happened claire did you lose sight of her no it wasnt that i mean not really you dont understand help us to understand claire said maggie holding her hand we want to help us i should have been with her why werent you banks asked did you have an argument claire paused and looked away it was a boy she said finally kim was with a boy no me i was with a boy tears streamed down her cheeks but she pressed on nicky gallagher id fancied him for weeks and he asked me to dance then he said he wanted to walk me home kim wanted to leave just before eleven she had a curfew and normally id have gone with her but nicky he wanted to stay for a slow dance i thought there would be lots of people around i then she broke down in tears again and buried her head in maggies shoulder banks took a deep breath claires pain and guilt and grief were so real they broke over him in waves and made his breath catch in his chest maggie stroked her hair and muttered words of comfort but still claire let it all pour out finally she came to the end of her tears and blew her nose in a tissue im sorry she said really i am id give anything to live that night over again and do it differently i hate nicky gallagher claire said banks who was no stranger to guilt himself its not his fault and its certainly not yours im a selfish bitch i had nicky to walk me home i thought he might kiss me i wanted him to kiss me see im a slut too dont be silly said maggie the superintendent is right its not your fault but if id only if if if said banks but its true kim had no one so she had to walk home by herself and mr payne got her i bet he did awful things to her before he killed her didnt he ive read about people like him whatever happened that night said banks is not your fault then whose fault is it nobodys kim was in the wrong place at the wrong time it could have been banks stopped not a good idea he hoped claire hadnt picked up on the implication but she had me yes i know that i wish it had been you dont mean that claire said maggie yes i do then i wouldnt have to live with it it was because of me because she didnt want to be a gooseberry claire started crying again banks wondered if it could have been claire she was the right type blond and longlegged as so many young northern girls were was it as random as that or had payne had his eyes on kimberley myers all along jenny might have some theories on that he tried to picture what had happened payne parked in his car near the youth club perhaps knowing there was a dance on that night knowing the one hed had his eye on would be there he couldnt count on her going home alone of course but nothing ventured nothing gained there was always a chance a risk of course but it would have been worth it to him his hearts desire all the others were practice this was the real thing the one he had wanted right from the start there at school under his very eyes tormenting him day after day terence payne would also have known as banks did that kimberley lived about two hundred yards farther down the hill than her friend claire toth under the railway bridge and that there was a dark desolate stretch of road there nothing but a wasteland on one side and a wesleyan chapel on the other which would have been in darkness at that hour wesleyans not being noted for their wild latenight parties when banks had walked down there on saturday afternoon the day after kimberley had disappeared following the route she would have taken home from the dance he had thought it would have made an ideal pickup place payne would have parked his car a little ahead of kimberley and either jumped her or said hello the familiar safe mr payne from school somehow maneuvered her inside then chloroformed her and taken her back through the garage to the cellar perhaps banks realized now payne couldnt believe his luck when kimberley started walking home alone he would have expected her to be with her friend claire if not with others and could only hope that the others would live closer to the school than kimberley did and that she would end up alone for that final short but desolate stretch but with her being alone right from the start if he was careful and made sure that nobody could see he could even have offered her a lift she trusted him perhaps he had even being the good kind neighbor given her a lift before get in the van kimberley you know its not safe for a girl your age to be walking the streets alone at this hour ill take you home yes mr payne thank you very much mr payne youre lucky i happened by yes sir now fasten your seat belt superintendent im sorry said banks who had been lost in his imaginings is it all right if claire goes home her mother should be back by now banks looked at the child her world had shattered into pieces around her all weekend she must have been terrified that something like this had happened dreading the moment when the shadow of her guilt was made substance when her nightmares proved to be reality there was no reason to keep her here let her go to her mother he knew where she was if he needed to talk to her again just one more thing claire he said did you see mr payne at all on the evening of the dance no he wasnt at the dance no he wasnt parked outside the youth club not that i saw did you notice anyone at all hanging around no but i wasnt really looking did you see mrs payne at all mrs payne no why all right claire you can go home now is there any more news of lucy maggie asked after claire had left shes comfortable shell be fine you wanted to see me yes said banks just a few loose ends from this mornings interview thats all oh maggie fingered the neck of her tshirt nothing important i shouldnt think what is it one of the officers who interviewed you gave me the impression that he thought you werent telling the full story about your relationship with lucy payne maggie raised her eyebrows i see would you describe the two of you as close friends friends yes but close no i havent known lucy long when did you last see her yesterday she dropped by in the afternoon what did you talk about maggie looked down at her hands on her lap nothing really you know the weather work that sort of thing kimberley myers was tied naked in the cellar of the payne house and lucy had dropped by to talk about the weather either she really was innocent or her evil went way beyond anything banks had experienced before did she ever give you any cause to suspect that anything was wrong at home he asked maggie paused not in the way youre suggesting no what way am i suggesting i assume its to do with the murder with kimberleys murder banks leaned back in his armchair and sighed it had been a long day and it was getting longer maggie wasnt a convincing liar ms forrest he said right now anything at all we can find out about life at number thirtyfive the hill would be useful to us and i mean anything im getting the same impression as my colleague that youre keeping something back its nothing relevant how the hell would you know banks snapped at her he was shocked by the way she flinched at his harsh tone at the look of fear and submission that crossed her features and the way she wrapped her arms around herself and drew in ms forrest maggie he said more softly look im sorry but ive had a bad day and this is becoming very frustrating if i had a penny for every time someone told me their information was irrelevant to my investigation id be a rich man i know we all have secrets i know there are some things wed rather not talk about but this is a murder investigation kimberley myers is dead pc dennis morrisey is dead god knows how many more bodies well unearth there and i have to sit here and hear you tell me that you know lucy payne that she may have shared certain feelings and information with you and that you dont think its relevant come on maggie give me a break here the silence seemed to go on for ages until maggies small voice broke it she was being abused lucy he her husband he hit her terence payne abused his wife yes is that so strange if he can murder teenage girls hes certainly capable of beating his wife she told you this yes why didnt she do something about it its not as easy as you think im not saying its easy and dont assume that you know what i think what did you advise her i told her to seek professional help of course but she was dragging her heels banks knew enough about domestic violence to know that victims of it often find it very difficult to go to the authorities or get out they feel shame feel its their own fault feel humiliated and would rather keep it to themselves believing it will turn out all right in the end many of them have nowhere else to go no other lives to live and they are scared of the world outside the home even if the home is violent he also got the impression that maggie forrest knew firsthand what she was talking about the way she had flinched at his sharp tone the way she had been so reluctant to talk about the subject holding back these were all signs did she ever mention that she suspected her husband of any other crimes never but she was frightened of him yes did you visit their house yes sometimes notice anything unusual no nothing how did the two of them behave together lucy always seemed nervous edgy anxious to please did you ever see any bruises they dont always leave bruises but lucy seemed afraid of him afraid of putting a foot wrong thats what i mean banks made some notes is that all he asked what do you mean is that all you were holding back or is there something else theres nothing else banks stood up and excused himself do you see now he said at the door that what youve told me is relevant after all very relevant i dont see how terence payne has serious brain injuries hes in a coma from which he may never recover and even if he does he might remember nothing lucy payne will mend quite easily youre the first person whos given us any information at all about her and its information from which she could benefit how there are only two questions as regards lucy payne first was she involved and second did she know and keep quiet about it what youve just told me is the first thing that tips the scales in her favor by talking to me youve done your friend a service good evening ms forrest ill make sure theres an officer keeping an eye on the place why do you think im in danger you said terry not that sort of danger the press they can be very persistent and i wouldnt want you telling them what youve just told me leanne wray was sixteen when she disappeared from eastvale on friday the thirtyfirst of march she was five feet two inches tall weighed only six stone twelve pounds and was an only child living with her father christopher wray a bus driver and her stepmother victoria who stayed home in a terrace house just north of eastvale town center leanne was a pupil at eastvale comprehensive leannes parents later told police that they saw nothing wrong in letting their daughter go to the pictures that friday night even though they had heard of the disappearances of kelly matthews and samantha foster after all she was going with her friends and they said she had to be home by halfpast ten at the latest the one thing christopher and victoria might have objected to had they known about it was the presence in the group of ian scott christopher and victoria didnt like leanne hanging around with ian for one thing he was two years older than she was and that meant a lot at her age for another ian had a reputation as a bit of a troublemaker and had even been arrested twice by the police once for taking and driving away and once for selling ecstasy in the bar none also leanne was a very pretty girl slim and shapely with beautiful goldenblond hair an almost translucent complexion and longlashed blue eyes and they thought an older boy like ian could be interested in her for only one thing that he had his own flat was another black mark against him but leanne just liked to hang out with ians crowd ians girlfriend also with them that night was sarah francis age seventeen and the fourth in the party was mick blair age eighteen just a friend they all said they had walked around the center for a while after the film then gone for a coffee at the el toro though the police discovered on further investigation that they had actually been drinking in the old ship inn in an alley between north market street and york road and lied about it because both leanne and sarah were under age when pressed they all said that leanne had left them just outside the pub and headed home on foot at about a quarter past ten a journey that should have taken her no more than ten minutes but she never arrived leannes parents though angry and worried gave her until morning before calling the police and an investigation headed by banks soon went into full swing eastvale was papered with posters of leanne everyone who had been at the cinema in the old ship inn and in the town center that evening was questioned nothing they even ran a reconstuction but still nothing came of it leanne wray had vanished into thin air not one person reported seeing her since she left the old ship her three friends said they went to another pub the riverboat a crowded place that stayed open late and ended up at the bar none on the market square the closedcircuit tv cameras showed them turning up there at about halfpast twelve ian scotts flat was given the full soco treatment to see if any evidence of leannes presence could be found there but there was nothing if she had been there she had left no trace there were hints of tension in the wray home banks soon discovered and according to a school friend jill brown leanne didnt get on well with her stepmother they argued a lot she missed her real mother who had died of cancer two years ago and leanne had told her friend that she thought victoria ought to go out and get a job instead of sponging off her dad who didnt make a lot of money anyway things were always a bit tough financially jill said and leanne had to wear sturdier clothes than she thought fashionable and make them last longer than she would have wished when she was sixteen she got a saturday job in a town center boutique so she was able to buy nice clothes at a discount there was then the faintest hope that leanne had run away from a difficult situation and somehow hadnt heard the appeals until her shoulder bag was found in the shrubbery of a garden she would have passed on her route home the owners of the house were questioned but they turned out to be a retired couple in their seventies and were soon exonerated after the third day banks contacted his assistant chief constable ron mclaughlin and discussions with area commander philip hartnell of west yorkshire police followed within days the chameleon task force was created and banks was put in charge of north yorkshires part it meant more resources more manhours and more concentrated effort it also meant sadly that they believed a serial killer was at work and this was something the newspapers lost no time in speculating about leanne was an average pupil so her teachers said she could probably do better if she tried harder but she didnt want to make the effort she intended to leave school at the end of the year and get a job maybe in a clothes shop or a music shop like virgin or hmv she loved pop music and her favorite group was oasis no matter what people said about them leanne was a loyal fan her friends thought her a rather shy but easygoing person quick to laugh at peoples jokes and not given much to introspection she also suffered from mild asthma and carried an inhaler which had been found along with the rest of her personal things in the abandoned shoulder bag if the second victim samantha foster was a little eccentric leanne wray was about as ordinary a lowermiddleclass yorkshire lass as you could get yeah im all right to talk sir really come on in pc janet taylor didnt look all right to banks when he called at her flat after six that evening but then anyone who had that morning both fought off a serial killer and cradled her dying partners head on her lap had every right to look a bit peaky janet was pale and drawn and the fact that she was dressed all in black only served to accentuated her pallor janets flat was above a hairdressers on harrogate road not far from the airport banks could smell the setting lotion and herbal shampoo inside the groundfloor doorway he followed her up the narrow staircase she moved listlessly dragging her feet banks felt almost as weary as janet seemed he had just attended kimberley myerss postmortem and while it had yielded no surprises death by ligature strangulation dr mackenzie had found traces of semen in the vagina anus and mouth with any luck dna would link that to terence payne janet taylors living room showed signs of neglect typical to a single police officers dwelling banks recognized it all too well he tried to keep his own cottage clean as best he could but it was difficult sometimes when you couldnt afford a cleaning lady and you didnt have time yourself when you did have a bit of free time the last thing you wanted to do was housework still the small room was cozy enough despite the patina of dust on the low table and the tshirt and bra slung over the back of the armchair the magazines and occasional halfempty teacups there were three framed posters of old bogie movies on the walls casablanca the maltese falcon and the african queen and some photos on the mantelpiece including one of janet looking proud in her uniform standing between an older couple banks took to be her mother and father the potted plant on the windowsill looked to be on its last legs wilting and brown around the edges of the leaves a television set flickered in one corner the sound turned down it was a local news program and banks recognized the scene around the payne house janet moved the tshirt and bra from the back of the armchair sit down sir can we have the sound on for a minute banks asked who knows maybe well learn something sure janet turned the volume up but all they got was a repeat of ac hartnells earlier press statement when it was over janet got up and turned off the tv she still seemed slow in her movements slurred in her speech and banks imagined it was something to do with the tranquilizers the doctor would have given her or maybe it was the halfempty bottle of gin on the sideboard a plane took off from leeds and bradford airport and while the noise didnt actually shake the flat it was enough to rattle a glass and make conversation impossible for a minute or so it was also hot in the small room and banks felt the sweat gather on his forehead and under his arms its why the place is so cheap janet said after the noise had waned to a distant drone i dont mind it that much you get used to it sometimes i sit here and imagine im up there in one of them flying off to some exotic country she got up and poured herself a small gin adding some tonic from an open bottle of schweppes fancy a drink sir no thanks how are you coping janet sat down again and shook her head the funny thing is i dont really know im all right i suppose but i feel sort of numb as if ive just come around from an anesthetic and im still all padded in cotton wool or like im in a dream and im going to wake up tomorrow morning and everything will be different it wont though will it probably not said banks it might even be worse janet laughed well thanks for not giving me a load of bollocks banks smiled my pleasure look im not here to question your actions but i need to know what happened in that house do you feel up to talking about it sure banks noticed her body language the way she crossed her arms and seemed to draw in on herself and guessed that she wasnt up to it but he had to press on nonetheless i felt like a criminal you know she said what do you mean the way the doctor examined me bagged my clothes scraped under my fingernails its routine you know it is i know i know thats not what it feels like on the receiving end though i suppose not look im not going to lie to you janet this could be a serious problem it could be over in no time at all a minor bump in the road but it could stick around cause you problems with your career i think thats pretty much over dont you sir not necessarily not unless you want it to be i must admit i havent given it a lot of thought since you know she gave a harsh laugh funny thing is if this was america id be a hero what happened when you first received the call janet told him about the car fire and the call and finding lucy payne unconscious in the hallway in short halting sentences occasionally pausing for a sip of gin and tonic once or twice losing her thread and staring toward the open window sounds of evening traffic came up from the busy road and occasionally a plane landed or took off did you think she was seriously hurt serious enough not lifethreatening but i stayed with her while dennis checked around upstairs he came back with a blanket and a pillow i remember that i thought that was nice of him it surprised me dennis wasnt always nice its not a word id use to describe him no we disagreed a lot but i suppose we got on okay hes all right just a bit of a neanderthal and full of himself what did you do next dennis went in back the kitchen i mean someone had hit her and if it was her husband the odds were he was still in the house somewhere right probably feeling sorry for himself you stayed with lucy yes then what happened dennis called me so i left her she was as comfortable as i could make her with the blanket and the pillow the bleeding had pretty much stopped i didnt think she was in any real danger the ambulance was on its way you didnt sense any danger in the house danger no not at all i mean no more than you do in any domestic they can turn on you its happened but no okay what made you go down to the cellar did you think her husband might be there yes i suppose we must have why did dennis call you janet paused clearly embarrassed janet finally she looked at him youve been there down the cellar yes that picture on the door the woman i saw it dennis called me to see it it was his idea of a joke thats what i mean neanderthal i see was the door open the door to the cellar no it was closed but there was light showing under it a sort of flickering light you didnt hear anyone in there no did either of you call out before you went in identifying yourselves as police officers i dont remember okay janet youre doing fine carry on janets knees were pressed tight together and she was twisting her hands on her lap as she spoke like i said there was this flickering light the candles janet looked at him and gave a little shudder there was a bad smell too like drains did you have any reason to be afraid at this point not particularly it was creepy but we were proceeding cautiously as we always do in such situations routine he could have been armed the husband we were aware of that possibility but if you mean did we have any inkling of what wed find in there then no if we had wed have been out of there like a shot and brought in the troops dennis and me were neither of us the hero types she shook her head who went in first i did dennis kicked the door in and stood back like you know making a bow taking the piss what happened next she gave a sharp jerk of her head it was all so fast it was a blur i remember candles mirrors the girl crude drawings on the walls things i saw out of the corners of my eyes but theyre like images from a dream a nightmare her breathing became sharper and she curled up on the armchair legs under her arms wrapped around herself then he came dennis was right behind me i could feel his breath warm on my neck where did he come from i dont know behind a corner so fast what did dennis do he didnt have time to do anything he must have heard or sensed something to make him turn and the next thing i knew he was bleeding he screamed out thats when i pulled my baton he cut dennis again and the blood sprayed over me it was as if he hadnt noticed me or he didnt care hed get to me later but when he did i had my baton out and he tried to slash me but i deflected it then i hit him she started to sob and rubbed the backs of her hands against her eyes sorry dennis im so sorry its all right banks said take it easy janet youre doing fine he had his head on my lap i was trying to hold the artery closed like they teach in first aid but i couldnt do it id never done it before not with anyone real the blood just kept seeping out so much blood she sniffed and ran the back of her hand across her nose sorry thats okay youre doing fine janet before that before you tried to save dennis what else did you do i remember handcuffing the man to one of the pipes how many times did you hit him i dont remember more than once yes he wouldnt stop coming so i hit him again and again yes he kept getting up she started sobbing again when shed calmed she asked is he dead not yet the bastard killed dennis i know and when a mans partner is killed hes supposed to do something about it right if you dont its bad for business bad for detectives everywhere janet looked at him as if he were crazy what banks looked up at bogart as sam spade clearly the posters were there for show not as a result of any great passion for the films themselves and his pathetic attempt at lightening things up fell flat never mind he said i was just wondering what went through your mind nothing i didnt have time to stop and think hed cut dennis and he was going to cut me call it selfpreservation if you like but it wasnt a conscious thought i mean i didnt think id better hit him again or he might get up and cut me it wasnt like that what was it like i told you a blur i disabled the killer handcuffed him to one of the pipes and then i tried to keep dennis alive i didnt even look in paynes direction again to be honest i didnt give a damn what shape he was in only dennis janet paused and looked down at her hands clasped around the glass you know what really gets me id just been nasty to him all because hed been telling his damn sexist jokes to that fireman what do you mean wed been arguing thats all just before we got to the house i told him his mole was probably cancerous it was cruel of me i know hes a hypochondriac why did i do that why am i such a horrible person then it was too late i couldnt tell him i didnt mean it she cried again and banks thought it best to let her get it all out it would take more than one tearful session to purge her of her guilt but at least it was a start have you been in touch with the federation not yet do it tomorrow talk to your rep theyll be able to help with counseling if you want it and legal representation if it comes to that yes janet got to her feet a bit more unsteadily and went to pour herself another drink are you sure thats wise banks asked janet poured herself a stiff measure and sat down again tell me what else i should be doing sir should i be going to sit with denniss wife and kids should i try to explain to them how it happened how it was all my fault or should i just smash up my flat and go out on the town and pick a fight in some anonymous pub somewhere the way i feel like doing i dont think so this is by far the least harmful alternative to anything else id rather be doing right now banks realized that she had a point he had felt that way himself more than once and had even given in to the urge to go out on the town and pick a fight it hadnt helped he would be a hypocrite if he said he didnt understand plenty about finding oblivion at the bottom of a bottle there had been two periods in his life when he had sought solace that way the first was when he felt he was fast approaching burnout those last few months in london before the transfer to eastvale and the second was more than a year ago after sandra had left him the thing was people said it didnt work but it did as a shortterm solution for temporary oblivion there was nothing to match the bottle except perhaps heroin which banks hadnt tried maybe janet taylor was right and tonight drinking was the best thing she could do she was hurting and sometimes you had to do your hurting by yourself booze helped dull the pain for a while and eventually you passed out the hangover would be painful but that was for tomorrow right you are ill let myself out on impulse banks leaned over and kissed the top of janets head as he left her hair tasted of burned plastic and rubber that evening jenny fuller sat in her home office where she kept all the files and notes on the investigation on her computer no office having been made available to her at millgarth the office looked out over the green a narrow stretch of parkland between her street and the east side estate she could just see the lights of the houses through the spaces between the dark trees working so closely with banks had made jenny remember a lot of their history she had once tried to seduce him she recalled with embarrassment and he had resisted politely claiming to be a happily married man but he was attracted to her she knew that much he wasnt a happily married man anymore but now he had the girlfriend as jenny had come to call annie cabbot though she had never met her that had come about because jenny had spent so much time out of the country and hadnt even been around when banks and sandra separated if she had been well things might have been different instead she had embarked on a series of disastrous relationships one of the reasons she had spent so much time away she had finally admitted to herself after coming back from california this last time with her tail between her legs was to get away from banks from the easy proximity to him that tormented her so much while she pretended to be casual about the whole thing and much cooler than she felt and now they were working closely together with a sigh jenny returned her attention to her work her main problem thus far she realized had been an almost complete lack of forensic and crime scene information and without them it was damn near impossible to produce a decent threshold analysis an initial review that could serve as an investigative compass help the police know where to look let alone a more complex profile about all she had been able to work on was the victimology all this of course had given her detractors on the task force and they were legion plenty of ammunition england was still in the dark ages as far as the use of consultant psychologists and criminal profiling went jenny believed especially as compared to the usa partly this was because the fbi is a national force with the resources to develop national programs and britain has fifty or more separate police forces all operating piecemeal also profilers in the usa tend to be cops and are therefore more readily accepted in britain profilers are usually psychologists or psychiatrists and as such are distrusted by the police and the legal system in general consultant psychologists would be lucky to make it to the witness box in an english court jenny knew let alone be accepted as expert witnesses the way they are in the usa even if they did get in the box whatever evidence they gave would be looked at askance by judge and jury and the defense would wheel in another psychologist with a different theory the dark ages when it came right down to it jenny was well aware that most of the police she worked with regarded her as perhaps only one step up from a clairvoyant if that and that they only brought her in because it was easier than not doing so but still she struggled on while she was prepared to admit that profiling was still perhaps more of an art than a science and while a profile could rarely if ever point the finger at a specific killer she believed that it could narrow the field and help focus an investigation looking at pictures on a screen just didnt do it for jenny so she spread out the photographs again on her desk though she knew them all by heart kelly matthews samantha foster leanne wray melissa horrocks and kimberley myers all attractive blond girls between the ages of sixteen and eighteen there had been too many assumptions for jennys liking right from the start the prime one being that all five girls had been abducted by the same person or persons she could she had told banks and the team make out almost as a good a case for their not being linked even on such little information as she possessed young girls go missing all the time jenny had argued they have arguments with their parents and run away from home but banks told her that detailed and exhaustive interviews with friends family teachers neighbors and acquaintances showed that all the girls except perhaps leanne wray came from stable family backgrounds and apart from the usual rows about boyfriends clothes loud music and what have you nothing unusual or significant had happened in their lives prior to their disappearance these banks stressed were not your common or gardenvariety teenage runaways there was also the matter of the shoulder bags found abandoned close to where the girls had last been seen with the botched yorkshire ripper investigation still hanging like an albatross around its neck west yorkshire was taking no chances the number became four then five and no traces whatsoever could be found of any of the girls through the usual channels youth support groups the national missing persons helpline crimewatch uk reconstructions missing canuhelp posters media appeals and local police efforts in the end jenny accepted bankss argument and proceeded as if the disappearances were linked at the same time keeping clear notes of any differences between the individual circumstances before long she found that the similarities by far overwhelmed the differences victimology what did they have in common all the girls were young had long blond hair long legs and trim athletic figures it seemed to indicate the type of girl he liked jenny had said they all have different tastes by victim number four jenny had noticed the pattern of escalation nearly two months between victims one and two five weeks between two and three but only two and a half weeks between three and four he had been getting needier she thought at the time which meant he might also become more reckless jenny was also willing to bet that there was a fair degree of personality disintegration going on the criminal had chosen his haunts well openair parties pubs dances clubs cinemas and pop concerts were all places where you were very likely to find young people and they all had to get home one way or another she knew that the team referred to him as the chameleon and agreed that he showed a very high level of skill in taking his pick of victims without being seen all had been abducted at night in urban settings desolate stretches of city streets illlit and deserted he had also managed to stay well beyond the range of the cctv cameras that covered many city centers and town squares these days a witness said she saw samantha the bradford victim talking to someone through the window of a dark car and that was the only information jenny had about his possible method of abduction while the new years eve party the harrogate pop concert the cinema and university pub were common knowledge and obvious hunting grounds one question that had bothered jenny since saturday morning was how the killer had known about the youthclub dance after which kimberley myers had been abducted did he live in the neighborhood was he a church member had he simply happened to be passing at the time as far as she knew these things werent advertised outside the immediate community or even beyond the clubs actual members now she knew terence payne lived just down the street taught at the local comprehensive knew the victim also now some of the things she had learned that day were making sense of some of the other puzzling facts and questions she had gathered over the weeks of the five abductions four had occurred on a friday night or in the early hours of saturday morning which had led jenny to believe that the killer worked a regular fiveday week and that he devoted his weekends to his hobby the odd one out melissa horrocks had bothered her but now that she knew payne was a schoolteacher the tuesday eighteenth of april abduction made sense too it was the easter holidays and payne had more spare time on his hands from this scant information all this before the kimberley myers abduction jenny had surmised that they were dealing with an abductor who struck opportunistically he cruised suitable locations looking for a certain type of victim and when he found one he struck as fast as lightning there was no evidence that any of the girls had been stalked either on the evening of or prior to their abductions though it was a possibility she had to bear in mind but jenny was willing to bet that he had scouted the locations studied every way in and out every dark nook and cranny all the sight lines and angles there was always a certain level of risk involved in things such as this just enough perhaps to guarantee that quick surge of adrenaline that was probably part of the thrill now jenny knew that he had used chloroform to subdue his victims that decreased the level of risk jenny had also not been able until now to take into account any crime scene information because there hadnt been a crime scene available there could be plenty of reasons why no bodies turned up jenny had said they could have been dumped in remote locations and not discovered yet buried in the woods dumped in the sea or in a lake as the number of disappearances increased though and as time went on and still no bodies were found jenny found herself moving toward the theory that their man was a collector someone who plucks and savors his victims and perhaps then disposes of them the way a butterfly collector might gas and pin his trophies now she had seen the anteroom where the killer had buried or partially buried the bodies and she didnt think that had been done by chance or done badly she didnt think that the toes of one victim were sticking through the earth because terence payne was a sloppy worker they were like that because he wanted them that way it was part of his fantasy because he got off on it as they said back in america they were part of his collection his trophy room or his garden now jenny would have to rework her profile factoring in all the new evidence that would be pouring out of number the hill over the next few weeks she would also have to find out all she could about terence payne and there was another thing now jenny also had to consider lucy payne had lucy known what her husband was doing it was possible at least that she had her suspicions why didnt she come forward because of some misguided sense of loyalty perhaps this was her husband after all or fear if he had hit her with a vase last night he could have hit her at other times too warned her of the fate that awaited her if she told anyone the truth it would have been a living hell for lucy of course but jenny could believe her doing that plenty of women lived their whole lives in such hells but was lucy more involved again possible jenny had suggested tentatively that the method of abduction indicated the killer might have had a helper someone to lure the girl into the car or distract her while he came up from behind a woman would have been perfect for that role would have made the actual abduction easier young girls wary of men are far more likely to lean in the window and help when a woman pulls over at the curb were women capable of such evil definitely and if they were ever caught the outrage against them was far greater than against any male you only had to look at the publics reactions to myra hindley rosemary west and karla homolka to see that so was lucy payne a killer banks felt boneweary when he pulled up in the narrow lane outside his gratly cottage close to midnight that night he knew he should have probably taken a hotel room in leeds as he had done before or accepted ken blackstones offer of the sofa but he had very much wanted to go home tonight even if annie had refused to come over and he didnt mind the drive too much it helped relax him there were two messages waiting for him on the machine the first was from tracy saying shed heard the news and hoped he was all right and the second was from leanne wrays father christopher who had seen the press conference and the evening news and wanted to know if the police had found his daughters body at the payne house banks didnt answer either of them for one thing it was too late and for another he didnt want to talk to anybody he could deal with them all in the morning now that he was home he was even glad that annie wasnt coming the idea of company tonight even annies didnt appeal and after all hed seen and thought about today the idea of sex held about as much interest as a trip to the dentists instead he poured himself a generous tumbler of laphroaig and tried to find some suitable music he needed to listen to something but he didnt know what usually he had no trouble finding what he wanted in his large collection but tonight he rejected just about every cd he picked out he knew he didnt want to listen to jazz or rock or anything too wild and primitive like that wagner and mahler were out as were all the romantics beethoven schubert rachmaninoff and the rest the entire twentieth century was out too in the end he went for rostropovichs rendition of bachs cello suites outside the cottage the low stone wall between the dirt lane and the beck bulged out and formed a little parapet over gratly falls which was just a series of terraces none more than a few feet in height running diagonally through the village and under the little stone bridge that formed its central gathering place since he had moved into the cottage the previous summer banks had got into the habit of standing out there last thing at night if the weather was good enough or even sitting on the wall dangling his legs over the beck and enjoying his nightcap and a cigarette before bed the night air was still and smelled of hay and warm grass the dale below him was sleeping one or two farmhouse lights shone on the far valley side but apart from the sounds of sheep in the field across the beck and night animals from the woods all was quiet he could just make out the shapes of distant fell sides in the dark humpbacked or jagged against the night sky he thought he heard a curlews eerie trill from high up on the moors the new moon gave sparse light but there were more stars than he had seen in a long time as he watched a star fell through the darkness leaving a thin milky trail banks didnt make a wish he felt depressed the elation he had expected to feel on finding the killer somehow eluded him he had no sense of an ending of an evil purged in some odd way he felt the evil was just beginning he tried to shake off his sense of apprehension he heard a meow beside him and looked down it was the skinny marmalade cat from the woods starting that spring it had come over on several occasions when banks was outside alone late at night the second time it appeared he had brought it some milk which it lapped up before disappearing back into the trees he had never seen it anywhere else or at any other time than night once he had even bought some cat food to be more prepared for its visit but the cat hadnt touched it all it would do was meow drink the milk strut around for a few minutes and go back where it came from banks fetched a saucer of milk and set it down refilling his own glass at the same time the cats eyes shone amber in the darkness as it looked up at him before bending to drink banks lit his cigarette and leaned against the wall resting his glass on its rough stone surface he tried to purge his mind of the days terrible images the cat rubbed against his leg and ran off back into the woods rostropovich played on and bachs precise mathematical patterns of sound formed an odd counterpoint to the wild roaring music of gratly falls so recently swelled by the spring thaw and for a few moments at least banks succeeded in losing himself according to her parents melissa horrocks aged seventeen who failed to return home after a pop concert in harrogate on the eighteenth of april was going through a rebellious phase steven and mary horrocks had only the one daughter a late blessing in marys midthirties steven worked in the office of a local dairy while mary had a parttime job in an estate agents office in the city center around the age of sixteen melissa developed an interest in the kind of theatrical pop music that used satanism as its main stage prop though friends advised steven and mary that it was harmless enough just youthful spirits and that it would soon pass they were nonetheless alarmed when she started altering her appearance and letting her schoolwork and athletics slip melissa first dyed her hair red got a stud in her nose and wore a lot of black her bedroom wall was adorned with posters of skinny sataniclooking pop stars such as marilyn manson and occult symbols her parents didnt understand about a week before the concert melissa decided she didnt like the red hair so she reverted to her natural blond coloring there was a good chance banks thought later that if shed kept it red that might have saved her life which also led banks to think that she hadnt been stalked before her abduction or at least not for long the chameleon wouldnt stalk a redhead harrogate a prosperous victorianstyle north yorkshire city of about seventy thousand known as a conference center and a magnet for retired people wasnt exactly the typical venue for a beelzebubs bollocks concert but the band was new and had yet to win a major recording contract they were working their way up to bigger gigs there had been the usual calls for a ban from retired colonels and the kind of old busybodies who watch all the filth on television so they can write letters of protest but in the end this came to no avail about five hundred kids wandered into the converted theater including melissa and her friends jenna and kayla the concert ended at halfpast ten and the three girls stood around outside for a while talking about the show the three of them split up at about a quarter to eleven and went their separate ways it was a mild night so melissa said she was going to walk she didnt live far from the city center and most of her walk home took her along the busy welllit ripon road two people later came forward to say they saw her close to eleven oclock walking south by the junction of west park and beech grove to get home she would turn down beech grove and then turn off after about a hundred yards but she never got there at first there was a faint hope that melissa might have run away from home given the running battle with her parents but steven and mary along with jenna and kayla assured banks this could not be the case the two friends in particular said they shared everything and they would have known if she was planning on running away besides she had none of her valued possessions with her and she told them she was looking forward to seeing them the next day at the victoria centre then there was the satanic element not to be lightly dismissed when a girl had disappeared the members of the band were interviewed along with as many audience members as could be rounded up but that went nowhere too even banks had to admit when examining the statements later that the whole thing had been pretty tame and harmless the black magic merely theater as it had been for black sabbath and alice cooper in his day beelzebubs bollocks didnt even bite the heads off chickens on stage when melissas black leather shoulder bag was found in some bushes two days after her disappearance as if it had been tossed from the window of a moving car money still intact the case came to the attention of bankss chameleon task force like kelly matthews samantha foster and leanne wray before her melissa horrocks had disappeared into thin air jenna and kayla were devastated just before melissa had walked off into the night they had joked kayla said about perverts but melissa had pointed to her chest and said the occult symbol on her tshirt would ward off evil spirits the incident room was crowded at nine oclock on tuesday morning over forty detectives sat on the edges of their desks or leaned against the walls smoking was not permitted in the building and many of them chewed gum or fidgeted with paper clips or rubber bands instead most had been on the task force since the beginning and they had all put in long hours invested a lot of themselves in the job emotionally as well as physically it had taken its toll on all of them banks happened to know that one unfortunate dcs marriage had broken up over the hours he spent away from home and the neglect he displayed toward his wife it would have happened some other time anyway banks told himself but an investigation like this one can put the pressure on can push events to a crisis point especially if that crisis point isnt too far away to start with these days banks also felt that he was approaching his own crisis point though he had no idea where it was or what would happen when he got there now there was at least some sense of progress no matter how unclear things still seemed and the air buzzed with speculation they all wanted to know what had happened the mood was mixed on the one hand it looked as if they had their man on the other one of their own had been killed and his partner was about to be put through the hoops when banks strode in somewhat the worse for wear after another poor nights sleep despite a third laphroaig and the second disc of bachs cello sonatas the room hushed everyone waiting to hear the news he stood next to ken blackstone beside the photographs of the girls pinned to the corkboard okay he said ill do my best to explain where we are with this the socos are still at the scene and it looks as if theyll be there for a long time yet so far theyve uncovered three bodies in the cellar anteroom and it doesnt look as if theres room for any more theyre digging in the back garden for the fourth none of the victims has been identified yet but ds nowak says the bodies are all young and female so its reasonable to assume for the moment that theyre the young girls who went missing we should be able to make some headway on identification later today by checking dental records dr mackenzie performed the postmortem on kimberley myers late yesterday and found that she had been subdued by chloroform but death was due to vagal inhibition caused by ligature strangulation yellow plastic fibers from the clothesline were embedded in the wound he paused then sighed and went on she was also raped anally and vaginally and forced to perform fellatio what about payne sir someone asked is the bastard going to die the last i heard was that they had to operate on his brain terence payne is still in a coma and theres no telling how long that might last or how it will end by the way we now know that terence payne lived and taught in seacroft before he moved to west leeds in september the year before last at the start of the school year dci blackstone has him in the frame for the seacroft rapist so were already checking dna ill want a team to go over the casework on that one with the local cid ds stewart can you get that organized right away sir thatll be chapeltown cid chapeltown would be hot to trot on this banks knew it was a red inker for them an easy way of closing several open case files at one fell swoop weve also checked paynes car registration with dvla in swansea he was using false plates his own plates end in kwt just like the witness in the samantha foster disappearance saw the socos found them hidden in the garage that means bradford cid must have already interviewed him id imagine it was after that he switched to the false ones what about dennis morrisey someone asked pc morrisey died of blood loss caused by the severing of his carotid artery and jugular vein according to dr mackenzies examination at the scene hell be doing the pm later today as you can imagine theres getting to be quite a queue down at the mortuary hes looking for assistance anyone interested nervous laughter rippled through the room what about pc taylor one of the detectives asked pc taylors coping said banks i talked to her yesterday evening she was able to tell me what happened in the cellar as you all probably know shell be under investigation so lets try to keep that one at arms length a chorus of boos came up from the crowd banks quieted them down its got to be done he said unpopular as it is were none of us above the law but lets not let that distract us our job is far from over in fact its just beginning theres going to be a mountain of stuff coming out of forensics examinations at the house itll all have to be tagged logged and filed holmes is still in operation so the green sheets will have to be filled out and fed in banks heard carol houseman the trained holmes operator groan oh bugger it sorry carol he said with a sympathetic smile needs must in other words despite whats happened were still very much in business for the time being we need to gather the evidence we need to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that terence payne is the killer of all five missing girls what about his wife someone asked she must have known just what ken blackstone had said we dont know that said banks for the moment shes a victim but her possible involvement is one of the things well be looking into were already aware that he might have had an accomplice she should be able to talk to me later this morning banks glanced at his watch and turned to ds filey in the meantime ted id like you to put a team together to go over all the statements and reinterview everyone we talked to when the girls were first reported missing family friends witnesses everyone okay right you are guv said ted filey banks hated being called guv but he let it go by get some photographs of lucy payne and show one to everyone you talk to see if anyone remembers seeing her in connection with any of the missing girls more mutterings broke out and banks quieted them down again for the moment he said i want you all to keep in close touch with our office manager ds grafton here a cheer went up and ian grafton blushed hell be issuing actions and ties and therell be plenty of them i want to know what terence and lucy payne eat for breakfast and how regular their bowel movements are dr fuller suggested that payne would have kept some sort of visual record of his deeds videos most likely but maybe just ordinary still photographs nothings been found at the scene yet but well need to know if the paynes ever owned or rented video equipment banks noticed a number of skeptical looks at the mention of jenny fuller typical narrowminded thinking in his opinion consultant psychologists might not be possessed with magic powers and able to name the killer within hours but in bankss experience they could narrow the field and target the area where the offender may live why not use them at best they could help and at worst they did no harm remember he went on five girls were abducted raped and murdered five girls you dont need me to tell you any one of them could have been your daughter we think weve got the man responsible but we cant be sure he acted alone and until we can prove it was him no matter what shape hes in therell be no slacking on this team got it the assembled detectives muttered yes sir then the group they started to split up some drifting outside for a muchneeded cigarette others settling back at their desks one more thing said banks dcs bowmore and singh in my office now after a brief meeting with area commander hartnell who definitely gave her the eye and banks who seemed uncomfortable about the whole thing di annie cabbot read over pc janet taylors file as she waited in the small office assigned her hartnell himself had decided that as janet taylor was coming in voluntarily and as she wasnt under arrest an office would be a far less threatening environment for the preliminary talk than a standard grungy interview room annie was impressed by pc taylors record there was little doubt that she would find a place in the accelerated promotion course and make the rank of inspector within five years if she was cleared of all charges a local girl from pudsey janet taylor had four alevels and a degree in sociology from the university of bristol she was just twentythree years old unmarried and living alone janet had high scores on all her entrance exams and in the opinions of those who had examined her she showed a clear grasp of the complexities of policing a diverse society along with the sort of cognitive skills and problemsolving abilities that augured well for a detective she was in good health and listed her hobbies as squash tennis and computers throughout her student career she had spent her summers working for security at the white rose centre in leeds both manning the cameras and patrolling the shopping precinct janet had also done voluntary community work for her local church group helping the elderly all of this sounded quite dull to annie who grew up in an artists commune near st ives surrounded by oddballs hippies and weirdos of all sorts annie had also come late to the police and though she had a degree it was in art history not much use in the force and she hadnt got on the apc because of an incident at her previous county when three fellow officers had attempted to rape her at a party following her promotion to sergeant one succeeded before she had managed to fight them off traumatized annie had not reported the incident until the following morning by which time she had spent hours in the bath washing away all evidence the dcs had accepted the words of the three officers against hers and while they admitted that things had got a little out of hand with a drunken annie leading them on they said they had retained their control and no sexual assault had taken place for a long time annie hadnt much cared about her career and no one had been more surprised than she had at the rekindling of her ambition which had meant dealing with the rape and its aftermath more complicated and traumatic than anyone but her really knew but it had happened and now she was a fully fledged inspector investigating a politically dodgy case for detective superintendent chambers who was clearly scared stiff of the assignment himself a brief tap at the door was followed by the entry of a young woman with short black hair which looked rather dry and lifeless they told me you were in here she said annie introduced herself sit down janet janet sat and tried to make herself comfortable on the hard chair she looked as if she hadnt slept all night which didnt surprise annie in the least her face was pale and there were dark semicircles under her eyes perhaps beyond the ravages of sleeplessness and abject terror janet taylor was an attractive young woman she certainly had beautiful eyes the color of loam and the kind of cheekbones that models hang their careers on she also seemed a very serious person weighed down by the gravity of life or perhaps that was a result of recent events how is he janet asked who you know payne still unconscious will he survive they dont know yet janet okay i mean its just that well i suppose it makes a difference you know to my case if he dies yes it does but dont lets worry about that for the time being i want you to tell me what happened in the paynes cellar then ill ask you a few questions finally i want you to write it all down in a statement this isnt an interrogation janet im sure you went through hell down in that cellar and nobody wants to treat you like a criminal but there are procedures to be followed in cases like this and the sooner we get going the better annie wasnt being entirely truthful but she wanted to set janet taylor as much at ease as possible she knew she would have to push and prod a bit maybe even go in hard now and again it was her interrogation technique after all it was often under pressure of some sort that the truth slipped out she would play it by ear but if she needed to badger janet taylor a bit then so be it damn chambers and hartnell if she was going to do the bloody job she was going to do it properly dont worry said janet i havent done anything wrong im sure you havent tell me about it as janet taylor spoke sounding rather bored and detached as if she had been through this all too many times already or as if she were recounting someone elses story annie watched her body language janet shifted in her chair often twisted her hands on her lap and when she got to the real horror she folded her arms and her voice became flatter lacking expression annie let her go on making notes on points she thought relevant janet didnt so much come to a definite end as trail off after she said she had settled to wait for the ambulance cradling pc morriseys head on her lap and feeling the warm blood seep through on her thighs as she spoke about this her eyebrows rose and wrinkled the center of her forehead and tears formed in her eyes annie let the silence stretch for a while after janet had fallen silent then she asked if janet would like a drink she asked for water and annie brought her some from the fountain the room was hot and annie got some for herself too just a couple of things janet then ill leave you alone to write your statement janet yawned she put her hand to her mouth but didnt apologize normally annie would have taken a yawn as a sign of fear or nervousness but janet taylor had good reason to be tired so she didnt make too much of it on this occasion what were you thinking about while it was happening annie asked thinking im not sure i was thinking at all just reacting did you remember your training janet taylor laughed but it was forced training doesnt prepare you for something like that what about your baton training i didnt have to think about that it was instinctive you were feeling threatened damn right i was he was killing dennis and he was going to kill me next hed already killed the girl on the bed how did you know she was dead what kimberley myers how did you know she was dead you said it all happened so fast you barely caught a glimpse of her before the attack i i suppose i just assumed i mean she was lying there naked on the bed with a yellow rope around her neck her eyes were open it was a reasonable assumption to make okay said annie so you never thought of yourself as saving her as rescuing her no it was what was happening to dennis that concerned me and what you thought was going to happen to you next yes janet sipped some more water a little of it dripped down her chin on to the front of her gray tshirt but she didnt seem to notice so you got your baton out what next i told you he came at me with this crazy look in his eye and he lashed out at you with his machete yes i deflected the blow with my baton the side against my arm like they taught us and then when hed swung before he could bring it back into position again i swung out and hit him where did the first blow land on his head where exactly on his head i dont know i wasnt concerned about that but you wanted to put him out of commission didnt you i wanted to stop him from killing me so youd want to hit him somewhere effective well im righthanded so i suppose i must have hit him on the left side of his head somewhere around the temple did he go down no but he was dazed he couldnt get his machete in position to strike again where did you hit him next the wrist i think to disarm him yes did you succeed yes what did you do next i kicked the machete into the corner what did payne do he was holding his wrist and cursing me youd hit him once on the left temple and once on the wrist by this time thats right what did you do next i hit him again where on the head why to incapacitate him was he standing at this point yes hed been on his knees trying to get the machete but he got up and came at me he was unarmed now yes but he was still bigger and stronger than me and he had this insane look in his eyes as if he had strength to spare so you hit him again yes same spot i dont know i used my baton in the same way so yes i suppose so unless he was half turned away was he i dont think so but its possible i mean it was you who suggested it i suppose its possible but i dont see why you didnt hit him on the back of his head at any point i dont think so janet had started to sweat now annie could see beads of it around her hairline and a dark stain spreading slowly under her arms she didnt want to put the poor woman through much more but she had her job to do and she could be hard when she needed to be what happened after you hit payne on the head a second time nothing what do you mean nothing nothing he kept coming so you hit him again yes i took the baton in both hands like a cricket bat so i could hit him harder he had nothing to defend himself with at this time right only his arms but he didnt raise them to ward off the blow he was holding his wrist i think it was broken i heard something crack so you had free rein to hit him as hard as you liked he kept coming at me you mean he kept moving toward you yes and calling me names what sort of names filthy names and dennis was groaning bleeding i wanted to go to him to see if i could help but i couldnt do anything until payne stopped moving you didnt feel you could restrain him with handcuffs at this point no way id already hit him two or three times but it seemed to have no effect he kept coming if id gone in close and hed got hold of me hed have strangled the life out of me even with his broken wrist yes he could have got his arm across my throat okay annie paused to make some notes on the pad in front of her she could almost smell janet taylors fear and she wasnt sure if it was residual from the cellar or because of present circumstances she drew out the notemaking process until janet started shifting and fidgeting then she asked how many times do you think you hit him in all janet turned her head to one side i dont know i wasnt counting i was fighting for my life defending myself against a maniac five times six times i told you i dont remember as many times as i needed to make him stop coming he just wouldnt stop coming at me janet broke into sobs and annie let her cry it was the first time emotion had broken through the shock and it would do her good after a minute or so janet collected herself and sipped some more water she seemed embarrassed to have broken down in front of a colleague ive almost finished now janet said annie then ill leave you be okay you managed to get him to stay down didnt you yes he fell against the wall and slid down was he still moving then not very much he was sort of twitching and breathing heavily there was blood on his mouth final question janet did you hit him again after he went down her eyebrows shot together in fear no i dont think so what did you do i handcuffed him to the pipe and then then i went to help dennis are you sure you didnt hit him again after he went down just to make sure janet looked away i told you i dont think so why would i annie leaned forward and rested her arms on the desk try to remember janet but janet shook her head its no good i dont remember okay said annie getting to her feet interview over she pushed a statement sheet and a pen in front of janet write out what youve told me in as much detail as you can remember janet grasped the pen what happens next when youve finished love go home and have a stiff drink hell have two janet managed a weak but genuine smile as annie left and shut the door behind her dcs bowmore and singh looked shifty when they walked into bankss temporary millgarth office as well they might he thought sit down he said they sat what is it sir asked dc singh attempting lightness got a job for us banks leaned back in his chair and linked his hands behind his head in a manner of speaking he said if you call sharpening pencils and emptying the wastepaper baskets a job their jaws dropped sir bowmore began but banks held his hand up a car number plate ending in kwt ring any bells sir kwt kathryn wendy thurlow yes sir said singh its the number bradford cid got in the samantha foster investigation bingo said banks now correct me if im wrong but didnt bradford send us copies of all their files on the samantha foster case when this team was set up yes sir including the name of everyone in the area who owned a dark car with the number plate ending in kwt over a thousand sir over a thousand indeed bradford cid interviewed them all and guess whos among that thousand terence payne sir answered singh again bright lad said banks now when bradford cid were working on that case did they have any links to any similar crimes no sir answered bowmore this time there was the girl went missing from the new years party in roundhay park but there was no reason to link them together at the time right said banks so why do you think i issued an action shortly after this task force was set up to go over all the evidence on the previous cases including the disappearance of samantha foster because you thought there was a link sir said dc singh not just me said banks but yes three girls as it was then then four then five the possibility of a link was becoming stronger and stronger now guess who was assigned to go over the evidence in the samantha foster case singh and bowmore looked at each other then frowned and looked at banks we were sir they said as one including reinterviewing the list of car owners bradford cid got from the dvla over a thousand sir indeed said banks but am i correct in assuming that you had plenty of help that the action was split up and that the letter p was among those alphabetically assigned to you because thats what it says in my files p for payne there were still a lot to go sir we havent got around to them all yet you havent got around to them yet this was at the beginning of april over a month ago youve been dragging your feet a bit havent you its not as if it was the only action assigned us sir said bowmore look said banks i dont want any excuses for one reason or another you failed to reinterview terence payne but it wouldnt have made any difference sir bowmore argued i mean bradford cid didnt exactly mark him down as their number one suspect did they what was he going to tell us that he didnt tell them he wasnt going to decide to confess just because we went to talk to him was he banks ran his hand over his hair and muttered a silent curse he was not a natural authoritarian far from it and he hated this part of the job dishing out bollockings having been on the receiving end of plenty himself but if anyone ever did these two prize pillocks deserved the worst he could give is this supposed to be an example of you using your initiative he said because if it is youd have been better advised to stick to procedure and follow orders but sir singh said he was a schoolteacher newly married nice house we did read over all the statements im sorry said banks shaking his head am i missing something here what do you mean sir well im not aware that dr fuller had given us any sort of profile of the person we were looking for at this point dc singh grinned hasnt given us much of anything when you get right down to it has she sir so what made you think you could rule out a recently married schoolteacher with a nice house singhs jaw opened and shut like a fish mouth bowmore looked down at his shoes well banks repeated im waiting look sir said singh im sorry but we just hadnt got around to him yet have you talked to any of the people on your list a couple sir muttered singh the ones bradford cid had marked down as possibles there was one bloke had a previous for flashing but he had a solid alibi for leanne wray and melissa horrocks we checked that out sir so when youd nothing better to do youd fill in a bit of overtime by ticking a name or two off the list names that bradford cid had put question marks beside is that it thats not fair sir bowmore argued not fair ill tell you whats not bloody fair dc bowmore its not bloody fair that at least five girls that we know of so far have most likely died at the hands of terence payne thats whats not fair but he wouldnt have admitted it to us sir singh protested youre supposed to be detectives arent you look let me put it simply if youd gone around to paynes house when you were supposed to say last month then one or two more girls might not have died you cant put that down to us sir bowmore protested red in the face thats just not on oh isnt it what if youd seen or heard something suspicious while you were in the house interviewing him what if your finely developed detectives instinct had picked up on something and youd asked to have a look around bradford cid didnt i dont give a damn what bradford cid did or didnt do they were examining a single case the disappearance of samantha foster you on the other hand were investing a case of serial abductions if youd had any reason at all to look in the cellar youd have had him believe me even if youd poked around his video collection it might have raised your suspicions if youd looked at his car youd have noticed the false plates the ones hes using now end in ngv not kwt that might have rung a few alarm bells dont you think instead you decide on your own that this action isnt worth rushing on god knows what else you thought was so much more important well they both looked down nothing to say for yourselves no sir muttered a tightlipped dc singh ill even give you the benefit of the doubt said banks ill assume that you were pursuing other angles and not just skiving off but you still screwed up but he mustve lied to bradford cid bowmore argued hed only have lied to us too you just dont get it do you said banks ive told you youre supposed to be detectives you dont take anything at face value maybe youd have noticed something about his body language maybe youd have caught him out in a lie maybe god forbid you might have even checked one of his alibis and found it didnt hold up maybe just something might have made you a little bit suspicious about terence payne am i making myself clear you had at least two maybe three more things to go on than bradford had and you blew it now youre off the case both of you and this is going on your records clear bowmore looked daggers at banks and singh seemed close to tears but banks had no sympathy for either of them at that moment he felt a splitting headache coming on get the hell out of here he said and dont let me see you in the incident room again maggie hid herself away in the sanctuary of ruths studio spring sunshine spilled through the window which she opened an inch or two to let in some air it was a spacious room at the back of the house originally the third bedroom and while the view through the window left a lot to be desired a grotty litterstrewn back passage and the council estate beyond the room itself was perfect for her needs upstairs in addition to the three rooms toilet and bathroom there was also a loft accessed by a pulldown ladder that ruth said she used for storage maggie didnt store anything there in fact she never even went up there as she felt disturbed by spidery dusty neglected places the mere thought of which made her shiver she had allergies too and the slightest hint of dust made her eyes burn and her nose itch another bonus today was that upstairs at the back of the house she wasnt constantly distracted by all the activity out on the hill it was open to traffic again but number was screened off and people kept coming and going bringing out boxes and bags of god knew what she couldnt quite put it out of her mind of course but she didnt read the newspaper that morning and she tuned the radio to a classical station that had few news breaks she was preparing to illustrate a new coffeetable selection of grimms fairy tales working on thumbnails and preliminary sketches and what nasty gruesome little stories they were she discovered on reading through them for the first time since childhood back then they had seemed remote cartoonish but now the horror and the violence seemed all too real the sketch she had just finished was for rumpelstiltskin the poison dwarf who helped anna spin straw into gold in exchange for her firstborn her illustration was a bit too idealized she thought a sadlooking girlchild at a spinning wheel with just the suggestion of two burning eyes and the distorted shadow of the dwarf in the background she could hardly use the scene where he stamped so hard his foot went through the floor and his leg came off as he tried to pull it out matteroffact violence no dwelling on blood and guts the way so many films did these days special effects for the sake of it but violence nonetheless now she was working on rapunzel and her preliminary sketches showed the young girl another firstborn taken from her true parents letting her long blond hair down from the tower where she was held captive by a witch another happy ending with the witch being devoured by a wolf except for her talonlike hands and feet which it spat out to be eaten by worms and beetles she was just trying to get the rope of hair and the angle of rapunzels head right so that it would at least look as if she might be able support the princes weight when the telephone rang maggie picked up the studio extension yes margaret forrest it was a womans voice am i speaking to margaret forrest whos asking is that you margaret my names lorraine temple you dont know me what do you want i understand that it was you who dialed in the emergency call on the hill yesterday morning a domestic disturbance who are you are you a reporter oh didnt i say yes i write for the post im not supposed to talk to you go away look im just down the street margaret im calling on my mobile the police wont let me near your house so i wondered if youd care to meet me for a drink or something its almost lunchtime theres a nice pub ive nothing to say to you ms temple so theres no point in our meeting you did report a domestic disturbance at number thirtyfive the hill early yesterday morning didnt you yes but then i have got the right person what made you think it was a domestic im sorry i dont understand i dont know what you mean you heard noises didnt you raised voices breaking glass a thud how do you know all this im just wondering what made you jump to the conclusion that it was a domestic disturbance thats all i mean why couldnt it have been someone grappling with a burglar for example i dont know what youre getting at oh come on margaret its maggie isnt it can i call you maggie maggie said nothing she had no idea why she didnt just hang up on lorraine temple look maggie lorraine went on give me a break here ive got my living to make were you a friend of lucy paynes is that it do you know something about her background something the rest of us dont know i cant talk to you anymore maggie said and then she did hang up but something lorraine temple had said struck a chord and she regretted doing so despite what banks had told her if she were to be lucys friend then the press might prove an ally not an enemy she might have to speak to them to mobilize them in lucys support public sympathy would be very important and in that the media might be able to help her of course all this depended on the approach the police took if banks believed what maggie had told him about the abuse and if lucy confirmed it as she would then they would realize that she was more of a victim than anything else and just let her go as soon as she was well again lorraine temple was persistent enough to call back a couple of minutes later come on maggie she said wheres the harm all right said maggie ill meet you for a drink ten minutes i know the place you mean its called the woodcutter at the bottom of the hill right right ten minutes ill be there maggie hung up while she was still close to the phone she took out the yellow pages and looked up a local florist she arranged to have some flowers delivered to lucy in her hospital bed along with a note wishing her well before she left she had one last quick look at her sketch and noticed something curious about it rapunzels face it wasnt the allpurpose fairytale princess sort of face you saw in so many illustrations it was individual unique something maggie prided herself on more than that though rapunzels face halfturned to the viewer resembled claire toths even down to the two spots on her chin frowning maggie picked up her rubber and erased them before she went off to meet lorraine temple from the post banks hated hospitals hated everything about them and he had done so ever since hed had his tonsils out at the age of nine he hated the smell of them the colors of the walls the echoing sounds the doctors white coats and the uniforms the nurses wore hated the beds thermometers syringes stethoscopes ivs and the strange machines glimpsed behind halfopen doors everything if truth be told he had hated it all since well before the tonsil experience when his brother roy was born banks was five seven years too young to be allowed inside a hospital at visiting time his mother had some problems with the pregnancy those unspecified adult problems that grownups always seemed to be whispering about and spent an entire month there those were the days when theyd let you hang on to a bed that long banks was sent away to live with his aunt and uncle in northampton and went to a new school for the whole period he never settled in and being the new boy he had to stick up for himself against more than one bully he remembered his uncle driving him to the hospital to see his mother one dark cold winters night holding him up to the window thank god she was on the ground floor so he could wipe the frost off with his wool mitten and see her swollen shape halfway along the ward and wave to her he felt so sad it must be a horrible place he remembered thinking that would keep a mother from her son and make her sleep in a room full of strange people when she was so poorly the tonsillectomy had only confirmed what he already knew in the first place and now he was older hospitals still scared the shit out of him he saw them as last resorts places where one ends up where one goes to die and where the wellintentioned ministrations the probing pricking slicing and all the various ectomies of medical science only postpone the inevitable filling ones last days on earth with torture pain and fear banks was a veritable philip larkin when it came to hospitals could think only of the anesthetic from which none come round lucy payne was under guard at leeds general infirmary not far from where her husband lay in intensive care after emergency surgery to remove skull splinters from his brain the pc sitting outside her room a dogeared tom clancy paperback on the chair beside him reported no comings or goings other than hospital staff it had been a quiet night he said lucky for some banks thought as he entered the private room the doctor was inside waiting she introduced herself as dr landsberg no first name banks didnt want her there but there was nothing he could do about it lucy payne wasnt under arrest but she was under the doctors care im afraid i cant give you very long with my patient she said she has suffered an extremely traumatic experience and she needs rest more than anything banks looked at the woman in the bed half her face including one eye was covered with bandages the eye that he could see was the same shiny black as the ink he liked to use in his fountain pen her skin was pale and smooth her ravenswing hair spread out over the pillow and sheets he thought of kimberley myerss body spreadeagled on the mattress that had happened in lucy paynes house he reminded himself banks sat down beside lucy and dr landsberg hovered like a lawyer waiting to interrupt when banks overstepped his pace bounds lucy he said my names banks acting detective superintendent banks im in charge of the investigation into the five missing girls how are you feeling not bad lucy answered considering is there much pain some my head hurts hows terry whats happened to terry nobody will tell me her voice sounded thick as if her tongue were swollen and her words were slurred the medication perhaps if you just told me what happened last night lucy can you remember is terry dead someone told me he was hurt the concern of the abused wife for her abuser if that was what he was witnessing didnt surprise banks very much at all it was an old sad tune and he had heard it many times before in all its variations your husband was very badly injured lucy dr landsberg cut in were doing all we can for him banks cursed her under his breath he didnt want lucy payne to know what kind of shape her husband was in if she thought he wasnt going to survive she could tell banks whatever she wanted knowing hed have no way of checking whether it was true or not can you tell me what happened last night he repeated lucy half closed her good eye she was trying to remember or pretending she was trying to remember i dont know i cant remember good answer banks realized wait and see what happens to terry before admitting to anything she was sharp this one even in her hospital bed under medication do i need a lawyer she asked why would you need a lawyer i dont know when the police talk to people you know on television were not on television lucy she wrinkled her nose i know that silly i didnt mean never mind whats the last thing you remember about what happened to you i remember waking up getting out of bed putting on my dressing gown it was late or early why did you get out of bed i dont know i must have heard something what a noise i cant remember what did you do next i dont know i just remember getting up and then it hurt and everything went dark do you remember having an argument with terry no did you go in the cellar i dont think so i dont remember i might have done covering all the possibilities did you ever go in the cellar that was terrys room he would have punished me if i went down there he kept it locked interesting banks thought she could remember enough to distance herself from whatever they might have found in the cellar did she know forensics ought to be able to confirm whether she was telling the truth or not about going down there it was the basic rule wherever you go you leave something behind and take something with you what did he do down there banks asked i dont know it was his own private den so you never went down there no i didnt dare what do you think he did down there i dont know watched videos read books alone a man needs his privacy sometimes thats what terry said and you respected that yes what about that poster on the door lucy did you ever see it only from the top of the steps coming in from the garage its quite graphic isnt it what did you think of it lucy managed a thin smile men men are like that arent they they like that sort of thing so it didnt bother you she did something with her lips that indicated it didnt superintendent dr landsberg cut in i really think you ought to be going now and let my patient get some rest just a couple more questions thats all lucy do you remember who hurt you i i it must have been terry there was no one else there was there had terry ever hit you before she turned her head sideways so the only side banks could see was bandaged youre upsetting her superintendent i really must insist lucy did you ever see terry with kimberley myers you do know who kimberley myers is dont you lucy turned to face him again yes shes the poor girl that went missing thats right did you ever see terry with her i dont remember she was a pupil at silverhill where terry taught did he ever mention her i dont think so i you dont remember no im sorry whats wrong whats happening can i see terry im afraid you cant not at the moment said dr landsberg then she turned to banks im going to have to ask you to leave now you can see how agitated lucy is becoming when can i talk to her again ill let you know soon please she took banks by the arm banks knew when he was beaten besides the interview was going nowhere he didnt know whether lucy was telling the truth about not remembering or whether she was confused because of her medication get some rest lucy dr landsberg said as they left mr banks superintendent it was lucy her small thick slurred voice her obsidian eye fixing him in its gaze yes when can i go home banks had a mental image of what home would look like right now and probably for the next month or more under construction i dont know he said well be in touch outside in the corridor banks turned to dr landsberg can you help me with something doctor perhaps her not remembering is that symptomatic dr landsberg rubbed her eyes she looked as if she got about as much sleep as banks did someone paged a dr thorsen over the pa system its possible she said in cases like this theres often posttraumatic stress disorder one of the effects of which can be retrograde amnesia do you think thats the case with lucy too early to say and im not an expert in the field youd have to talk to a neurologist all i can say is that were pretty certain theres no physical brain damage but emotional stress can be a factor too is this memory loss selective what do you mean she seems to remember her husband was hurt and that he was the one who hit her but nothing else its possible yes is it likely to be permanent not necessarily so her complete memory might come back in time how long impossible to say as early as tomorrow as late as well maybe never we know so little about the brain thank you doctor youve been very helpful dr landsberg gave him a puzzled glance not at all she said superintendent i hope im not speaking out of turn but i had a word with dr mogabe hes terence paynes doctor just before you came yes hes very concerned oh this was what dc hodgkins had told banks the day before yes it seems as if his patient was assaulted by a policewoman not my case said banks dr landsbergs eyes widened just like that youre not at all concerned whether im concerned or not doesnt enter into it someone else is investigating the assault on terence payne and will no doubt be talking to dr mogabe in due course my interest is in the five dead girls and the paynes goodbye doctor and banks walked off down the corridor footsteps echoing leaving dr landsberg to her dark thoughts an orderly pushed a wheyfaced wrinkled old man past on a gurney iv hooked up on his way to surgery by the look of things banks shuddered and walked faster one good thing about the familystyle chain pubs thought maggie was that nobody raised an eyebrow if you only ordered a pot of tea or a cup of coffee which was all she wanted when she met lorraine temple at the woodcutters that tuesday lunchtime lorraine was a plump petite brunette with an easy manner and an open face a face you could trust she was about maggies age early thirties wearing black jeans and a jacket over a white silk blouse she bought the coffees and put maggie at ease with some small talk and sympathetic noises about the recent events on the hill then she got down to business she used a notebook rather than a tape recorder maggie was glad to see for some reason she didnt like the idea of her voice her words being recorded as sounds but as squiggles on the page they hardly seemed to matter do you use shorthand she asked thinking nobody used that anymore lorraine smiled up at her my own version would you like something to eat no thanks im not hungry okay well start then if thats all right with you maggie tensed a little waiting for the questions the pub was quiet mostly because it was a weekday and the bottom of the hill was hardly a tourist area or a business center there were a couple of industrial estates nearby but it wasnt quite lunchtime yet pop music played on the jukebox at an acceptable level and even the few children in the family room seemed more subdued than she would have expected maybe the recent events had got to everyone in one way or another it felt as if a pall lay over the place can you tell me how it happened lorraine asked first maggie thought for a moment well i dont sleep very well and maybe i was awake or it woke me up im not sure but i heard noises across the street what noises voices arguing a mans and a womans then a sound of glass breaking and then a thud and you know this was coming from across the street yes when i looked out of the window there was a light on and i thought i saw a shadow pass across it lorraine paused a moment to catch up with her notes why were you so sure it was a domestic incident she asked as she had done over the phone it just i mean take your time maggie i dont want to rush you think back try to remember maggie ran her hand over her hair well i didnt know for certain she said i suppose i just assumed from the raised voices and you know did you recognize the voices no they were too muffled but it could have been someone fighting off a burglar couldnt it i understand theres quite a high burglary rate in this area thats true so what im getting at maggie is that maybe there was some other reason you thought you were witnessing a domestic argument maggie paused her moment of decision had arrived and when it came it was more difficult than she had thought it would be for one thing she didnt want her name splashed all over the papers in case bill saw it back in toronto though she very much doubted that even he would come this far to get at her there was little likelihood of such exposure with a regional daily like the post of course but if the national press got onto it that would be another matter this was a big story and the odds were that it would at least make the national post and the globe and mail back home on the other hand she had to remember her goal focus on what was important here lucys predicament first and foremost she was talking to lorraine temple in order to get the image of lucy the victim in peoples minds call it a preemptive strike the more the public saw her that way from the start the less likely they were to believe that she was the embodiment of evil all people knew so far was that the body of kimberley myers had been found in the paynes cellar and a policeman had been killed most likely by terence payne but everyone knew they were digging there and everyone knew what they were likely to find maybe there was she said could you elaborate on that maggie sipped some coffee it was lukewarm in toronto she remembered they would come around and refill your cup once or twice not here i might have had reason to believe that lucy payne was in danger from her husband did she tell you that yes that her husband abused her yes what do you think of terence payne not much really do you like him not particularly not at all maggie admitted to herself terence payne very much gave her the creeps she didnt know why but she would cross the street if she saw him coming rather than meet say hello and make small talk about the weather all the time with him looking at her in that curiously empty dispassionate manner he had as if she were a butterfly pinned to a felt pad or a frog on the table ready for dissection as far as she knew though she was the only one to feel that way he was handsome and charming on the surface and according to lucy he was popular at school both with the kids and with his colleagues on staff but there was still something about him that put maggie off an emptiness at his center that she found disturbing with most people she felt that whatever it was she communicated whatever radar or sonar beam went out bounced off something and came back in some way made some sort of blip on the screen with terry it didnt it disappeared in the vast sprawling darkness inside him where it echoed forever unheard that was the only way she could explain the way she felt about terry payne she admitted to herself that she might be imagining it responding to some deep fear or inadequacy of her own and god knew there were enough of those so she had resolved to try not to criticize him for lucys sake but it had been difficult what did you do after lucy told you this talked to her tried to persuade her to seek professional help have you ever worked with abused women no not really i were you a victim of abuse yourself maggie felt herself tightening up inside her head started to spin she reached for her cigarettes offered one to lorraine who refused then lit up she had never talked about the details of her life with bill the pattern of violence and remorse blows and presents with anyone here except her psychiatrist and lucy payne im not here to talk about me she said i dont want you to write about me im here to talk about lucy i dont know what happened in that house but its my feeling that lucy was as much a victim as anything else lorraine put her notebook aside and finished her coffee youre canadian arent you she asked surprised maggie answered that she was where from toronto why just curious thats all ive got a cousin lives there that house youre living in tell me but doesnt it belong to ruth everett the illustrator yes it does i thought so i interviewed her there once she seems like a nice person shes been a good friend how did you meet if you dont mind my asking we met professionally at a convention a few years ago so youre an illustrator too yes childrens books mostly perhaps we can do a feature on you and your work im not very well known illustrators rarely are even so were always looking for local celebrities maggie felt herself blush well im hardly that ill talk with my features editor anyway if thats okay with you id rather you didnt if thats all right but please no okay lorraine held her hand up all right ive never know anyone turn down a bit of free publicity before but if you insist she put her notebook and pencil in her handbag i must be going now she said thank you for talking to me maggie watched her leave feeling oddly apprehensive she looked at her watch time for a little walk around the pond before heading back to work well you certainly know how to pamper a girl tracy said as banks led her into the mcdonalds at the corner of briggate and boar lane later that afternoon banks laughed i thought all kids loved mcdonalds tracy nudged him in the ribs enough of the kid please she said im twenty now you know for one horrible moment banks feared he might have forgotten her birthday but no it was back in february before the task force and he had sent a card given her some money and taken her out to dinner at brasserie a very expensive dinner not even a teenager anymore then he said thats right and it was true tracy was young woman now an attractive one at that it almost broke bankss heart to see how much she resembled sandra twenty years ago the same willowy figure with the same dark eyebrows high cheekbones hair in a long blond ponytail stray tresses tucked behind her delicate ears she even echoed some of sandras mannerisms such as biting her lower lip when she was concentrating and winding strands of hair around her fingers as she talked she was dressed like a student today blue jeans white tshirt with a rock bands logo denim jacket carrying a backpack and she moved with assurance and grace a young woman no doubt about it banks had returned her phone call that morning and they had arranged to meet for a late lunch after her last lecture of the day he had also told christopher wray that they hadnt found his daughters body yet they stood in line the place was full of office workers on afternoon break truant schoolkids and mothers with prams and toddlers taking a break from their shopping what do you want banks asked my treat in that case ill have the full monty big mac large fries and large coke sure thats all well see about a sweet later itll bring you out in spots no it wont i never come out in spots it was true tracy had always had a flawless complexion school friends had often hated her for it youll get fat then she patted her flat stomach and pulled a face at him she had inherited his metabolism which allowed him to live on beer and junk food and still remain lean they got their food and sat at a plastic table near the window it was a warm afternoon women wore bright sleeveless summer dresses and the men had their suit jackets slung over their shoulders and their shirtsleeves rolled up hows damon banks asked weve decided not to see each other till after exams there was something about tracys tone that indicated there was more to it than that boyfriend trouble with the monosyllabic damon who had spirited her off to paris last november when banks himself should have been with her instead of hunting down chief constable riddles wayward daughter he didnt want to make her talk about it she would get to it in her own time if she wanted to he couldnt make her talk anyway tracy had always been a very private person and could be as stubborn as he was when it came to discussing her feelings he bit into his big mac special sauce oozed down his chin he wiped it off with a serviette tracy was already halfway through her burger and the chips were disappearing quickly too im sorry i havent been in touch very often lately banks said ive been very busy story of my life said tracy i suppose so she put her hand on his arm im only teasing dad ive got nothing to complain about youve got plenty but its nice of you not to say so anyway apart from damon how are you im fine studying hard some people say second years harder than finals any plans for the summer i might go to france again charlottes parents have a cottage in the dordogne but theyre going to be in america and they said she can take a couple of friends down if she wants lucky you tracy finished her big mac and sipped some coke through her straw looking closely at banks you look tired dad she said i suppose i am your job yes its a lot of responsibility keeps me awake at night im not at all certain im cut out for it im sure youre just wonderful such faith but i dont know ive never run such a big investigation before and im not sure i ever want to again but youve caught him tracy said the chameleon killer looks that way congratulations i knew you would i didnt do anything the whole thing was a series of accidents well the results the same isnt it true look dad i know why you havent been in touch youve been busy yes but its more than that isnt it banks pushed his halfeaten burger aside and worked on the chips what do you mean you know what i mean you probably held yourself personally responsible for those girls abductions the way you always do didnt you i wouldnt say that ill bet you thought that if you relaxed your vigilance for just one single moment hed get someone else another young woman just like me didnt you banks applauded his daughters perception and she did have blond hair well there may be a grain of truth in that he said just a tiny grain was it really horrible down there i dont want to talk about it not at lunch not with you i suppose you think im being nosy for sensation like a newspaper reporter but i worry about you youre not made of stone you know you let these things get to you for a daughter said banks you do a pretty good impersonation of a nagging wife immediately the words were out of his mouth he regretted them it brought the specter of sandra between them again tracy like brian had struggled not to take sides in the breakup but whereas brian had taken an immediate dislike to sean sandras new companion tracy got along with him quite well and that hurt banks though he would never tell her have you talked to mum lately tracy asked ignoring his criticism you know i havent tracy sipped some more coke frowned like her mother and stared out of the window why banks asked sensing a change in the atmosphere is there something i should know i was down there at easter i know you were did she say something about me banks knew he had been dragging his feet over the divorce the whole thing had just seemed too hurried to him and he wasnt inclined to hurry seeing no reason so sandra wanted to marry sean make it legal big deal let them wait its not that tracy said what then you really dont know id say if i did oh shit tracy bit her lip i wish id never got into this why do i have to be the one because you started it and dont swear now give tracy looked down at her empty chip carton and sighed all right she told me not to say anything to you yet but youll find out eventually remember you asked for it tracy okay okay mums pregnant thats what its all about shes three months pregnant shes having seans baby not long after banks had left lucy paynes room annie cabbot strode down the corridors of the hospital to her appointment with dr mogabe she hadnt been at all satisfied with pc taylors statement and needed to check out the medical angle as far as it was possible to do so of course payne wasnt dead so there would be no postmortem at least not yet if he had done what it very much seemed that he had then annie thought it might not be such a bad idea to carry out a postmortem on him while he was still alive come in called dr mogabe annie went in the office was small and functional with a couple of bookcases full of medical texts a filing cabinet whose top drawer wouldnt shut and the inevitable computer on the desk a laptop various medical degrees and honors hung on the creampainted walls and a pewterframed photograph stood on the desk facing the doctor a family picture annie guessed there was no skull beside it though nor was there a skeleton standing in the corner dr mogabe was smaller than annie had imagined and his voice was higher in pitch his skin was a shiny purpleblack and his short curly hair gray he also had small hands but the fingers were long and tapered a brain surgeons fingers annie thought though she had nothing for comparison and the thought of them poking their way through the gray matter made her stomach lurch pianists fingers she decided much easier to live with or artists fingers like her fathers he leaned forward and linked his hands on the desk im glad youre here detective inspector cabbot he said with a voice straight out of oxford indeed if the police hadnt seen fit to call i would have felt obliged to bring them in myself mr payne was most brutally beaten always willing to be of service said annie what can you tell me about the patient in laymans terms if you please dr mogabe inclined his head slightly of course he said as if he already knew the elite technical mumbo jumbo of his profession would be wasted on an ignorant copper such as annie mr payne was admitted with serious head wounds resulting in brain damage he also had a broken ulna so far we have operated on him twice once to relieve a subdural hematoma thats i know what a hematoma is said annie very well the second to remove skull fragments from the brain i could be more specific if you wish go ahead dr mogabe stood up and started walking back and forth behind his desk hands clasped behind his back as if he were delivering a lecture when he came to name the various parts he pointed to them on his own skull as he paced the human brain is essentially made up of the cerebrum the cerebellum and the brain stem the cerebrum is uppermost divided into two hemispheres by a deep groove at the top giving what you have probably heard called right brain and left brain do you follow i think so prominent grooves also divide each hemisphere into lobes the frontal lobe is the largest there are also parietal temporal and occipital lobes the cerebellum is at the base of the skull behind the brain stem when dr mogabe had finished he sat down again looking very pleased with himself how many blows were there annie asked its difficult to be specific at this stage said dr mogabe i was concerned merely with saving the mans life you understand not with conducting an autopsy but at an estimate id say two blows to the left temple perhaps three they caused the most damage to begin with including the hematoma and skull fragments there is also evidence of one or two blows to the top of the cranium denting the skull the top of his head the cranium is that part of the head which isnt the face yes hard blows as if someone hit directly down on it possibly but i cant be a judge of that they would have been incapacitating but not lifethreatening the top of the cranium is hard and though the skull there was dented and fractured as i said the bone didnt splinter annie made some notes those werent the most damaging injuries though dr mogabe added oh no the most serious injury was caused by one or more blows to the back of the head the brainstem area you see that contains the medulla oblongata which is the heart blood vessel and breathing center of the brain any serious injury to it can be fatal yet mr payne is still alive barely is there a possibility of permanent brain damage there already is permanent brain damage if mr payne recovers he may well spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair in need of twentyfourhouraday care the only good thing is that he probably wont be aware of that fact this injury to the medulla could it have occurred as mr payne fell back against the wall dr mogabe rubbed his chin again its not my place to do the polices job or the pathologists detective inspector suffice it to say that in my opinion these wounds were caused by the same blunt instrument as the others make of that what you will he leaned forward in this simplest laymans terms this man received a most vicious beating about the head detective inspector most vicious i hope you believe as i do that the perpetrator should be brought to justice shit thought annie putting her notebook away of course doctor she said heading for the door you will keep me informed wont you you can count on it annie looked at her watch time to head back to eastvale and prepare her daily report for detective superintendent chambers after his lunch with tracy banks wandered around leeds city center in a daze thinking of the news she had given him the matter of sandras pregnancy had hit him harder than he would have expected after so long apart he realized as he stood and gazed in currys window on briggate hardly taking in the display of computers camcorders and stereo systems he had last seen her in london the previous november when he was down there searching for chief constable riddles runaway daughter emily looking back he felt foolish for the way he had approached that meeting full of confidence that because he had applied for a job with the national crime squad that would take him back to live in london sandra would see the error of her ways dump the temporary sean and run back into bankss arms wrong instead she had told banks that she wanted a divorce because she and sean wanted to get married and that cathartic event he thought had flushed sandra out of his system forever along with any thoughts of moving to the ncs until tracy told him about the pregnancy banks hadnt thought hadnt suspected for a moment that they wanted to get married because they wanted to have a baby what on earth did sandra think she was playing at the idea of a half brother or sister for brian and tracy twenty years younger seemed unreal to banks and the thought of sean whom he had never met being the father seemed even more absurd he tried to imagine their conversations leading up to the decision the lovemaking the maternal desire rekindled in sandra after so many years and even the shadowiest of imaginings made him feel sick he didnt know her this woman in her early forties who wanted a baby with a boyfriend she had hardly been with for five minutes and that also made banks feel sad banks was in borders looking at the colorful display of bestsellers and he didnt even remember walking in the shop when his mobile rang he went outside and ducked into the victoria quarter before answering leaning near the entrance across from the harvey nichols café it was stefan alan thought youd like to know asap weve identified the three bodies in the cellar got lucky with the dentists well still run the dna though crosscheck with the parents thats great said banks snapping back from his gloomy thoughts of sandra and sean and melissa horrocks samantha foster and kelly matthews what i said i know i heard what you said i just people were walking by with their shopping and banks didnt want to be overheard to be truthful he also still felt like a bit of a dickhead talking on his mobile in public though from what he saw around him nobody else did he had even once witnessed a father sitting in a helmthorpe café phone his daughter in the playground across the road when it was time to go home and curse because the kid had switched her mobile off so he had to walk across the road and shout to her instead im just surprised thats all why whats wrong its the sequence banks said its all wrong he lowered his voice and hoped that stefan could still hear him working backward kimberley myers melissa horrocks leanne wray samantha foster kelly matthews one of the three should be leanne wray why isnt she there a little girl holding her mothers hand gave banks a curious look as they passed him by in the arcade banks switched off his mobile and headed toward millgarth jenny fuller was surprised to find banks ringing her doorbell that evening it was a long time since he had visited her at home they had met many times for coffee or drinks even lunch or dinner but rarely had he come here jenny had often wondered whether this was anything to do with that clumsy attempt at seduction the first time they had worked together come in she said and banks followed her through the narrow hall into the highceilinged living room she had redecorated and rearranged the furniture since his last visit and noticed him glancing around in that policemans way of his checking it out well the expensive stereo was the same and the sofa she thought smiling to herself was the very same one where she had tried to seduce him she had bought a small television and video when she got back from america having picked up the habit of watching there but apart from the wallpaper and carpeting nothing much else had changed she noticed his gaze settle on the emily carr print over the fireplace a huge dark steep mountain dominating a village in the foreground jenny had fallen in love with emily carrs work when she was doing postgraduate work in vancouver and had bought that print to bring back as a reminder of her three years there happy years for the most part drink she asked whatever youre pouring knew i could count on you im sorry i dont have any laphroaig is red wine okay fine jenny went to pour the wine and noticed banks walk over to the window the green looked peaceful enough in the golden evening sunlight long shadows dark green leaves people walking their dogs kids holding hands perhaps he was remembering the second time he visited her jenny thought with a shudder as she poured the sainsburys côtes du rhône a druggedout kid called mick webster had held her hostage with a handgun and banks had managed to defuse the situation the kids mood swings had been extreme and the whole thing had been touch and go for a while jenny had been terrified ever since that day she had been unable to listen to tosca which had been playing in the background at the time when she had poured the wine she shook off the bad memory put a cd of mozart string quartets on and carried the glasses over to the sofa cheers they clinked glasses banks looked as tired as jenny had ever seen him his skin was pale and even his normally sharp and lean features seemed to be sagging on the bone the way his suit sagged on his frame and his eyes seemed more deeply set than usual duller lacking their usual sparkle still she told herself the poor sod probably hasnt had a decent nights sleep since he was put in charge of the task force she wanted to reach out and touch his face smooth away the cares but she didnt dare risk rejection again so to what do i owe the honor jenny said im assuming its not just my irresistible company thats brought you here banks smiled it made him look a little better she thought a little id like to say it was he answered but id be a liar if i did and god forbid you should ever be a liar alan banks such an honorable man but couldnt you be a bit less honorable sometimes the rest of us human beings well we cant help the occasional untruth but you no you cant even lie to give a girl a compliment jenny i just couldnt stay away some inner force drove me to your house compelled me to seek you out i just knew i had to come jenny laughed and waved him down all right all right thats enough honorable is much better she ran her hand through her hair hows sandra sandras pregnant jenny shook her head as if she had been slapped shes what shes pregnant im sorry to state it so abruptly but i cant think of a better way thats all right im just a bit gobsmacked you and me both how do you feel about it you sound like a psychologist i am a psychologist i know but you dont have to sound like one how do i feel about it i dont know yet when you get right down to it its none of my business is it i let go the night she asked for a divorce so she could marry sean is that why yes they want to get married make the kid legal did you talk to her no tracy told me sandra and i well we dont communicate much anymore thats sad alan maybe theres still a lot of anger and bitterness funnily enough there isnt oh i know i might sound a bit upset but it was the shock thats all i mean there was a lot of anger but it was sort of a revelation when she asked for the divorce a release i knew then that it was really over and that i should just get on with my life and and i have done for the most part but residual feelings surprise you sometimes creep up behind you and hit you on the back of your head i suppose you could say that welcome to the human race alan you ought to know by now that you dont stop having feelings for someone just because you split up it was all new to me she was the only woman id been with for any length of time the only one i wanted now i know what it feels like naturally i wish them all the best meow there you go again banks laughed no really i do jenny sensed that there was something he wasnt telling her but she also knew that he guarded his feelings when he wanted to and she would get nowhere if she pushed him best move on to the business at hand she thought and if he wants to say anything more about sandra hell say it in his own time that wasnt why you came to see me either was it not really maybe partly but i do want to talk to you about the case any new developments just one banks told her about the identification of the three bodies and how he found it puzzling curious jenny agreed i would have expected some sort of sequence too theyre still digging outside oh yes theyll be out there for a while there wasnt much room in that little cellar just enough for about three true said banks but that still doesnt explain why it isnt the most recent three anyway id just like to go over some stuff with you remember when you suggested quite early on that the killer might have had an accomplice it was only a remote possibility despite the inordinate amounts of publicity your wests and bradys and hindleys get the killer couple is still a rare phenomenon i assume youre thinking of lucy payne banks sipped some wine i talked to her at the hospital she well she said she didnt remember much about what happened not surprising said jenny retrograde amnesia thats what dr landsberg said its not that i dont believe in it ive come across it before its just so damn convenient thats one way of putting it jenny i just couldnt get over the feeling that she was waiting calculating stalling in some way waiting for what waiting to see which way the wind was going to blow as if she cant work out what to say until she knows whats happening with terry and it would make sense wouldnt it what would the way the girls were taken a girl walking home on her own would be most unlikely to stop and give directions say to a male driver but she might stop if a woman called her over and the man crouched down in the backseat with the chloroform ready jumps out the back door and drags her in i dont know the details but it makes sense doesnt it yes it makes sense have you got any other evidence of her complicity none but its early days yet the socos are still going through the house and the lab boys are working on the clothes she was wearing when she was assaulted even that might come to nothing if she says she went down in the cellar saw what her husband had done and ran away screaming thats what i mean about her waiting to see which way the wind blows if terence payne dies lucys home free if he lives his memory could be damaged irretrievably he is very badly hurt and even if he recovers he might decide to protect her gloss over what part she played if she played a part she certainly couldnt rely on his memory being damaged or his dying thats true but it might have given her the perfect opportunity to cover up her own involvement if there was any you had a look around the house didnt you yes what was your impression jenny sipped some wine and thought about it the magazine perfect decor the little knickknacks the obsessive cleanliness i suppose youre thinking of the videos and books she said partly there looked to be some pretty raunchy stuff especially in the bedroom so theyre into porn and kinky sex so what she raised her eyebrows as a matter of fact ive got a couple of soft porn videos in my bedroom i dont mind a little kinkiness now and then oh dont blush alan im not trying to seduce you im simply pointing out that a few videos featuring threeway sex and a bit of mild consensual s and m dont necessarily make a killer i know that and while it is true jenny went on that statistically most sex killers are into pornography of an extreme kind its false logic to argue the opposite i know that too said banks what about the occult connection i wondered about the candles and incense in the cellar could be just for atmosphere but there was a sort of ritual element possibly i was even wondering if there could be some connection there with the fourth victim melissa horrocks she was into that satanic rock music stuff you know marilyn manson and the rest or maybe payne just has an extreme sense of irony in his choice of victims but look alan even if lucy did get off on the kinky stuff and satanism its hardly evidence of anything else is it im not asking for court evidence at the moment ill take anything i can get jenny laughed clutching at straws again maybe so ken blackstone reckons payne might also be the seacroft rapist seacroft rapist two years ago between may and august you were in america a man raped six women in seacroft never caught it turns out payne was living there single at the time he met lucy that july and they moved to the hill around the beginning of september when he started teaching at silverhill the rapes stopped it wouldnt be the first time a serial killer was a rapist first indeed not anyway theyre working on dna have a smoke if you want jenny said i can see youre getting all twitchy am i i will then if you dont mind jenny brought him an ashtray she kept in the sideboard for the occasional visitor who smoked though a nonsmoker herself she wasnt as fanatical about not allowing any smoking in her house as some of her friends were in fact her time in california had made her hate the niconazis even more than the smokers what do you want me to do she asked your job said banks leaning forward and the way i see it now is that weve probably got enough to convict terry payne ten times over if he survives its lucy im interested in and times running out what do you mean banks drew on his cigarette before answering as long as she stays in hospital were fine but as soon as shes released we can only hold her for twentyfour hours oh we can get extensions maybe in an extreme case like this up to ninetysix hours but wed better damn well have something solid to go on if were going to do that or she walks i still think its more than possible that she had nothing to do with the killings something woke her up that night and her husband wasnt there so she looked around the house for him saw the lights in the cellar went down and saw but why hadnt she noticed before jenny why hadnt she been down there before she was afraid to it sounds as if shes terrified of her husband look at what happened to her when she did go down i know that but kimberley myers was the fifth victim for gods sake the fifth why did it take lucy so long to find out why did she wake up and go exploring only this time she said she never went down in the cellar that she didnt dare what was so different about this time perhaps she didnt want to know before but dont forget the way it looks is that payne was escalating unraveling id guess he was fast becoming highly unstable perhaps this time even she couldnt look away jenny watched banks take a contemplative drag on his cigarette and let the smoke out slowly you think so he said its possible isnt it earlier if her husband was behaving strangely she might have suspected that he had some sort of horrible secret vice and she wanted to pretend it wasnt there the way most of us do with bad things sweep it under the carpet or play the ostrich bury her head in the sand yes why not so were both agreed that there are any number of possibilities to explain what happened and that lucy payne might be innocent where are you going with this alan i want you to dig deep into lucy paynes background i want you to find out all you can about her i want but no let me finish jenny i want you to get to know her inside out her background her childhood her family her fantasies her hopes her fears slow down alan whats the point of all this you might come across something that implicates her or absolves her banks held his hands out palms open if thats what you find fine im not asking you to make anything up just dig even if i do i might not come up with anything useful at all doesnt matter at least well have tried isnt this a police job banks stubbed out his cigarette not really im after an evaluation here an indepth psychological profile of lucy payne of course well check out any leads you might stumble across i dont expect you to play detective well im grateful for that think about it jenny if shes guilty she didnt just start helping her husband abduct and kill young girls out of the blue on new years eve there has to be some pathology some background of psychological disturbance some abnormal pattern of behavior doesnt there there usually is but even if i find out she was a bed wetter liked to start fires and pulled the wings off flies it still wont give you anything you can use against her in court it will if someone was hurt in the fire it will if you find out about any other mysterious events in her life that we can investigate thats all im asking jenny that you make a start on the psychopathology of lucy payne and if you turn up anything we should investigate further you let us know and we do it and if i turn up nothing then we go nowhere but were already nowhere jenny sipped some more wine and thought for a moment alan seemed so intense about it that she was feeling browbeaten and she didnt want to give in just because of that but she was intrigued by his request she couldnt deny that the enigma of lucy payne interested her both professionally and as a woman she had never had the chance to probe the psychology of a possible serial killer up close before and banks was right that if lucy payne was complicit in her husbands acts then she hadnt just come from nowhere if jenny dug deeply enough there was a chance that she might find something in lucys past after that well banks had said that was the polices job and he was right about that too she topped up their wineglasses what if i agree she asked where do i start right here said banks digging out his notebook theres a friend from the natwest branch where lucy payne worked one of our teams went and talked to the employees and theres only one of them who knows her well names pat mitchell then theres clive and hilary liversedge lucys parents they live out hull way do they know of course they know what do you think we are jenny raised a fine plucked eyebrow they know how did they react upset of course stunned even but according to the dc who interviewed them they werent much help they hadnt been in close touch with lucy since she married terry have they been to see her in hospital no seems the mothers too ill to travel and the fathers a reluctant caregiver what about his parents terrys as far as weve been able to work out banks said his mothers in a mental asylum has been for fifteen years or so whats wrong with her schizophrenia and the father died two years ago what of massive stroke he was a butcher in halifax had a record for minor sex offenses exposing himself peeping that sort of thing sounds a pretty classic background for someone like terry payne wouldnt you say if there is such a thing the miracle is that terry managed to become a teacher jenny laughed oh theyll let anyone in the classroom these days besides thats not the miracle what is that he managed to hold on to the job for so long and that he was married usually serial sex offenders such as terence payne find it hard to hold down a job and maintain a relationship our man did both is that significant its intriguing if id been pushed for a profile a month or so ago id have said you were looking for a man between twenty and thirty most likely living alone and working at some sort of menial job or a succession of such jobs just shows how wrong one can be doesnt it will you do it jenny toyed with the stem of her glass the mozart ended and left only the memory of music a car passed by and a dog barked on the green she had the time to do as banks asked she had a lecture to give on friday morning but it was one she had given a hundred times so she didnt need to prepare then she had nothing until a string of tutorials on monday that should give her plenty of time as i said its intriguing ill need to talk to lucy herself that can be arranged you are our official consultant psychologist after all easy for you to say that now you need me ive known it all along dont let a few narrowminded all right said jenny youve made your point i can take being laughed at behind my back by a bunch of thick plods im a big girl when can i talk to her best do it as soon as possible while shes still only a witness believe it or not but defense lawyers have been known to claim that psychologists have tricked suspects into incriminating themselves how about tomorrow morning ive got to be down at the hospital for the next postmortem at eleven anyway lucky you okay ill give you a lift if you like no ill go straight over to talk to the parents after ive talked to lucy and her friend ill need my car meet you there ten oclock then fine banks told her how to find lucys room and ill let the parents know youre coming banks gave her the details youll do it then what im asking doesnt look as if i have much choice does it banks stood up leaned forward and kissed her swiftly on the cheek even though she could smell the wine and smoke on his breath her heart jumped and she wished his lips had lingered a little longer moved a little closer to her own hey any more of that she said and ill have you up on sexual harassment charges banks and jenny walked past the police guard into lucy paynes room just after ten oclock the following morning there was no doctor standing over them this time banks was happy to note lucy lay propped against the pillows reading a fashion magazine the slats of the blinds let in some of the morning sun lighting the vase of tulips on the bedside table forming a pattern of bars over lucys face and the white bedsheets her long glossy black hair was spread out on the pillow around her hospitalpale face the colors of her bruises had deepened since the previous day which meant they were on the mend and she still wore half her head swathed in bandages her good eye longlashed dark and sparkling gazed up at them banks wasnt sure what he saw in it but it wasnt fear he introduced jenny as dr fuller lucy looked up and gave them a fleeting wisp of a smile is there any news she asked no said banks hes going to die isnt he what makes you think that i just have this feeling hes going to die thats all would that make a difference lucy what do you mean you know what i mean if terry died would it make a difference to what you might care to tell us how could it you tell me lucy paused banks could see her frown as she thought about what to say next if i were to tell you you know what went on i mean if i knew you know about terry and those girls and all what would happen to me youll have to be a bit clearer than that im afraid lucy she licked her lips i cant really be any clearer not at this point i have to think of myself i mean if i remembered something that didnt show me in a good light what would you do depends what it is lucy lucy retreated into silence jenny sat on the edge of the bed and smoothed her skirt banks gave her the goahead to pick up the questioning do you remember anything more about what happened she asked are you a psychiatrist im a psychologist lucy looked at banks they cant make me have tests can they no said banks nobody can force you to undergo testing thats not why dr fullers here she just wants to talk to you shes here to help and the checks in the post banks added silently lucy glanced at jenny i dont know youve got nothing to hide have you lucy jenny asked no im just worried that theyll make things up about me wholl make things up doctors the police why would they want to do that i dont know because they think im evil nobody thinks youre evil lucy you wonder how i could have lived with him a man who did what terry did dont you how could you live with him jenny asked i was frightened of him he said hed kill me if i left him and he abused you is that right yes physically sometimes he hit me where the bruises wouldnt show until monday morning lucy touched her bandages yes why was it different that time lucy i dont know i still cant remember thats okay jenny went on im not here to force you to say anything you dont want just relax did your husband abuse you in other ways what do you mean emotionally for example do you mean like putting me down humiliating me in front of people thats the kind of thing i mean then the answers yes like you know if something i cooked wasnt very good or i hadnt ironed his shirt properly he was very fussy about his shirts what did he do if his shirts werent ironed properly hed make me do them again and again once he even burned me with the iron where lucy looked away where it wouldnt show im curious about the cellar lucy detective superintendent banks here told me you said you never went down there i might have been there the once you know the time he hurt me on monday morning yes but you dont remember no you never went down there before lucys voice took on a strange keening edge no never not since we first moved in anyway how long after that was it that he forbade you to go there i dont remember not long when hed done his conversions what conversions he told me hed made it into a den his own private place were you never curious not much besides he always kept it locked and he carried the key with him he said if he ever thought id been down there hed thrash me to within an inch of my life and you believed him she turned her dark eye on jenny oh yes it wouldnt have been the first time did your husband ever mention pornography to you yes he sometimes brought videos home things he said hed borrowed from geoff one of the other teachers sometimes we watched them together she looked at banks you must have seen them i mean youve probably been in the house searching and stuff banks remembered the tapes did terry have a camcorder he asked her did he make his own tapes no i dont think so she said jenny picked up the thread again what sort of videos did he like she asked people having sex girls together sometimes people tied up you said you watched the videos together sometimes did you like them what effect did they have on you did he force you to watch them lucy shifted under her thin bedsheets the outline of her body stirred banks in ways he didnt want to be stirred by her i didnt really like them much she said in a sort of husky littlegirl voice sometimes you know though even so they they excited me she moved again did your husband abuse you sexually make you do things you didnt want to do jenny asked no she said it was all just normal banks was beginning to wonder if the marriage to lucy was just a part of terence paynes normal facade something to make people think twice about his real proclivities after all it had worked on dcs bowmore and singh who hadnt even bothered to reinterview him perhaps he went elsewhere to satisfy his more perverse tastes prostitutes for example it was worth looking into do you know if he went with other women jenny asked as if reading bankss mind he never said but did you suspect it i thought he might have done yes prostitutes i dont know i didnt like to think about it did you ever find his behavior bizarre what do you mean did he ever shock you make you wonder what he was up to not really he had a terrible temper you know if he didnt get his own way and sometimes during school holidays i didnt see him for days you didnt know where he was no and he never told you no werent you curious she seemed to shrink back into the bed curiosity never did you any good with terry curiosity killed the cat hed say and if you dont shut up itll kill you too she shook her head i dont know what i did wrong everything was fine it was just a normal life until i met terry then everything started to fall apart how could i be such a fool i should have known known what lucy what kind of person he was what a monster he was but you did know you told me he hit you humiliated you in public and in private you did know are you trying to tell me you thought that was normal did you think that was how everybody lived no of course not but it didnt make him the sort of monster you think he is lucy looked away again what is it lucy jenny asked you must think im such a weak person to let him do all that a terrible person but im not im a nice person everybody says i am i was frightened talk to maggie she understands banks stepped in maggie forrest your neighbor yes lucy looked in his direction she sent me those flowers we talked about it you know about men abusing their wives and she tried to persuade me to leave terry but i was too frightened maybe in a while i might have found the courage i dont know its too late now isnt it please im tired i dont want to talk anymore i just want to go home and get on with my life banks wondered whether he should tell lucy that she wouldnt be going home for some time that her home looked like the site of an archaeological dig and would be in the polices hands for weeks perhaps months to come he decided not to bother she would find out soon enough well go now then said jenny standing up take care lucy would you do me a favor lucy asked as they stood in the doorway what is it banks asked back at the house theres a nice little jewelry box on the dressing table in the bedroom its a lacquered japanese box black with all kinds of beautiful flowers handpainted on it anyway its got all my favorite pieces in earrings i bought on our honeymoon on crete a gold chain with a heart terry bought me when we got engaged theyre my things would you bring it to me please my jewelry box banks tried to hold in his frustration lucy he said as calmly as he could manage we believe that several young girls were sexually abused and murdered in the cellar of your house and all you can think about is your jewelry thats not true said lucy a hint of petulance in her tone im very sorry for what happened to those girls of course i am but its not my fault i dont see why it should stop me having my jewelry box the only thing anyones let me have from there is my handbag and purse and i could tell someone had even been searching through them first banks followed jenny out into the corridor and they headed for the lifts calm down alan said jenny lucys dissociating she doesnt realize the emotional significance of whats happened right said banks glancing at the clock on the wall thats just bloody fine and dandy now i have to go and watch dr mackenzie do his next postmortem but ill do my damnedest to remember that none of it is lucy paynes fault and that shes managing to dissociate herself from it all thank you jenny put her hand on his arm i can understand why youre frustrated alan but it wont do any good you cant push her she wont be pushed be patient the lift came and they got in trying to have a conversation with that woman is like trying to catch water in a sieve banks said shes a weird one all right is that your professional opinion jenny grinned let me think about it ill talk to you after ive talked to her coworker and her parents bye they arrived at the ground floor and she hurried off toward the car park banks took a deep breath and pressed the down button rapunzel was going much better today maggie decided as she stood back and examined her work tip of her tongue between her small white teeth she didnt look as if one good yank on her hair would rip her head from her shoulders and she didnt look a bit like claire toth claire hadnt turned up as usual yesterday after school and maggie wondered why not perhaps it was only to be expected that she didnt feel very sociable after what had happened maybe she just wanted to be alone to sort out her feelings maggie decided she would talk to her psychiatrist dr simms about claire see if there was something that ought to be done she had an appointment tomorrow which despite the events of the week she was determined to keep lorraine temples story hadnt turned up in the morning newspaper as maggie had expected it to and she had felt disappointed when she had searched through every page and not found it she assumed that the journalist needed more time to check her facts and put the story together after all it had only been yesterday when they talked perhaps it would be a long article focusing on the plight of abused women a feature in the weekend paper she bent over the drawing board and got back to work on the rapunzel sketch she had to turn her desk light on as the morning had turned overcast and muggy a couple of minutes later her phone rang maggie put her pencil aside and answered it maggie she recognized the soft husky voice lucy how are you im feeling much better now really maggie didnt know what to say at first she felt awkward despite her sending the flowers and defending lucy to the police and with lorraine temple she realized they didnt know each other well and came from very different worlds its good to hear from you she said im glad youre feeling better i just wanted to thank you for the flowers lucy went on theyre lovely they make all the difference it was a nice thought its the least i can do you know youre the only person whos bothered with me everyone else has written me off im sure thats not true lucy oh but it is even my friends from work though maggie could hardly bring herself to ask it was only polite hows terry they wont even tell me that but i think hes very badly hurt i think hes going to die i think the police are going to try to blame me what makes you think that i dont know have they been to talk to you twice just now there were two of them one was a psychologist she asked me all sorts of questions about what about things terry did to me about our sex life i felt like such a fool maggie i just feel so frightened and alone look lucy if i can help in any way thank you have you got a solicitor no i dont even know any look lucy if the police come bothering you again dont say anything to them i know how they can twist your words make something out of nothing will you at least let me try to get you someone one of ruth and charless friends is a solicitor in town julia ford ive met her and she seems nice enough shell know what to do but i dont have that much money maggie dont worry well sort it out with her somehow will you let me call her for you i suppose so i mean if you think its for the best i do ill call her right now and ask her to drop by and talk to you shall i okay are you sure theres nothing else i can do for you maggie heard a defeated laugh over the line pray for me perhaps i dont know maggie i dont know what theyre going to do to me for the moment id just like to know theres someone on my side count on it lucy there is thank you im tired i have to go now and lucy hung up the phone after attending dr mackenzies postmortem on the sad pile of bones and decaying flesh that had once been a young and vibrant girl with hopes and dreams and secrets banks felt twenty years older but none the wiser first on the slab was the freshest because dr mackenzie said it might tell him more which seemed logical to banks even so the body had been partially buried under a thin layer of soil in paynes cellar for about three weeks dr mackenzie estimated which was why the skin hair and nails were loose and easy to pull off insects had been at work and much of the flesh was gone where skin remained it had burst open in places revealing the glistening muscle and fat beneath not much fat because this was melissa horrocks weighing just a little under seven stone whose tshirt bore symbols to ward off evil spirits banks left before dr mackenzie had finished not because it was too gruesome for him but because these postmortems were going to go on for some time yet and he had other business to attend to it would be more than a day or two dr mackenzie said before he would be able to get down to a report as the other two bodies were in an even worse state of decomposition someone from the team had to sit through the postmortems but this was one job banks was happy to delegate after the sights sounds and smells of mackenzies postmortem the bland headmasters office at silverhill comprehensive came as a relief there was nothing about the uncluttered and nondescript room that indicated it had anything to do with education or anything else for that matter it was much the same as any anonymous office in any anonymous building and it didnt even smell of much except a faint whiff of lemonscented furniture polish the head was called john knight early forties balding stoopshouldered dandruff on his jacket collar after getting a few general details about paynes employment history banks asked knight if there had been any problems with payne there have been a few complaints now that you mention it knight admitted banks raised his eyebrows from pupils knight reddened good lord no nothing like that have you any idea what happens at the merest hint of something like that these days no said banks when i was at school the teachers used to thrash us with just about anything they could lay their hands on some of them enjoyed it too well those days are over thank the lord or the law not a believer my job makes it difficult yes i can understand that knight glanced toward the window mine too sometimes thats one of the great challenges of faith dont you think so what sort of problems were you having with terence payne knight brought himself back from a long way away and sighed oh just little things nothing important in themselves but they all add up for example tardiness too many days off without a valid reason teachers may get generous holidays superintendent but they are expected to be here during term time barring some serious illness of course i see anything else just a general sort of sloppiness exams not marked on time projects left unsupervised terry has a bit of temper and he can get quite stroppy if you call him on anything how long has this been going on according to head of science only since the new year and before that no problems at all terence payne is a good teacher knows his stuff and he seemed popular with the pupils none of us can believe whats happened were stunned just absolutely stunned do you know his wife i dont know her i met her once at the staff christmas party charming woman a little reserved perhaps but charming nonetheless does terry have a colleague here called geoff yes geoffrey brighouse hes the chemistry teacher the two of them seemed pretty thick went out for a jar or two together every now and again what can you tell me about him geoffs been with us six years now solid sort of fellow no trouble at all can i talk to him of course knight looked at his watch he should be over in the chemistry lab right now preparing for his next class follow me they walked outside the day was becoming more and more muggy as the clouds thickened threatening rain nothing new apart from the past few days it had been raining pretty much every day on and off since the beginning of april silverhill comprehensive was one the few prewar gothic redbrick schools that hadnt been sandblasted and converted into offices or luxury flats yet knots of adolescents lounged around the asphalt playground they all seemed subdued banks thought and a pall of gloom fear and confusion hung about the place palpable as a peasouper the groups werent mixed banks noticed the girls stood in their own little conclaves as if huddled together for comfort and security staring down and scuffing their shoes on the asphalt as banks and knight walked by the boys were a bit more animated at least some of them were talking and there was a bit of the usual playful pushing and shoving but the whole effect was eerie its been like this since we heard said knight as if reading bankss mind people dont realize how farreaching and longlasting the effects will be around this place some of the students may never get over it itll blight their lives its not just that weve lost a cherished pupil but someone we put in a position of trust seems to be responsible for some abominable acts if im not speaking out of turn youre not said banks and abominable only scratches the surface but dont tell the papers my lips are sealed theyve been around already you know doesnt surprise me i didnt tell them anything nothing to tell really here we are the bascombe building the bascombe building was a modern concreteandglass addition to the main school building there was a plaque on the wall near the door which read this building is dedicated to the memory of frank edward bascombe who was he banks asked as they went in the door a teacher here during the war knight explained english teacher this used to be part of the main building then but it was hit by a stray doodlebug in october of frank bascombe was a hero he got twelve children and another teacher out two pupils were killed in the attack just through here he opened the door to the chemistry lab where a young man sat at the teachers desk in front of a sheaf of notes he looked up geoff a detective superintendent banks to see you then he left shutting the door behind him banks hadnt been in a school chemistry lab for thirty years or more and though this one had far more modern fixtures than he remembered from his own school days much of it was still the same the high lab benches bunsen burners test tubes pipettes and beakers the glassfronted cabinet on the wall full of stoppered bottles containing sulfuric acid potassium sodium phosphate and such what memories it even smelled the same slightly acrid slightly rotten banks remembered the first chemistry set his parents bought him for christmas when he was thirteen remembered the fine powdered alum the blue copper sulfate and bright purple crystals of potassium permanganate he liked to mix them all up and see what happened paying no regard to the instructions or the safety precautions once he was heating some odd concoction over a candle at the kitchen table when the test tube cracked making a mess all over the place his mother went spare brighouse wearing a lightweight jacket and gray flannel trousers not a lab coat came forward and shook hands he was a freshfaced lad about paynes age with pale blue eyes fair hair and a lobster complexion as if hed been able to find some sun and stayed out in it too long his handshake was firm dry and short he noticed banks looking around the lab bring back memories does it he asked a few good ones i hope banks nodded he had enjoyed chemistry but his teacher titch barker was one of the worst most brutal bastards in the school he used the rubber connecting lines of the bunsen burners in his thrashings once he held bankss hand over a burner and made as if to light it but he backed off at the last moment banks had seen the sadistic gleam in his eye how much effort it had cost him not to strike the match banks hadnt given him the satisfaction of a plea for mercy or an outward expression of fear but he had been shaking inside anyway its sodium today said brighouse pardon sodium the way its so unstable in air always goes down well the kids these days dont have much of an attention span so you have to give them pyrotechnics to keep them interested luckily theres plenty of scope for that in chemistry ah sit down he pointed toward a tall stool by the nearest bench banks sat in front of a rack of test tubes and a bunsen burner brighouse sat opposite im not sure i can help you in any way brighouse began i know terry of course were colleagues and good mates to some extent but i cant say i know him well hes a very private person in many ways stands to reason said banks look at what he was doing in private brighouse blinked er quite mr brighouse geoff please call me geoff right geoff said banks who always preferred the first name as it gave him an odd sort of power over a suspect which geoff brighouse certainly was in his eyes how long have you known mr payne since he first came here nearly two years ago he was teaching in seacroft before then is that right yes i think so you didnt know him then no look if you dont mind my asking how is he by the way hes still in intensive care but hes hanging on good i mean oh shit this is so difficult i still cant believe it what am i supposed to say the mans a friend of mine after all no matter brighouse put his fist to his mouth and chewed on a knuckle he seemed suddenly close to tears no matter what hes done i was going to say that but im just confused forgive me itll take time i understand but in the meantime i need to find out all i can about terence payne what sorts of things did you do together mostly went to pubs we never drank a lot at least i didnt paynes a heavy drinker not until recently did you say anything to him a couple of times you know when he was in his car what did you do i tried to take his keys away what happened he got angry even hit me once terence payne hit you yeah but he was pissed hes got a temper when hes pissed did he give you any reason why he was drinking so much no he didnt talk about any personal problems he might be having no did you know of any problems other than the drinking he was letting his work slip a bit the same thing knight had said like the drinking it was probably more of a symptom than the problem itself jenny fuller would perhaps be able to confirm it but banks thought it made sense that a man who was doing who felt compelled to do what payne had been doing would need some sort of oblivion it seemed almost as if he had wanted to be caught wanted it all to be over the abduction of kimberley myers when he knew he was already in the system because of his car number plate was a foolhardy move if it hadnt been for dcs bowmore and singh he might have been brought to bankss attention earlier even if nothing had come from a second interview his name would have leaped out of holmes as soon as carol houseman had entered the new data that kimberley myers was a pupil at silverhill where payne taught and that he was listed as the owner of a car whose number ended in kwt despite the false ngv plates did he ever talk about kimberley myers banks asked no never did he ever talk about young girls in general he talked about girls not particularly young ones how did he talk about women with affection with disgust with lust with anger brighouse thought for a moment come to think of it he said i always thought terry sounded a bit sort of domineering the way he talked about women how so well hed spot a girl he fancied in a pub say and go on about you know how hed like to fuck her tie her to the bed and fuck her brains out that sort of thing i i mean im not a prude but sometimes it was a bit overthetop but thats just male crudeness isnt it brighouse raised an eyebrow is it i dont know i honestly dont know what it means im just saying he sounded rough and domineering when he talked about women talking about male crudeness did you ever lend terry any videos brighouse looked away what do you mean what sort of videos pornographic videos it wasnt possible for someone as red as brighouse to blush but for moment banks could almost have sworn that he did just some soft stuff nothing under the counter nothing you cant rent at the corner shop i lent him other videos too war films horror science fiction terrys a film buff no homemade videos of course not what do you think i am the jurys still out on that one geoff does terry own a camcorder not that i know of do you no i can just about manage a basic pointandshoot camera did you go to his house often once in a while ever go down in the cellar no why are you sure about that geoff damn it yes surely you cant think you do realize were carrying out a complete forensic examination of the paynes cellar dont you so so the first rule of a crime scene is that anyone whos been there leaves something and takes something away if you were there well find out thats all i wouldnt want you looking guilty simply for not telling me you were there on some innocent mission like watching a porn video together i never went down there okay just so long as you know did the two of you ever pick up any women together brighouses eyes shifted toward the bunsen burner and he fiddled with the test tube rack in front of him mr brighouse geoff it could be important i dont see how let me be the judge of that and if youre worried about splitting on a mate you shouldnt be your mates in hospital in a coma his wifes in the same hospital with a few cuts and bruises he inflicted on her and we found the body of kimberley myers in the cellar of his house remember kimberley you probably taught her didnt you ive just been to the postmortem of one of his previous victims and im still feeling a bit offcolor you dont need to know anymore and believe me you dont want to brighouse took a deep breath some of the bright red coloring seemed to have leached from his cheeks and brow well okay yeah we did once tell me what happened nothing you know no i dont know tell me look this is i dont care how embarrassing it is i want to know how he behaved with this woman you picked up carry on think of it as confiding in your doctor over a dose of clap brighouse swallowed and went on it was at a conference in blackpool in april just over a year ago before he got married yeah he was seeing lucy but they werent married then not till may go on not much to tell there was this cracking young teacher from aberdeen and one night you know wed all had a few drinks at the bar and got to flirting and all anyway she seemed game enough after a few gins so we went up to the room the three of you yes terry and i were sharing a room i mean id have stayed away if it was his score like but she made it clear she didnt mind it was her idea she said shed always fancied a threesome and you it had been a fantasy of mine yes what happened what do you think we had sex did she enjoy it well like i said it had been mostly her idea in the first place she was a bit drunk we all were she didnt object really she was keen it was only later what was only later look you know what its like no i dont know what its like well terry he suggested a greek sandwich i dont know if you i know what a greek sandwich is go on but she didnt fancy it what happened terry can be very persuasive how violence no he just doesnt give up he keeps on coming back to what he wants and it just wears down peoples resistance in the end so you had your greek sandwich brighouse looked down and rubbed his fingertips on the rough scratched lab bench yeah and she was willing sort of i mean yes nobody forced her not physically wed had a couple more drinks and terry was at her you know just verbally about how great it would be so in the end what happened afterward nothing really i mean she didnt kick up a fuss but it soured the mood she cried a bit seemed down you know as if she felt betrayed used and i could tell she didnt like it much when it was happening but you didnt stop no did she scream or tell you to stop no i mean she was making noises but well she was a real screamer to start with i was even worried about the people next door telling us to keep the noise down what happened next she went back to her own room we had a few more drinks then i passed out i assume terry did the same banks paused and made a jotting in his notebook i dont know if you realize this geoff but what youve just told me constitutes accessory to rape nobody raped her i told you she was willing enough doesnt sound like it to me two men her by herself what choice did she have she made it clear that she didnt want to do what terence payne was asking for but he went ahead and did it anyway he brought her around to his way of thinking bollocks geoff he wore down her resistance and resolve you said so yourself and ill also bet she was worried what might happen if she didnt go along with him nobody threatened her with violence maybe not in so many words look maybe things went just a little too far got out of hand maybe a little banks sighed the number of times hed heard that excuse for male violence against women it was what annie cabbots assailants had claimed too he felt disgusted with geoffrey brighouse but there wasnt much he could do the incident had taken place over a year ago the woman hadnt filed a complaint as far as he knew and terence payne was fighting for his life in the infirmary anyway still it was one worth noting down for future reference im sorry said brighouse but you must understand she never told us to stop didnt seem as if she had much chance to do that sandwiched between two strapping lads like you and terry well shed enjoyed everything else move on banks told himself before you hit him any other incidents like that no it was the only time believe it or not superintendent but after that night i was a bit ashamed even though i did nothing wrong and i wouldve been uncomfortable getting into a situation like that with terry again he was too much for me so i just avoided the possibility so payne was faithful to his wife from then on i didnt say that what do you mean just that the two of us didnt pick up any more girls together sometimes he told me you know about picking up prostitutes and all what did he do with them what do you think he didnt go into detail no did he ever talk about his wife in a sexual way no never he was very possessive about her and very guarded he hardly mentioned her at all when we were together it was as if she were part of a different life altogether terrys got a remarkable ability to compartmentalize things so it would seem did he ever suggest abducting young girls do you seriously believe that id have anything to do with that sort of thing i dont know geoff you tell me he talked to you about tying them up and fucking their brains out and he certainly raped that teacher in blackpool no matter how willing she might have been to have regular sex with the two of you earlier i dont know what to think of your part in all this geoff to be quite honest brighouse had lost all his color now and he was trembling but you cant think that i i mean why not theres no reason you couldnt have been in it with him more convenient if there were two of you easier to abduct your victims any chloroform in the lab chloroform yes why under lock and key is it of course who has a key i do terry keith miller the department head mr knight i dont know who else probably the caretaker and the cleaners for all i know whose prints do you think wed find on the bottle i dont know i certainly cant remember the last time i used the stuff what did you do last weekend not much stayed home marked some projects went shopping in town got a girlfriend at the moment geoff no see anyone else over the weekend just neighbors you know people from the other flats in the hall on the stairs oh and i went to the pictures saturday night on your own yes what did you go to see new james bond in the city center and then i dropped in at my local anyone see you a few of the regulars yes we had a game of darts how late were you there closing time banks scratched his cheek i dont know geoff when you get right down to it its not much of an alibi is it i wasnt aware id be needing one the lab door opened and two boys poked their heads in geoff brighouse seemed relieved he looked at his watch then at banks and gave a weak smile time for class im afraid banks stood up thats all right geoff i wouldnt want to interfere in the education of the young brighouse beckoned the boys in and more followed swarming around the stools at the benches he walked with banks over to the door id like you to come down to millgarth and make a statement banks said before leaving a statement me but why just a formality tell the detective exactly what you just told me and well also need to know exactly where you were and what you were doing at the times those five girls were abducted details witnesses the lot well also need a fingerprint scan and a sample of dna it wont be painful just like brushing your teeth this evening after school will do fine say five oclock go to the front desk and ask for dc younis hell be expecting you banks gave him a card and wrote down the name of the bright if rather judgmental young dc he had that very second chosen for the task of taking brighouses formal statement dc younis was active in his local methodist chapel and a bit conservative morally cheers said banks leaving a stunned and worriedlooking geoff brighouse to teach his class the joys of unstable sodium pat mitchell took a break when jenny turned up at the bank and they walked to the café in the shopping center over the road where they sipped rather weak milky tea as they talked pat was a vivacious brunette with damp brown eyes and a big engagement ring all she could do at first was shake her head and repeat i still cant believe this i just cant believe this is happening jenny was no stranger to denial either as a psychologist or as a woman so she made sympathetic noises and gave pat the time to compose herself once in a while someone from one of the other tables would give them a puzzled look as if he or she recognized them but couldnt quite place them but for the most part the café was empty and they were able to talk undisturbed how well do you know lucy jenny asked when pat had stopped crying were pretty close i mean ive known her for about four years ever since she started here at the bank she had a little flat then just off tong road were about the same age how is she have you seen her all the time she talked pats big brown eyes continued to glisten on the brink of tears i saw her this morning jenny answered shes doing well healing nicely physically anyway what was she like when you first met pat smiled at the memory she was fun a laugh she liked a lark what do you mean you know she just wanted to enjoy herself have a good time what was her idea of a good time clubbing going to pubs parties dancing chatting up lads just chatting them up lucy was well she was just funny when it came to lads back then i mean most of them seemed to bore her shed go out with them a couple of times and then shed chuck them why do you think that was pat swirled the grayish tea in her cup and looked into it as if she were seeking her fortune in the leaves i dont know it was as if she was waiting for someone mr right pat laughed something like that jenny got the impression that her laugh would have been a lot more ready and frequent had it not been for the circumstances did she ever tell you what her idea of mr right was no just that none of the lads around here seemed to satisfy her in any way she thought they were all stupid and all they had on their minds was football and sex in that order jenny had met plenty of lads like that what was she after a rich man an exciting one a dangerous one she wasnt interested in money particularly dangerous i dont know maybe she liked to live on the edge back then like she could be quite overthetop jenny made some notes how in what way its nothing really i shouldnt have spoken go on tell me pat lowered her voice look youre a psychiatrist right psychologist whatever does that mean if i tell you something it goes no further it stays between you and me and nobody can make you name your source i mean i wouldnt want lucy to think id been talking out of turn while jenny might have some valid defenses for not turning over her patients files without a court order in this instance she was working for the police and couldnt promise privacy on the other hand she needed to hear pats story and lucy would probably never find out about it without resorting to an outright lie she said ill do my best i promise pat chewed on her lower lip and thought for a moment then she leaned forward and gripped her teacup in both hands well once she wanted to go to some of those clubs in chapeltown west indian clubs yes i mean most nice white girls wouldnt go near places like that but lucy thought it would be exciting did she go yes she went with jasmine a jamaican girl from the boar lane branch of course nothing happened i think she might have tried some drugs though why what did she say she just hinted and did that you know that knowing sort of thing with her eyes like shed been there and the rest of us had only seen it on television she can be quite unnerving like that can lucy was there anything else yes once pat was in full flow it seemed there was no stopping her she once told me shed acted as a prostitute shed what its true pat looked around to make sure no one was interested and lowered her voice even more it was over a couple of years ago before terry came on the scene wed talked about it in a pub one night when we saw one you know a prostitute wondering what it would be like and all doing it for money just as a bit of a laugh really lucy said shed like to try it and find out and shed let us know did she uhhuh thats what she told me about a week later she said the night before shed put on some slutty clothes fishnet tights high heels a black leather miniskirt and a lowcut blouse and she sat at the bar of one of those business hotels near the motorway it didnt take long she said before a man approached her did she tell you what happened not all the details she knows when to hold back does lucy for effect like but she said they talked very businesslike and polite and all that and they came to some financial arrangement then they went up to his room and and they did it did you believe her not at first i mean its outrageous isnt it but eventually you did well like i said lucys always capable of surprising you and she likes danger excitement i suppose it was when she showed me the money that tipped the balance she showed you yes two hundred pounds she could have got it out of the bank she could but anyway thats all i know about it jenny made some more notes pat tilted her head to see what she was writing it must be a fascinating job yours she said it has its moments just like that woman who used to be on television prime suspect im not a policewoman pat just a consultant psychologist pat wrinkled her nose still its an exciting life isnt it catching criminals and all that excitement wasnt the first word that came to jennys mind but she decided to leave pat to her illusions like most peoples they wouldnt do her any real harm what about after lucy met terry she changed but then you do dont you otherwise whats the point of getting married if it doesnt change you i mean i see your point how did she change she became a lot more reserved stopped home more terrys a bit of a homebody so there was no more clubbing hes the jealous type too is terry if you know what i mean so she had to watch herself chatting up the lads not that she did that after they were married it was terry terry terry all the way then were they in love id say dotty about each other at least thats what she said and she seemed happy mostly lets back up a bit were you there when they met she says so but i cant for the life of me remember them meeting when was it nearly two years ago july a warm muggy night we were at a girls night out at a pub in seacroft one of those really big places with lots of rooms and dancing how do you remember it i remember lucy leaving alone she said she hadnt enough money for a taxi and she didnt want to miss her bus they dont run late id had a few drinks but i remember because i said something about her being careful the seacroft rapist was active around then what did she say she just gave me that look and left did you see terry there that night did you see him chatting her up i think i saw him there by himself at the bar but i dont remember seeing them talking what did lucy say later that shed talked to him when she went to the bar for drinks once and quite liked the look of him then they met again on her way out and went to some other pub together i cant remember i was definitely a bit squiffy anyway whatever happened that was it from then on it was a different lucy she didnt have anywhere near enough time for her old friends did you ever visit them go for dinner a couple of times with my fiancé steve we got engaged a year ago she held up her ring the diamond caught the light and flashed were getting married in august weve already booked the honeymoon were going to rhodes did you get along with terry okay pat gave a little shudder no i dont like him never did steve thought he was all right but thats why we stopped going over really theres just something about him and lucy she was sort of like a zombie when he was around either that or she acted like she was on drugs what do you mean well its just a figure of speech i mean i know she wasnt really on drugs but just you know overexcited talking too much mind jumping all over the place did you ever see any signs of abuse you mean did he hit her and stuff yes no nothing i never saw any bruises or anything like that did lucy seem to change in any way what do you mean recently did she become more withdrawn seem afraid of anything pat chewed on her the edge of her thumb for a moment before answering she changed a bit the past few months now you come to mention it she said finally i cant say exactly when it started but she seemed more nervy more distracted as if she had a problem a lot on her mind did she confide in you no wed drifted apart quite a bit by then was he really beating her i cant understand it can you how a woman especially a woman like lucy can let that happen jenny could but there was no point trying to convince pat if lucy sensed that would be her old friends attitude toward her problem it was no surprise that she turned to a neighbor like maggie forrest who at least showed empathy did lucy ever talk about her past her childhood pat looked at her watch no all i know is that shes from somewhere near hull and it was a pretty dull life she couldnt wait to get away and she didnt keep in touch as much as she should especially after terry came on the scene look i really have to get back now i hope ive been of help she stood up jenny stood and shook her hand thanks yes youve been very helpful as she watched pat scurry back to the bank jenny looked at her watch too she had enough time to drive out to hull and see what lucys parents had to say it was several days since banks had last stopped in at his eastvale office and the amount of accumulated paperwork was staggering since he had temporarily inherited detective superintendent gristhorpes workload consequently when he did find time to drop by the station late that afternoon driving straight back after his interview with geoff brighouse his pigeonhole was stuffed with reports budget revisions memos requests telephone message slips crime statistics and various circulars awaiting his signature he decided to clear up some of the backlog of paperwork and take annie cabbot for a quick drink at the queens arms to discuss her progress in the janet taylor investigation and maybe build a few bridges in the process after leaving a message for annie to drop by his office at six oclock banks closed the door behind him and dropped the pile of papers on his desk he hadnt even changed his dalesman calendar from april to may he noticed flipping over from a photo of the stone bridge at linton to the soaring lines of york minsters east window pink and white may blossom blurred in the foreground it was thursday the eleventh of may hard to believe it was only three days since the gruesome discovery at number the hill already the tabloids were rubbing their hands with glee and calling the place dr terrys house of horrors and even worse the house of payne they had somehow got hold of photographs of both terry and lucy payne the former cropped from a school class picture by the look of it and the latter from an employee of the month presentation to lucy at the natwest branch where she worked both photos were poor in quality and youd have to know who they were before youd recognize either of them banks turned on his computer and answered any email he thought merited a response then he picked away at the pile of papers not much it seemed had happened in his absence the major preoccupation had been with a series of nasty post office robberies in which one masked man terrorized staff and customers with a long knife and an ammonia spray no one had been hurt yet but that didnt mean they wouldnt be there had been four such robberies in the western division over a month ds hatchley was out rounding up his ragbag assortment of informants apart from the robberies perhaps the most serious crime on their hands was the theft of a tortoise that happened to be sleeping in a cardboard box nicked from someones garden along with a raleigh bicycle and a lawn mower business as usual and somehow banks found an odd sort of comfort in these dull predictable crimes after the horrors of the paynes cellar he turned on his radio and recognized the slow movement from a late schubert piano sonata he felt a tight pain between his eyes and massaged the spot gently when that didnt work he swallowed a couple of paracetamol he kept in his desk for emergencies such as this washed them down with tepid coffee then he pushed the mound of papers aside and let the music spill over him in gentle waves the headaches were coming more frequently these days along with the sleepless nights and a strange reluctance to go to work it reminded him of the pattern he went through just before he left london for yorkshire when he was on the edge of burnout and he wondered if he was getting in the same state again he should probably see his doctor he decided when he had time the ringing telephone disturbed him as it had so often before scowling he picked up the offending instrument and growled banks stefan here you asked me to keep you informed banks relaxed his tone yes stefan any developments banks could hear voices in the background millgarth most likely or the payne house one piece of good news theyve lifted paynes prints from the machete used to kill pc morrisey and the lab reports both yellow plastic fibers from the rope in the scrapings taken from under lucy paynes fingernails along with traces of kimberley myerss blood on the sleeve of her dressing gown kimberleys blood on lucy paynes dressing gown yes so she was down there banks said looks like it mind you she could explain away the fibers by saying she hung out the washing they did use the same kind of clothesline in the back garden ive seen it but the blood maybe more tricky said stefan there wasnt very much but at least it proves that she was down there thanks stefan its a big help what about terence payne the same blood and yellow fibers along with a fair quantity of pc morriseys blood what about the bodies one more skeletal out in the garden that makes all five skeletal how long would that take depends on temperature and insect activity said stefan could it have happened in just a month or so could have with the right conditions it hasnt been very warm this past month though but is it possible its possible leanne wray had disappeared on the thirtyfirst of march which was slightly over a month ago so there was at least some possibility that it was her remains anyway stefan went on theres plenty of garden left theyre digging very slowly and carefully to avoid disturbing the bones ive arranged for a botanist and an entomologist from the university to visit the scene tomorrow they should be able to help us with time of death did you find any clothing with the victims no nothing of a personal nature get to work on identifying that body stefan and let me know the minute you have anything even if its negative will do banks said goodbye to stefan and hung up then he walked over to his open window and sneaked a prohibited cigarette it was a hot muggy afternoon with the sort of tension in the air that meant rain would probably come soon perhaps even a thunderstorm office workers sniffed the air and reached for their umbrellas as they headed home shopkeepers closed up and wound back the awnings banks thought about sandra again how when she used to work at the community center down north market street they would often meet for a drink in the queens arms before heading home happy days or so they had seemed and now she was pregnant with seans baby the schubert piano music played on the serene and elegiac opening of the final bflat sonata bankss headache began to subside a little the one thing he remembered about sandras pregnancies was that she hadnt enjoyed them hadnt glowed with the joys of approaching motherhood she had suffered extreme morning sickness and though she didnt drink or smoke much she continued to do both because back then nobody made such a fuss about it she also continued to go to galleries and plays and meet with friends and complained when her condition made it difficult or impossible for her to do so while pregnant with tracy she had slipped on the ice and broken her leg in her seventh month and spent the rest of her confinement with a cast on that more than anything had driven her crazy unable to get out and about with her camera the way she loved to do stuck in their poky little kennington flat watching gray day follow gray day all that winter while banks was working all hours hardly ever home well perhaps sean would be around for her more often lord only knew perhaps if banks had been but he didnt get to follow that thought to the particular circle of hell he was sure must be reserved for neglectful husbands and fathers annie cabbot tapped at his door and popped her head around giving him a temporary escape from the guilt and selfrecrimination that seemed to be so much his lot these days no matter how hard he tried to do the right thing you did say six oclock didnt you yes sorry annie miles away banks picked up his jacket checking the pockets for wallet and cigarettes then cast a backward glance at the pile of untouched paperwork on his desk to hell with it if they expected him to do two three jobs at once then they could wait for their bloody paperwork as jenny drove through a shower and looked out at the ugly forest of cranes that rose up from goole docks she wondered for the umpteenth time what on earth had induced her to return to england to yorkshire it certainly wasnt family ties jenny was an only child and her parents were retired academics living in sussex both her mother and father had been far too wrapped up in their work he as a historian she as a physicist and jenny had spent more of her childhood with a succession of nannies and au pairs than with her parents given their natural academic detachment too jenny often felt that she had been far more of an experiment than a daughter it didnt bother her after all she didnt know any different and it was very much the way she had lived her life too as an experiment sometimes she looked back and it all seemed so shallow and selfcentered that she felt herself panic other times it seemed just fine she would turn forty that coming december was still single had never in fact been married and while a bit shopsoiled battered and bruised she was far from down and out for the count she still had her looks and her figure though she needed more and more magic potions for the former and had to work harder and harder at the university gym to keep those excess pounds from creeping on given her taste for good food and wine she also had a good job a growing reputation as an offender profiler publications to her credit so why did she sometimes feel so empty why did she always feel she was in a hurry to get somewhere she never arrived at even now with the rain lashing against her windscreen the wipers going as fast as they could go she was doing ninety kilometers per hour she slowed down to eighty but her speed soon started creeping up again along with the feeling that she was late for something always late for something the shower ended elgars enigma variations was playing on classic fm to the north a power station with its huge corsetshaped cooling towers squatted against the horizon the steam it spewed almost indistinguishable from the low cloud she was nearing the end of the motorway now the eastbound m was like so many things in life it left you just short of your destination well she told herself she had come back to yorkshire because she was running away from a bad relationship with randy story of her life she had a nice condo in west hollywood rented at a most generous rate by a writer who had made enough money to buy a place way up in laurel canyon and she was within walking distance of a supermarket and the restaurants and clubs on santa monica boulevard she had her teaching and research at ucla and she had randy but randy had a habit of sleeping with pretty twentyoneyearold graduate students after a minor breakdown jenny had called it a day and come running back to eastvale perhaps that explained why she was always in a hurry she thought desperate to get home wherever that was desperate to get away from one bad relationship and right into the next one it was a theory at any rate and then of course alan was in eastvale too if he was part of the reason why she had stayed away could he also be part of the reason why she had come back she didnt want to dwell on that the m turned into the a and soon jenny caught a glimpse of the humber bridge ahead to her right stretching out majestically over the broad estuary into the mists and fens of lincolnshire and little holland suddenly a few shafts of sunlight pierced the ragged cloud cover as the nimrod variation reached its rousing climax a yorkshire moment she remembered the la moments randy was so fond of pointing out in their early days when they drove and drove and drove around the huge sprawling city a palm tree silhouetted against a bloodorange sky a big bright full moon low over the hollywood sign as soon as she could jenny pulled into a layby and studied her map the clouds were dispersing now allowing even more sunlight through but the roads were still swamped with puddles and the cars and lorries swished up sheets of water as they sped by her lucys parents lived off the a to beverley so she didnt have to drive through hull city center she pressed on through the straggling western suburbs and soon found the residential area she was looking for clive and hilary liversedges house was a nicely maintained baywindow semi in a quiet crescent of similar houses not much of a place for a young girl to grow up jenny thought her own parents had moved often throughout her childhood and though she had been born in durham she had at various times lived in bath bristol exeter and norwich all university towns and all full of randy young men she had never been stuck in a dull suburban backwater like this a small plump man with a soft gray mustache answered the door he was wearing a green cardigan unbuttoned and dark brown trousers which hugged the underside of his rounded gut a belt wouldnt be much good with a shape like that jenny thought noticing the braces that held the trousers up clive liversedge come in love he said you must be dr fuller thats me jenny followed him into the cramped hall from which a glasspaneled door led to a tidy living room with a red velour threepiece suite an electric fire with fake coals and striped wallpaper somehow it wasnt the kind of place jenny had imagined lucy payne growing up in she couldnt get any sense of lucy living in this environment at all she could see what banks meant about the invalid mother pale skin and raccoon eyes hilary liversedge reclined on the sofa a wool blanket covering her lower half her arms were thin and the skin looked puckered and loose she didnt move when jenny entered but her eyes looked lively and attentive enough despite the yellowish cast of the sclera jenny didnt know what was wrong with her but she put it down to one of those vague chronic illnesses that certain types of people luxuriate in toward the ends of their lives how is she clive liversedge asked as if lucy had perhaps suffered a minor fall or car accident they said it wasnt serious is she doing all right i saw her this morning jenny said and shes bearing up well poor lass said hilary to think of what shes been through tell her shes welcome to come here and stay with us when she gets out of hospital i just came to get some sense of what lucys like jenny began what sort of a girl she was the liversedges looked at each other just ordinary said clive normal said hilary right thought jenny normal girls go marrying serial killers every day even if lucy had nothing at all to do with the killings there had to be something odd about her something out of the ordinary jenny had even sensed that during their brief chat in the hospital that morning she could couch it in as much psychological gobbledygook as she wanted and jenny had come across plenty of that in her career but what it came down to was the feeling that lucy payne was definitely a sausage or two short of the full english breakfast what was she like at school jenny pressed on very bright answered clive she got three alevels good marks too as and bs added hilary she could have gone to university clive added why didnt she she didnt want to said clive she wanted to get out in the world and make a living for herself is she ambitious shes not greedy if thats what you mean hilary answered of course she wants to get on in the world like everyone else but she doesnt think she needs a university degree to do it theyre overrated anyway dont you think i suppose so said jenny who had a ba and a phd was she studious when she was at school i wouldnt really say so said hilary she did what she had to do in order to pass but she wasnt a swot was she popular at school she seemed to get on all right with the other children we got no complaints from her at any rate no bullying nothing like that well there was one girl once but that came to nothing said clive someone bullying lucy no someone complaining she was being bullied by lucy accused her of demanding money with threats what happened nothing it was just her word against lucys and you believed lucy yes so no action was taken no they couldnt prove anything against her and nothing else like that occurred no did she take part in any afterschool activities she wasnt much a one for sports but she was in a couple of school plays very good too wasnt she love hilary liversedge nodded was she wild at all she could be highspirited and if she got it in her mind to do something there was no stopping her but i wouldnt say she was especially wild what about at home how did you all get along they looked at each again it was an ordinary enough gesture but it unnerved jenny a bit fine quiet as a mouse never any trouble said clive when did she leave home when she was eighteen she got that job at the bank in leeds we didnt stand in her way not that we could have added hilary have you seen much of her lately hilarys expression darkened a little she said shes not been able to get over here as much as shed have liked when was the last time you saw her christmas answered clive last christmas the year before it was as pat mitchell had said lucy had become distanced from her parents so thats seventeen months i suppose so did she telephone or write she writes us nice letters said hilary what does she tell you about her life about her job and the house just normal ordinary sorts of things did she tell you how terry was doing at the school this exchanged look definitely spoke volumes no said clive and we didnt ask we didnt approve of her taking up with the first boy she met said hilary did she have other boyfriends before terry nobody serious but you thought she could do better were not saying theres anything wrong with terry he seems nice enough and hes got a decent job good prospects but but he seemed to sort of take over didnt he clive yes it was very odd what do you mean jenny asked it was as if he didnt want her to see us did he or she ever say that hilary shook her head the loose skin flapped not in so many words it was just an impression i got we got jenny made a note to her this sounded like one of the stages of a sexually sadistic relationship that she had learned about at quantico the sadist in this case terry payne starts to isolate his partner from her family pat mitchell had also suggested the same sort of progressive separation from her friends they just kept to themselves said clive what did you think of terry there was something strange about him but i couldnt put my finger on it what sort of person is lucy jenny went on is she generally trusting naïve dependent i wouldnt really describe her in any of those terms would you hilary no said hilary shes very independent for a start headstrong too always makes her own decisions and acts on them like about not going to university and getting a job instead once shed made her mind up she was off it was the same with marrying terry love at first sight she said you werent at the wedding though hilary cant travel anymore said clive going over and patting his wifes inert form can you love we sent a telegram and a present hilary said a nice set of royal doulton do you think lucy lacks confidence selfesteem it depends on what youre talking about shes confident enough at work but not so much around people she often becomes very quiet around strangers very wary and reserved she doesnt like crowds but she used to like going out with a small group of friends you know the girls from work that sort of thing would you say shes a loner by nature to some extent yes shes a very private person never told us much about what was going on or what was going through her mind jenny was wondering whether she should ask if lucy pulled the wings off flies wet her bed and set fire to the local school but she couldnt find an easy way to get around to doing it was she like that even as a child she asked or did her need for solitude develop later in life we wouldnt know the answer to that said clive looking over at his wife we didnt know her then what do you mean well lucy wasnt our daughter not our natural daughter hilary cant have children you see shes got a heart condition always has had doctor said childbirth could kill her hilary patted her heart and gave jenny a rueful look you adopted lucy no no we fostered her lucy was our foster child the third and last as it turned out she was with us by far the longest and we came to think of her as our own i dont understand why didnt you tell the police this they didnt ask said clive as if that made it all perfectly reasonable jenny was stunned here was an essential piece of information in the puzzle that was lucy payne and nobody else on the team knew it how old was she when she came to you jenny asked twelve said clive it was in march i remember the day as if it were yesterday didnt you know lucy was one of the alderthorpe seven annie lounged back in her hard wood chair as if it had been molded to fit her shape and stretched out her legs banks had always envied the way she managed to seem so centered and comfortable in almost any environment and she was doing it now she took a sip of her theakstons bitter and almost purred then she smiled at banks ive been cursing you all day you know she said taking your name in vain i thought my ears were burning by rights they should have both burned off by now point taken what did superintendent chambers have to say annie gave a dismissive wave what youd expect that its my career on the line if theres any fallout oh and he warned me about you about me yes said he thought you might try to pump me for information to play my cards close to my chest which he examined rather too closely for my comfort by the way anything else yes he said youre a ladies man is that true banks laughed he did he really said that annie nodded the queens arms was busy with the afterwork crowd and tourists seeking shelter and banks and annie had been lucky to get seats at the small dimpled coppertopped table in the corner by the window banks could see the ghostly images of people with umbrellas drifting back and forth on market street beyond the red and yellow panes of glass rain spotted the windows and he could hear it tapping in the pauses between words savage garden were on the jukebox claiming that they loved someone before they met her the air was full of smoke and animated chatter what do you think of janet taylor banks asked im not trying to pry into your case im just interested in your first impression so you say anyway i quite like her and i feel sorry for her shes a probationary pc with limited experience put in an impossible position she did what came naturally but ill not let my feelings blinker my judgment i havent been able to put it all together yet but it looks to me as if janet taylor lied on her statement deliberately lied or just didnt remember i suppose we could give her the benefit of the doubt on that look ive never been in a situation like she was i cant begin to imagine what it must have been like for her the fact remains that according to dr mogabe she must have hit payne with her baton at least seven or eight times after he was beyond any sort of retaliatory action he was stronger than her maybe thats what was required to subdue him the law allows us some latitude on reasonable force in making an arrest annie shook her head she stretched out her legs sideways from the chair and crossed them banks noticed the thin gold chain around her ankle one of the many things he found sexy about annie she lost it alan it goes way beyond selfdefense and reasonable force theres another thing too what i spoke to the paramedics and ambulance attendants who were first at the scene they hadnt a clue what had happened of course but it didnt take them long to work out it was something really nasty and bizarre and one of them said when he went over to pc taylor who was cradling pc morriseys body she looked over at payne and said is he dead did i kill the bastard that could mean anything my point exactly in the hands of a good barrister it could mean she had intended to kill him all along and was asking if she had succeeded in her aim it could signify intent it could also just be an innocent question you know as well as i do theres nothing innocent about this business at all especially with the hadleigh case on the news every day and dont forget that payne was unarmed and down on the floor when she aimed the final few blows how do we know that pc taylor had already broken his wrist according to her statement and kicked the machete into the corner where it was found later also the angles of the blows and the force behind them indicate she had the advantage of height which we know she didnt have naturally paynes six foot one and pc taylors only five foot six banks took a long drag on his cigarette as he digested what annie had to say thinking it wouldnt be a hell of a lot of fun to tell ac hartnell about this not an immediate threat to her then he said not from where im looking annie shifted a little in her chair its possible she admitted im not saying that wouldnt freak out even the besttrained copper but ive got to say that it looks to me as if she lost it id still like to have a look at the scene sure though i doubt theres much left to see now the socos have been in there for three days even so i understand said banks and he did there was something ritualistic in visiting the scene whether you picked up vibrations from the walls or what it didnt really matter what mattered was that it connected you more closely with the crime youd stood there in that place where evil had happened when do you want to go tomorrow morning ill call on janet taylor after ill arrange it with the officers on duty said banks we can go down there together if you like im off to talk to lucy payne again before she disappears theyre releasing her from hospital so ive heard her injuries arent that serious besides they need the bed annie paused then she said id rather make my own way okay if thats what you want oh dont look so crestfallen alan its nothing personal it just wouldnt look good and people would see us no matter what you think youre right banks agreed look if theres any chance of a bit of spare time saturday night how about dinner and the corners of annies mouth turned up and a gleam came to her dark eyes dinner and what you know i dont tell me banks glanced around to make sure no one was eavesdropping then he leaned forward but before he could say anything the doors opened and dc winsome jackman walked in heads turned some because she was black and some because she was a gorgeous statuesque young woman winsome was on duty and banks and annie had told her where they would be sorry to disturb you sir she said pulling up a chair and sitting down thats all right said banks what is it a dc karen hodgkins from the task force just phoned and winsome looked at annie its terence payne she said he died an hour ago in the infirmary without recovering consciousness oh shit said annie well that should make life interesting said banks reaching for another cigarette tell me about the alderthorpe seven said banks into his phone at home later that evening he had just settled down to duke ellingtons black brown and beige the latest copy of gramophone and two fingers of laphroaig when jenny phoned he turned down the music and reached for his cigarettes i mean he went on i vaguely remember hearing about it at the time but i cant remember many details i dont have a lot yet myself said jenny only what the liversedges told me go on banks heard a rustle of paper at the other end of the line on the eleventh of february jenny began police and social workers made a dawn raid on the village of alderthorpe near spurn head on the east yorkshire coast they were acting on allegations of ritual satanic abuse of children and investigating a missing child who blew the whistle banks asked i dont know said jenny i didnt ask banks filed it away for later okay carry on im not a policeman alan i dont know what sort of questions to ask im sure you did just fine please go on they took six children from two separate households into care what exactly was supposed to have been going on at first it was all very vague lewd and libidinous behavior ritualistic music dance and costume sounds like police headquarters on a saturday night anything else well thats where it gets interesting and sick it seems this was one of the few such cases in which prosecutions went forward and convictions were gained all the liversedges would tell me was that there were tales of torture of kids being forced to drink urine and eat christ im not squeamish alan but this stuff turns my stomach thats all right take it easy they were humiliated jenny went on sometimes physically injured kept in cages without food for days used as objects of sexual gratification in satanic rituals one child a girl called kathleen murray was found dead her remains showed evidence of torture and sexual abuse how did she die she was strangled shed also been beaten and halfstarved too that was what sparked the whistleblower her not turning up for school and this was proven in court most of it yes the killing the satanic stuff didnt come out in the trial i suppose the cps must have thought it would just sound like too much mumbo jumbo how did it come out some of the children gave descriptions later after theyd been fostered lucy no according to the liversedges lucy never spoke about what happened she just put it all behind her was it followed up no there were similar allegations and raids in cleveland rochdale and the orkneys and pretty soon it was all over the papers caused a hell of a national outcry epidemic of child abuse that sort of thing overzealous social workers questions in the house the lot i remember said banks most of the cases were thrown out and nobody wanted to talk about the one that was true well alderthorpe wasnt the only one there was a similar case in nottingham in that also resulted in convictions but it wasnt widely publicized then we got the butlerschloss report and revisions of the childrens act what happened to lucys real parents they went to jail the liversedges have no idea whether theyre still there or what they havent kept track of things banks sipped some laphroaig and flicked his cigarette end into the empty grate so lucy stayed with the liversedges yes she changed her name too by the way she used to be called linda linda godwin then with all the publicity she wanted to change it the liversedges assured me its all legal and aboveboard from linda godwin to lucy liversedge to lucy payne banks thought interesting anyway jenny went on after theyd told me all this i pushed them a bit more and at least got them to admit life with lucy wasnt quite as ordinary and normal as theyd originally said it was oh problems adjusting surprise surprise the first two years between the ages of twelve and fourteen lucy was as good as gold a quiet passive considerate and sensitive kid they were worried she was traumatized and lucy saw a child psychiatrist for a while then from fourteen to sixteen she started to act up come out of her shell she stopped seeing the psychiatrist there were boys suspicions that she was having sex and then there was the bullying bullying yes at first they told me it was an isolated incident and came to nothing but later they said it caused a few problems with the school lucy was bullying younger girls out of their dinner money and stuff like that its fairly common but in lucys case a phase the liversedges worked with the school authorities and the psychiatrist entered the picture again briefly then lucy settled down to behave herself the next two years sixteen to eighteen she quieted down withdrew more into herself became less active socially and sexually she did her alevels got good results and got a job with the natwest bank in leeds that was four years ago it seemed almost as if she were planning her escape she had very little contact with the liversedges after she left and i get the impression that they were relieved why i dont know why call it intuition but i got the feeling that they ended up being scared of lucy for the way she seemed able to manipulate them as i say its just a vague feeling interesting go on they saw even less of her after she hooked up with terence payne i thought when they first told me that that he might have been responsible for isolating her from her family and friends you know the way abusers often do but now it seems just as likely that she was isolating herself her friend from work pat mitchell said the same thing meeting terry really changed lucy cut her off almost entirely from her old life her old ways so she was either under his thrall or shed found a new sort of life that she preferred yes jenny told him about the incident of lucys prostitution banks thought for a moment its interesting he said really interesting but it doesnt prove anything i told you that would probably be the case it makes her weird but being weirds no grounds for arrest or half the population would be behind bars more than half but hang on a minute jenny youve come up with a number of leads worth pursuing like what like what if lucy was involved in the alderthorpe abuse herself i remember reading at the time that there were cases of some of the older victims abusing their own younger siblings but what would it mean even if we could prove that after all this time i dont know jenny im just thinking out aloud whats your next step im going to talk to someone from the social services tomorrow see if i can get the names of any of the social workers involved good ill work it from the police angle when i get a spare moment there are bound to be records files then what i want to go to alderthorpe nose around talk to people who remember be careful jenny its bound to be a very raw nerve still out there even after all this time ill be careful and dont forget there might still be someone who escaped prosecution worried about new revelations that makes me feel really safe and secure the other kids yes what do you know about them nothing really except they were aged between eight and twelve any idea where they are no the liversedges dont know and i did ask them dont be defensive well make a detective of you yet no thanks lets see if we can find them shall we they might be able to tell us a lot more about lucy payne than anyone else okay ill see how much the social workers are willing to tell me not much ill bet your best chance will be if one of thems retired or moved on to some other line of work then spilling the beans wont seem like such a betrayal hey im supposed to be the psychologist leave that sort of thinking to me banks laughed over the phone its a blurred line sometimes isnt it detective work and psychology try and tell some of your oafish colleagues that thanks jenny youve done a great job and ive only just begun keep in touch promise when banks put the phone down mahalia jackson was singing come sunday he turned up the volume and took his drink outside to his little balcony over gratly falls the rain had stopped but the downpour had been heavy enough to swell the sound of the falls it was just after sunset and the deep vermilions purples and oranges were dying in the western sky streaked with dark ribs of cloud while the darkening east went from pale to inky blue just across the falls was a field of grazing sheep in it stood a clump of huge old trees where rooks nested and often woke him early in the morning with their noisy squabbling such illtempered birds they seemed beyond the field the daleside sloped down to the river swain and banks could see the opposite hillside a mile or more away darkening in the evening rising to the long grinning skeletons mouth of crow scar the runic patterns of the drystone walls seemed to stand out in relief as the light faded just a little to his right he could see the helmthorpe church tower poking up from the valley bottom banks looked at his watch still early enough to stroll down there and have a pint or two in the dog and gun maybe chat with one or two of the locals hed become friendly with since his move but he decided he didnt fancy company he had too much on his mind what with terence paynes death the mystery of leanne wray and the revelations jenny fuller had just come through with as regards lucys past since taking on the chameleon investigation he realized he had become more and more of a loner less inclined to make small talk at the bar partly he supposed it was the burden of command but it was also something more the proximity to such evil perhaps that tainted him somehow and made small talk seem like a completely inadequate response to what was happening the news of sandras pregnancy was also still weighing on his mind bringing back some memories he had hoped to forget he knew he wouldnt be good company but nor would he be able to get to sleep so early he nipped inside and poured another shot of whiskey then picked up his cigarettes and went back outside to lean against the damp wall and enjoy the last of the evening light a curlew piped up on the distant moors and mahalia jackson sang on humming the tune long after she had run out of words friday morning started badly for maggie she had spent a night disturbed by vague and frightening nightmares that scuttled away into the shadows the minute she awoke screaming and tried to grasp them getting back to sleep was difficult not only because of the bad dreams but also because of the eerie noises and voices she could hear from across the road didnt the police ever sleep once getting up to go for a glass of water she looked out of her bedroom window and saw some uniformed police officers carrying cardboard boxes into a van waiting with its engine running then some men carried what looked like electronic equipment through the front door and a short while later maggie fancied she could see a strange ghostly light sweeping the living room of number behind the drawn curtains the digging continued in the front garden surrounded by a canvas screen and lit on the inside so that all maggie could see was enlarged and deformed shadows of men silhouetted against the canvas these figures carried over into her next nightmare and in the end she didnt know whether she was asleep or awake she got up a little after seven oclock and headed for the kitchen where a cup of tea helped soothe her frayed nerves this was one english habit that she had slipped into easily she planned to spend the day working on grimm again perhaps hänsel and gretel now that she had satisfactory sketches for rapunzel and trying to put the business of number out of her head for a few hours at least then she heard the paperboy arrive and the newspaper slip through her letter box on to the hall mat she hurried out and carried it back to the kitchen where she spread it on the table lorraine temples story was prominent on the front page beside the bigger headline story about terence paynes dying without recovering consciousness there was even a photograph of maggie taken without her knowledge standing just outside her front gate it must have been taken when she was going down to the pub to talk with lorraine she realized as she was wearing the same jeans and light cotton jacket as she had worn on tuesday house of payne neighbor speaks out ran the headline and the article went on to detail how maggie had heard suspicious sounds coming from across the hill and called the police afterward calling maggie lucys friend lorraine temple reported what maggie had said about lucys being a victim of domestic abuse and how she was scared of her husband all of which was fine and accurate enough as far as it went but then came the sting in the tail according to sources in toronto lorraine temple went on to report maggie forrest herself was on the run from an abusive husband toronto lawyer william burke the article detailed the time maggie had spent in hospital and all the fruitless court orders issued to stop bills going near her describing maggie as a nervous mousy sort of woman lorraine temple also mentioned that she was seeing a local psychiatrist called dr simms who declined to comment lorraine ended by suggesting that perhaps because of maggies own psychological problems maggie had been gullible and that her identification with lucys plight may have blinded her to the truth lorraine couldnt come out and say that she thought lucy was guilty of anything the laws of libel forbade that but she did have a very good stab at making her readers think lucy might just be the sort of manipulative and deceitful person who could twist a weak woman like maggie around her little finger it was rubbish of course but effective rubbish nonetheless how could she do that now everybody would know every time maggie walked down the street to go to the shops or catch the bus into town the neighbors and shopkeepers would look at her differently with pity and perhaps just the merest hint of blame in their eyes some people would avoid looking her in the eye and perhaps even stop talking to her associating her too closely for comfort with the events at number even strangers who recognized her from the photograph would wonder about her perhaps claire would stop coming to see her altogether though she hadnt been since the time the policeman turned up and maggie was already worried about her perhaps even bill would find out it was her own fault of course she had put herself in harms way she had been trying to do a favor for poor lucy trying to garner her some public sympathy and the whole thing had backfired how stupid she had been to trust lorraine temple one lousy article like this and her whole new fragile protected world would change just like that it wasnt fair maggie told herself as she cried over the breakfast table it just wasnt fair after a short but satisfying nights sleep perhaps due to the generous doses of laphroaig and duke ellington banks was back in his millgarth cubbyhole by eightthirty on friday morning and the first news to cross his desk was a note from stefan nowak informing him that the skeletal remains dug up in the payness garden were not leanne wrays had banks been harboring the slightest hope that leanne might still be alive and well after all this time he would have jumped for joy but as it was he rubbed his forehead in frustration it looked as if it was going to be another one of those days he punched in stefans mobile number and got an answer after three rings it sounded as if stefan was in the middle of another conversation but he muttered a few asides and gave his attention to banks sorry about that he said problems typical breakfast chaos im just trying to get out of the house i know what you mean look about this identification its solid sir dental records dna will take a bit longer theres no way its leanne wray im just about to set off back to the house the lads are still digging who the hell can it be dont know all ive been able to find out so far is that its a young woman late teens to early twenties been there a few months and theres a lot of stainless steel in her dental work including a crown meaning banks asked a faint memory beckoning possible eastern european origin they still use a lot of stainless steel over there right banks had come across something like that before a forensic dentist had once told him that russians used stainless steel eastern european just a possibility sir all right any chance of that dna comparison between payne and the seacroft rapist turning up before the weekend ill get onto them this morning see if i can give them a prod okay thanks keep at it stefan will do banks hung up more puzzled than ever one of the first things ac hartnell had instituted when the team was first put together was a special squad to keep tabs on all missing persons cases throughout the entire country mispers as they were called particularly if they involved blond teenagers with no apparent reasons for running away disappearing on their way home from clubs pubs cinemas and dances the team had monitored scores of cases every day but none had met the criteria of the chameleon investigation except one girl in cheshire who had turned up alive and contrite two days later after a brief shackup with her boyfriend about which she just happened to forget to tell her parents and the sadder case of a young girl in lincoln who it turned out had been run over and had not been carrying any identification now here was stefan saying theyd probably got a dead eastern european girl in the garden banks didnt get very far with his chain of thought before his office door opened and dc filey dropped a copy of that mornings post on his desk annie parked her purple astra up the street and walked toward number the hill shielding her eyes from the morning sunlight crime scene tape and trestles blocked off that section of pavement in front of the garden wall so that pedestrians had to make a detour on to the tarmac road to get by one or two people paused to glance over the garden gate as they passed annie noticed but most walked to the other side of the road and averted their eyes she even saw one elderly woman cross herself annie showed her warrant card to the officer on duty signed in at the gate and walked down the garden path she wasnt afraid of seeing gruesome sights if indeed there were any left inside the house but she had never before visited a scene so completely overrun with soco activity and just walking into it made her edgy the men in the front garden ignored her and went on with their digging the door was ajar and when annie pushed gently it opened into the hall the hallway was deserted and at first the house seemed so quiet inside that annie thought she was alone then someone shouted and the sound of a pneumatic drill ripped through the air coming up from the cellar shattering her illusion the house was hot stuffy and full of dust and annie sneezed three times before exploring further her nerves gradually gave way to professional curiosity and she noted with interest that the carpets had been taken up leaving only the bare concrete floors and wooden stairs and that the living room had been stripped of furniture too even down to the light fixtures several holes had been punched in the walls no doubt to ensure that no bodies had been entombed there annie gave a little shudder poes the cask of amontillado was one of the more frightening stories she had read at school everywhere she went she was conscious of the narrow ropedoff pathway she knew she was supposed to follow in an odd way it was like visiting the brontë parsonage or wordsworths cottage where you could only stand and look beyond the rope at the antique furniture the kitchen where three soco officers were working on the sink and drains was in the same sorry state tiles wrenched up oven and fridge gone cupboards bare fingerprint dust everywhere annie hadnt thought anyone could do so much damage to a place in three days one of the socos looked over at her and asked her rather testily what she thought she was doing there she flashed him her warrant card and he went back to ripping out the sink the pneumatic drill stopped and annie heard the sound of a vacuum cleaner from upstairs an eerily domestic sound amidst all the crime scene chaos though she knew its purpose was far more sinister than getting rid of the dust she took the silence from the cellar as her cue to go down there noting as she did so the door open to the garage which had been stripped as bare as the rest of the house the car was gone no doubt in the police garage being taken apart piece by piece and the oilstained floor had been dug up she sensed herself becoming hypersensitive as she approached the cellar door her breath coming in short gasps there was an obscene poster of a naked woman with her legs spread wide apart on the door which annie hoped the socos hadnt left there because they enjoyed seeing it that must have unnerved janet taylor to start with she thought advancing slowly as she imagined janet and dennis had done christ she felt apprehensive enough herself even though she knew the only people in there were socos but janet and dennis hadnt known what to expect annie told herself whatever it was they hadnt expected what they got she knew far more than they had and no doubt her imagination was working overtime on that through the door much cooler down here trying to feel the way it was despite the two soco officers and the bright lighting janet went in first dennis just behind her the cellar was smaller than she had expected it must have happened so quickly candlelight the figure leaping out of the shadows wielding a machete hacking into dennis morrisseys throat and arm because he was the closest dennis goes down janet already has her sidehandled baton out extended ready to ward off the first blow so close she can smell paynes breath perhaps he cant believe that a woman weaker and smaller than him can thwart him so easily before he can recover from his shock janet lashes out and hits him on the left temple blinded by pain and perhaps by blood he falls back against the wall next he feels a sharp pain on his wrist and he cant hold on to the machete he hears it skitter away across the floor but doesnt know where he rears up and goes at her angry now because she knows her partner is bleeding to death on the floor janet hits him again and again wanting it to be over so she can tend to dennis he scrabbles after where he thought the machete went blood dripping down his face she hits him again and again how much strength does he have left by now annie wondered surely not enough to overpower janet and how many more times does she hit him now hes down handcuffed to the pipe not moving at all annie sighed and watched the socos shifting their drill to dig into another spot are you going to start that thing up again she asked one of the men grinned want some earmuffs annie smiled back at him no id rather just get out of here before you start can you give me another minute or so can do annie glanced around at the crude stick figures and occult symbols on the walls and wondered how integral a part of paynes fantasy they were banks had also told her that the place was lit by dozens of candles but they were all gone now as was the mattress they had found the body on one of the socos was on his knees looking at something on the concrete floor over by the door what is it annie asked him found something dunno he said some sort of little scuff marks in the concrete it hardly shows at all but there seems to be some sort of pattern annie knelt to look she couldnt see anything until the soco pointed to what looked like small circles in the concrete there were three of them in all pretty much equidistant ill try a few different lighting angles he said almost to himself maybe some infrared film to highlight the contrasts could be a tripod annie said what bugger me sorry love but you could be right luke selkirk and that funny little assistant of his were down here maybe they left the marks i think theyd have been more professional dont you id better ask them hadnt i annie left him to it and walked through the far door the ground had been sectioned into grids and the soil had been dug up annie knew that three bodies had been found there she followed the narrow marked path across to the door opened it and walked up the steps into the back garden crime scene tape barred her entrance at the top of the steps but she didnt need to go any farther like the anteroom in the cellar the overgrown garden had been divided into grids and marked out with rope most of them had already been cleared of grass and weeds and topsoil but some farther back remained overgrown at the far wall a large waterproof sheet used to protect the garden from yesterdays rain lay rolled up like a carpet this was a delicate job annie knew from watching the excavation of a skeleton at the village of hobbs end it was far too easy to disturb old bones she could see the hole about three feet deep where one body had been dug up and now there were two men gathered around another hole taking off the soil with trowels and passing it to a third man who ran it through a sieve as if he were panning for gold what is it annie asked from the top of the cellar steps one of the men looked up at her she hadnt recognized stefan nowak at first she didnt know him well as he hadnt been at eastvales western divisional headquarters for long but banks had introduced them once stefan was the man acc ron mclaughlin had said who would drag north yorkshire kicking and screaming into the twentyfirst century annie had found him rather reserved a bit mysterious even as if he were carrying around a grave secret or a great weight of past pain he affected a cheery enough demeanor on the surface but she could tell it didnt run very deep he was tall over six feet and handsome in a cleancut elegant sort of way she knew his background was polish and had often wondered if he was a prince or a count or something most of the poles she had ever met said they were descended from counts or princes at one time or another and there was something regal and stately in stefans bearing its annie isnt it he said ds annie cabbot di now stefan hows it going didnt know you were on this case one of them annie explained terence payne im with complaints and discipline i cant believe the cps will even let that one see the light of day said stefan justifiable homicide surely i hope thats how theyll see it but you never know with them anyway i just wanted a look at the place im afraid weve made rather a mess said stefan it looks as if weve just found another body want a look annie ducked under the tape yes be careful said stefan follow the marked path annie did as he said and soon found herself standing beside the partially excavated grave this one was a skeleton not quite as stained and filthy as the one she had seen at hobbs end but a skeleton nonetheless she could see part of the skull one shoulder and part of the left arm how long she asked hard to say stefan answered more than a few months he introduced the two men who had been poring over the grave with him one a botanist and the other an entomologist these lads should be able to help with that and were getting dr ioan williams to come over from the university and give us a hand annie remembered the young doctor with the long hair and the prominent adams apple from the hobbs end case the way he had caressed gloria shackletons pelvic bone and leered over it at annie i know this isnt my case annie said but isnt this one body too many stefan looked up at her and shielded his eyes from the sun yes he said it is rather throws a spanner in the works doesnt it indeed it does annie walked back toward her car there was nothing more to be gained from hanging around the hill besides she realized glancing at her watch she had a postmortem to attend what the hell do you mean talking to press like that said banks didnt i warn you about it this is the first ive heard were living in a police state said maggie forrest arms folded over her chest eyes angry and tearful they stood in her kitchen banks brandishing the post and maggie in the midst of clearing away her breakfast dishes after seeing the article at millgarth he had headed straight for the hill dont give me that adolescent crap about police states who do you think you are a student protesting some distant war youve no right to talk to me like this i havent done anything wrong anything wrong have you any idea of the wasps nest you could be helping to stir up i dont know what you mean all i wanted to do was tell lucys side of the story but that woman twisted it all are you so naïve that you didnt expect that theres a difference between being naïve and caring but a cynic like you probably wouldnt understand it banks could see that maggie was shaking either with anger or fear and he was worried that he had given too free a rein to his anger he knew she had been abused by her husband that she was a bruised soul so she was probably scared stiff of this man raising his voice in her kitchen it was insensitive of him but damn it the woman irritated him he sat at the kitchen table and tried to cool things down a bit maggie he said softly im sorry but you could cause us a lot of problems maggie seemed to relax a little i dont see how public sympathy is a very fickle thing and when you mess with it its like dancing with the devil its just as likely to reach out and eat you up as anyone else but how would people find out what lucy went through at her husbands hands she wont talk about it i can guarantee you that none of us know what went on in lucys house all youre doing is jeopardizing her chance of a fair trial if trial trial for what i was going to say if it comes to that im sorry but i dont agree maggie put the electric kettle on and sat opposite banks people need to know about domestic abuse its not something that should be swept under the carpet for any reason especially not just because the police say so i agree look i understand youre prejudiced against us but prejudiced right with your help i ended up in hospital but you have to understand that in many of these matters our hands are tied were only as good as the information we have and the laws of the land allow all the more reason for me to speak out about lucy after all youre not exactly here to help her are you im here to find out the truth well thats all very highandmighty of you now whos the cynic we all know the police only want convictions that theyre not overly concerned with the truth or with justice convictions help if they keep the bad guys off the street too often they dont and justice we leave to the courts but youre wrong about the rest i cant speak for anyone else but im very much concerned with the truth ive worked day and night on this case since the beginning of april and every case i work i want to know what happened who did it and why i dont always find out but youd be surprised how much i do learn sometimes it gets me into trouble and i have to live with the knowledge take it into my life take it home with me im that snowball rolling down the hill only the pure snows run out and im picking up layer after layer of dirt and gravel just so that you can sit safe and warm at home and accuse me of being some sort of gestapo officer i didnt mean it like that and i wasnt always safe and warm do you know that what youve just done actually stands a good chance of warping the truth whatever it may be i didnt do that it was her that journalist lorraine temple banks slapped the table and immediately regretted it when maggie jumped wrong he said she was only doing her job like it or not thats what it was her jobs to sell newspapers youve got this all backward maggie you think the medias here to tell the truth and the police to lie youre confusing me now the kettle boiled and maggie got up to make tea she didnt offer banks a cup but when it was ready she poured him one automatically he thanked her all im saying maggie is that you might be doing lucy more harm than good by talking to the press look at what happened this time you say it came out all wrong and that they practically said lucy is as guilty as her husband thats hardly helping her is it but i told you she twisted my words and im saying you should have expected that it made a better story then where am i supposed to go to tell the truth or to find it christ maggie if i knew the answer to that id but before banks could finish his mobile rang this time it was the pc on duty at the infirmary lucy payne had just been cleared for release and she had a solicitor with her do you know anything about this solicitor banks asked maggie when hed finished on the phone she smiled sheepishly as a matter of fact yes i do banks said nothing not trusting himself to respond in a civilized manner leaving his tea untouched he bid maggie forrest a hurried farewell and dashed out to his car he didnt even stop to talk to annie cabbot when he saw her walking out of number but managed only a quick wave before jumping in his renault and roaring off lucy payne was sitting on the bed painting her toenails black when banks walked in she gave him a look and demurely pulled her skirt down over her thighs the bandages were gone from her head and the bruises seemed to be healing well she had rearranged her long black hair so it covered the patch the doctor had shaved for his stitches another woman stood in the room over by the window the solicitor slight in stature with chocolate brown hair cropped almost as closely as bankss and watchful serious hazel eyes she was dressed in a charcoal pinstriped jacket matching skirt and a white blouse with some sort of ruffled front she wore dark tights and shiny black pumps she walked over and held her hand out julia ford im lucys solicitor i dont believe weve met a pleasure said banks this isnt the first time youve talked to my client is it superintendent no said banks and the last time you were accompanied by a psychologist named dr fuller dr fullers our consulting psychologist on the chameleon task force said banks just be careful superintendent thats all id have very good grounds to argue that anything dr fuller might have got from my client is inadmissible as evidence we werent gathering evidence said banks lucy was questioned as a witness and as a victim not as a suspect a fine line superintendent should matters change and now banks glanced at lucy who had resumed painting her toenails seeming indifferent to the banter between her solicitor and banks i wasnt aware you thought you needed a solicitor lucy he said lucy looked up its in my best interests theyre discharging me this morning soon as the paperworks done i can go home banks looked at julia ford in exasperation i hope you havent encouraged her in this fantasy julia raised her eyebrows i dont know what youre talking about banks turned back to lucy you cant go home lucy he explained your house is being taken apart brick by brick by forensic experts have you any concept of what happened there of course i have said lucy terry hit me he knocked me out and put me in hospital but terrys dead now isnt he yes so that changes things doesnt it look said lucy ive been abused and ive just lost my husband now youre telling me ive lost my home too for the time being well what am i supposed to do where am i supposed to go how about your foster parents linda lucys look let banks know that she hadnt missed the emphasis i dont seem to have much choice do i anyway it wont be a problem for a while yet banks went on we found traces of kimberley myerss blood on the sleeves of your dressing gown along with some yellow fibers under your fingernails youve got a lot of explaining to do before you go anywhere lucy looked alarmed what do you mean julia ford narrowed her eyes and looked at banks what he means lucy is that hes going to take you in to the police station for questioning can he do that im afraid so lucy and he can keep me there under the pace regulations he can yes if hes not satisfied with the answers you give him for twentyfour hours but there are very strict guidelines youve got nothing to worry about you mean i could be in prison for a whole day in a cell dont be alarmed lucy said julia stepping over and touching her clients arm nothing bad will happen to you those days are gone now youll be well looked after but ill be in prison possibly it all depends but i havent done anything she gave banks an angry look black eyes burning like coals im the victim here why are you picking on me nobodys picking on you lucy said banks theres a lot of questions need answering and we think you can help us ill answer your questions im not refusing to cooperate you dont have to take me to the police station for that besides ive already answered them hardly theres a lot more we need to know and there are certain formalities procedures to be followed anyway its all changed now that terrys died hasnt it lucy looked away i dont know what you mean you can speak freely now you dont have to be afraid of him oh i see what did you think i meant lucy nothing that you could change your story just deny everything i told you nothing but theres the blood to explain now and the yellow fibers we know you were in the cellar we can prove it i dont know anything about that i dont remember very convenient arent you sorry terrys dead lucy lucy packed her nail polish away in her handbag of course i am but he beat me up it was him who put me here him who got me into all this trouble with the police its not my fault none of its my fault i havent done anything wrong why should i have to be the one who suffers banks shook his head and stood up maybe wed better just go lucy looked over to julia ford ill come with you said julia ill be present when youre questioned and nearby in case you need me lucy managed a weak smile but you wont stay in the cell with me julia smiled back then looked at banks im afraid they dont make doubles lucy thats right said banks like girls do you lucy there was no need for that superintendent julia ford said and ill thank you to keep any more questions you might have until were in the interview room lucy just glared at banks anyway julia ford went on turning back to lucy lets not be pessimistic it might not come to that she turned to banks might i suggest superintendent that we leave by a discreet exit you cant have failed to notice the media presence its a big story for them banks said but yes thats a good idea ive got another one too oh that we take lucy to eastvale for questioning you and i know damn well that millgarth will be a zoo once the press find out shes there this way weve got a chance of avoiding all that chaos at least for a while julia ford thought for moment then looked at lucy its a good idea she said will you come to eastvale with me im scared of course julia looked at banks im sure the superintendent here can recommend a decent hotel but how could she possibly know im seeing you maggie asked dr susan simms at the start of her session that afternoon ive no idea but you can be certain i didnt tell anyone and i told her nothing i know said maggie thank you think nothing of it dear its a matter of professional ethics this implied support of yours for lucy payne is it true maggie felt her anger bristle again as she remembered her argument with banks that morning she still felt upset by it i think lucys been a victim of abuse yes dr simms remained silent for a while gazing our of the window then she shifted in her chair and said just be careful margaret just be careful you seem to be under a lot of stress now shall we begin i believe last time we were talking about your family maggie remembered it was their fourth session and the first time theyd touched on maggies own family background which surprised her shed been expecting freudian questions about her relationship with her father right from the start even though dr simms had insisted she wasnt a freudian analyst they were sitting in a small office overlooking park square a peaceful elegant bit of eighteenthcentury leeds birds sang in the trees among the pink and white blossoms and students sat on the grass reading or simply enjoying the sun again after yesterdays rain most of the humidity seemed to have cleared away and the air was crisp and warm dr simms had her window open and maggie could smell flowers from the window box she didnt know what kind but they were flowers all right red and white and purple she could just see the top of the town hall dome over the trees and elegant facades of the houses on the opposite side of the square the place was just like a doctors office maggie thought or at least an oldstyle doctors office with a solid desk diplomas on the wall fluorescent lights filing cabinets and bookcases full of psychological journals and textbooks there was no couch maggie and dr simms sat in armchairs not facing each other but at a slight angle so that eye contact was easy but not mandatory cooperative rather than confrontational dr simms had been recommended by ruth and so far she was turning out to be a real find in her midfifties solidly built matronly even and with a severe look about her she always wore oldfashioned laura ashleystyle clothes and her bluegray hair was lacquered into whorls and waves that looked razorsharp appearances to the contrary dr simms had the kindest most compassionate manner maggie could wish for without being soft for she certainly wasnt soft sometimes she was downright prickly especially if maggie whom she always called margaret for some reason got her defenses up or started whimpering there was never any violence in the home when we were growing up my father was strict but he never used his fists or his belt to discipline us neither my sister fiona nor me so what did he do for discipline oh the usual things grounded us stopped our pocket money lectured us that sort of thing did he raise his voice no i never heard him yell at anyone did your mother have a violent temper good lord no i mean she might get mad and shout if fiona or i did something annoying like not tidying up our rooms but itd be all over and forgotten in no time dr simms put her fist under her chin and rested on it i see lets get back to bill shall we if you like no margaret its not for me to like its for you to want maggie shifted in her chair yes all right you told me in our previous session that youd seen signs of his aggressiveness before you were married can you tell me more about that yes but it wasnt directed toward me toward whom was it directed the world in general perhaps no just some people people who screwed up like waiters or delivery men did he beat them up he got mad lost his temper yelled at them called them idiots morons what i meant was that he channeled a lot of aggression into his work ah yes hes a lawyer right yes for a big firm and he wanted to make partner very badly hes competitive by nature very he was a highschool sports star and he might have ended up playing professional football if he hadnt ripped his knee apart in a championship game he still walks with a slight limp but he hates it if anyone notices it and mentions it it doesnt stop him playing with the firms softball team but i dont see what this has to do with anything dr simms leaned forward and lowered her voice margaret i want you to see to understand where your husbands anger and violence come from they didnt come from you they came from him they didnt come out of your family background in any way either they came from his only when you see that when you see that it was his problem and not yours will you start to believe that it wasnt your fault and will you find the strength and courage to go on and live your life as fully as you can rather than continue in this shadow existence you have at the moment but i already see that maggie protested i mean i know it was his aggression not mine but you dont feel it maggie felt disappointed dr simms was right dont i she said i suppose not do you know anything about poetry margaret not much no only what we did at school and one of my boyfriends at art college used to write me stuff terrible drivel really he just wanted to get in my pants dr simms laughed another surprise for it came out as a loud horsey guffaw samuel taylor coleridge wrote a poem called dejection an ode it was partly about his inability to feel anything and one of the quotes that has always stuck in my mind was when he wrote about looking at the clouds the moon and the stars and ended up saying i see not feel how beautiful they are i think that applies to you margaret and i think you know it intellectual awareness of something through reason does not guarantee emotional acceptance and you are a very intellectual person despite your obvious creative inclinations if i were a jungian which i am not i would probably classify you as the introverted thinking type now tell me more about this courtship theres not much to tell a door opened and closed out in the corridor two male voices rose and fell then only the birdsongs and the sounds of distant traffic on the headrow and park lane remained i suppose he swept me off my feet she went on it was about seven years ago and i was just a young art school graduate without a career still wet behind the ears hanging out with the artsy crowd in bars and arguing philosophy in queen street west pubs and coffeehouses thinking one day some rich patron would appear and discover my genius id had a few affairs in college slept with a few boys nothing satisfactory then along came this tall dark intelligent handsome man in an armani suit who wanted to take me to concerts and expensive restaurants it wasnt the money that wasnt it at all not even the restaurants i wasnt even eating much then it was his style his panache i suppose he dazzled me and did he prove to be the patron of the arts youd been dreaming of maggie looked down at the scuffed knees of her jeans not really bill was never very much interested in the arts oh we had all the requisite subscriptions symphony ballet opera but somehow i somehow you what i dont know perhaps im being unfair but i think maybe it was just some sort of a business thing being seen like going to a clients box at the skydome i mean hed be excited about going to the opera for example take ages getting dressed up in his tux and fuss about what he wanted me to wear then wed have drinks in the members bar beforehand rub shoulders with colleagues and clients all the local bigwigs but i just got the impression that the music itself bored him did any problems manifest themselves early on in your relationship maggie twisted her sapphire ring around her finger the freedom ring she had bought after she had thrown bills wedding and engagement rings into lake ontario well she said its easy to identify things as problems in retrospect isnt it claim that you saw it coming or should have after youve found out where things were leading they might not have seemed strange at the time might they try maggie continued twisting at her ring well i suppose the main problem was bills jealousy about what most things really he was very possessive he didnt like me talking to other men for too long at parties that sort of thing but mostly he was jealous of my friends the artists yes you see he never had much time for them he thought them all a bunch of deadbeats losers and he felt hed somehow rescued me from them she laughed and they on their part didnt want to mix with corporate lawyers in armani suits but you continued to see your friends oh yes sort of and how did bill react to this he used to make fun of them to me put them down criticize them he called them pseudointellectuals nobrainers and layabouts if we ever met any of them when we were together hed just stand there looking up at the sky shifting from foot to foot glancing at his rolex whistling i can see him now did you defend them yes for a while then there seemed no point maggie remained silent for a moment then she went on you have to remember that i was head over heels in love with bill he took me to movie premieres wed go for weekends in new york stay at the plaza take horseandbuggy rides in central park go to cocktail parties full of stockbrokers and ceos you name it there was a romantic side to it all once we even flew down to la for a movie premiere the firms entertainment lawyers had been involved with we went to the party too and sean connery was there can you believe it i actually met sean connery how did you handle all this high living i fit in well enough i was good at mixing with them businessmen lawyers entrepreneurs the movers and shakers believe it or not many of them are far more cultured than the artsy crowd thinks a lot of them sponsored corporate art collections my friends believed that everyone in a suit was dull and conservative and a philistine to boot but you cant always go by appearances i knew that i think they were being very immature about it all i think bill saw me as a positive enhancement to his career but he saw my friends as dead weights that would drag me down with them if they could maybe him too if we werent careful and i didnt feel anywhere near as uncomfortable in his world as he did in mine i began to feel id only been playing the starving artist role anyway what do you mean by that well my dads a pretty important architect and we always moved in elevated circles traveled around the continent a fair bit on commissions too when i was younger just after we emigrated from england sometimes if it was school holidays hed take me with him so i didnt come from a blue collar background or a bohemian one dad appreciates the arts but hes very conservative and we werent poor anyway as time went on i suppose i began to agree with bill he wore down my defenses like he did in a lot of other ways i mean all my friends seemed to do was drift from one social security check to the next without making any attempt to do anything because it would compromise their precious art the greatest sin in our crowd was to sell out which you did maggie stared out of the window for a moment the blossoms were falling from the trees in slow motion she suddenly felt cold and hugged herself yes she said i suppose i did as far as my friends were concerned i was lost to them id been seduced by the almighty dollar and all because of bill at one of his firms parties i met a small publisher who was looking for an illustrator for a childrens book i showed him my work and he loved it i got the job then that led to another and so on how did bill react to your success he was pleased at first thrilled proud that the publisher liked my work proud when the book was published he bought copies for all his nephews and nieces his clients kids his boss dozens of copies and he was pleased that it was because of him all this had happened as he never ceased to tell me it would never have happened if id chosen to stay with my deadbeat friends this was at first what about later maggie felt herself shrinking in the chair her voice becoming smaller that was different later after we were married and bill still hadnt made partner i think he started to resent my success he started referring to art as my little hobby and suggested i might have to give it up at any time and start having babies but you chose not to have babies no i had no choice i cant have babies maggie felt herself slipping down the rabbit hole just like alice darkness closing around her margaret margaret she could hear dr simmss voice only as if from a great distance echoing with great effort she struggled up toward it toward the light and felt herself burst out like a drowning person from the water gasping for air margaret are you all right yes im i but it wasnt me she said aware of the tears flowing down her cheeks it isnt me who cant have babies bill cant its bill its something to do with his sperm count dr simms gave maggie a little time to dry her eyes calm down and compose herself when she had done so maggie laughed at herself he used to have to masturbate into a tupperware container and take it in for testing somehow that seemed so well tupperware i mean it all seemed so leave it to beaver pardon an old american tv program mom at home pop at the office apple pie happy families perfect children i see couldnt you have adopted a child maggie was back out in the light now only it felt too bright no she said that wouldnt do for bill the child wouldnt be his then you see no more than if id had someone elses sperm in artificial insemination did the two of you discuss what to do at first yes but not after he found out it was his physical problem and not mine after that if i ever mentioned children again he hit me and around this time he came to resent your success yes even to the point of committing little acts of sabotage so id be behind on a deadline you know throwing away some of my colors or brushes misplacing an illustration or a package for the courier accidentally wiping images from the computer from my computer forgetting to tell me about an important phone call that sort of thing so at this time he wanted to have children but discovered that he couldnt father any and he also wanted to be a partner in his law firm but he didnt get to be thats right but thats no excuse for what he did to me dr simms smiled true margaret very true but its a pretty volatile combination dont you think im not making excuses but can you imagine the stress he must have been under how it might have triggered his violent feelings i couldnt see it coming at the time how could i no you couldnt no one could expect you to its as you said hindsight retrospect she leaned back in her chair crossed her legs and looked at the clock now i think thats enough for today dont you now was the time ive got a question maggie blurted out not about me dr simms raised her eyebrows and looked at her watch it wont take a minute honest it wont all right said dr simms ask away well its this friend of mine not really a friend i suppose because shes too young just a schoolgirl but she drops by you know on her way home from school yes claires her name claire toth claire was a friend of kimberley myers i know who kimberley myers was i read the newspapers go on they were friends they went to the same school both of them knew terence payne he was their biology teacher yes go on and she felt responsible you know for kimberley they were supposed to walk home together that night but a boy asked claire to dance a boy she liked and and her friend walked home alone to her death yes said maggie you said you had a question to ask me i havent seen claire since she told me this on monday afternoon im worried about her psychologically i mean what would something like this do to someone like her not knowing the girl in question i cant possibly say said dr simms it depends on her inner resources on her selfimage on family support on many things besides it seems to me that there are two separate issues here yes first the girls proximity to the criminal and to one victim in particular and second her feeling of responsibility of guilt as far as the first is concerned i can offer a few general considerations please do first of all tell me how you feel about it all me yes i i dont know yet afraid i suppose not so trusting he was my neighbor after all i dont know i havent been able to work it all out yet dr simms nodded your friend probably feels the same way mostly confused for the moment only shes younger than you and she probably has fewer defenses shell certainly be more mistrustful of people after all this man was her teacher a figure of respect and authority handsome welldressed with a nice house and a pretty young wife he didnt look at all like the sort of monster we usually associate in our minds with crimes such as these and shell experience a heightened sense of paranoia she may not feel comfortable going out alone for example may feel shes being stalked or watched or her parents might not let her go out sometimes parents take control in these situations especially if they feel theyve been guilty of any sort of neglect so her parents might be keeping her at home keeping her from visiting me its possible what else from what i can gather so far these are sex crimes and as such they are bound to have some effect on a vulnerable young schoolgirls burgeoning sexuality exactly what effect is hard to say it takes different people different ways some girls might become more childlike suppress their sexuality because they think that will afford them some kind of protection others may even become more promiscuous because being good girls didnt help the victims i cant tell you which way shell go im sure claire wouldnt become promiscuous she may become withdrawn and preoccupied with the case i think its most important that she doesnt keep these feelings bottled up that she struggles to understand what happened i know thats difficult even for us adults but we can help her how by accepting its effect on her but also reassuring her that it was some sort of aberration not the natural course of things theres little doubt the effects will be deep and longlasting but she will have to learn how to readjust to the way her worldview has altered what do you mean were always saying that teenagers feel immortal but any immortality your friend felt she had will have been stripped away by whats happened thats a hard adjustment to make that what happened to someone close to you could happen to you too and the full horror of it hasnt even come out yet what can i do probably nothing said dr simms you cant make her come to you but if she does you should encourage her to talk be a good listener but dont push her and dont try to tell her how to feel should she be seeing a psychologist probably but thats her decision or her parents could you recommend someone i mean if theyre interested dr simms wrote a name on a slip of paper shes good she said now off you go ive got my next patient waiting they arranged another appointment and maggie walked out into park square thinking about claire and kimberley and human monsters that numb sensation had come back the feeling that the world was at a distance through mirrors and filters cotton wool through the wrong end of the telescope she felt like an alien in human form she wanted to go back to where she came from but she didnt know where it was anymore she walked down to city square past the statue of the black prince and the nymphs bearing their torches then she leaned against the wall near the bus stop on boar lane and lit a cigarette the elderly woman beside her gave her a curious look why was it maggie wondered that she always felt worse after these sessions with dr simms than she did before she went the bus arrived maggie trod out her cigarette and got on the drive to eastvale went smoothly enough banks ordered an unmarked car and driver from millgarth and left through a side exit with julia ford and lucy payne they didnt run into any reporters during the journey banks sat in the front with the driver a young female dc and julia ford and lucy payne sat in the back nobody spoke a word banks was preoccupied by the discovery of another body in the paynes back garden news he had just received from stefan nowak on his mobile as they set off from the infirmary that made one body too many and by the sound of it he didnt think this one was leanne wrays either occasionally banks caught a glimpse of lucy in the rearview mirror and saw that she was mostly gazing out of the window he couldnt read her expression just to be on the safe side they entered the eastvale police station through the rear entrance banks settled lucy and julia in an interview room and went to his office where he walked over to the window and lit a cigarette and prepared himself for the coming interview he had been so preoccupied with the extra body on the journey up that he had hardly noticed it was another gorgeous day out there there were plenty of cars and coaches parked on the cobbled market square family groups milling about holding on to their childrens hands women with cardigans fastened loosely by the sleeves around their necks just in case a cool breeze sprang up clutching umbrellas against the possibility of rain why is it we english can never quite entrust ourselves to believe that fine weather will last banks wondered were always expecting the worst that was why the forecasters covered all bases sunny with cloudy periods and chance of a shower the interview room smelled of disinfectant because its last inhabitant a drunken seventeenyearold joyrider had puked up a takeaway pizza all over the floor other than that the room was clean enough though very little light filtered in through the high barred window banks inserted tapes in the machine tested them and then went through the immediate formalities of time date and those present right lucy he said when hed finished ready to begin if you like how long have you been living in leeds what banks repeated the question lucy looked puzzled by it but said four years more or less ever since i started working at the bank and you came from hull from your foster parents clive and hilary liversedge yes you know that already just getting the background clear lucy where did you live before then lucy started to fidget with her wedding ring alderthorpe she said quietly i lived at number four spurn road and your parents yes yes what yes they lived there too banks sighed dont play games with me lucy this is a serious business dont you think i know that lucy snapped you drag me out of hospital all the way up here for no reason and then you start asking about my childhood youre not a psychiatrist im just interested thats all well it wasnt very interesting yes they abused me and yes i was taken into care the liversedges were good to me but its not as if they were my real parents or anything when the time came i wanted to go out on my own in the world put my childhood behind me and make my own way is there anything wrong with that no said banks he wanted to find out more about lucys childhood especially the events that occurred when she was twelve but he knew he wasnt likely to find out much from her is that why you changed your name from linda godwin to lucy liversedge yes reporters kept bothering me the liversedges arranged it with the social services what made you choose to move to leeds thats where the job was the first one you applied for that i really wanted yes where did you live i had a flat off tong road at first when terry got the job at silverhill we bought the house on the hill the one you say i cant go back to even though its my home i suppose you expect me to keep making the mortgage payments while your men rip the place apart too you moved in together before you were married we already knew we were getting married it was such a good deal at the time that wed have been fools to turn it down when did you marry terry just last year the twentysecond of may wed been going out together since the summer before how did you meet him what does that matter im just curious surely its a harmless question in a pub which pub i cant remember what it was called it was a big one though with live music where was it seacroft was he by himself i think so why did he chat you up not in so many words i dont remember did you ever stay at his flat yes of course i did it wasnt wrong we were in love we were going to get married we were engaged even then it was love at first sight you might not believe me but it was wed only been going out two weeks when he bought me my engagement ring it cost nearly a thousand pounds did he have other girlfriends not when we met but before i suppose so i didnt make a fuss about it i assumed hes led a pretty normal life normal why not did you ever see any evidence of other women in his flat no what were you doing in seacroft when you lived off tong road its a long way wed just finished a weeks training course in town and one of the girls said it was a good place for a night out had you heard of the man the papers at the time called the seacroft rapist yes everybody had but it didnt stop you going to seacroft you have to live your life you cant let fear get the better of you or a woman wouldnt even dare go out of the house alone thats true enough said banks so you never suspected that this man you met might be the seacroft rapist terry no of course not why should i was there nothing at all in terrys behavior that gave you cause for concern no we were in love but he abused you you admitted this the last time we talked she looked away that came later how much later i dont know christmas maybe last christmas yes around then but it wasnt like that all the time afterward he was wonderful he always felt guilty hed buy me presents flowers bracelets necklaces i really wish i had them with me now to remember him by in time lucy so he always made up to you after he hit you yes he was wonderful to me for days was he drinking more these past few months yes he was out more too i didnt see him as much where was he i dont know he didnt tell me didnt you ever ask him lucy looked away demurely turning her bruised side on him banks got the message i think we can move on cant we superintendent said julia ford my clients clearly getting upset with this line of questioning pity for her banks wanted to say but he had plenty more ground to cover very well he turned to lucy again did you have anything to do with the abduction rape and murder of kimberley myers lucy met his gaze but he couldnt see anything in her dark eyes if the eyes were the windows of the soul then lucy paynes were made of tinted glass and her soul wore sunglasses no i didnt she said what about melissa horrocks no i had nothing to do with any of them how many were there lucy you know how many tell me five thats what i read in the papers anyway what did you do with leanne wray i dont understand where is she lucy wheres leanne wray where did you and terry bury her what made her different from the others lucy looked in consternation at julia ford i dont know what hes talking about she said ask him to stop superintendent julia said my client has already made it clear she knows nothing about this person i think you should move on did your husband ever mention any of these girls no terry never mentioned any of them did you ever go in that cellar lucy youve asked me all this before im giving you a chance to change your answer to go on record i told you i dont remember i might have done but i dont remember ive got retrograde amnesia who told you that my doctor at the hospital dr landsberg yes its part of my posttraumatic shock disorder it was the first banks had heard of it dr landsberg had told him she was no expert on the subject well im very glad you can put a name to whats wrong with you on how many occasions might you have gone down in the cellar if you could remember just the once when the day it happened when i got put in hospital early last monday morning so you admit that you may have gone down there if you say so i cant remember if i ever did go down it was then its not me who says so lucy its the scientific evidence the lab found traces of kimberley myerss blood on the sleeves of your dressing gown how did it get there i i dont know theres only two ways it could have got there either before she was in the cellar or after she was in the cellar which is it lucy it must be after why because i never saw her before but she didnt live far away hadnt you seen her around in the street maybe or the shops yes but i never talked to her banks paused and shuffled some papers in front of him so you admit now that you might have been in the cellar but i dont remember what do you think might have happened hypothetically speaking well i might have heard a noise what sort of noise i dont know lucy paused and put her hand to her throat a scream maybe the only screams maggie forrest heard were yours well maybe you could only hear it if you were inside the house maybe it came up from the cellar when maggie heard me i was in the hall you remember that being in the hall only very vaguely go on so i might have heard a noise and gone down to investigate even though you knew it was terrys private den and hed kill you if you did yes maybe i was disturbed enough by what by what i heard but the cellar was very well soundproofed lucy and the door was closed when the police got there then i dont know im just trying to find a reason go on what might you have found there if you did go down that girl i might have gone over to her to see if there was anything i could do what about the yellow fibers what about them they were from the plastic clothesline that was wrapped around kimberley myerss neck the pathologist determined ligature strangulation by that line as cause of death fibers were also embedded in kimberleys throat i must have tried to get it off her do you remember doing this no im still imagining how it might have happened go on then terry must have found me and chased me upstairs and then hit me why didnt he drag you back down the cellar and kill you too i dont know he was my husband he loved me he couldnt just kill me like like some teenage girl superintendent julia ford cut in i dont think speculation about what mr payne did or didnt do is relevant here my client says she might have gone down in the cellar and surprised her husband at at whatever he was doing and thus provoked him that should explain your findings it should also be enough but you said terry would kill you if you went in the cellar why didnt he banks persisted i dont know maybe he was going to maybe he had something else to do first like what i dont know kill kimberley maybe but wasnt she already dead i dont know get rid of her body maybe i dont know i was unconscious oh come on lucy this is rubbish said banks the next thing youll be trying to convince me is you did it while you were sleepwalking you killed kimberley myers didnt you lucy you went down in the cellar and saw her lying there and you strangled her i didnt why would i do a thing like that because you were jealous terry wanted kimberley more than he wanted you he wanted to keep her lucy banged the table with her fist thats not true youre making it up well why else did he have her staked out there naked on the mattress to give her a biology lesson it was quite a biology lesson lucy he raped her repeatedly both vaginally and anally he forced her to fellate him then he or someone strangled her with a length of yellow plastic fiber clothesline lucy put her head in her hands and sobbed is this kind of gruesome detail really necessary asked julia ford whats wrong banks asked her afraid of the truth its just a bit overthetop thats all overthetop ill tell you whats over the bloody top banks pointed at lucy kimberleys blood on the sleeves of her dressing gown yellow fibers under her fingernails she killed kimberley myers its all circumstantial said julia ford lucys already explained to you how it might have happened she doesnt remember thats not her fault the poor woman was traumatized either that or shes a damn good actress said banks superintendent banks turned back to lucy who are the other girls lucy i dont know what youre talking about weve found two unidentified bodies in the back garden skeletal remains at any rate that makes six altogether including kimberley we were only looking into five disappearances and we havent even found all of those yet we dont know these two who are they ive no idea did you ever go out in the car with your husband and pick up a teenage girl the change of direction seemed to shock lucy into silence but she soon found her voice and regained her composure no i did not so you knew nothing about the missing girls no only what i read in the papers i told you i didnt go in the cellar and terry certainly didnt tell me so how could i know how indeed banks scratched the little scar beside his right eye im more concerned with how you could possibly not have known the man youre living with your own husband abducts and brings home six young girls that we know of so far keeps them in the cellar for god knows how long while he rapes and tortures them then he buries them either in the garden or in the cellar and all this time youre living in the house only one floor away two at the most and you expect me to believe you didnt know anything didnt even smell anything do i look as if was born yesterday lucy i dont see how you could fail to know i told you i never went down there didnt you notice when your husband was missing in the middle of the night no i always sleep very heavily i think terry must have been giving me sleeping pills with my cocoa thats why i never noticed anything we didnt find any sleeping pills at the house lucy he must have run out that must be why i woke up on monday morning and thought something was wrong or he forgot did either of you have a prescription for sleeping tablets i didnt i dont know if terry did maybe he got them from a drug pusher banks made a note to look into the matter of sleeping tablets why do you think he might have forgotten to drug you this time why did you go down to the cellar this time he went on what was so different about this time about kimberley was it because she was too close to home for comfort terry must have known he was taking a huge risk in abducting kimberley mustnt he was he obsessed with her lucy was that it were the others merely practice substitutes until he could no longer stop himself from taking the one he really wanted how did you feel about that lucy that terry wanted kimberley more than you more than life itself more than freedom lucy put her hands to her ears stop it its lies all lies i dont know what you mean i dont understand whats going on why are you persecuting me like this she turned to julia ford get me out of here now please i dont have to stay and listen to any more of this do i no said julia ford standing up you can leave whenever you like i dont think so banks stood up and took a deep breath lucy payne im arresting you as an accessory in the murder of kimberley myers this is ludicrous shot julia ford its a travesty i dont believe your clients story said banks he turned to lucy again you dont have to say anything lucy but if you fail to say something now that you later rely on in court it might be held against you do you understand banks opened the door and got two uniformed officers to take her down to the custody officer when they came toward her she turned pale please she said ill come back whenever you want please im begging you dont lock me all alone in a dark cell for the first time in his dealings with her banks got the sense that lucy payne was genuinely afraid he remembered what jenny had told him about the alderthorpe seven kept in cages without food for days he almost faltered but there was no going back now he forced himself to remember kimberley myers spreadeagled on the bed in lucy paynes dark cellar nobody had given her a chance the cells arent dark lucy he said theyre welllit and very comfortable they regularly get four stars in the police accommodation guide julia ford gave him a disgusted look lucy shook her head banks nodded toward the guards take her down hed managed it by the skin of his teeth and he didnt even feel as good about it as he had thought he would but hed got lucy payne where he wanted her for twentyfour hours twentyfour hours to find some real evidence against her annie felt only indifference toward terence paynes corpse laid out naked on the steel autopsy table it was simply the shell the deceptive outer human form of an aberration a changeling a demon come to think about it though she wasnt even certain she believed that terence paynes evil was all too human over the centuries men had raped and mutilated women whether as acts of plunder in wartime for dark pleasures in the back alleys and cheap rooms of decaying cities in the isolation of the countryside or in the drawing rooms of the rich it hardly needed a demon in human form to do what men themselves already did so well she turned her attention to events at hand dr mackenzies close examination of the exterior of terence paynes skull identity and time of death had not been a problem in this case payne had been pronounced dead by dr mogabe at leeds general infirmary at pm the previous evening naturally dr mackenzie would do a thorough job his assistant had already carried out the weighing and measuring and photographs and x rays had been taken indeed annie guessed mackenzie to be the kind of doctor who would do a thorough postmortem on a man shot dead right in front of his very eyes it didnt do to make assumptions the body was clean and ready for cutting as theres no man cleaner than one who has just been through surgery luckily the police surgeon had been dispatched to take fingernail scrapings bloodstained clothing and blood samples when payne had first arrived at the infirmary so no evidence had been lost due to the scruples of hospital hygiene at the moment annie was interested only in the blows to paynes head and dr mackenzie was paying particular attention to the cranium before performing the full postmortem they had already examined the fractured wrist and determined that it was broken by a blow from pc janet taylors baton which lay on the lab bench by the whitetiled wall and there were also several defense bruises on paynes arms where he had tried to ward off pc taylors blows unless payne had been murdered by a nurse or doctor while he was in hospital pc janet taylors actions were most likely directly responsible for his death what had yet to be determined was just how culpable she was an emergency operation to relieve a subdural hematoma had complicated matters dr mackenzie had told annie but it should be easy enough to separate the surgical procedure from the unskilled bludgeoning paynes head had already been shaved before his surgery which made the injuries easier to identify after a close examination mackenzie turned to annie and said im not going to be able to tell you the exact sequence of blows but there are some interesting clusters clusters yes come here look dr mackenzie pointed toward paynes left temple which looked to annie with its shaved hair and bloody rawness rather like a dead rat in a trap there are at least three distinct wounds overlapping here dr mackenzie went on tracing the outlines as he went from the first one this indentation here followed by a later wound superimposed and a third here which overlaps parts of both could they have been delivered in quick succession annie asked remembering what janet taylor had told her about the flurry of blows and the way she had imagined it all herself when she visited the scene its possible dr mackenzie admitted but id say any one of these blows would have incapacitated him for a while and perhaps changed his position in relation to his attacker can you explain dr mackenzie brought his hand around gently to the side of annies head and pushed she went with the light pressure and stepped back head turned when he reached out again his hand was closer to the back of her head had that been a real blow he said you would have been turned even farther away from me and the blow would have stunned you it might have taken you a little time to get back to the same position i see what you mean annie said so that would lead you to believe that perhaps other blows came between mmm theres the angles to consider too if you look very closely at the indentations youll see that the first blow came when the victim was standing he glanced toward the baton see the wound is relatively smooth and even allowing for the differences in height between pc taylor and the victim ive measured the baton by the way and matched it closely to each wound and that along with the x rays gives me a better idea of the victims position at the time of each blow he pointed again at least one of those blows to the temple was delivered when the victim was on his knees you can see the way the impression deepens its even clearer on the x ray dr mackenzie led annie over to the x ray viewer on the wall slipped in a sheet of film and turned on the light he was right when he pointed to it annie could see how the wound was deeper toward the back indicating that the baton had come down at an angle they went back to the table could he have got up again after a blow like that annie asked its possible theres no telling with head wounds people have been known to walk around for days with a bullet in their brains the main problem would be the rate of blood loss head wounds bleed an awful lot thats why we usually leave the brain until last in a postmortem most of the blood has drained off by then less messy what are you going to do with paynes brain annie asked keep it for scientific study dr mackenzie snorted id as soon read his character by the bumps on his head he said and speaking of which he asked his assistants to turn the body over annie saw another raw pulpy area at the back of paynes head she thought she could see splinters of bone sticking out but realized she must be imagining things payne had been treated in hospital and they wouldnt leave bone splinters sticking out of the back of his head there was also some evidence of surgical stitching which probably gave the impression of splinters she only shivered because it was cold in the room she told herself these wounds were almost certainly inflicted when the victim was at an inferior level say on his hands and knees and they were delivered from behind as if he were moving away from his attacker on all fours looking for something i wouldnt know about that said mackenzie but its possible its just that at one point she says she hit him on the wrist and he dropped his machete which she kicked into a corner apparently he went scrabbling after it on his hands and knees and she hit him again that would concur with this kind of injury dr mackenzie conceded though i count three blows to the same general area the brain stem by the way by far the most dangerous and vulnerable to attack she hit him there three times yes would he have been able to get up after that again i cant say a weaker man might well have been dead by then mr payne survived for three days perhaps he found his machete and got up again so that is a possible scenario i cant rule it out but look at these dr mackenzie directed annies attention toward the deep depressions at the top of the skull these two wounds i can say with some certainty were administered when the victim was in an inferior position to the attacker perhaps sitting or squatting given the angle and they were administered with tremendous power what sort of power mackenzie stood back raised both his arms high in the air behind his head and clasped his hands then he brought them down as if wielding an imaginary hammer with all his might on to the head of an imaginary victim like that he said and there was no resistance annie swallowed damn this was turning into a real bugger of a case elizabeth bell the social worker in charge of the alderthorpe seven investigation hadnt retired but she had changed jobs and relocated to york which made it easy for jenny to drop in on her after a quick stop by her office at the university she found a narrow parking spot several doors away from the terrace house off fulford road not far from the river and managed to squeeze her car in without doing any damage elizabeth answered the door as quickly as if she had been standing right behind it though jenny had been vague on the phone about her time of arrival it hadnt mattered elizabeth said as friday was her day off this week the kids were at school and she had ironing to catch up with you must be dr fuller elizabeth said thats me but call me jenny elizabeth led jenny inside i still dont know what you want to see me about but do come on in she led jenny into a small living room made even smaller by the ironing board and basket of laundry balanced on a chair jenny could smell the lemon detergent and fabric softener along with that warm and comforting smell of freshly ironed clothes the television was on showing an old blackandwhite thriller starring jack warner elizabeth cleared a pile of folded clothes from the armchair and bade jenny sit excuse the mess she said its such a tiny house but theyre so expensive around here and we do so love the location why did you move from hull wed been looking to move for a while then roger thats my husband got a promotion hes a civil servant well hardly all that civil if you catch my drift what about you job i mean still the social only now i work down the benefits office do you mind if i carry on ironing while we talk only ive got to get it all done no not at all jenny looked at elizabeth she was a tall bigboned woman wearing jeans and a plaid buttondown shirt the knees of her jeans were stained jenny noticed as if she had been gardening under her short nononsense haircut her face was hard and prematurely lined but not without kindness which showed in her eyes and in the expressions that suddenly softened the hardness as she spoke how many children do you have jenny asked only two william and pauline she nodded toward a photograph of two children that stood on the mantelpiece smiling in a playground anyway im intrigued why are you here you didnt tell me very much over the telephone im sorry i wasnt meaning to be mysterious honestly im here about the alderthorpe seven i understand you were involved how could i forget why do you want to know it was all over ten years ago nothings ever all over in my line of work said jenny she had debated how much to tell elizabeth and had even spoken with banks on the phone about this useful as ever he had said as much as you have to and as little as you need to jenny had already asked mr and mrs liversedge not to reveal lucys true origins or name to reporters but it wouldnt be long before some bright spark came across a slip of paper or recognized a photo from the newspapers morgue she knew that she and banks had a very narrow window of opportunity in which to operate before trainloads of media people got off at york and hull and even found their way to sleepy little alderthorpe she took a risk that elizabeth bell wasnt likely to tip them off either can you keep a secret she asked elizabeth looked up from the shirt she was ironing if i have to i have done before the person im interested in is lucy payne lucy payne yes that name is familiar but im afraid youll have to jog my memory its been in the news a lot recently she was married to terence payne the schoolteacher the police believe was responsible for the murder of six young girls of course yes i did see a mention in the paper but i must admit that i dont follow such things understandable anyway lucys parents clive and hilary liversedge turn out to be foster parents lucy was one of the alderthorpe seven youd probably remember her as linda godwin good heavens elizabeth paused holding the iron in midair as if traveling back in her memory little linda godwin the poor wee thing perhaps now you can see why i asked you about keeping secrets the press would have a field day indeed they would probably will eventually they wont find out anything from me a worthwhile risk then good said jenny i think id better sit down elizabeth propped the iron on its end and sat opposite jenny what do you want to know whatever you can tell me how did it all begin for a start it was a local schoolteacher who tipped us off said elizabeth maureen nesbitt shed been suspicious about the state of some of the children for some time and some of the things they said when they thought no one could overhear them then when young kathleen didnt show up for school for a week and nobody had a reasonable explanation that would be kathleen murray you know about her i just did a bit of background research among old newspapers at the library i know that kathleen murray was the one who died was murdered should have been the alderthorpe six as one of them was already dead by the time the whole thing blew up where did kathleen fit in there were two families involved oliver and geraldine murray and michael and pamela godwin the murrays had four children ranging from keith age eleven to susan age eight the two in the middle were dianne and kathleen age ten and nine respectively the godwins had three children linda at twelve was the eldest then came tom who was ten and laura nine good lord it sounds complicated elizabeth grinned it gets worse oliver murray and pamela godwin were brother and sister and nobody was quite sure exactly who fathered whom extendedfamily abuse its not as uncommon as it should be especially in small isolated communities the families lived next door to one another in two semis in alderthorpe just far enough away from the other houses in the village to be guaranteed their privacy its a remote enough part of the world to begin with have you ever been there not yet you should just to get the feel of the place its creepy i intend to were they true then the allegations the police would be able to tell you more about that i was mostly responsible for separating the children and making sure they were cared for getting them examined and for fostering them too of course all of them i didnt do it all on my own but i was in overall charge yes did any of them ever go back to their parents no oliver and geraldine murray were charged with kathleens murder and are still in jail as far as i know michael godwin committed suicide two days before the trial and his wife was declared unfit to stand trial i believe shes still in care a mental institution i mean theres no doubt about who did what then as i said the police would know more about that than me but if ever ive come facetoface with evil in my life it was there that morning what happened nothing happened it was just i dont know the aura around the place did you go inside no the police wouldnt let us they said wed only contaminate the scene we had a van a heated van and they brought the children out to us what about the satanic angle i understand it didnt come up in court wasnt necessary the lawyers said would only confuse things was there any evidence oh yes but if you ask me it was nothing but a load of mumbo jumbo to justify drinking drugtaking and abusing the children the police found cocaine and marijuana in both houses you know along with some lsd ketamine and ecstasy is that case why you gave up social work elizabeth paused before answering partly yes it was the straw that broke the camels back if you like but i was already close to burning out long before that it takes it out of you it does dealing with illtreated kids all the time you lose sight of the humanity the dignity of life do you know what i mean i think so said jenny spending too much time with criminals has a similar effect but these were children they had no choice i see what you mean you meet some proper losers down at the benefits office believe me but its not like child care what state was lucy in same as the rest dirty hungry bruised sexually abused elizabeth nodded what was she like linda or i suppose id better start calling her lucy from now on hadnt i she was a sweet little thing shy and scared standing there with a blanket around her and that look on her face like a grubby little angel she hardly said a word could she speak oh yes one of the children susan i think lost the use of her voice but not lucy shed been abused in just about every way imaginable yet she was surprisingly resilient shed speak if she wanted to but i never once saw her cry in fact she seemed to have assumed the role of caregiver to the younger ones though she wasnt in a position to offer much in the way of care she was the eldest at least so maybe she could offer them some comfort youd know more about this than i do but i guessed she was repressing the full horror of what shed been through holding it back i often wondered what would become of her i never suspected anything like this the problem is elizabeth call me liz please everyone does okay liz the problem is that we just dont know what lucys role in all this is she claims amnesia and she was certainly abused by her husband were trying to find out whether she knew anything about his other activities or to what degree she might have been involved you cant be serious lucy involved in something like that surely her own experiences i know it sounds crazy liz but the abused often become the abusers its all they know power pain withholding tormenting its a familiar cycle studies have shown that abused children as young as eight or ten have gone on to abuse their younger siblings or neighbors but not lucy surely we dont know thats why im asking questions trying to fit the psychology together build a profile of her is there anything more you can tell me well as i said she was quiet resilient and the other children the younger ones seemed to defer to her were they afraid of her i cant say i got that impression but they took notice of her yes she was definitely the boss what else can you tell me about lucys personality then let me think not much really she was a very private person shed only let you see what she wanted you to see you have to realize that these children were probably as much if not more shaken up by the raid by being taken from their parents so abruptly that was all they knew after all it might have been hell but it was a familiar hell lucy always seemed gentle but like most children she could be cruel on occasion oh i dont mean torturing animals or that sort of thing said elizabeth i assume that is the sort of thing youre looking for isnt it such early patterns of behavior can be a useful guide but ive always thought they were overrated myself to be honest i once pulled the wings off a fly myself no i just want to know about her how could she be cruel for example when we were arranging for foster parents for example you realize it was impossible to keep the siblings together so they had to be split up it was more important at the time that each child have a stable possibly longterm caring environment anyway i remember laura in particular lucys younger sister was upset but all lucy said was shed just have to get used to it the poor girl just wouldnt stop crying where did she end up laura with a family in hull i believe its a long time ago so forgive me if i dont remember all the details of course can you tell me what happened to any of the other children at all im afraid i left there shortly after so i never got to keep track of them i often wish i had but is there anything more you can tell me elizabeth stood up and went back to her ironing not that i can think of jenny stood up took her card from her purse and handed it over if you think of anything at all elizabeth peered at the card and set it on the edge of the ironing board yes of course im only too glad to have been of help but she didnt look it jenny thought as she maneuvered her car out of the tiny parking spot elizabeth bell had looked like a woman forced to confront memories she would sooner forget and jenny didnt blame her she didnt know if shed learned anything much of value except confirmation that satanic paraphernalia had been found in the cellar banks would certainly be interested in that tomorrow she would go all the way to alderthorpe and see if she could find anyone who knew the families before the investigation and as elizabeth had suggested to get the feel of the place banks hadnt had a break all day had even missed his lunch interviewing lucy payne so with no real plan in mind around three oclock that afternoon he found himself wandering down an alley off north market street toward the old ship inn heavy with the recent news that the second body discovered in the back garden of the hill was definitely not leanne wrays lucy payne was being held in a cell in the basement of police headquarters and julia ford had booked herself in at the burgundy eastvales best most expensive hotel the task force and forensics people were working as fast and as hard as they could and jenny fuller was probing lucys past all looking for that one little chink in her armor that one little piece of hard evidence that she was more involved with the killings than she let on banks knew that if they unearthed nothing more by noon tomorrow hed have to let her go he had one more visit to make today to talk to george woodward the detective inspector who had done most of the legwork on the alderthorpe investigation now retired and running a b ampb in withernsea banks glanced at his watch it would take him about two hours plenty of time to head out there after a drink and a bite to eat and still get back before too late the old ship was a shabby undistinguished victorian watering hole with a few benches scattered in the cobbled alley out front not much light got in as the buildings all around were dark and high its claim to fame was that it was wellhidden and known to be tolerant of underage drinkers many an eastvale lad so banks had heard had sipped his first pint at the old ship well before his eighteenth birthday the sign showed an old clipper ship and the windows were of smoked etched glass it wasnt very busy at that time of day between the lunchhour and the afterwork crowd indeed the old ship wasnt busy very often at all as few tourists liked the look of it and most locals knew better places to drink the interior was dim and the air stale and acrid with more than a hundred years accumulated smoke and beer spills which made it all the more surprising that the barmaid was a pretty young girl with short dyed red hair and an oval face a smooth complexion a bright smile and a cheerful disposition banks leaned against the bar i dont suppose theres any chance of a cheeseandonion sandwich is there sorry she said we dont serve food after two packet of chips sorry crisps okay better than nothing said banks what flavor plain will do fine and a pint of bitter shandy too please as she was pouring the drink and banks was dipping into a packet of rather soggy potato crisps she kept glancing at him out of the corner of her eye and finally said arent you the policeman who was here about that girl who disappeared a month or so ago leanne wray said banks yes i thought so i saw you here you werent the policeman i talked to but you were here have you found her yet its shannon isnt it she smiled you remember my name and you never even talked to me im impressed shannon banks remembered from the statement taken by dc winsome jackman was an american student taking a year off from her studies she had already traveled around most of europe and through relatives and banks suspected a boyfriend she had ended up spending a few months in yorkshire which she seemed to like banks guessed that she was working at the old ship perhaps because the manager wasnt concerned about visas and permits and paid cash in hand probably not much of it either banks lit a cigarette and looked around a couple of old men sat smoking pipes by the window not speaking not even looking at one another they seemed as if they might have been there since the place first opened in the nineteenth century the floor was worn stone and the tables scored and wobbly a watercolor of a huge sailing ship hung crookedly on one wall and on the opposite one a series of framed charcoal sketches of seagoing scenes quite good to bankss untrained eye i wasnt trying to be nosy shannon said i was only asking because i havent seen you since and ive been reading about those girls in leeds she gave a little shudder its horrible i remember being in milwaukee thats where im from milwaukee wisconsin when all the jeffrey dahmer stuff was going on i was only a kid but i knew what it was all about and we were all scared and confused i dont know how people can do things like that do you banks looked at her saw the innocence the hope and the faith that her life would turn out to be worth living and that the world wasnt an entirely evil place no matter what bad things happened in it no he said i dont so you havent found her then leanne no its not that i knew her or anything i only saw her once but you know when something like that happens like you think you might be the last person to have seen someone well she rested her hand on her chest it sort of sticks with you if you know what i mean i cant get the picture out of my mind her sitting over there by the fireplace banks thought of claire toth whipping herself over kimberley myerss murder and he knew that anyone remotely connected with what payne had done felt tainted by it i know what you mean he said one of the old men came up to the bar and plunked his halfpint glass down shannon filled it for him he paid and went back to his chair she wrinkled her nose theyre in here every day you can set your watch by them if one of them didnt turn up id have to call an ambulance when you say you cant get leannes image out of your mind does that mean youve given any more thought to that evening not really said shannon i mean i thought you know that shed been taken like the others thats what everyone thought im starting to believe that might not be the case said banks putting his fear into words for the first time in fact im beginning to think we might have been barking up the wrong tree on that one i dont understand anyway banks went on i just thought id drop by see if you remembered anything you forgot to mention before that sort of thing its been a while and that he knew meant that any trail leanne may had left would have gone cold if they had screwed up in assuming too quickly that leanne wray had been abducted by the same person or persons as kelly matthews and samantha foster then any clues as to what had really happened could well have vanished forever by now i dont know how i can help said shannon tell me said banks you say they were sitting over there right he pointed to the table by the empty tiled fireplace yes four of them at that table did they drink much no i told the policewoman before they only had a drink or two each i didnt think she was old enough but the landlord tells us not to bother too much unless its really obvious she put her hand over her mouth shoot i probably shouldnt have said that should i dont worry about it we know all about mr parkinsons practices and dont worry about what you told us before shannon i know i could go and look it all up in the files if i wanted but i want you to start again as if it had never happened before it was hard to explain to a civilian but banks needed the feel of investigating leannes disappearance as if it were a fresh crime he didnt want to start by poring over old files in his office though it would no doubt come to that if something didnt turn up soon he wanted to start by revisiting the place where she had last been seen did leanne seem intoxicated at all he asked she was a bit giggly a bit loud as if maybe she wasnt used to the drink what was she drinking i cant remember not beer maybe wine or it could have been pernod something like that did you get the impression that the four of them had paired off anything along those lines shannon thought for a moment no two of them were clearly a couple you could tell by the way they were touching one another casually i mean its not as if they were necking or anything but the other two leanne and mick blair said banks i dont know their names anyway i got the impression he might have been a bit keen and she was flirting a bit maybe because of the drinks was he bothering her at all oh no nothing like that or id have a made a point of saying so before no just the way i caught him looking at her once or twice they seemed comfortable enough together but as i say i just thought maybe he fancied her and she was playing him along a bit thats all you didnt mention this before it didnt seem important besides nobody asked me back then everyone was more concerned that shed been abducted by a serial killer true enough banks thought with a sigh leannes parents had been adamant that she was a good girl and would never under any normal circumstances break a curfew so certain were they that she must have been attacked or abducted that their certainty influenced the investigation and the police broke one of their cardinal rules dont make assumptions until youve checked out every possible angle people were also making noises about kelly matthews and samantha foster at the time so leannes disappearance another nice welladjusted teenager became linked with theirs and there was of course the matter of the abandoned shoulder bag in it were leannes inhaler which she needed in case of an asthma attack and her purse which contained twentyfive pounds and a handful of change it made no sense that she would throw away her money if she was running away from home surely she would need all she could get dc winsome jackman had questioned shannon and perhaps she should have asked more probing questions but banks couldnt blame winsome for the omissions she had discovered what mattered at the time that the group had been wellbehaved that they had caused no problems that there had been no arguments that they werent drunk and that there had been no unwelcome attention from strangers what was their general mood banks asked did they seem quiet rambunctious or what i dont remember anything unusual about them they werent causing any trouble or im sure id have said usually you get that with people who know theyre drinking underage they know theyre under sufferance if you know what i mean so they tend not to draw attention to themselves banks remembered the feeling well at sixteen he had sat proud and terrified with his mate steve in a poky little pub a mile or so from the estate where they both lived drinking their first pints of bitter in a corner by the jukebox smoking park drive tipped they had felt like real grownups but banks also remembered being worried in case the police came around or someone who knew them came in one of his fathers friends for example so they tried to fade into the woodwork as much as possible he sipped his shandy and crumpled up the crisp packet shannon took it from him and put it in the waste bin behind the bar i do remember that they seemed excited about something just before they left though shannon added i mean they were too far away for me to hear anything and they werent really noisy about it but i could tell someone had come up with a good idea for something to do banks hadnt heard about this before youve no idea what it was no it was just like they were going yeah lets do that then a couple of minutes later they left what time was this must have been about a quarter to eleven and they were all excited about this idea including leanne i couldnt honestly separate out the reactions for you shannon said with a frown it was just a general sort of thing as if someone had an idea for something to do and they all thought it would be fun this great idea did you get the impression it was something they were going to do right then after they left here i dont know perhaps why banks finished his drink because leanne wray had an elevenoclock curfew he said and according to her parents she never stayed out past her curfew if she was planning on going off anywhere with them after theyd been here shed have missed it theres something else too what if they were all planning to do something it means her friends all lied shannon thought for a moment i see what you mean but there was no reason to think she wasnt going home she might have i mean it could have been just the three of them planning something look im really sorry i mean i never thought you know last time i tried to remember everything that was important its okay said banks smiling not your fault he looked at his watch time to head out for withernsea must dash oh im leaving at the end of next week said shannon i mean my last nights a week next wednesday you know if youd like to stop by for a drink say goodbye banks didnt know how to take the invitation was it a comeon surely not shannon couldnt have been a day over twentyone still it was nice to think there was even the remotest chance that a younger girl fancied him thanks he said im not sure ill be able to make it so in case i dont ill say bon voyage now shannon gave a little whatever sort of shrug and banks walked out into the dismal alley it was only midafternoon but annie would have sworn that janet taylor was drunk not totally fallingdown pissed but emitting a slight buzz fuzzy around the edges shed had a bit of experience with drunks at the artists commune where she had grown up with her father ray there had once briefly been an alcoholic writer she remembered a big smelly man with rheumy eyes and a thick matted beard he hid bottles all over the place her father told her to stay away from him and once when the man whose name she couldnt remember started talking to her her father got angry and made him leave the room it was one of the few times she had ever seen ray really angry he liked a drop or two of wine now and then and no doubt he still smoked a bit of pot but he wasnt a drunk or a drug addict most of the time he was consumed by his work whatever painting it happened to be at the time to the exclusion of pretty much everything including annie janets flat was a mess with clothes strewn everywhere and halffull cups of tea on the windowsill and mantelpiece it also smelled like a drunks room that peculiar mix of stale skin and the sweetandsour smell of booze gin in janets case janet slumped on to a wrinkled tshirt and a pair of jeans on the armchair leaving annie to fend for herself she cleared some newspapers off a hardbacked chair and sat so what is it now janet asked you come to arrest me not yet what then more questions youve heard terence payne died ive heard how are you doing janet how am i doing ha thats a good one well let me see she started counting off on her fingers as she spoke apart from not being able to sleep apart from pacing the flat and feeling claustrophobic whenever it gets dark apart from reliving the moment over and over again whenever i close my eyes apart from the fact that my careers pretty much fucked let me see i feel just fine annie took a deep breath she certainly wasnt there to make janet feel any better though in a way she wished she could you know you really should seek some sort of counseling janet the federation will no no im not seeing any shrinks ill not have them messing with my head not with all this shit going on when theyve done with me ill not know whether im coming or going imagine how that would look in court annie held her hands up okay okay its your choice she took some papers from her briefcase ive attended terence paynes postmortem and theres a couple of things id like to go over on your statement are you saying i was lying no not at all janet ran her hand through her lifeless greasy hair because im not a liar i might have been a bit confused about the sequence of events it all happened so fast but i told it as i remember it okay janet thats fine look in your statement you say you hit payne three times on the left temple and once on his wrist and that one of the blows to the temple was delivered twohanded did i yes is that correct i couldnt remember exactly how many times or where i hit him but that seemed about right yes why according to dr mackenzies postmortem you hit payne nine times three on the temple one to the wrist one on the cheek two to the base of the skull while he was crouching or kneeling and two to the top of his head while he was squatting or sitting janet said nothing and a jet from the airport streamed into the silence filling it with the roar of engines and the promise of distant exotic places anywhere but here annie was thinking and she guessed that janet probably felt the same janet what i wasnt aware youd asked me a question how do you respond to what i just said i dont know i told you i wasnt counting i was just trying to save my life are you sure you werent acting out of revenge for dennis what do you mean the number of blows the position of the victim the violence of the blows janet turned red victim is that what you call the bastard victim when dennis was lying there on the floor with his lifeblood pumping away you call terence payne a victim how dare you im sorry janet but thats the way a case would be presented in court and youd better get used to the idea janet said nothing why did you say what you did to the ambulance attendant what did i say is he dead did i kill the bastard what did you mean by that i dont know i dont even remember saying it it could be construed as meaning you set out to kill him do you see i suppose it could be twisted that way yes did you janet did you intend to kill terence payne no i told you i was just trying to save my life why cant you believe me what about the blows to the back of his head when might those have occurred in the sequence of events i dont know try harder you can do better than that maybe when he was bent over reaching for his machete okay but you dont remember delivering them no but i suppose i must have done if you say so what about those two blows to the top of his head dr mackenzie tells me they were delivered with a lot of force they werent just random hits janet shook her head i dont know i dont know annie leaned forward and held janets chin between thumb and forefinger looking into her blurry scared eyes listen to me janet terence payne was taller than you by the angle and force of those blows the only way they could have been delivered was if he was sitting and the attacker had plenty of time to take a huge uninterrupted downward swing and well you get the picture come on janet talk to me believe it or not im trying to help you janet twisted her chin from annies grip and looked away what do you want me to say id only get myself deeper in trouble not true youll get nowhere if youre perceived as lying or covering up your actions thatll only lead to perjury the truths your best defense do you think theres a person on that jury if thats what it comes to who wont sympathize with your predicament even if you did admit to losing it for a few moments give yourself a break here janet what do you want me to say tell the truth was that how it happened was he down and you just lost your temper gave him one for dennis and crack theres another is that how it happened janet jumped up and began pacing wringing her hands so what if i did give him one or two for dennis it was nothing less than he deserved thats what you did you remember now janet stopped and narrowed her eyes then she poured herself two fingers of gin and knocked it back not clearly no but if youre telling me thats how it happened i can hardly deny it can i not in the face of the pathologists evidence pathologists can be wrong annie said though not she thought about the number strength and angle of the blows but who will they believe in court ive told you if it comes to that youll get a lot of sympathy but it might not come to court janet sat down again perched at the edge of the armchair what do you mean its up to the cps ill be meeting with them on monday in the meantime if you want to alter your statement at all before then nows the time to do it its no good said janet holding her head in her hands and weeping i dont remember it clearly it all seemed to happen so fast it was over before i knew what was happening and dennis dennis was dead bleeding on my lap that went on forever me telling him to hang on trying to stanch the blood she looked at her hands as if seeing the same thing lady macbeth saw what she couldnt wash away but he wouldnt stop bleeding i couldnt stop it from coming out maybe it happened as you said maybe thats the only way it could have happened all i remember is the fear the adrenaline the the anger janet is that what you were going to say janet shot her a defiant glance what if i was wasnt i right to feel anger im not here to judge you i think id have been angry myself maybe done exactly the same as you but weve got to get this sorted theres no way itll simply disappear as i say the cps might decide not to press charges at the worst youd be looking at excusable homicide maybe even justifiable were not talking jail time here janet thing is though we cant hide it and it wont go away theres got to be some action annie spoke softly and clearly as if to a frightened child i hear what youre saying janet said its like im some sort of sacrificial lamb tossed to the slaughter to appease public opinion not at all annie stood up public opinion is far more likely to be on your side its just procedure that has to be followed look if you want to get in touch with me about anything anything at all before monday heres my card she wrote her home and mobile numbers on the back thanks janet took the card glanced at it and set it on the coffee table you know annie said at the door im not your enemy janet yes id have to give evidence if it came to court but im not against you janet gave her a twisted smile yeah i know she said reaching for the gin again lifes a bitch isnt it sure is annie smiled back then you die claire its so nice to see you again come in claire toth walked into maggies hall and followed her through to the front room where she slouched on the sofa the first things maggie noticed about her were how pale she was and that she had cut off all her beautiful long blond hair what was left lay jaggedly over her skull in such a manner as to suggest that she had cut it herself she wasnt wearing her school uniform but a pair of baggy jeans and a baggy sweatshirt that hid all signs that she was an attractive young woman she wore no makeup and her face was dotted with acne maggie remembered what dr simms had said about the possible reactions of kimberleys close friends that some might suppress their sexuality because they thought that would protect them from predators such as terence payne it looked as if claire was trying to do just that maggie wondered if she should comment but decided not to milk and cookies she asked claire shook her head what is it sweetheart maggie asked whats wrong i dont know said claire i cant sleep i just keep thinking of her i just lie awake all night with it going through my head what must have happened to her what she must have felt like i cant bear it its awful what do your parents say claire looked away i cant talk to them i i thought you know you might understand better let me get those cookies anyway i could do with one myself maggie fetched two glasses of milk and a plate of chocolate chip cookies from the kitchen and put them down on the coffee table claire picked up her milk and sipped at it then reached out and picked up a cookie you read about me in the papers then maggie said claire nodded and what did you think at first i couldnt believe it not you then i realized it could be anybody that you didnt have to be poor or stupid to be abused then i felt sorry for you well please dont do that said maggie trying on a smile i stopped feeling sorry for myself a long time ago and now im just getting on with life all right okay what sort of things do you think about do you want to tell me how terrible it must have been for kimberley with mr payne you know doing things to her sex the police didnt say anything to the papers about it but i know he did horrible things to her i can just picture him there doing it hurting her and kimberley so helpless its no use imagining what it was like claire it wont do any good do you think i dont know that do you think i do it on purpose she shook her head slowly and i keep going over the details of that night in my mind how i just said i was staying for a slow dance with nicky and kimberley said that was okay shed probably find somebody to walk home with but it wasnt very far anyway and the road was welllit i should have known something would happen to her you couldnt know claire how could you possibly know i should have we knew about those girls the ones whod gone missing we should have stuck together been more careful claire listen to me its not your fault and i know this sounds harsh but if anyone should have been more careful perhaps its kimberley you cant be blamed for dancing with a boy if she was concerned then she should have made sure she had someone to walk home with her and not gone off alone maybe she didnt what do you mean maybe mr payne gave her a lift you told the police you didnt see him you didnt did you no but he could have been waiting outside couldnt he i suppose so maggie admitted i hate him im glad hes dead and i hate nicky gallagher i hate all men maggie didnt know what to say to that she could tell claire that shed get over it in time but a fat lot of good that would do the best thing she could do she decided was have a talk with mrs toth and see if they could persuade claire to go for counseling before things got worse at least she seemed to want to talk about her thoughts and feelings which was a good start was she conscious all the time he was doing stuff with her she asked i mean was she aware of him doing it to her claire stop it but maggie was spared further debate by the phone she listened frowning said a few words and then turned back to claire who managed to pull herself out of her absorption with kimberleys ordeal for a moment and ask her who it was it was the local television station maggie said wondering if she sounded as stunned as she felt a flicker of interest what did they want they want me to go on the local news show tonight what did you say i said yes said maggie as if she couldnt quite believe it herself cool said claire squeezing out a tiny smile there are many english seaside resorts that look as if they have seen better days withernsea looked as if it had never seen any good days at all the sun was shining over the rest of the island but you wouldnt know it at withernsea a vicious cold rain slanted in from the iron sky and waves from a north sea the color of stained underwear churned up dirty sand and pebbles on the beach set back from the front was a strip of gift shops amusement arcades and bingo halls their brightcolored lights garish and lurid in the gloomy afternoon the bingo callers amplified number nine doctors orders pathetic as it sounded along the deserted promenade the whole thing reminded banks of long ago childhood holidays at great yarmouth blackpool or scarborough july or august days when it seemed to rain nonstop for two weeks and all he could do was wander around the amusement arcades losing pennies in the onearmed bandits and watching the mechanical claw drop the shiny cigarette lighter just before it reached the winners chute he had never played bingo but had often watched the hardfaced peroxide women sit there game after game chainsmoking and staring down at the little numbers on their cards on better days and when he reached his teens banks would spend his time searching through the secondhand bookshops for the old pan books of horror stories or steamy bestsellers such as the carpetbaggers and peyton place when he was thirteen or fourteen feeling way too grownup to be on holiday with his parents he would wander off alone for the day hanging around in coffee bars and browsing through the latest singles in woolworths or a local record shop sometimes he would meet a girl in the same predicament and he had had his first adolescent kisses and tentative gropings on these holidays banks parked by the seafront and without even stopping for a look at the water hurried to the house directly across from him where retired di george woodward now ran his b ampb the vacancies sign swung in the wind and creaked like a shutter on a haunted house by the time banks rang the front doorbell he was cold and soaked to the skin george woodward was a dapper man with gray hair bristly mustache and the watchful eyes of an excopper there was also an aura of the hangdog about him most noticeable as he looked over bankss shoulder at the weather and shook his head slowly i did suggest torquay he said but the wifes mother lives here in withernsea he ushered banks in ah well its not that bad youve just come on a miserable day thats all early in the season too you should see it when the suns shining and the place is full a different world altogether banks wondered on which day of the year that momentous event occurred but he kept silent no point antagonizing george woodward they were in a large room with a bay window and several tables clearly the breakfast room where the lucky guests hurried down for their bacon and eggs every morning the tables were laid out with white linen but there were no knives and forks and banks wondered if the woodwards had any guests at all at the moment without offering tea or anything stronger george woodward sat at one of the tables and bade banks sit opposite its about alderthorpe is it then yes banks had spoken with jenny fuller on his mobile on his way out to withernsea and learned what elizabeth bell the social worker had to say now he was after the policemans perspective i always thought that would come back to haunt us one day how do you mean damage like that it doesnt go away it festers i suppose youve got a point like jenny had with elizabeth bell banks decided he had to trust george woodward im here about lucy payne he said watching woodwards expression linda godwin as was but thats between you and me for the moment woodward paled and whistled between his teeth my god id never have believed it linda godwin thats right i saw her picture in the paper but i didnt recognize her the poor lass not anymore surely you cant think she had anything to do with those girls we dont know what to think thats the problem shes claiming loss of memory theres some circumstantial evidence but not much you know the sort of thing i mean whats your instinct that shes more involved than shes saying whether shes an accessory or not i dont know you realize she was only a twelveyearold girl when i met her yes twelve going on forty the responsibility she had responsibility jenny had said something about lucy taking care of the younger children he wondered if this was what woodward meant yes she was the eldest for christs sake man she had a tenyearold brother who was being regularly buggered by his father and uncle and there wasnt a damn thing she could do about it they were doing it to her too can you even begin to imagine how all that made her feel banks admitted he couldnt mind if i smoke he asked ill get you an ashtray youre lucky marys over at her mothers he winked shed never allow it woodward produced a heavy glass ashtray from the cupboard by the door and surprised banks by pulling a crumpled packet of embassy regal from the shirt pocket under his beige vneck sweater he then went on to surprise him even further by suggesting a wee dram nowt fancy mind just bells bells would be fine said banks hed have just the one as he had a long drive home the first sip after they clinked glasses tasted wonderful it was everything to do with the cold rain lashing at the bay windows did you get to know lucy at all he asked woodward sipped his bells neat and grimaced barely spoke to her or any of the kids for that matter we left them to the social workers wed enough on our hands with the parents can you tell me how it went down woodward ran his hand over his hair then took a deep drag on his cigarette good lord this is going back a bit he said whatever you can remember oh i remember everything as if it was yesterday thats the problem banks tapped some ash from his cigarette and waited for george woodward to focus his memory on the one day he would probably sooner forget it was pitchblack when we went in woodward began and cold as a witchs tit the eleventh of february it was there was me and baz barry stevens my ds in one car the bloody heater didnt work properly i remember and we were almost blue with cold when we got to alderthorpe all the puddles were frozen there were about three more cars and a van for the social workers to isolate the kids like we were working off a tip from one of the local schoolteachers whod got suspicious about some of the truancies the way the kids looked and behaved and especially the disappearance of kathleen murray shes the one who was killed right thats right anyway there were a couple of lights on in the houses when we got there and we marched straight up and bashed our way in we had a warrant and that was when we we saw it he was silent for a moment staring somewhere beyond banks beyond the bay window beyond even the north sea then he took another nip of whiskey coughed and went on of course we didnt know who was who at first the two households were mixed up and nobody knew whod fathered who anyway what did you find most of them were asleep until we bashed the doors in they had a vicious dog took a chunk out of baz as we went in then we found oliver murray and pamela godwin brother and sister in a bed with one of the godwin girls laura lucys sister yes dianne murray the secondeldest child was curled up safe and sound in a room with her brother keith but their sister susan was sandwiched between the other two adults he swallowed the place was a pigsty both of them were smelled terrible someone had knocked a hole through the livingroom wall so they could travel back and forth without going outside and being seen he paused a moment to collect his thoughts its hard to get across the sense of squalor of depravity you could feel there but it was tangible something you could touch and taste i dont just mean the dirt the stains the smells but more than that a sort of spiritual squalor if you catch my drift everyone was terrified of course especially the kids he shook his head sometimes looking back i wonder if we couldnt have done it some other way some gentler way i dont know too late for that now anyroad i understand you found evidence of satanic rituals in the cellar of the godwin house yes what did you find the usual incense robes books pentagram an altar no doubt on which the virgin would be penetrated other occult paraphernalia you know what my theory is no what these people werent witches or satanists they were just sick and cruel perverts im sure they used the satanism as an excuse to take drugs and dance and chant themselves into a frenzy all that satanic rigmarole the candles magic circles robes music chanting and whatnot it was just something to make it all seem like a game to the children it was just something that played with their minds like didnt let the poor buggers know whether what they were doing was what was supposed to be happening playing with mummy and daddy even if it hurt sometimes and they punished you when you were bad or something way out way overthetop it was both of course no wonder they couldnt understand and all those trappings they just helped turn it into a kids game ring around the roses thats all satanic paraphernalia had also been found in the payness cellar banks wondered if there was a connection did any of them profess any sort of belief in satan at any time oliver and pamela tried to confuse the jury with some sort of gobbledygook about the great horned god and at their trial but nobody took a blind bit of notice of them trappings thats all it were a kids game lets all go down in the cellar and dress up and play where was lucy locked in a cage we later found out it was a genuine morrison shelter left over from the war in the cellar of the murray house along with her brother tom it was where you got put if you misbehaved or disobeyed we found out later we never did find out what the two of them had done to get put there though because they wouldnt talk wouldnt or couldnt wouldnt they wouldnt talk out against the adults their parents theyd been abused and messed up in their minds too long to dare put it into words he paused a moment sometimes i dont think they could have expressed it all anyway no matter how much they tried i mean where does a nineyearold or an elevenyearold find the language and points of reference she needs to explain something like that they werent just protecting their parents or shutting up in fear of them it went deeper than that anyway tom and linda they were both naked and dirty crawling in their own filth looked as if they hadnt eaten for a couple of days i mean most of the children were malnourished and neglected but they were worse there was a bucket in the cage and the smell and linda well she was twelve and it showed she was i mean theyd made no provisions for you know time of the month ill never forget the look of shame and fear and defiance on that little kids face when baz and i walked in on them and turned the light on banks took a sip of bells waited until it had burned all the way down then asked what did you do first off we found some blankets for them as much for warmths sake as modestys because there wasnt much heat in the place either after that we handed them over to the social workers he gave a little shudder one of them couldnt handle it wellmeaning young lass thought she was tough but she didnt have the stomach what did she do went back to the car and wouldnt get out just sat there hunched up shivering and crying there was no one to pay her much mind as we all had our hands full me and baz were mostly occupied with the adults did they have much to say nah surly lot and pamela godwin well there was clearly summat wrong with her in the head she didnt seem to have a clue what was going on kept on smiling and asking us if we wanted a cup of tea her husband though michael ill never forget him greasy hair straggly beard and that look in his dark eyes you ever seen pictures of that american killer charles manson yes like him thats who michael godwin reminded me of charles manson what did you do with them we arrested them all under the protection of children act to be going on with they resisted arrest of course picked up a few lumps and bruises he gave banks a challengemeonthatoneifyoudare look banks didnt later of course we came up with a list of charges as long as your arm including murder that was later after we found kathleen murrays body when did you find her later that day where out back in an old sack in the dustbin i reckon theyd dumped her there until the ground softened a bit and they could bury her you could see where someone had tried to dig a hole but theyd given up the earth was so hard shed been doubled over and been there long enough to freeze solid so the pathologist had to wait till she thawed out before he could do the postmortem were they all charged yes we charged all four adults with conspiracy and they were all committed for trial michael godwin topped himself in his cell and pamela was found unfit to stand trial the jury convicted the other two after a mornings deliberation what evidence did you have what do you mean could anyone else have killed kathleen who i dont know one of the other kids maybe woodwards jaw tightened you didnt see them he said if you had you wouldnt be making suggestions like that did anyone suggest it at the time he gave a harsh laugh believe it or not yes the adults had the gall to try and pin it on the boy tom but nobody fell for that one thank the lord what about the evidence how was she killed for example ligature strangulation banks held his breath another coincidence with what woodward smiled as if laying down his trump card oliver murrays belt the pathologist matched it to the wound he also found traces of murrays semen in the girls vagina and anus not to mention unusual tearing it looks they went too far that once maybe she was bleeding to death i dont know but they killed her he killed her with the knowledge and consent of the others maybe even with their help i dont know how did they plead the murrays what would you expect not guilty they never confessed no people like that never do they dont even think theyve done anything wrong theyre so beyond the law beyond whats normal for the rest of us folks in the end they got less than they deserved in that theyre still alive but at least theyre still locked up out of harms way and that mr banks is the story of the alderthorpe seven woodward put his palms on the table and stood up he seemed less dapper and more weary than when banks had first arrived now if youll excuse me ive got the rooms to do before the missus comes back it seemed like an odd time to be doing the rooms banks thought especially as they were all probably vacant but he sensed that woodward had had enough wanted to be alone and wanted if he could to get rid of the bad taste of his memories before his wife came home good luck to him banks couldnt think of anything more to ask so he said his goodbyes buttoned up and walked out into the rain he could have sworn he felt a few lumps of hail stinging his bare head before he got into his car maggie began to have doubts the moment she got in the taxi to the local television studio truth be told she had been vacillating ever since she first got the call early that afternoon inviting her to participate in a discussion on domestic violence on the evening magazine show at six oclock after the news a researcher had seen the article in the newspaper and thought maggie would make a valuable guest this was not about terence and lucy payne the researcher had stressed and their deeds were not to be discussed it was an odd legal situation she explained that no one had yet been charged with the murders of the girls and the main suspect was dead but not proved guilty could you charge a dead man with murder maggie wondered as the taxi wound down canal road over the bridge and under the viaduct to kirkstall road where the rush hour traffic was slow and heavy maggie felt the butterflies begin the flutter in her stomach she remembered the newspaper article how lorraine temple had twisted everything and wondered again if she was doing the right thing or if she was simply walking back into the lions den but she did have very good strong reasons for doing it she assured herself in the first place she wanted to atone for even correct the image the newspaper had given of lucy payne as being evil and manipulative if she could slip it in somehow lucy was a victim and the public should be made to realize that secondly she wanted to rid herself of the mousy nervous image lorraine temple had lumbered her with both for her own sake and in order to get people to take her seriously she didnt like being thought of as mousy and nervous and she was damn well going to do something about it finally and this was the reason that pushed her to say yes was the way that policeman banks had come to the house shouting at her insulting her intelligence and telling her what she could and couldnt do damn him shed show him shed show them all she was feeling empowered now and if it was her lot to become a spokeswoman for battered wives then so be it she was up to the task lorraine temple had let the cat out of the bag about her past anyway so there was nothing more to hide she might as well speak out and hope she could do some good for other others in her position no more mousy and nervous julia ford had phoned her that afternoon to tell her that lucy was being detained in eastvale for further questioning and would probably be kept there overnight maggie was outraged what had lucy done to deserve such treatment something was very much out of kilter in the whole business maggie paid the taxi driver and kept the receipt the tv people would reimburse her they had said she introduced herself at reception and the woman behind the desk called the researcher tina driscoll who turned out to be a cheerful slip of a lass in her early twenties with short bleached blond hair and pale skin stretched tight over her high cheekbones like most of the other people maggie saw as she followed tina through the obligatory television studio maze she was dressed in jeans and a white blouse youre on after the poodle groomer tina said glancing at her watch should be about twenty past heres makeup tina ushered maggie into a tiny room with chairs and mirrors and a whole array of powders brushes and potions just here love thats right said the makeup artist who introduced herself as charley wont take a minute and she started dabbing and brushing away at maggies face finally satisfied with the result she said drop by when youve finished and ill wipe it off in a jiffy maggie didnt see a great deal of difference though she knew from her previous television experience that the studio lighting and cameras would pick up the subtle nuances david will be conducting the interview said tina consulting her clipboard on their way to the green room david maggie knew was david hartford half of the malefemale team that hosted the program the woman was called emma larson and maggie had been hoping that she would have been asking the questions emma had always come across as sympathetic on womens issues but david hartford maggie thought had a cynical and derogatory tone to his questioning of anyone who was passionate about anything he was also known to be provocative still the way maggie was feeling she was quite willing to be provoked maggies fellow guests were waiting in the green room the grave bearded dr james bletchley from the local hospital dc kathy proctor of the domestic violence unit and michael groves a rather shaggylooking social worker maggie realized she was the only victim on the program well so be it she could tell them what it was like to be on the receiving end they all introduced themselves and then a sort of nervous silence fell over the room broken only when the poodle emitted a short yap at the entry of the producer there to check that everyone was present and accounted for for the remainder of the wait maggie chatted briefly with her fellow guests about things in general and watched the hubbub as people came and went and shouted questions at each other in the corridors outside like the other tv studio she had been in this one also seemed to be in a state of perpetual chaos there was a monitor in the room and they were able to watch the shows opening the light banter of david and emma and a recap of the days main local news stories including the death of a revered councillor a proposed new roundabout for the city center and a neighbors from hell story from the poplar estate during the commercial break after the poodle groomer a set worker got them all in position on the armchairs and sofas designed to give the feel of a cozy intimate living room complete with fake fireplace wired up their mikes and disappeared david hartford made himself comfortable in a position where he could see the guests without having to move too much and where the cameras would show him to best advantage the silent countdown came to an end david hartford straightened his tie and put on his best smile and they were off close up maggie thought davids skin looked like pink plastic and she imagined it would feel like a childs doll to the touch his hair was also too impossibly black to be natural as soon as david started his introduction to the subject he swapped his smile for a serious concerned expression and turned first to kathy the policewoman for a general idea of how many domestic complaints they got and how they dealt with them after that it was the social worker michaels turn to talk about womens shelters when david turned to maggie for the first time she felt her heart lurch in her chest he was handsome in a tvhost sort of way but there was something about him that unnerved her he didnt seem interested in the problems and the issues but more in making something dramatically appealing out of it all of which he was the focus she supposed that was what television was all about when you came right down to it making things dramatic and making presenters look good but still it disturbed her he asked her when she first knew there was something wrong and she briefly detailed the signs the unreasonable demands flashes of anger petty punishments and finally the blows right up to the time bill broke her jaw knocked out two of her teeth and put her in hospital for a week when maggie had finished he turned to the next question on his sheet why didnt you leave i mean youve just said you put up with this physical abuse for how long nearly two years youre clearly an intelligent and resourceful woman why didnt you just get out as maggie sought the words to express why it didnt happen as simply as that the social worker cut in and explained how easy it was for women to get trapped in the cycle of violence and how the shame often prevented them from speaking out finally maggie found her voice youre right she said to david i could have left as you say im an intelligent and resourceful woman i had a good job good friends a supportive family i suppose part of it was that i thought it would go away that we would work through it i still loved my husband marriage wasnt something i was going to throw away lightly she paused and when nobody else dived into the silence said besides it wouldnt have made any difference even after i did leave he found me stalked me harassed me assaulted me again even after the court order this prompted david to go back to the policewoman and talk about how ineffective the courts were in protecting women at risk from abusive spouses and maggie had the chance to take stock of what she had said she hadnt done too badly she decided it was hot under the studio lights and she felt her brow moisten with sweat she hoped it wouldnt rinse away the makeup next david turned to the doctor is domestic violence specifically directed from men to women dr bletchley he asked there are some cases of husbands being physically abused by their wives said the doctor but relatively few i think youll find statistically michael butted in that male violence against women by far outstrips womens against men almost enough to make female violence against men seem insignificant its built into our culture men hunt down and kill their expartners for example or commit familial massacres in a way that women do not but that aside david asked next dont you think sometimes that a woman might overreact and ruin a mans life i mean once such accusations have been made they are often very difficult to shake off even if a court finds the person not guilty but isnt it worth the risk maggie argued if it saves the ones who really need saving david smirked well thats rather like saying whats hanging a few innocent people matter as long as we get the guilty ones too isnt it nobody intentionally set out to hang innocent people kathy pointed out but say if a man retaliates in the face of extreme provocation david pressed on isnt the woman still far more likely to be seen as the victim she is the victim maggie said thats like saying she asked for it michael added just what kind of provocation justifies violence are there not also women who actually like it rough oh dont be absurd said michael thats the same sort of thing as suggesting that women ask to be raped by the way they dress but there are masochistic personalities arent there doctor youre talking about women who like their sex rough yes said the doctor david seemed a little embarrassed by the directness of the question clearly he was a man used to asking not answering but he nodded dr bletchley stroked his beard before answering well to answer your question simply yes there are masochistic women just as there are masochistic men but you have to understand that were dealing with a very tiny fragment of society here and not that section of society concerned with domestic violence obviously glad to be done with this line of questioning david moved on to his next question phrasing it carefully for maggie youve recently had some involvement with whats become rather a cause célèbre involving domestic abuse now while we cant discuss the case directly for legal reasons is there anything you can tell us about that situation he looked hungry for an answer maggie thought someone confided in me she said confided that she was being abused by her husband i offered advice as much help and support as i could give but you didnt report it to the authorities it wasnt my place to do that what do you think of that dc proctor shes right theres nothing we can do until the persons themselves report the matter or until things come to a head as they did in this instance yes thats often the unfortunate result of the way things work thank you very much david said about to wrap things up maggie realized she had weakened at the end got sidetracked so she launched in interrupting him and said if i might add just one more thing its that victims are not always treated with the care respect and tenderness we all think they deserve right now theres a young woman in the cells in eastvale a woman who until this morning was in hospital with injuries she sustained when her husband beat her last weekend why is this woman being persecuted like this do you have an answer dave asked he was obviously pissed off at the interruption but excited by the possibility of controversy i think its because her husbands dead maggie said they think he killed some young girls but hes dead and they cant exact their pound of flesh thats why theyre picking on her thats why theyre picking on lucy thank you very much david said turning to the camera and bringing out his smile again that just about wraps things up there was silence when the program ended and the technician removed their mikes then the policewoman went over to maggie and said i think it was extremely illadvised of you to say what you did back there oh leave her alone said michael its about time someone spoke out about it the doctor had already left and david and emma were nowhere to be seen fancy a drink said michael to maggie as they left the studio after having their makeup removed but she shook her head all she wanted to do was get a taxi home and climb into a nice warm bath with a good book it might be the last bit of peace and quiet she got if there was a reaction to what she had said tonight she didnt think she had broken any laws after all she hadnt said terry was guilty of the killings hadnt even mentioned his name but she was also certain that the police could find something to charge her with if they wanted to they seemed to be good at that and she wouldnt put it past banks at all let them do it she thought just let them make a martyr of her are you sure just a quick one she looked at michael and knew that all he wanted to do was probe her for more details no she said thank you very much for the offer but no im going home banks found chaos outside western divisional headquarters early saturday morning even at the back where the entrance to the car park was located reporters and camerawielding television news teams pushed against one another and shouted out questions about lucy payne banks cursed to himself turned off the dylan cd halfway through not dark yet and edged his way carefully but firmly through the throng inside things were quieter banks slipped into his office and looked out of the window over the market square more reporters tv station vans with satellite dishes the works someone had well and truly let the cat out of the bag first banks walked into the detectives squad room looking for answers dcs jackman and templeton were at their desks and annie cabbot was bending over the low drawer in the filing cabinet a heartwarming sight in her tight black jeans banks thought remembering they had a date that night dinner video and what the hells going on out there he asked the room in general annie looked up dont you know know what didnt you see her what are you talking about kevin templeton and winsome jackman kept their heads down leaving this one well alone annie put her hands on her hips last night on the television i was over in withernsea interviewing a retired copper about lucy payne what did i miss annie walked over to her desk and rested her hip against the edge the neighbor maggie forrest was involved in a television discussion about domestic violence oh shit indeed she ended up by accusing us of persecuting lucy payne because we cant wreak our revenge on her husband and she informed the viewers in general that lucy was being detained here julia ford banks whispered who the lawyer ill bet shes the one told maggie where we were holding lucy christ what a mess oh by the way annie said with a smile ac hartnells already phoned twice asked if youd ring him as soon as you get in banks headed for his office before phoning phil hartnell he opened his window as wide as it would go and lit a cigarette bugger the rules it was shaping up to be one of those days and it had only just begun banks should have known maggie forrest was a loose cannon that his warning might well just egg her on to more foolish behavior but what else could he do about her not much apparently she hadnt committed a criminal offense and certainly there was nothing to be gained by going around and telling her off again still if he did happen to see her for any reason hed give her a piece of his mind she had no idea what she was playing with when he calmed down he sat at his desk and reached for the phone but it rang before he could pick it up and dial hartnells number alan stefan here i hope youve got some good news for me stefan because the way this mornings going i could do with some that bad getting that way maybe thisll cheer you up then i just got the dna comparison in from the lab and a match terence payne was your seacroft rapist all right banks slapped the desk excellent anything else only minor points the lads going through all the documents and bills taken from the house have found no evidence of sleeping tablets prescribed for either terence or lucy payne and they didnt find any illegal ones either as i thought they did find an electronics catalog though from one of those places that put you on their mailing list when you buy something from them what did they buy theres no record of their buying anything on their credit cards but well approach the company and get someone to go through the purchases see if they used cash and another thing there were some marks on the floor of the cellar that on further investigation look rather like those a tripod would make ive talked with luke and he didnt use a tripod so someone else did looks that way then where the hell is it no idea okay stefan thanks for the good news keep looking will do as soon as hed hung up banks dialed hartnells number the man himself answered on the second ring area commander hartnell its alan said banks heard youve been trying to get in touch with me did you see it no ive only just found out the place is swarming with media surprise surprise the stupid woman whats the situation with lucy payne i talked to her yesterday got nowhere any more evidence not evidence as such banks told him about the seacroft rapist dna match the possibility of a camcorder still being hidden somewhere on the paynes property and his talk with george woodward about the satanic paraphernalia in alderthorpe and the ligature strangulation of kathleen murray its nothing said hartnell certainly not evidence against lucy payne for christs sake alan she was a victim of the most appalling abuse i remember that alderthorpe case we dont want all that raked up think what it will look like if we start suggesting she killed her own bloody cousin when she was only twelve i thought i might use it to push her a bit see where she goes you know as well as i do that blood and fibers arent enough and as far as evidence goes theyre all weve got this speculation about her past will do nothing but gain her more sympathy from the public there are probably as many people outraged by the crimes and thinking maybe she had more to do with them than she admits probably but theyre nowhere near as vocal as the people whove already been phoning millgarth believe me cut her loose alan but we caught our killer and hes dead let her go we cant hold her any longer banks looked at his watch weve still got four hours something might turn up nothing will turn up in the next four hours believe me release her what about surveillance too bloody expensive tell the local police to keep an eye on her and tell her to stick around we might want to talk to her again if shes guilty shell disappear if shes guilty well find the evidence and then well find her let me have one more shot at her first banks held his breath as hartnell paused at the other end all right talk to her one more time if she doesnt confess let her go but be bloody careful i dont want any allegations of gestapo interrogation tactics banks heard a knock at his door put his hand over the mouthpiece and called out come in julia ford entered and gave him a broad smile no worry on that score sir banks said to hartnell her lawyer will be present at all times quite the zoo out there isnt it julia ford said after banks had hung up the fine lines around her eyes crinkled when she smiled she was wearing a different suit this morning gray with a pearl blouse but it looked every bit as businesslike her hair looked shiny as if fresh from the shower and she had applied just enough makeup to take a few years off her age yes banks answered looks as if someone tipped the entire british media off about lucys whereabouts are you going to let her go soon i want another chat first julia sighed and opened the door for him ah well once more unto the breach hull and beyond were parts of yorkshire jenny hardly knew at all on her map there was a tiny village called kilnsea right at the southern tip of land where the humber joined the north sea just before a thin strip called spurn head designated as a heritage coast stuck out into the sea like a witchs crooked wizened finger it looked so desolate out there that jenny shuddered just looking at the map feeling the ceaseless cold wind and the biting salt spray she imagined were all one would find there was it named spurn head because someone was spurned there once she wondered and her ghost lingered walking the sands and wailing in the night or because spurn was a corruption of sperm and it looked a bit like a sperm wiggling out to sea it was probably something much more prosaic like peninsula in viking jenny wondered if anybody ever went there birders perhaps they were crazy enough to go anywhere in search of the elusive lesserspeckled yellow tree warbler or some such creature it didnt look as if there were any holiday resorts in the region except perhaps withernsea which banks had visited yesterday all the hot spots were much farther north bridlington filey scarborough whitby all the way up to saltburn and redcar in teeside it was a fine day windy but sunny with only an occasional high white cloud passing over it wasnt exactly warm definitely lightjacket weather but then it wasnt freezing either jenny seemed to be the only car on the road beyond patrington where she stopped briefly for a cup of coffee and a look at st patricks church reputed to be one of the finest village churches in england it was desolate country mostly flat farmland green fields and the occasional flash of bright yellow rapeseed what villages she passed through were no more than mean assemblages of bungalows and the odd row of redbrick terraces soon the surrealistic landscape of the north sea gas terminal with its twisted metal pipes and storage units came into view and jenny headed up the coast toward alderthorpe she had been thinking about banks quite a lot during her journey and came to the conclusion that he wasnt happy she didnt know why apart from sandras pregnancy which was obviously upsetting to him for any number of reasons he had everything to be thankful for for a start his career was back on track and he had an attractive young girlfriend at least she assumed that annie was attractive but perhaps it was annie who was making banks unhappy he had never seemed quite certain of their relationship whenever jenny had questioned him she had assumed that was mostly due to his innate evasiveness when it came to personal and emotional matters like most men but perhaps he was genuinely confused not that she could do anything she remembered how disappointed she had felt last year when he had accepted her dinner invitation and failed to turn up or even phone jenny had sat there in her most seductive silky outfit duck à lorange in the oven ready to take a risk again and waited and waited at last he had phoned hed been called to a hostage situation well it was definitely a good excuse but it didnt do much to dispel her sense of disappointment and loss since then they had been more circumspect with each other neither willing to risk making an arrangement in case it got screwed up but still she fretted about banks and still she admitted to herself she wanted him the flat desolate landscape went on and on how on earth could anybody live in such a remote and backward spot jenny wondered she saw the sign pointing east alderthorpe mile and set off down the narrow unpaved track hoping to hell there was no one coming the other way still the landscape was so open hardly a tree in sight that she could easily see someone coming from a long way away the halfmile seemed to go on forever as short distances often do on country roads then she saw a huddle of houses ahead and she could smell the sea through her open window though she couldnt see it yet when she found herself turning left on to a paved street with bungalows on one side and rows of redbrick terrace houses on the other she realized this must be alderthorpe she saw a small post officecumgeneral store with a rack of newspapers fluttering in the breeze a greengrocers and a butchers a squat gospel hall and a meanlooking pub called the lord nelson and that was it jenny pulled up behind a blue citroën outside the post office and when she got out of the car she thought she could see curtains twitching over the road feel curious eyes on her back as she opened the postoffice door no one comes here she imagined the people thinking what could she possibly want jenny felt as if she had walked into one of those lostvillage stories the place that time forgot and she had the illogical sense that by walking into it she was lost too and all memory of her in the real world was gone silly fool she told herself but she shivered and it wasnt cold the bell pinged above her head and she found herself in the kind of shop that she guessed had ceased to exist even before she was born where jars of barley sugar rubbed shoulders with shoelaces and patent medicines on high shelves and birthday cards stood on a rack next to the halfinch nails and tins of evaporated milk it smelled both musty and fruity pear drops jenny thought and the light that filtered in from the street was dim and cast strips of shadow on the sales counter there was a small postoffice wicket and the woman standing there in a threadbare brown coat turned and stared at jenny when she entered the postmistress herself peered around her customer and adjusted her glasses they had clearly been having a good natter and were none too thrilled at being interrupted can i help you the postmistress asked i wondered if you could tell me where the old murray and godwin houses are jenny asked why would you be wanting to know that its to do with a job im doing newspaper reporter are you as a matter of fact no im a forensic psychologist this stopped the woman in her tracks its spurn lane you want just over the street and down the lane to the sea last two semis you cant miss them nobodys lived there for years do you know if any of the children still live around here ive not seen hide nor hair of any of em since it happened what about the teacher maureen nesbitt lives in easington theres no school here thank you very much as she left she heard the customer whisper forensic psychologist whatevers that when its at home sightseer muttered the postmistress ghoul just like all the rest anyway you were saying about mary wallaces husband jenny wondered how they would react when the media descended en masse which they surely would do before long its not often a place such as alderthorpe sees fame more than once in a lifetime she crossed the high street still feeling as if she were being watched and found the unpaved lane that led east to the north sea though there was a chill in the wind the cloudless sky was such a bright piercing blue that she put on her sunglasses remembering with a flutter of anger the day she bought them on santa monica pier with randy the twotiming bastard there were about five or six bungalows on each side of spurn lane near the high street but about fifty yards along there was only rough ground jenny could see two dirty brick semis another fifty yards beyond that they were certainly isolated from the village which itself was isolated enough to begin with she imagined that once the reporters and the television cameras had gone ten years ago the silence and loneliness and sense of grief must have been devastating for the community the questions and accusations screaming out loud in the air even the residents around the hill part of a suburb of a large modern city would be struggling to understand what had happened there for years and many of the residents would need counseling jenny could only imagine what alderthorpe folk probably thought of counseling as she approached the houses she became more and more aware of the salt smell of the sea breeze and realized that it was out there only yards away beyond the low dunes and marram grass villages along this coast had disappeared into the sea jenny had read the sandy coastline was always shifting and maybe in ten or twenty years time alderthorpe would have vanished underwater too it was a spooky thought the houses were beyond repair the roofs had caved in and the broken windows and doors were boarded up here and there people had spraypainted graffiti rot in hell bring back hanging and the simple touching kathleen we will not forget jenny found herself oddly moved as she stood there playing the voyeur the gardens were overgrown with weeds and shrubs but she could make her way through the tangled undergrowth closer to the buildings there wasnt much to see and the doors had been so securely boarded up that she couldnt get inside even if she wanted to in there she told herself lucy payne and six other children had been terrorized raped humiliated tormented and tortured for god knew how many years before the death of one of them kathleen murray led the authorities to the door now the place was just a silent ruin jenny felt like a bit of a fraud standing there the way she had in the cellar of the hill what could she possibly do or say to make sense of the horrors that had occurred here her science like all the rest was inadequate even so she stood there for some time then she walked around the buildings noting that the back gardens were even more overgrown than the front an empty clothesline hung suspended between two rusty poles in one of the gardens as she was leaving jenny almost tripped over something in the undergrowth at first she thought it was a root but when she bent down and pulled aside the leaves and twigs she saw a small teddy bear it looked so disheveled it could have been out there for years could even have belonged to one of the alderthorpe seven though jenny doubted it the police or the social services would have taken everything like that away so it had probably been left as a sort of tribute later by a local child when she picked it up it felt soggy and a beetle crawled out from a rip in its back on to her hand jenny let out a sharp gasp dropped the teddy bear and headed quickly back to the village she had intended to knock on a few doors and ask about the godwins and the murrays but alderthorpe had spooked her so much that she decided instead to head for easington to talk to maureen nesbitt right lucy shall we start banks had turned on the tape recorders and tested them this time they were in a slightly bigger and more salubrious interview room in addition to lucy and julia ford banks had invited dc jackman along too though it wasnt her case mostly to get her impressions of lucy afterward i suppose so lucy said in a resigned sulky voice she looked tired and shaken by her night in the cell banks thought even though the cells were the most modern part of the station the duty officer said shed asked to have the light left on all night so she couldnt have slept much i hope you were comfortable last night he asked what do you care its not my intention to cause you discomfort lucy dont worry about me im fine julia ford tapped her watch can we get on with this superintendent banks banks paused then looked at lucy lets talk a bit more about your background shall we whats that got to do with anything julia ford butted in if youll allow me to ask my questions you might find out if it distresses my client distresses your client the parents of five young girls are more than distressed thats irrelevant said julia its nothing to do with lucy banks ignored the lawyer and turned back to lucy who seemed disinterested by the discussion will you describe the cellar at alderthorpe for me lucy the cellar yes dont you remember it it was just a cellar lucy said dark and cold was there anything else down there i dont know what black candles incense a pentagram robes wasnt there a lot of dancing and chanting down there lucy lucy closed her eyes i dont remember that wasnt me that was linda oh come on lucy you can do better than that why is it that whenever we come to something you dont want to talk about you always conveniently lose your memory superintendent julia ford said remember my client has suffered retrograde amnesia due to posttraumatic shock yes yes i remember impressive words banks turned back to lucy you dont remember going into the cellar at the hill and you dont remember the dancing and chanting in the cellar at alderthorpe do you remember the cage lucy seemed to draw in on herself do you banks persisted the old morrison shelter i remember it lucy whispered it was where they put us when we were bad how were you bad lucy i dont understand why were you in the cage when the police came you and tom what had you done to get yourselves put there i dont know it was never much you never had to do much if you didnt clean your plate not that there was ever much on it to clean or if you talked back or said no when they when they wanted to it was easy to get locked in the cage do you remember kathleen murray i remember kathleen she was my cousin what happened to her they killed her who did the grownups why did they kill her i dont know they just she just died they said your brother tom killed her thats ridiculous tom wouldnt kill anybody toms gentle do you remember how it happened i wasnt there just one day they told us kathleen had gone away and she wouldnt be coming back i knew she was dead how did you know i just knew she cried all the time she said she was going to tell they always said theyd kill any of us if they thought we were going to tell kathleen was strangled lucy was she yes just like the girls we found in your cellar ligature strangulation remember those yellow fibers we found under you fingernails along with kimberleys blood where are you going with this superintendent julia ford asked there are a lot of similarities between the crimes thats all but surely the killers of kathleen murray are behind bars julia argued its got nothing to do with lucy she was involved she was a victim always the victim eh lucy the victim with the bad memory how does it feel thats enough said julia it feels awful lucy said in a small voice what you asked how it feels to be a victim with a bad memory it feels awful it feels like i have no self like im lost i have no control like i dont count i cant even remember the bad things that happened to me let me ask you once more lucy did you ever help your husband to abduct a young girl no i didnt did you ever harm any of the girls he brought home i never knew about them not until last week why did you get up and go down in the cellar on that particular night why not on any of the previous occasions when your husband was entertaining a young girl in the cellar of your house i never heard anything before he must have drugged me we found no sleeping tablets in our search of the house nor do either of you have a prescription for any he must have got them illegally he must have run out thats why i woke up where would he get them school theres all sorts of drugs in schools lucy did you know that your husband was a rapist when you met him did i what you heard me banks opened the file in front of him by our count he had already raped four women we know of before he met you at that pub in seacroft terence payne was the seacroft rapist his dna matches that left in the victims i i you dont know what to say no how did you meet him lucy none of your friends remember seeing you talk to him in the pub that night i told you i was on my way out it was a big pub with lots of rooms we went into another bar why should you be any different lucy i dont know what you mean i mean why didnt he follow you out into the street and rape you like he did with the others i dont know how should i know youve got to admit its strange though isnt it i told you i dont know he liked me loved me yet he still continued to rape other young women after hed met you banks consulted his file again at least two more times according to our account and theyre only the ones who reported it some women dont report it you know too upset or too ashamed see they blame themselves banks thought of annie cabbot and what shed been through over two years ago whats that got to do with me why didnt he rape you lucy gave him an unfathomable look maybe he did dont be absurd no woman likes being raped and shes certainly not going to marry her rapist youd be surprised what you can get used to if youve got no choice what do you mean no choice what i say it was your choice to marry terry wasnt it nobody forced you to thats not what i mean then what do you mean never mind come on never mind banks shuffled his papers what was it lucy did he tell you about what hed done did it excite you did he recognize a kindred spirit your hindley to his brady julia ford shot to her feet thats enough superintendent one more remark like that and this interviews over and ill be reporting you banks ran his hand over his closely cropped hair it felt spiky winsome picked up the questioning did he rape you lucy she asked in her lilting jamaican accent did your husband rape you lucy turned to look at winsome and seemed to banks to be calculating how to deal with this new factor in the equation of course not i would never have married a rapist so you didnt know about him of course i didnt didnt you find anything odd about terry i mean i never knew him but it sounds to me as if theres enough there to give a person cause for concern he could be very charming did he do or say nothing to make you suspicious in all the time you were together no but somehow you ended up married to a man who was not only a rapist but also an abductor and murderer of young girls how can you explain that lucy youve got to admit its highly unusual hard to believe i cant help that and i cant explain it thats just how it happened did he like to play games sexual games like what did he like tying you up did he like to pretend he was raping you we didnt do anything like that winsome gave banks a signal to take over again and her look mirrored his feelings they were getting nowhere and lucy payne was probably lying wheres the camcorder banks asked i dont know what youre talking about we found evidence in the cellar a camcorder had been set up at the end of the bed i think you liked to video what you were doing to the girls i didnt do anything to them ive told you i didnt go down there except maybe the once i know nothing about any camcorder you never saw your husband with one no he never showed you any videos only rented or borrowed ones we think we know where he bought the camcorder lucy we can check go ahead i never saw one never knew about any such thing banks paused and changed tack you say you didnt play sexual games lucy so what made you decide to dress up and act like a prostitute banks asked what dont you remember yes but that wasnt it i mean i didnt i wasnt on the street or anything who told you that never mind did you pick up a man in a hotel bar for sex what if i did it was just a lark a dare so you did like games this was before i knew terry so that makes it all right im not saying that it was a lark thats all what happened lucy gave a sly smile same as happened often enough if i let myself get chatted up in a pub only this time i got paid two hundred pounds like i said it was a lark thats all are you going to arrest me for prostitution some lark said banks julia ford looked a bit perplexed by the exchange but she said nothing banks knew they were still going nowhere hartnell was right they had no real evidence against lucy beyond the extreme weirdness of her relationship with payne and the tiny bloodstains and rope fibers her answers might not make a lot of sense but unless she confessed to aiding and abetting her husband in his murders she was in the clear he looked at her again the bruises had almost faded to nothing and she looked quite innocent and lovely with her pale skin and long black hair almost like a madonna the only thing that made banks persist in his belief that there was far more to events than she would ever care to admit was her eyes black reflective impermeable he got the impression that if you stared into eyes like hers for too long youd go mad but that wasnt evidence that was an overactive imagination all of a sudden hed had enough surprising all three of them he stood up so abruptly he almost knocked over his chair said youre free to go now lucy just dont go too far and hurried out of the interview room easington was a pleasant change from alderthorpe jenny thought as she parked her car near the pub at the center of the village though still almost as remote from civilization it seemed at least to be connected to be a part of things in a way that alderthorpe didnt jenny found maureen nesbitts address easily enough from the barmaid and soon found herself on the doorstep facing a suspicious woman with long white hair tied back in a blue ribbon wearing a fawn cardigan and black slacks a little too tight for someone with such ample hips and thighs who are you what do you want im a psychologist said jenny i want to talk to you about what happened in alderthorpe maureen nesbitt looked up and down the street then turned back to face jenny are you sure youre not a reporter im not a reporter because they were all over me when it happened but i told them nothing scavengers she pulled her cardie tighter over her chest im not a reporter jenny repeated digging deep into her handbag for some sort of identification the best she could come up with was her university library card at least it identified her as dr fuller and as a member of the staff maureen scrutinized the card clearly unhappy it didnt also bear a photograph then she finally let jenny in once inside her manner changed completely from grand inquisitor to gracious host insisting on brewing a fresh pot of tea the living room was small but comfortable with only a couple of armchairs a mirror above the fireplace and a glassfronted cabinet full of beautiful crystal ware beside one of the armchairs was a small table and on it lay a paperback of great expectations next to a halffull cup of milky tea jenny sat in the other chair when maureen brought through the tray including a plate of digestive biscuits she said i do apologize for my behavior earlier its just that ive learned the hard way over the years a little notoriety can quite change your life you know are you still teaching no i retired three years ago she tapped the paperback i promised myself that when i retired i would reread all my favorite classics she sat down well just let the tea mash for a few minutes shall we i suppose youre here about lucy payne you know ive tried to keep up with them all over the years i know that lucy linda as she was back then lived with a couple called liversedge near hull and then she got a job at a bank and went to live in leeds where she married terence payne last i heard this lunchtime was that the police just let her go for lack of evidence even jenny hadnt heard that yet but then she hadnt listened to the news that day how do you know all this she asked my sister works for the social services in hull you wont tell will you cross my heart so what do you want to know what were your impressions of lucy she was a bright girl very bright but easily bored easily distracted she was headstrong stubborn and once shed made her mind up you couldnt budge her of course you have to remember that shed gone on to the local comprehensive at the time of the arrests i only taught junior school she was with us until she was eleven but the others were still there yes all of them its not as if theres a lot of choice when it comes to local schools i imagine not anything else you can remember about lucy not really did she form any close friendships outside the immediate family none of them did that was one of the odd things they were a mysterious group and sometimes when you saw them together it gave you a creepy feeling as if they had their own language and an agenda you knew nothing about have you ever read john wyndham no you should hes quite good for a sciencefiction writer that is believe it or not i encouraged my pupils to read just about anything they enjoyed so long as they read something anyway wyndham wrote a book called the midwich cuckoos about a group of strange children fathered by aliens on an unsuspecting village that sounds vaguely familiar jenny said perhaps you saw the film it was called village of the damned thats it said jenny that one where the teacher planted a bomb to destroy the children and had to concentrate on a brick wall so they couldnt read his thoughts yes well it wasnt quite like that with the godwins and the murrays but it still gave you that sort of feeling the way they looked at you waited in the corridor till youd gone by before talking again and they always seemed to speak in whispers linda i remember was very distressed when she had to leave and go to the comprehensive before the others but i gather from her teacher there that she quickly got used to it she has a strong personality that girl despite what happened to her and shes adaptable did she show any unusual preoccupations what do you mean anything particularly morbid death mutilation not so far as i noticed she was how shall i put this an early developer and rather sexually aware for a girl of her age on average girls peak in puberty at about twelve but lucy was beyond prepubescence at eleven her breasts were developing for example sexually active no well as we now know she was being sexually abused in the home but no not in the way youre suggesting she was just sexually there it was something people noticed about her and she wasnt above playing the little coquette i see jenny made a note and it was kathleens absence that led you to call in the authorities yes maureen looked away toward the window but she didnt look as if she were admiring the view not my finest moment she said bending to pour the tea milk and sugar yes please thank you why i should have done something sooner shouldnt i it wasnt the first time id had my suspicions something was terribly wrong in those households though i never saw any bruises or clear outward signs of abuse the children often looked undernourished and seemed timid sometimes i know this is terrible but they smelled as if they hadnt bathed in days other children would stay away from them theyd jump if you touched them no matter how gently i should have known what did you do well i talked with the other teachers and we all agreed there was something odd about the childrens behavior it turned out the social services already had their concerns too theyd been out to the houses once before but never got past the front door i dont know if you knew but michael godwin had a particularly vicious rottweiler anyway when kathleen murray went absent without any reasonable explanation they decided to act the rest is history you say youve kept track of the children jenny said id really like to talk to some of them will you help me maureen paused a moment if you like but i dont think youll get much out of them do you know where they are how they are not all the details no but i can give you a general picture jenny sipped some tea and took out her notebook okay im ready so what do you think of lucy payne banks asked dc winsome jackman as they walked along north market street on their way to talk to leanne wrays parents winsome paused before answering banks noticed several people gawk at her as they walked she knew she was a token minority she had told banks when he interviewed her brought in to fulfill a quota demanded in the aftermath of the stephen lawrence case there were to be more police officers from minorities the ruling stated even in communities where those minorities were to all extent nonexistent like west indians in the yorkshire dales but she also told him she didnt care about the tokenism and shed do a damn good job anyway banks didnt doubt her for a moment winsome was acc mclaughlins golden girl set for accelerated promotion and all its blessings shed probably be a superintendent before she was thirtyfive and banks liked her she was easygoing had a wicked sense of humor and she didnt let the race thing get in the way of doing her job even when other people tried to put it in the way he knew nothing about her personal life except that she enjoyed both climbing and spelunking the very thought of which gave banks a severe case of the heebiejeebies and that she lived in a flat on the fringe of the eastvale student area whether she had a boyfriend or a girlfriend banks had no idea i think she might have been protecting her husband winsome said she knew or she suspected and she kept quiet maybe she didnt even admit it to herself do you think she was involved i dont know i dont think so i think she was attracted to the dark side especially the sex but id pull up short of assuming she was involved weird yes but a killer remember kathleen murray died of ligature strangulation banks said but lucy was only twelve then makes you think though doesnt it isnt the house just down here yes they turned off north market on to a grid of narrow streets opposite the community center where sandra used to work seeing the place and remembering the times he dropped in on her there or waited to pick her up after work to go to a play or a film made banks feel a pang of loss but it passed sandra was gone now far far away from the wife he used to have they found the house not at all far from the old ship maybe ten or fifteen minutes walk and most of it along the busy welllit stretch of north market street with its shops and pubs and banks knocked at the front door the first thing that assailed his senses as christopher wray opened the door was the smell of fresh paint when banks and winsome stepped inside he saw why the wrays were redecorating all the wallpaper in the hallway had been stripped and mr wray was painting the livingroom ceiling cream the furniture was covered with sheets im sorry for the mess he apologized shall we go in the kitchen have you found leanne yet no not yet said banks they followed him through to the small kitchen where he put the kettle on without even asking if they wanted a cup of tea they all sat at the small kitchen table and for the short time it took the kettle to boil mr wray chatted on about the redecoration as if determined to avoid the real subject of their visit finally tea made and poured banks decided it was time to steer things around to the subject of leanne i must say he began that were at a bit of a loss oh as you know our men have been working at the payne house for days now theyve recovered six bodies four of which have been identified but none of the six is your daughters theyre running out of places to look does that mean leanne might still be alive wray asked a gleam of hope in his eyes its possible banks admitted though ive got to say after all this time without contact especially given the nationwide appeals on tv and in the press i wouldnt hold out a lot of hope then what thats what wed like to find out i dont see how i can help you perhaps you cant banks said but the only thing to do when a case is stalled like this is to go right back to first principles weve got to go over the ground we covered before and hope we see it from a new perspective this time wrays wife victoria appeared in the doorway and looked puzzled to see banks and winsome enjoying a chat and a cup of tea with her husband wray jumped up i thought you were resting dear he said giving her a peck on the cheek victoria wiped the sleep from her eyes though she looked to banks as if she had spent at least a few minutes putting on her face before coming down her skirt and blouse were pure harvey nichols and her accent was what she thought sounded like upper class though he could hear traces of birmingham in it she was an attractive woman in her early thirties with a slim figure and a full head of shiny naturalbrown hair that hung over her shoulders she had a slightly retroussé nose arched eyebrows and a small mouth but the effect of the whole was rather more successful than one might imagine from the separate parts wray himself was about forty and pretty much medium in whatever category you might describe him except for the chin which slid down toward his throat before it even got started they were an odd couple banks remembered thinking from the first time he had met them he was a rather basic downtoearth bus driver and she was an affected social climber what had drawn them together in the first place banks had no idea except perhaps that people who have suffered a great loss as christopher wray had might not necessarily be the best judges of their next move victoria stretched sat down and poured herself a cup of tea how are you feeling her husband asked not bad you know youve got to be careful in your condition the doctor said so i know i know she squeezed his hand ill be careful what conditions that banks asked my wifes expecting a baby superintendent wray beamed banks looked at victoria congratulations he said she inclined her head in a queenly manner banks could hardly imagine victoria wray going through anything as messy and painful as childbirth but life was full of surprises how long he asked she patted her stomach almost four months so you were pregnant when leanne went missing yes as a matter of fact id just found out that morning what did leanne think of it victoria looked down into her teacup leanne could be willful and moody superintendent she said she certainly wasnt quite as ecstatic as we hoped she would be now come on love thats not fair said mr wray shed have got used to it in time im certain she would banks thought about the situation leannes mother dies a slow and painful death from cancer shortly afterward her father remarries to a woman leanne clearly cant stand not long after that the stepmother announces shes pregnant you didnt need to be a psychologist to see that there was a situation ripe for disaster it was a bit close to the bone for banks too though he had hardly been in leannes position still whether its your father having a baby with your new stepmother or your estranged wife having one with the bearded sean the resulting feelings could be similar perhaps even more intense in leannes case given her age and her grief over her mother so she wasnt happy with the news not really mr wray admitted but it takes time to get used to things like that you have to be at least willing to try first said victoria leannes too selfish for that leanne was willing mr wray insisted when did you tell her banks asked the morning of the day she disappeared he sighed why didnt you tell us this when we interviewed you after leannes disappearance mr wray looked surprised nobody asked it didnt seem important i mean it was a private family matter besides said victoria its bad luck to tell strangers until after three months were they really so thick or were they just playing at it banks wondered trying to keep his tone as calm and neutral as possible reminding himself that they were the parents of a missing girl he asked what did she say the wrays looked at each other say nothing really did she dear said mr wray acted up is what she did said victoria was she angry i suppose so said mr wray angry enough to punish you what do you mean listen mr wray banks said when you told us that leanne was missing and we couldnt find her within a day or two we were all of us willing to think the worst now what youve just told us puts a different light on things it does if she was angry at you over her stepmothers pregnancy then she might easily have run away to strike back but leanne wouldnt run away mr wray said slackjawed she loved me maybe thats the problem banks said he didnt know if it was called the electra complex but he was thinking of the female version of the oedipus complex girl loves her father then her mother dies but instead of devoting himself to her the father finds a new woman and to make things worse he makes her pregnant threatening the entire stability of their relationship he could easily see leanne doing a bunk under circumstances like that but the problem still remained that she would have to be a very uncaring child indeed not to let them know she was still alive after all the hue and cry about the missing girls and she wouldnt have got far without her money and her inhaler i think shed probably be capable of it said victoria she could be cruel remember that time when she put castor oil in the coffee the evening of my first bookclub meeting caroline opley was sick all over her margaret atwood but that was early days love mr wray protested it all took a bit of getting used to for her i know im only saying and she didnt value things as she should have she lost that silver do you think she might have at least been angry enough to disobey her curfew banks asked certainly answered victoria without missing a beat its that boy you should be talking to that ian scott hes a drug dealer you know did leanne take drugs not to our knowledge said mr wray but she could have done chris his wife went on she obviously didnt tell us everything did she who knows what she got up to when she was with those sorts of people christopher wray put his hand over his wifes dont get excited love remember what the doctor said i know victoria stood up she swayed a little i think i need to go and lie down again for a while she said but you mark my words superintendent thats the one you should be looking at ian scott hes no good thank you said banks ill bear that in mind when shed gone the silence stretched for a while is there anything else you can tell us banks asked no no im sure she wouldnt do what you say im sure something must have happened to her why did you wait until morning to call the police had she done that sort of thing before never i would have told you if i thought that so why did you wait i wanted to call earlier come on mr wray said winsome touching his arm gently you can tell us he looked at her his eyes beseeching seeking forgiveness i would have called the police honest i would he said she had never stayed out all night before but youd had an argument hadnt you banks suggested when she reacted badly to the news of your wifes pregnancy she asked me how could i so soon after after her mother she was upset crying saying terrible things about victoria things she didnt mean but victoria told her to get out if she wanted and said she could stay out why didnt you tell us this at the time banks asked though he knew the answer embarrassment that great social fear something victoria wray would certainly be sensitive to and not wanting the police involved in your private family arguments the only way they had found out about the tension between victoria and leanne in the first place was through leannes friends and leanne clearly hadnt had time or chance to tell them about victorias pregnancy victoria wray was the kind of woman banks thought who would make the police use the tradesmans entrance if they had a tradesmans entrance and the fact that they didnt was probably an unbearable thorn in her side there were tears in mr wrays eyes i couldnt he said i just couldnt we thought it was as you said that perhaps she had stayed out all night to spite us to demonstrate her anger but no matter what superintendent leanne isnt a bad girl she would have come back in the morning im certain of that banks stood up may we have another look at her room mr wray there may be something we missed wray looked puzzled yes of course but i mean its been redone theres nothing there you redecorated leannes room winsome said he looked at her yes we couldnt stand it with her gone the memories and now with the new baby on the way what about her clothes winsome asked we gave them to the oxfam shop her books belongings them too winsome shook her head banks asked may we have a peek anyway they went upstairs wray was right not an object remained that indicated the room had ever belonged to a teenager like leanne wray the tiny dresser bedside drawers and matching wardrobe were all gone as was her bed with the quilt bedspread little bookcase the few dolls left over from her childhood even the carpet was gone and the pop star posters had been ripped off the walls nothing remained banks could hardly believe his eyes he could understand how people want to escape unpleasant memories dont like being reminded of someone theyve loved and lost but all this just over a month after their daughters disappearance and without her body having been found thank you he said indicating for winsome to follow him down the stairs isnt that weird she said when theyd got outside makes you think doesnt it think what winsome that maybe leanne did go home that night and that maybe when they heard we were digging up the paynes garden mr wray decided it was time for redecoration hmm said banks maybe youre right or maybe people just have different ways of showing their grief either way i think well be looking a bit more closely at the wrays over the next few days you can start by talking to their neighbors see if theyve seen or heard anything unusual after her chat with maureen nesbitt jenny decided to visit spurn head itself before heading for home maybe a good long walk would help her think things over blow the cobwebs away maybe it would also help her get rid of the eerie feeling she had had since alderthorpe that she was being watched or followed she couldnt explain it but every time she turned suddenly to look over her shoulder she felt rather than saw something slip into the shadows it was irritating because she couldnt quite grasp whether she was being paranoid or whether it was a case of just because she was paranoid it didnt mean someone wasnt following her she was still feeling it jenny paid her entrance fee and drove slowly along the narrow track to the car park noticing an old lighthouse half under water and guessing that the sands had shifted since it was built and left it stranded there jenny walked down to the beach the place wasnt quite as desolate as she had imagined it to be just ahead on a platform a little way out to sea attached to the mainland by a narrow wooden bridge were a dock and control center for the humber pilots who guided the big tankers in from the north sea behind her stood the new lighthouse and a number of houses across the estuary jenny could see the docks and cranes of grimsby and immingham though the sun was shining there was quite a breeze and jenny felt the chill as she walked the sands around the point the sea was an odd combination of colors purple brown lavender everything but blue even in the sun there werent many people around most of those who visited the area were serious birders and the place was a protected wildlife sanctuary even so jenny saw a couple or two walking hand in hand and one family with two small children as she walked she still couldnt shake off the feeling of being followed when the first tanker came around the head it took her breath away because of the sharp curve the huge shape seemed to appear there suddenly moving very fast and it filled her field of vision for a few moments then one of the pilot boats nearby guided it over the estuary toward immingham docks another tanker followed only moments later as jenny stood on the sand looking out over the broad waters she thought of what maureen nesbitt had told her about the alderthorpe seven tom godwin lucys younger brother had stayed with his foster parents until he was eighteen like lucy then he had gone to live with distant relatives in australia all thoroughly checked out by the social services and he now worked on their sheep farm in new south wales by all accounts tom was a sturdy quiet sort of boy given to long walks alone and a sort of shyness that made him stutter in front of strangers often he woke up screaming from nightmares he couldnt remember laura lucys sister was living in edinburgh where she was studying medicine at the university hoping to become a psychiatrist maureen said laura was welladjusted on the whole after years of therapy but there was still a timidity and reticence about her that might make it hard for her to face some of the more human challenges of her chosen profession there was no doubt she was a brilliant and skilled pupil but whether she could handle the daily pressures of psychiatry was another matter of the three surviving murray children susan had committed suicide tragically at the age of thirteen dianne was in a sort of halfway house for the mentally disturbed suffering from severe sleep disorders and terrifying hallucinations keith like laura was also a student though maureen reckoned he would be about graduation age by now he had gone to the university of durham to study history and english he was still seeing a psychiatrist regularly and suffered from bouts of depression and anxiety attacks especially in confined places but he managed to function and do well in his studies and that was it the sad legacy of alderthorpe such blighted lives jenny wondered if banks wanted her to continue now that hed let lucy go maureen nesbitt had said her best bets were clearly keith murray and laura godwin and as keith lived closer to eastvale she decided she would try to reach him first but was there any more point to it all she had to admit that she hadnt found any psychological evidence that significantly strengthened the case against lucy she felt every bit as inadequate as many officers on the task force thought all offender profilers were anyway lucy could have sustained the kind of psychological damage that made her a compliant victim of terence paynes but there again she might not have different people subjected to the same horrors often go in completely different directions perhaps lucy was truly a strong personality strong enough to put the past behind her and get on with life jenny doubted that anyone had the strength to avoid at least some kind of psychological fallout from the events in alderthorpe but it was possible to heal at least partially over time and to function on some level as tom laura and keith had also demonstrated they might be the walking wounded but at least they were still walking when jenny had covered half the circle of the head she cut back through the long grass to the car park and set off down the narrow track as she went she noticed a blue citroën in her rearview mirror and felt certain that she had seen it somewhere before telling herself to stop being so paranoid she left the head and drove toward patrington when shed got closer to the edges of hull she called banks on her mobile he answered on the third ring jenny where are you hull on my way home find out anything interesting plenty but im not sure that it gets us any further ill try to put it all together into some sort of profile if you want please i just heard you had to let lucy payne go thats right we got her out of a side exit without too much fuss and her lawyer drove her straight to hull they did some shopping in the city center then julia ford the lawyer dropped lucy off at the liversedges they welcomed her with open arms thats where she is now far as i know the local police are keeping an eye on her for us where else can she go where indeed said jenny does this mean its over what my job no said banks nothings over yet after jenny had hung up she checked her rearview mirror again the blue citroën was keeping its distance allowing three of four other cars between them but there was no doubt it was still back there on her tail annie have you ever thought of having children banks felt annie tense beside him in bed they had just made love and were basking in the aftermath the gentle rushing of the falls outside the occasional night animal calling from the woods and van morrisons astral weeks drifting up from the stereo downstairs i dont mean well not now i mean not you and me but ever annie lay still and silent for a while he felt her relax a little and stir against him finally she said why do you ask i dont know its been on my mind this case the poor devils in the murray and godwin families all the missing girls not much more than kids really and the wrays her being pregnant and sandra he thought but he hadnt told annie about that yet i cant say as i have annie answered never maybe i got shortchanged when it came to handing out the maternal instinct i dont know or maybe its to do with my own past anyway it never came up your past ray the commune my mother dying so young but you said you were happy enough i was annie sat up and reached for the glass of wine she had put on the bedside table her small breasts glowed in the dim light smooth skin sloping down to the dark brown areolas slightly upturned where the nipples rose then why good lord alan surely its not every womans duty in life to reproduce or to analyze why she doesnt want to im not a freak you know i know sorry banks sipped some of his wine lay back against the pillows its just well i had a bit of a shock the other day thats all what sandra what about her shes pregnant there hed done it he didnt know why it should have been so difficult or why he had the sharp sudden feeling that he would have been wiser to have kept his mouth closed he also wondered why he had told jenny straight away but delayed so long before telling annie partly it was because jenny knew sandra of course but there was more to it than that annie didnt seem to like the intimacy implied by details of bankss life and she had sometimes made him feel that sharing any part of his past was a burden to her but he couldnt seem to help himself since splitting up with sandra he had become far more introspective and examined his life much more closely he saw little point in being with someone if he couldnt share some of that at first annie said nothing then she asked why didnt you tell me before i dont know how did you hear the news from tracy when we went to lunch in leeds so sandra didnt tell you herself you know as well i do we dont communicate much still i wouldve thought something like this banks scratched his cheek well it just goes to show doesnt it annie sipped more wine show what how far apart weve grown you seem upset by this alan not really not upset so much as disturbed perhaps why just the thought of it of tracy and brian having a little brother or sister of of what i was just thinking banks said turning toward her i mean its something i havent thought about in years denied it i suppose but this has brought it all back all what back the miscarriage annie froze for a moment then said sandra had a miscarriage yes when was that oh years ago when we were living in london the kids were small too small to understand what happened i was working undercover at the time drugs squad you know what its like away for weeks at a time cant contact your family it was two days before my boss let me know annie nodded banks knew that she understood about the pressures and stresses of undercover work firsthand a knowledge of the job and its effects was one of the things they had in common how did it happen who knows the kids were at school she started bleeding thank god we had a helpful neighbor or who knows what might have happened and you blame yourself for not being there she could have died annie and we lost the baby everything might have gone just fine if id been there like any other fathertobe helping out around the place but sandra had to do everything for crying out loud all the lifting shopping odd jobs fetching and carrying she was replacing a lightbulb when she first started to feel funny she could have fallen and broken her neck banks reached for a cigarette he didnt usually indulge in the one after for annies sake but this time he felt like it he still asked is it okay go ahead i dont mind annie sipped more wine but thanks for asking you were saying banks lit up and the smoke drifted away toward the halfopen window guilt yes but more than that what do you mean i was working drugs like i said spending most of my time on the streets or in filthy squats trying to get a lead to the big guys from their victims kids for the most part runaways stoned high tripping zonked out whatever you care to call it some of them as young as ten or eleven half of them couldnt even tell you their own names or wouldnt i dont know if you remember but it was around the time the aids scare was growing nobody knew for sure yet how bad it was but there was a lot of scaremongering and everyone knew you got it through blood from unprotected sex mostly anal sex and through sharing needles thing was you lived in fear you just didnt know if some smalltime dealer was going to lunge at you with a dirty needle or if some junkies drool on your hand could give you aids i do know what you mean alan though it was a bit before my time as a copper but im not following what has it got to do with sandras miscarriage banks sucked in some smoke felt it burn on the way down and thought he ought to try stopping again probably nothing but im just trying to give you some sense of the life i was living i was in my early thirties with a wife and two kids another on the way and i was spending my life in squalor hanging out with scum my own kids probably wouldnt have recognized me if theyd seen me in the street the kids i saw were either dead or dying i was a cop not a social worker i mean i tried sometimes you know if i thought there was a chance a kid might listen give up the life and go home but that wasnt my job i was there to get information and to track down the big players and well its just that it has an effect on you thats all it changes you warps you alters your attitudes you start out thinking youre an ordinary decent family man just doing a tough job and you end up not really knowing what you are anyway my first thought when i heard sandra was okay but that shed had a miscarriage know what my first feeling was relief said annie banks stared at her what made you say that she gave him a small smile common sense its what id feel i mean if id been in your boots banks stubbed out the cigarette he felt somehow deflated that his big revelation had seemed so obvious to annie he swirled some red wine around in his mouth to wash away the taste of smoke van morrison was well into madame george riffing on the words a cat howled in the woods maybe the one that came for milk sometimes anyway he went on thats what i felt relief and of course i felt guilty not for just not being there but for being almost glad it happened and relieved that we wouldnt have to go through it all again the dirty nappies the lack of sleep not that i was getting much sleep anyway the extra responsibility here was one life i didnt have to protect here was one extra responsibility i could easily live without its not such an uncommon feeling you know said annie its not so terrible either it doesnt make you a monster i felt like one thats because you take too much on yourself you always do youre not responsible for all the worlds ills and sins not even a fraction of them so alan banks is human he isnt perfect so he feels relief when he thinks he should feel grief do you think youre the only one thats happened to i dont know i havent asked anyone else well youre not you just have to learn to live with your imperfections like you do annie smiled and flicked a little wine at him luckily she was drinking white what imperfections you cheeky bastard anyway after that we decided no more kids and we never talked about it again but youve carried the guilt around ever since yes i suppose so i mean i dont think about it very often but this brought it all back and do you know what else what i loved the job more i never for a moment thought of giving it all up and becoming a usedcar salesman annie laughed just as well i cant imagine you as the usedcarsalesman type or something else something with regular hours less chance of catching aids annie reached out and stroked his cheek poor alan she said snuggling closer why dont you just try to put it all out of your mind just put everything out of your mind everything except the moment me the music the here and now van was getting into the meandering sensuous ballerina and banks felt annies lips soft and moist running over his chest down his stomach lingering and he managed to do as she said when she reached her destination but even as he gave himself up to the sensation of the moment he still couldnt quite get the thought of dead babies out of his mind maggie checked the locks and the windows for the second time before going to bed that saturday night and only when she was satisfied that all was secure did she take a glass of warm milk upstairs with her she had hardly got halfway up when the telephone rang at first she wasnt going to answer it not at eleven oclock on a saturday night it was probably a wrong number anyway but curiosity got the better of her she knew that the police had been forced to let lucy go that morning so it might be she looking for help it wasnt it was bill maggies heart started to beat fast and she felt the room closing in on her youre creating quite a stir over there arent you he said heroine and champion of battered wives everywhere or is that championess maggie felt herself shrinking shriveling her heart squeezing into her throat all her bravado her empowerment withered and died she could hardly talk hardly breathe what do you want she whispered how did you find out you underestimate your celebrity youre not only in the globe and the post youre in the sun and the star too even a picture in the sun though its not a very good one unless youve changed a hell of a lot theyve been giving quite a bit of coverage to the chameleon case as they call it comparing it to bernardo and homolka naturally and you seem to be caught right up in the thick of it what do you want want me nothing how did you find me after the newspaper stories it wasnt difficult you had an old address book you forgot to take with you your friends were in it thirtytwo the hill leeds am i right what do you want with me nothing not at the moment anyway i just wanted to let you know that i know where you are and im thinking of you it must have been very interesting living across the street from a killer whats karla like its lucy leave me alone thats not very nice we were married once remember how could i forget bill laughed anyway mustnt run up the firms phone bill too much ive been working very hard lately and even my boss thinks i need a holiday just thought id let you know i might be taking a trip over to england soon i dont know when might be next week might be next month but i think itd be nice if we could get together for dinner or something dont you youre sick maggie said and heard bill chuckling as she hung up banks had always thought that sunday morning was a good time to put a little pressure on an unsuspecting villain sunday afternoon was good too after the papers the pub and the roast beef and yorkshire pud have put him in a good mood and he was stretched out in the armchair newspaper over his head enjoying a little snooze but on sunday morning if they werent particularly religious people were either relaxed and all set to enjoy a day off or they were hung over either way made for a good chat ian scott was definitely hungover his oily black hair stood in spikes on top and lay flat at the sides plastered to his skull where he had lain on the pillow one side of his pasty face was etched with crease marks his eyes were bloodshot and he wore only a grubby vest and underpants can i come in ian said banks pushing gently past him before he got an answer wont take long the flat reeked of last nights marijuana smoke and stale beer roaches still lay scattered in the ashtrays banks went over and opened the window as wide as it would go shame on you ian he said a lovely spring morning like this you ought to be out walking down by the river or having a crack at fremlington edge bollocks said ian scratching those very items as he spoke sarah francis stumbled in from the bedroom holding her tousled hair back from her face and squinting through sleepgummed eyes she was wearing a white tshirt with donald duck on the front and nothing else the tshirt only came down to her hips shit she said covering herself with her hands as best she could and dashing back into the bedroom enjoy the free show said ian not particularly banks tossed a heap of clothes from the chair nearest the window and sat down ian turned on the stereo too loud and banks got up and turned it off ian sat down and sulked and sarah came back in wearing a pair of jeans you could have bloody warned me she grumbled to ian shut up you silly cunt he said now sarah sat down and sulked too okay said banks are we all comfortable can i begin i dont know what you want with us again said ian we told you everything that happened well it wont do any harm to go over it again will it ian groaned i dont feel well i feel sick you should treat your body with more respect said banks its a temple what do you want to know get it over with first off im puzzled by something well youre the sherlock im sure you can work it out im puzzled by why you havent asked me about leanne what do you mean id hardly be back here interrupting your sunday morning would i if leanne had turned up dead and buried in a serial killers garden what are you saying speak english sarah had curled herself somehow into a fetal position in the other armchair and was watching the exchange intently what im saying ian is that you didnt ask about leanne that concerns me dont you care about her she was a mate thats all but its nothing to do with us we dont know what happened to her besides idve got around to it eventually my brains not working properly yet does it ever anyway im beginning to think you do do what know something about what happened to leanne thats rubbish is it really lets back up a bit first off were pretty certain now that leanne wray wasnt one of the chameleons victims as we had first thought your mistake isnt it said ian dont come looking to us to bail you out now if thats not the case then it stands to reason that something else happened to her you dont need to be a sherlock to figure that one out which discounting the possibility of another stranger killing leaves three possibilities oh yeah and what are those banks counted off on his fingers one that she ran away from home two that she did go home on time and her parents did something to her and three the main reason im here that she didnt in fact go home after you left the old ship that the three of you stayed together and you did something to her ian scott showed no expression but scorn as he listened and sarah started sucking on her thumb we told you what happened ian said we told you what we did yes said banks but the riverboat was so busy the people we talked to were very vague about seeing you they certainly werent sure about the time and werent even sure it was that friday night but youve got the cctv for fucks sake whats big brother watching for if you cant believe what you see oh we believe what we see all right said banks but all we see is you sarah here and mick blair entering the bar none shortly after halfpast twelve well theres no point going earlier things dont start to warm up till after midnight yes ian but that leaves over two hours unaccounted for a lot can happen in two hours how was i to know id have to account for my every minute two hours i told you we walked around town a bit dropped in at the riverboat then went to the bar none i dont know what fucking time it was sarah sarah took her thumb from her mouth what he says is that how it usually goes banks asked what ian says havent you got a mind of your own what he says we went to the riverboat then to the bar none leanne left us just before halfpast ten outside the old ship we dont know what happened to her after that and mick blair went with you yeah how did leanne seem that night sarah uh what sort of mood was she in all right i suppose she wasnt upset about anything no we were having a good time leanne didnt confide anything in you like what oh i dont know some problem with her stepmother perhaps she was always having problems with that stuckup bitch i was sick of hearing about them did she ever talk about running off not to me not that i remember ian nah she just whined about the old cow thats all she hadnt the bottle to run away if i was looking at somebody for it id look at the stepmother first somebody for what you know if you think someone did something to leanne like i see what was the idea that excited you all before you left the old ship i dont know what you mean said ian oh come on we know you seemed excited by something you were going to do what was it did it include leanne we talked about going to the bar none but leanne knew she couldnt come with us thats all what else could there be she didnt give you any hint that she might not be going straight home no or that she might run off teach her stepmother a lesson dunno who can tell whats in a bitchs mind when it comes right down to it hey tuttut such language youve been listening to too much hiphop ian said banks standing to leave nice choice of partner sarah he said on his way out noticing that sarah francis looked distinctly put out and more to the point even a little frightened that might come in useful before too long he thought i just had to get out of the flat thats all said janet taylor i mean i didnt want to drag you halfway across yorkshire thats all right said annie with a smile i dont live that far away besides i like it here here was a rambling old pub on the edge of the moorland above wensleydale not far from bankss cottage with a solid reputation for sunday lunch janets call had come shortly after ten oclock that morning just as annie was having a nap to make up for her lack of sleep at bankss place their conversation had bothered her kept her awake well into the small hours she didnt like talking about babies trust banks to hit a nerve what she also didnt like and didnt seem able to tell him about these personal revelations of his was that they pushed her into examining her own past and her own feelings far more than she felt ready to do right now she wished he would just lighten up and take it easy anyway an openair lunch was just the ticket the air was pure and there wasnt a cloud in the sky from where they sat she could see the lush green dalesides crisscrossed with drystone walls sheep wandering all over baaing like crazy if any ramblers passed by down in the valley bottom the river meandered and a group of cottages huddled around a village green the squaretowered church a little to one side gray limestone bright in the midday sun she thought she could see the tiny silhouettes of four people walking along the top of the high limestone scar over the dale christ it would be good to be up there all alone not a care in the world but if the setting was ideal she might have chosen a different companion despite the change of environment janet seemed distracted forever flicking back the lock of hair that fell over her tired brown eyes there was an unhealthy pallor about her that annie guessed would take more than a lunch on the moors to dispel already janet was on her second pint of lager and lime and annie had to bite her tongue not to say something about drink driving she was on her first half of bitter might have another half then coffee after lunch annie who was a vegetarian had ordered quiche and a salad but she was pleased to see that janet had ordered roast lamb she looked as if she needed some meat on her bones how are you doing annie asked janet laughed oh about as well as can be expected she rubbed her forehead i still cant get the sleep thing sorted out you know i keep replaying it but im not sure if im seeing it the way it really happened what do you mean well in the replays i see his face terry paynes yes all twisted and contorted fearsome but i dont think i remember seeing him clearly at the time my mind must be filling in details possibly annie thought of her own ordeal the rape carried out by three colleagues after celebrating her passing her sergeants boards at the time she could have sworn she would remember every grunt and groan every obscene facial expression and every sensation of him the one who actually succeeded in penetrating her while the others held her down forcing himself inside her as she struggled tearing at her clothes every drop of sweat that dripped from his face on to her skin but she was surprised to find that much of it had faded and it wasnt a memory she felt compelled to rerun for herself night after night perhaps she was tougher than she thought or maybe she was compartmentalizing it as someone had once told her she did shutting out the pain and humiliation youve changed your mind about the statement then annie asked they were sitting far enough away that they couldnt be overheard if they spoke quietly not that any of the other diners looked as if they wanted to eavesdrop they were all family groups talking loudly and laughing trying to keep track of their adventurous children i wasnt lying said janet i want you to know that first off i know that i was just confused thats all my memory of that nights a bit shaky understandable but you do remember how many times you hit him no all im saying is that it might have been more than i thought their meals arrived janet tucked in as if she hadnt eaten in a week which she probably hadnt and annie picked at her food the quiche was dry and the salad boring but that was to be expected in a place that catered mostly for meateaters at least she could enjoy the view a high plane left a figure eight of white vapor trail across the sky janet annie went on what do you want to change in your statement well you know where i insisted i only hit him what two or three times four whatever and the postmortem found how many nine blows right do you remember hitting him nine times no thats not what im saying janet sawed off a piece of lamb and chewed on it for a moment annie ate some lettuce what are you saying janet just that well i suppose i lost it thats all youre claiming diminished responsibility not really i mean i knew what was going on but i was scared and i was upset about dennis so i just i dont know maybe i should have stopped hitting him sooner after id handcuffed him to the pipes you hit him after that i think so once or twice and you remember doing that i remember hitting him after id handcuffed him yes thinking this ones for dennis you bastard i just dont remember how many times you realize youll have to come to the station and revise your statement dont you i mean its okay just telling me here now like this but it has to be done officially janet raised an eyebrow of course i know that im still a copper arent i i just wanted you know she looked away out over the dale annie thought she did know and that janet was too embarrassed to say it she wanted some company she wanted someone who would at least try to understand her in a gorgeous setting on a beautiful day before the threeringed circus that was likely to be her life for the next while went into full swing jenny fuller and banks had lunch together in the slightly less exotic queens arms the place was bursting at the seams with sunday tourists but they bagged a small table so small there was hardly room for two roast beef and yorkshire pud specials and the drinks just before they stopped serving meals at two oclock lager for jenny and a pint of shandy for banks because he had to conduct another interview that afternoon he still looked tired jenny thought and she guessed that the case had been keeping him awake at nights that and his obvious discomfort over sandras pregnancy jenny and sandra had been friends not close but both had been through harrowing experiences around the same time and these had created some sort of bond between them since her travels in america though jenny hadnt seen much of sandra and now she supposed she wouldnt see her again if she had to choose sides as people did then she supposed she had chosen alans she had thought he and sandra had a solid marriage after all alan had turned her down when she tried to seduce him and that had been a new experience for her but clearly she was wrong never having been married herself she would have been the first to confess that she knew little about such things except that outward appearances often belie an inner turmoil so what had been going through sandras mind in that last little while was a mystery alan had said that he wasnt sure whether sandra met sean before or after they split up or whether he was the real reason behind the separation jenny doubted it like most problems it hadnt just happened overnight or when someone else turned up on the scene sean was as much a symptom as anything and an escape hatch this business had probably been years in the making the car banks said a blue citroën yes i dont suppose you got the number i must admit it never crossed my mind the first time i saw it i mean why would i it was in alderthorpe and i parked behind it coming back from spurn head it always stayed too far behind for me to be able to see and you lost it where i didnt lose it i noticed it stopped following me just after i got on to the m west of hull and you never saw it again no jenny laughed i must admit i felt rather as if i was being run out of town you know like in those cowboy films you didnt get a glimpse of the driver at all no couldnt even tell if it was a man or a woman what next ive some university work to catch up on and some tutorials tomorrow i could postpone them but no thats okay said banks lucy paynes out anyway no real rush well on tuesday or wednesday ill see if i can talk to keith murray in durham then theres laura in edinburgh im developing a picture of linda lucy but its still missing a few pieces such as thats the problem im not sure i just get the feeling that im missing something she saw bankss worried expression and slapped his arm oh dont worry ill not go putting my intuitions into my profiles this is just between you and me okay i suppose you could call it the missing link the link between lindas childhood and the possibility of lucys being involved in the abductions and murders theres the sexual abuse yes theres no doubt that many people who were abused become abusers themselves its a cycle and according to maureen nesbitt linda was sexually aware at eleven but none of thats enough in itself all i can say is that it could have created a psychopathology in lucy that made her capable of becoming the compliant victim of a man like terence payne people often repeat mistakes and bad choices you just have to look at my history of relationships to see that banks smiled youll get it right one day meet my knight in shining armor is that what you want someone to fight your battles for you then pick you up and carry you upstairs its not a bad idea and i thought you were a feminist i am it doesnt mean i might not fight his battles pick him up and carry him upstairs the next day all im saying is that chance would be a fine thing anyway cant a woman have her fantasies depends where they lead has it occurred to you that lucy payne wasnt the compliant victim at all and that her husband was no it hasnt ive never come across such a case but not impossible in human psychology nothings impossible just very unlikely thats all but supposing she were the powerful one the dominant partner and terence payne was her sex slave doing her bidding something like that i dont know said jenny but i very much doubt it besides even if it is true it doesnt really get us any further does it i suppose not just speculation you mentioned that payne might have used a camcorder when you visited the cellar didnt you yes jenny sipped some lager and dabbed her lips with a paper serviette it would be highly unusual in such a ritualized case of rape murder and interment for the perpetrator not to keep some sort of record he had the bodies his trophies yes and that probably explains why there was no further mutilation no need to take a finger or a toe to remember them by payne had the whole body but its not just that someone like payne would have needed more something that enabled him to relive the events banks told her about the tripod marks and the electronics catalog so if he had one where is it she asked thats the question and why is it missing another good question believe me were looking hard for it if its in that house even if its buried ten feet down well find out we wont leave a brick of that place standing until its given up all its secrets if its in the house yes and therell be tapes too i havent forgotten them jenny pushed her plate aside i suppose id better go and get some work done banks looked at his watch and id better go see mick blair he reached forward and touched her arm lightly she was surprised at the tingle she felt take care jenny keep your eyes open and if you see that car again phone me right away understand jenny nodded then she noticed someone she didnt know approaching them walking with an easy confident grace an attractive young woman tight jeans emphasizing her long and shapely legs what looked like a mans white shirt hanging open over a red tshirt chestnut hair cascaded in shiny waves to her shoulders and the only flaw on her smooth complexion was a small mole to the right of her mouth even that wasnt so much an imperfection as a beauty spot her serious eyes were almond in shape and color when she got to the table she pulled up a chair and sat down without being invited ds cabbot she said stretching out her hand i dont think weve met dr fuller jenny shook firm grasp ah the famous dr fuller a pleasure to meet you at last jenny felt tense was this woman surely the annie cabbot staking out her territory had she seen banks touching her arm and thought something of it was she here to let jenny know as subtly as possible to keep her hands off banks jenny knew she was not bad when it came to the looks department but she couldnt help feeling somehow clumsy and even a bit dowdy next to annie older too definitely older annie smiled at banks sir jenny could sense something between them sexual tension yes but it was more than that had they had a disagreement all of a sudden the table was uncomfortable and she felt she had to leave she picked up her bag and started rummaging for her car keys why did they always sink to the bottom and get lost among the hairbrushes paper hankies and makeup dont let me interrupt your lunch said annie smiling again at jenny then turning to banks but i just happened to be in the station catching up on some paperwork after lunch winsome told me you were here and that shed got a message for you i said id deliver it banks raised his eyebrows and its from your mate ken blackstone in leeds it seems lucy paynes done a runner jenny gasped what local police dropped by her parents house this morning just to make sure everything was okay turns out her bed hadnt been slept in bloody hell said banks another cockup just thought youd want to know as soon as possible said annie untangling herself from the chair she looked at jenny nice to meet you then she walked out with the same elegant grace she had walked in with leaving banks and jenny to sit and stare at each other mick blair the fourth person in the group on the night leanne wray disappeared lived with his parents in a semi in north eastvale near enough to the edge of town for a fine view over swainsdale but close enough to the center for easy access after annies revelation about lucy payne banks wondered whether he should change his plans but he decided that leanne wray was still a priority and lucy payne was still a victim in the eyes of the law besides there would be plenty of coppers keeping an eye open for her it was the most they could do until and unless they had anything to charge her with unlike ian scott mick had never been in trouble with the police though banks suspected he might well have been buying drugs from ian he had a slightly wasted look about him not quite all there and didnt seem to have much time for personal grooming when banks called after his lunch with jenny that sunday micks parents were out visiting family and mick was slouching around in the living room listening to nirvana loud on the stereo wearing torn jeans and a black tshirt with a picture of kurt cobain on it above his birth and death dates what do you want mick asked turning down the volume and flopping on to the sofa hands behind his head to talk about leanne wray weve already been over that lets go over it again why have you found out something new what would there be to find out i dont know im just surprised at your coming here thats all was leanne your girlfriend mick no it wasnt like that shes an attractive girl didnt you fancy her maybe a bit but she wasnt having any of it it was early days thats all what do you mean some girls need a bit of time a bit of working on they dont all just jump into bed with you the first time you meet and leanne needed time yes how far had you got what do you mean how far holding hands necking tongue or no tongue banks remembered his own adolescent gropings and the various stages you had to pass after necking usually came touching above the waist but with clothes on then under the blouse but over the bra after that the bra came off then it was below the waist and so on until you got to go all the way if you were lucky with some girls it seemed to take forever to move from one stage to another and some might let you get below the waist but not go all the way the whole negotiation was a minefield fraught with the danger of being dumped at every turn well at least leanne wray hadnt been an easy conquest and for some odd reason banks was glad to know that we necked once in a while what about that friday night the thirtyfirst of march nah we were in a group like with ian and sarah you didnt neck with leanne in the cinema maybe is that a yes or a no i suppose so might you have had a fallingout what are you getting at banks scratched the scar beside his right eye its like this mick i come here to talk to you again and it seems to bother you but you dont ask me if weve found leanne alive or found her body yet it was the same with ian youve talked to ian this morning im surprised he didnt get straight on the phone to you he cant have been very worried why should he be i dont know the thing is you see that you both ought to be asking me if weve found leanne alive or if weve found her body or if weve identified her remains why why else would i come to talk to you how should i know but the fact that you dont ask makes me wonder if you know something youre not telling me mick folded his arms ive told you everything i know banks leaned forward and held micks gaze know what i think youre lying mick i think youre all lying you cant prove anything what would i need to prove that im lying i told you what happened we went for a drink in the old no what you told us was that you went for coffee after the film right well that was lying wasnt it mick so what if you can do it once you can do it again in fact it gets easier the more you practice what really happened that night mick why dont you tell me about it nothing happened i already told you did you and leanne have a fight did you hurt her maybe you didnt mean to where is she mick you know im certain of it and micks expression told banks that he did know but it also told him that he wasnt going to confess to anything not today at any rate banks felt pissed off and culpable at the same time it was his fault that this line of inquiry hadnt been properly followed up so fixated had he become on a serial killer abducting young girls that he had ignored the basics of police work and not pushed hard enough at those in the position to know best what had happened to leanne the people she had been with at the time she disappeared he should have followed up knowing of ian scotts criminal record and that it involved drugs but no leanne was put down as the third victim of the unidentified serial killer another pretty young blond victim and that was that winsome jackman had done a bit of followup work but she had pretty much accepted the official story too bankss fault all of it just like sandras miscarriage just like bloody everything it seemed sometimes tell me what happened banks pushed again ive told you ive fucking told you mick sat up abruptly when we left the old ship leanne set off home that was the last any of us saw of her some pervert must have got her all right thats what you thought isnt it why are you changing your minds ah so you are curious banks said standing up im sure youve been following the news weve got the pervert who took and killed those girls hes dead so he cant tell us anything but we found no trace of leannes body on the premises and believe me weve taken the place apart then it mustve been some other pervert come off it mick the odds against one are wild enough the odds against two are astronomical no it comes down to you you ian and sarah the last people she was seen with now im going to give you time to think about it mick but ill be back you can count on that then well have a proper talk no distractions in the meantime stick around enjoy the music when banks left he paused just long enough at the garden gate to see mick silhouetted behind the lace curtains jump up from the sofa and head over to the telephone the mondaymorning sunlight spilled through bankss kitchen window and glinted on the copperbottomed pans hanging on the wall banks sat at his pine table with a cup of coffee toast and marmalade the morning newspaper spread out before him and vaughan williamss variations on a theme by thomas tallis playing on the radio but he was neither reading nor listening he had been awake since before four a million details dancing around in his mind and though he felt dogtired now he knew he couldnt sleep he would be glad when the chameleon case was all over when gristhorpe was back at work and when he could go back to his normal duties as detective chief inspector the responsibility of command over the past month and a half had exhausted him he recognized the signs lack of sleep bad dreams too much junk food too much booze and too many cigarettes he was reaching the same nearburnout state as he had been in when he left the met for north yorkshire years ago hoping for a quieter life he loved detective work but it sometimes seemed that modern policing was a young mans game science technology and changes in management structure hadnt simplified things they had only made life more complicated banks realized that he had probably come to the limits of his ambition when he actually thought that morning for the first time about packing in the job altogether he heard the postman arrive and went out to pick up the letters from the floor among the usual collection of bills and circulars there was a handaddressed envelope from london and banks immediately recognized the neat looping hand sandra heart beating just a little too fast for comfort he carried the pile back into the kitchen this was his favorite room in the cottage mostly because he had dreamed about it before he had seen it but what he read in sandras letter was enough to darken the brightest of rooms even more than his previous mood had darkened it dear alan i understand that tracy told you sean and i are expecting a baby i wish she hadnt but there it is its done now i hope this knowledge will at least enable you to understand the need for expediency in the matter of our divorce and that you will act accordingly yours sincerely sandra that was it nothing more than a cold formal note banks had to admit that he hadnt been responding to the matter of divorce with any great dispatch but he hadnt seen any need for haste perhaps he was even willing to admit deep down he was stubbornly clinging to sandra and in some opaque and frightened part of his soul he was holding to the belief that it was all just a nightmare or a mistake and he would wake up one morning back in the eastvale semi with sandra beside him not that that was what he wanted not anymore but he was at least willing to admit that he might harbor such irrational feelings now this banks put the letter aside still feeling its chill why couldnt he just let go of this and move on as sandra clearly had done was it because of what he had told annie about his guilt over sandras miscarriage about being glad that it happened he didnt know it all just felt too strange his wife of over twenty years mother of their children now about to give birth to another mans child he tossed the letter aside picked up his briefcase and headed out for the car he intended to go to leeds later in the morning but first he wanted to drop by his office clear up some paperwork and have a word with winsome the drive to eastvale from gratly was banks had thought when he first made it one of the most beautiful drives in the area a narrow road about halfway up the daleside with spectacular views of the valley bottom with its sleepy villages and meandering river to his left and the steeply rising fields with their drystone walls and wandering sheep to his right but today he didnt even notice all this partly because he did it so often and partly because his thoughts were still clouded by sandras letter and vague depression over his job after the chaos of the weekend the police station was back to its normal level of activity the reporters had disappeared just as lucy payne had banks wasnt overly concerned about lucys going missing he thought as he closed his office door and turned on the radio she would probably turn up again and even if she didnt there was no real cause for concern not unless they came up with some concrete evidence against her at least in the meantime they could keep track of her through atm withdrawals and credit card transactions no matter where she was she would need money after he had finished the paperwork banks went into the squad room dc winsome jackman was sitting at her desk chewing on the end of a pencil winsome he said remembering one of the details that had awoken him so early in the morning ive got another job for you and when hed told her what he wanted her to do he left by the back exit and set off for leeds it was just after lunch when annie entered the cps offices though she hadnt managed to grab a bite to eat herself yet the crown solicitor appointed to the case jack whitaker turned out to be younger than she had expected late twenties or early thirties she guessed prematurely balding and he spoke with a slight lisp his handshake was firm his palm just a little damp his office was certainly far tidier than stafford oakess in eastvale where every file was out of place and stained with an olympic symbol of coffee rings any new developments he asked after annie had sat down yes said annie pc taylor changed her statement this morning may i annie handed him janet taylors revised statement and whitaker read it over when hed finished he slid the papers over the desk back toward annie what do you think she asked i think jack whitaker said slowly that we might be charging janet taylor with murder what annie couldnt believe what shed just heard she acted as a policewoman in pursuit of her duty i was thinking justifiable homicide or at the very most excusable but murder whitaker sighed oh dear i dont suppose youve heard the news then what news annie hadnt turned on the radio when she drove down to leeds being far too preoccupied with janets case and her confused feelings about banks to concentrate on news or chat the jury came back on the john hadleigh case just before lunch you know the devon farmer i know about the hadleigh case what was the verdict guilty of murder jesus christ said annie but even so surely thats different entirely i mean hadleigh was civilian he shot a burglar in the back janet taylor whitaker held his hand up the point is that its a clear message given the hadleigh verdict we have to be seen to be acting fairly toward everyone we cant afford to have the press screaming at us for going easy on janet taylor just because shes a policewoman so it is political isnt it always justice must be seen to be done justice whitaker raised his eyebrows listen he said i can understand your sympathies believe me i can but according to her statement janet taylor handcuffed terence payne to a metal pipe after she had already subdued him then she hit him twice with her baton hard think about it annie thats deliberate thats murder she didnt necessarily mean to kill him there was no intent thats for a jury to decide a good prosecutor could argue that she knew damn well what the effect of two more hard blows to the head would be after shed already given him seven previous blows i cant believe im hearing this annie said no ones sorrier than i am said whitaker except janet taylor then she shouldnt have killed terence payne what the hell do you know you werent there in that cellar with your partner bleeding to death on the floor a dead girl staked out on a mattress you didnt have just seconds to react to a man coming at you with a machete this is a bloody farce its politics is all it is calm down annie said whitaker annie stood up and paced arms folded why should i i dont feel calm this woman has been going through hell i provoked her into changing her statement because i thought it would go better for her in the long run than saying she couldnt remember how does this make me look is that all youre concerned about how it makes you look of course its not annie lowered herself slowly back into the chair she still felt flushed and angry her breath coming in sharp gasps but it makes me look like a liar it makes it look as if i tricked her i dont like that you were only doing your job only doing my job only obeying orders right thanks that makes me feel a whole lot better look we might be able to get a bit of leeway here annie but therell have to be a trial itll all have to be a matter of public record aboveboard therell be no sweeping it under the table thats not what i had in mind anyway what leeway i dont suppose janet taylor would plead guilty to murder damn right she wouldnt and i wouldnt advise her to its not exactly a matter of advising besides thats not your job what do you think she would plead guilty to excusable homicide it wasnt selfdefense not when she crossed the line and delivered those final blows after payne was rendered incapable of defending himself or of attacking her further what then voluntary manslaughter how long would she have to serve between eighteen months and three years thats still a long time especially for a copper in jail not as long as john hadleigh hadleigh shot a kid in the back with a shotgun janet taylor beat a defenseless man about the head with a police baton causing his death he was a serial killer she didnt know that at the time but he came at her with a machete and after shed disarmed him she used more force than necessary to subdue him causing his death annie it doesnt matter that he was a serial killer it wouldnt matter if hed been jack the bloody ripper hed cut her partner she was upset well im certainly glad to hear she wasnt calm cool and collected when she did it you know what i mean theres no need for sarcasm sorry im sure the judge and jury will take the whole picture into account her state of mind annie sighed she felt sick as soon as this farce was over she was getting the hell out of complaints and discipline back to real police work catching the villains all right she said what next you know what next annie find janet taylor arrest her take her to the police station and charge her with voluntary manslaughter someone asking to see you sir why was the freshfaced pc who popped his head around the door of bankss temporary office at millgarth smirking banks wondered who is it he asked youd better see for yourself sir cant someone else deal with it she specifically asked to see someone in charge of the missing girls case sir area commander hartnells in wakefield with the acc and dci blackstones out that leaves you sir banks sighed all right show her in the pc smirked again and disappeared leaving a distinct sense of smirk still in the air rather like the cheshire cats smile a few moments later banks saw why she tapped very softly on his door and pushed it open so slowly that it creaked on its hinges then she appeared before him all five feet nothing of her she was anorexically thin and the harsh red of her lipstick and nail polish contrasted with the almost translucent paleness of her skin her delicate features looked as if they were made out of porcelain carefully glued or painted on her moonshaped face clutching a goldlamé handbag she was wearing a bright green crop top which stopped abruptly just below her breasts no more than goose pimples despite the pushup bra and showed a stretch of pale bare midriff and a bellybutton ring below which came a black pvs microskirt she wore no tights and her pale thin legs stretched bare down to the kneehighs and chunky platform heels that made her walk as if she were on stilts her expression showed fear and nervousness as her astonishingly lovely cobaltblue eyes roved restlessly about the stark office banks would have put her down for a heroinaddicted prostitute but he could see no needle tracks on her arms that didnt mean she wasnt addicted to something and it certainly didnt mean that she wasnt a prostitute there are more ways of getting drugs into your system than through a needle something about her reminded him of chief constable riddles daughter emily but it quickly passed she bore more resemblance to the famous heroinchic models of a few years ago are you the one she asked what one the one in charge i asked for the one in charge thats me for my sins said banks what never mind sit down she sat slowly and suspiciously eyes still flicking restlessly around the office as if she were afraid someone was going to appear and strap her into her chair it had obviously taken her a lot of courage to come this far can i get you some tea or coffee banks asked she looked surprised at the offer er yes please coffee would be nice how do you take it what the coffee how do you want it milk and plenty of sugar she said as if unaware that it came any other way banks phoned for two coffees black for him and turned back to her whats your name candy really why whats wrong with it nothing nothing candy ever been in a police station before fear flashed across candys delicate features why just asking you seem ill at ease she managed a weak smile well yes maybe i am a little bit relax i wont eat you wrong choice of words banks realized when he saw the lascivious knowing look in her eye i mean i wont harm you he corrected himself the coffee arrived carried in by the same stillsmirking pc banks was abrupt with him resenting the kind of smug arrogance that the smirk implied okay candy said banks after the first sip care to tell me what its all about can i smoke she opened her handbag sorry said banks no smoking anywhere in the station otherwise id have one with you maybe we could go outside i dont think that would be a good idea banks said lets just get on with it its just that i really like a ciggie with my coffee i always have a smoke with my coffee not this time why have you come to see me candy she fidgeted awhile longer a sulky expression on her face then shut the handbag and crossed her legs clipping the underside of the desk with her platform and rattling it so much that bankss coffee spilled over the rim of his mug and made a gathering stain on the pile of papers before him sorry she said its nothing banks took out his handkerchief and wiped it up you were going to tell me why youre here was i yes well look candy said leaning forward in her chair first off you have to grant me that immunization or whatever or i wont say a word you mean immunity she flushed if thats what its called i didnt go to school much immunity from what from prosecution but why would i want to prosecute you her eyes were everywhere but on banks hands twisting the bag on her bare lap because of what i do she said you know with men im a prostitute a tom bloody hell said banks you could knock me over with a feather her eyes turned to him shimmering with angry tears theres no need to be snarky im not ashamed of what i am at least i dont go around locking up innocent people and letting the guilty go free banks felt like a shit sometimes he just didnt know when to hold his tongue he had acted no better than the smirking pc when he insulted her with his sarcasm im sorry candy he said but im a very busy man can we get to the point if youve got anything to tell me then say it you promise promise what you wont lock me up i wont lock you up cross my heart not unless youve come to confess a serious crime she shot to her feet i havent done nothing all right all right sit down then take it easy candy sat slowly careful with her platforms this time i came because you let her go i wasnt going to come i dont like the police but you let her go whos this about candy its about that couple in the papers the ones who took them young girls what about them just that they once you know they they picked you up she looked down yes both of them yes how did it happen i was just you know out on the street and they came by in a car he did the talking and when wed fixed it up they took me to a house when was this candy last summer do you remember the month august i think late august it was warm anyway banks tried to work out the timing the seacroft rapes had stopped around the time the paynes moved out of the area about a year or so before candys experience that left a period of about sixteen months before payne abducted kelly matthews perhaps during that period he had been trying to sublimate his urges relying on prostitutes and lucys role where was the house the hill its the same one thats in all the papers ive been there okay what happened next well first we had a drink and they chatted to me putting me at ease like they seemed a really nice couple and then what do you think id still like you to tell me he said lets go upstairs just the two of you yes thats what i thought he meant at first go on well we went up to the bedroom and i you know i got undressed well partly he wanted me to keep certain things on jewelry my underwear at first anyway what happened next it was dark in there and you could only make out shadows he made me lie down on the bed and the next thing i knew she was there too lucy payne yes on the bed with you yes starkers was she involved in what went on sexually oh yes she knew what she was doing all right proper little minx she never seemed to be coerced a victim in any way never no way she was in control and she liked what was happening she even came up with suggestions of her own you know different things to do different positions did they hurt you not really i mean they liked to play games but they seemed to know how far to go what sort of games he asked me if id mind him tying me to the bed he promised they werent going to hurt me you let him do that they were paying well and they seemed nice yes banks shook his head in amazement okay go on dont judge me she said you dont know anything about me or what i have to do so dont you dare judge me okay said banks go on candy they tied you to the bed she was doing something with hot candle wax on my belly my nipples it hurt a bit but it doesnt really hurt you know what i mean banks hadnt experimented sexually with candle wax but he had spilled some on his hand on more than one occasion and knew the sensation the brief flash of heat and pain followed by the quick cooling the setting and drying the way it pinched and puckered the skin not an entirely unpleasant sensation were you frightened a bit not really though ive known worse but they were a team thats what im telling you thats why i came forward i cant believe youve let her go we dont have any evidence against her any evidence that she had anything to do with killing those girls but dont you see candy pleaded shes the same as him theyre a team they do things together everything together candy i know it probably took you a lot of courage to come here and talk to me but what youve said doesnt change things we cant go and arrest her on on some toms statement you mean i wasnt going to say that what i was going to say was that we cant just go and arrest her on the evidence of what youve just told me you consented you were paid for your services they didnt hurt you beyond what you were prepared for its a risky profession youre in you know that candy but surely what ive said makes a difference yes it makes a difference to me but we deal in facts in evidence im not doubting your word that it happened but even if we had it on video it wouldnt make her a murderer candy paused for a moment then she said they did have it on video how do you know because i saw the camera they thought it was hidden behind a screen but i could hear something a whirring noise and once when i got up to go to the toilet i glimpsed a video camera set up behind a screen the screen had a hole in it we didnt find any videos at the house candy and as i said even if we had it wouldnt change anything but the fact that candy had seen a video camera interested banks again he had to ask himself where was it and where were the tapes so its all for nothing then my coming here not necessarily yes it is youre not going to do anything shes just as guilty as him and youre going to let her get away with murder candy weve got no evidence against her the fact that she joined in a threesome with her husband and you does not make her a murderer then find some evidence banks sighed why did you come here he asked really you girls never come forward voluntarily and talk to the police what do you mean you girls youre judging me again arent you candy for crying out loud youre a tom you told me yourself you sell sex im not judging your profession but what i am saying is that girls who practice it rarely make themselves helpful to the police so why are you here she shot him a sly glance so full of humor and intelligence that banks wanted to get on his soapbox and persuade her to go to university and get a degree but he didnt then her expression quickly changed to one of sadness youre right about my profession as you call it she said its full of risks risk of getting some sexually transmitted disease risk of meeting the wrong kind of customer the nasty kind things like that happen to us all the time we deal with them at the time these two were no better or worse than anyone else better than some at least they paid she leaned forward but since ive read about them in the papers what you found in the cellar she gave a little shudder and hugged her skinny shoulders girls go missing she went on girls like me and nobody cares banks attempted to say something but she brushed it aside oh youll say you do youll say it doesnt matter who gets raped beat up or murdered but if its some little butterwouldntmeltinherknickers schoolgirl youll move heaven and earth to find out who did it if its someone like me well lets just say were pretty much low priority okay if thats true candy there are reasons said banks and its not because i dont care because we dont care she studied him for a few moments and seemed to give him the benefit of the doubt maybe you do she said maybe youre different and maybe there are reasons not that they get you off the hook the point is though why i came and all that not just that girls do go missing girls have gone missing well one in particular banks felt the hairs bristle at the back of his neck a girl you know a friend of yours not exactly a friend you dont have many friends in this profession but someone i knew yes spent time with talked to had a drink with lent money to when did this happen i dont know exactly before christmas did you report it her cutting glance said hed just gone down a lot in her estimation curiously it mattered to him give me a break she said girls come and go all the time move on even give up the life sometimes save up enough money go to university get a degree banks felt himself blush as she said the very thing that had crossed his mind some time ago so whats to say this missing girl didnt just up and leave like the others he asked nothing said candy maybe its a wildgoose chase but but you said that what i had to tell you wasnt evidence thats true it made you think though didnt it it gave me pause for thought yes then what if this girl didnt just move on what if something did happen to her dont you think you at least ought to look into that possibility you never know you might find some evidence there what youre saying makes sense candy but did you ever see this girl with the paynes not exactly with them no did you see the paynes at any time around her disappearance i did see them sometimes cruising the street i cant remember the exact dates around that time though yes both of them yes ill need a name no problem i know her name and not a name like candy whats wrong with candy i dont believe its your own name well well i can see now why youre such an important detective actually its not my real name is hayley which if you ask me is even worse oh i dont know its not that bad you can spare me the flattery dont you know us toms dont need to be flattered i didnt mean she smiled i know you didnt then she leaned forward and rested her arms on the desk her pale face only a foot or two away from his he could smell bubble gum and smoke on her breath but that girl who disappeared i know her name her street name was anna but i know her real name what do you think of that mr detective i think were in business said banks reaching for pad and pen she sat back and folded her arms oh no not until ive had that cigarette what now asked janet ive already changed my statement i know said annie that sick feeling at the center of her gut partly it was due to janets stuffy flat but only partly ive been to talk to the cps janet poured herself a shot of gin neat from an almost empty bottle and and im supposed to arrest you and take you down to the station to charge you i see what are you going to charge me with annie paused took a deep breath then said the cps wanted me to charge you with murder at first but i managed to get them down to voluntary manslaughter youll have to talk to them about this but im sure that if you plead guilty itll go easy on you the shock and the anger she had expected didnt come instead janet twisted a loose thread around her forefinger frowned and took a sip of gin its because of the john hadleigh verdict isnt it i heard it on the radio annie swallowed yes i thought so a sacrificial lamb look annie went on we can work this out as i said the cps will probably work out a deal janet held her hand up no what do you mean what part of no dont you understand janet no if the bastards want to charge me let them ill not give them the satisfaction of pleading guilty to just doing my job this is no time for playing games janet what makes you think im playing games i mean it ill plead innocent to any charges you care to bring annie felt a chill janet listen to me you cant do that janet laughed she looked bad annie noticed hair unwashed and unbrushed pale skin breaking out in spots a general haze of stale sweat and fresh gin dont be silly she said of course i can the public want us to do our job dont they they want people to feel safe in their nice little middleclass beds at night or when theyre driving to work in the morning or going out for a drink in the evening dont they well let them find out theres a price for keeping killers off the streets no annie ill not plead guilty not even to voluntary manslaughter annie leaned forward to put some emphasis into what she was saying think about this janet it could be one of the most important decisions you ever make i dont think so i already made that one in the cellar last week but i have thought about it i havent thought about anything else for a week your minds made up yes do you think i want to do this janet annie said standing up janet smiled at her no of course you dont youre a decent enough person you like to do the right thing and you know as well as i do that this stinks but when push comes to shove youll do your job the bloody job you know im almost glad this has happened glad to be out of it the fucking hypocrites come on get on with it janet taylor im arresting you for the murder of terence payne you do not have to say anything but it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court anything you do say may be given in evidence when annie suggested they meet for a drink somewhere other than the queens arms banks felt immediately apprehensive the queens arms was their local it was where they always went for a drink after work by naming another pub the pied piper a tourist haunt on castle hill annie was telling banks she had a serious message to deliver something beyond casual conversation or so he believed either that or she was worried about detective superintendent chamberss finding out they were meeting he got there ten minutes early bought a pint at the bar and sat at a table near the window back to the wall the view was spectacular the formal gardens were a blaze of purple scarlet and indigo and across the river the tall trees of the green some of them still in blossom blocked out most of the eyesore of the east end estate he could still see some of the grim maisonettes and the two twelvestory tower blocks stuck up as if they were giving the finger to the world but he could also see beyond them to the lush plain with its fields of bright yellow rapeseed and he even fancied he could make out the dark green humps of the cleveland hills in the far distance he could see the back of jenny fullers house too facing the green sometimes he worried about jenny she didnt seem to have much going in her life apart from her work she had joked about her bad relationships yesterday but banks had witnessed some of them and they were no joke he remembered the shock disappointment and yes jealousy he had felt some years ago when he went to interrogate a loser called dennis osmond and saw jenny poke her head around his bedroom door hair in disarray a thin dressing gown slipping off her shoulders he had also listened as she spilled out her woes over the unfaithful randy jenny picked losers cheats and generally unsuitable partners time after time the sad thing was she knew it but it happened anyway annie was fifteen minutes late which was unlike her and she lacked the usual spring in her step when she got herself a drink and joined banks at the table he could tell she was upset rough day he asked you can say that again banks felt that he could have had a better one too sandras letter he could have done without for a start and while candys information was interesting it was maddeningly lacking in the hard evidence he needed if he was to track down lucy payne and arrest her for anything other than curbcrawling that was the trouble the odd things that trickled in lucys childhood the satanic stuff in alderthorpe kathleen murrays murder and now candys statement were all disturbing and suggestive of more serious problems but ultimately as ac hartnell had already pointed out they added up to nothing anything in particular he asked i just arrested janet taylor let me guess the hadleigh verdict yes it seems everyone knew about it except me the cps wants justice to be seen to be done its just bloody politics thats all often is annie gave him a sour look i know that but it doesnt help theyll make a deal with her annie told him what janet had just said should be an interesting trial then what did chambers have to say he doesnt give a damn hes just marking time till he gets his pension im through with complaints and discipline soon as theres an opening in cid im back and wed be happy to have you as soon as there is said banks smiling look alan annie said looking at the view through the window theres something else i wanted to talk to you about just as hed thought he lit a cigarette okay what is it its just that i dont know this isnt working out you and me i think we should ease off cool it thats all you want to end our relationship not end it just change its focus thats all we can still be friends i dont know what to say annie whats brought this on nothing in particular oh come on you cant just expect me to believe you suddenly decided for no apparent reason to chuck me im not chucking you i told you things are just changing okay are we going to continue going out for romantic dinners to galleries and concerts together no are we going to continue sleeping together no then what precisely are we going to do together be friends you know at work be supportive and stuff im already supportive and stuff why cant i be supportive and stuff and still sleep with you its not that i dont like it alan sleeping with you the sex you know that i thought i did maybe youre just a damn good actress annie winced and swigged some beer thats not fair i dont deserve that this isnt easy for me you know then why are you doing it you know its more than sex with us anyway i have to no you dont is it because of that conversation we had the other night i wasnt trying to suggest that we should have children thats the last thing id want right now i know it wasnt that was it to do with the miscarriage what i told you i felt christ no maybe look okay ill admit it threw me but not in the way you think in what way then annie paused clearly uncomfortable shifted in her chair and faced away from him her voice low it just made me think about things id rather not think about thats all what things do you have to know everything annie i care about you thats why im asking she ran her fingers through her hair turned her eyes on him and shook her head after the rape she said over two years ago well he hadnt the one who did it hadnt shit this is more difficult than i thought banks felt understanding dawn on him you got pregnant thats what youre telling me right thats why this whole business with sandra is bothering you so much annie smiled thinly perceptive of you she touched his hand and whispered yes i got pregnant and annie shrugged and i had an abortion it wasnt my best moment but it wasnt my worst i didnt feel guilty afterward i didnt feel much of anything in fact but all this i dont know i just want to put it behind me and being with you always seems to bring it all back shove it right in my face annie no let me finish youve got too much baggage alan too much for me to handle i thought it would get easier go away maybe but it hasnt you cant let it go youll never let it go your marriage was such a big part of your life for so long that you cant youre hurt and i cant console you i dont do consoling well sometimes i just feel too overwhelmed by your life your past your problems and all i want to do is crawl away and be on my own i cant get any breathing space banks stubbed out his cigarette and noticed his hand was shaking a little i didnt know you felt like that well thats why im telling you im not good at commitment at emotional closeness not yet anyway maybe never i dont know but its stifling me and scaring me cant we work it out i dont want to work it out i dont have the energy this is not what i need in my life right now thats the other reason what my career this janet taylor fiasco aside believe it or not i do love police work and i do have an aptitude for it i know no wait let me finish what weve been doing is unprofessional its hard for me to believe that half the station doesnt already know what were up to in private ive heard the sniggers behind my back certainly all my colleagues in cid and complaints and discipline know i think chambers was also dropping a hint when he warned me you were a ladies man i wouldnt be surprised if acc mclaughlin knows too relationships on the job arent unusual and they certainly arent illegal no but they are seriously discouraged and frowned upon i want to make chief inspector alan hell i want to make superintendent chief constable who knows ive rediscovered my ambition it was ironic banks thought that annie should rediscover her ambition just when he thought he had come to the limits of his and im standing in your way not standing in my way distracting me i dont need any distractions all work and no play so ill be dull for a while itll be a nice change so thats it then just like that over the end because im human and ive got a past that sometimes rears its ugly head and because youve decided you want to put more effort into your career we stop seeing each other if you want to put it like that yes what other way is there to put it annie hurried her pint banks could tell she wanted to leave damn it though he was hurt and angry and he wasnt going to let her get off that easily are you sure theres nothing else he asked like what i dont know youre not jealous of anyone are you jealous of whom why should i be jenny perhaps oh for crying out loud alan no im not jealous of jenny if im jealous of anyone its sandra cant you see that shes got more of a hold on you than anyone thats not true not anymore but banks remembered the letter his feelings when he read the cold businesslike words is there someone else is that it he went on quickly alan theres nobody else believe me ive told you i dont have room for anyone in my life right now i cant cope with anyone elses emotional demands what about sexual demands what do you mean it doesnt have to be emotional sex does it i mean if its too much trouble to sleep with someone who actually cares a bit about you maybe itd be easier to pick up some stud in a bar for a quick anonymous fuck no demands you dont even have to tell one another your names is that what you want alan i dont know where youre going with this but id like you to stop right there banks rubbed his temples im just upset annie thats all im sorry ive had a bad day too im sorry about that i really dont want to hurt you he looked her in the eye then dont no matter who you get involved with youll have to face things you want to avoid he noticed the tears in her eyes the only time hed seen her cry before was when she told him about her rape he reached out to touch her hand on the table but she jerked it away no dont annie no she stood up so abruptly that she banged the table hard and her drink spilled right on to bankss lap then she ran out of the pub before he could say another word all he could do was sit there feeling the cold liquid seep through his trousers aware of everyones eyes on him thankful only that they hadnt been in the queens arms where everyone knew him and hed thought the day couldnt get any worse after taking her last tutorial group and clearing up some paperwork jenny left her office at york early on tuesday afternoon and headed for the a to durham the traffic was heavy especially lorries and delivery vans but at least it was a pleasant sunny day not pouring down with rain after talking to keith murray if he agreed to talk to her jenny thought she would still have time to continue on to edinburgh later in the afternoon and look up laura godwin it would mean an overnight stay either that or a long drive home in the dark but she could worry about that later she had an old student friend in the psychology department at the university of edinburgh and it might be fun to get together and catch up with each others history not that jennys recent history was anything to write home about she thought glumly and now that she had met bankss girlfriend she decided there probably wasnt much hope for her there either still she was used to that by now after all they had known each other for seven years or more and they hadnt once strayed beyond the bounds of propriety more was the pity she still wasnt certain whether the girlfriend had been jealous when she came over to them in the queens arms she must certainly have seen banks touch jennys arm and though it was merely a friendly concerned gesture it was open to misinterpretation like so much body language was the girlfriend the jealous kind jenny didnt know annie had seemed selfassured and poised yet jenny had sensed something in her attitude that made her feel strangely concerned for banks who was probably the only man she had ever met whom she worried about wanted to protect she didnt know why he was independent strong private perhaps he was more vulnerable than he let on but he certainly wasnt the sort of person you went around feeling you needed to protect or mother a white van sped by on her outside lane just as she was turning off and still lost in thought she almost hit it luckily instinct kicked in and she had time to swing back abruptly into her own lane without causing anyone else great distress but she missed the turnoff she wanted she honked her horn and cursed him out loud impotent gestures but all she could come up with and drove on to the next junction when she had got off the a she switched the radio channel from a dreary brahms symphony to some cheerful pop music tunes she could hum along with and tap out the rhythm on the steering wheel durham was on odd sort of place jenny had always thought though she had been born there her parents had moved away when she was only three and she didnt remember it at all very early in her academic career she had applied for a job at the university but she got pipped at the post by a man with more publications to his name she would have liked living here she thought as she looked at the distant castle high on the hill and all the greenery surrounding it but york suited her well enough and she had no desire to start applying for a new job at this stage in her career she had found from her map that keith murray lived out by the university sports grounds so she was able to bypass the central maze around the cathedral and colleges the citys main tourist area even so she still managed to get lost on a couple of occasions there was a chance that keith might be out at lectures jenny realized though she remembered how few lectures she had attended when she was an undergraduate if he was she could wait until later if she had to explore the city have a pub lunch and still be in plenty of time to get to edinburgh to talk to laura she pulled over into a small car park in front of some shops and consulted the map again not far away now she just had to watch out for the oneway streets or she would end up back where she started on the second try she got it right and pulled off the arterial road into an area of narrow streets she was concentrating so much on finding the right street and the right house number that she almost didnt see the car she parked behind until the last moment when she did her heart jumped into her throat it was a blue citroën jenny told herself to be calm that she couldnt be certain it was the same blue citroën that had followed her around holderness because she hadnt seen the number plate but it was the exact same model and she didnt believe in coincidences what should she do go ahead anyway if the citroën belonged to keith murray what had he been doing at alderthorpe and spurn head and why had he followed her was he dangerous as jenny was trying to make up her mind what to do the front door of the house opened and two people walked over to the car a young man with keys in his hand and a woman who looked remarkably like lucy payne just as jenny decided to pull away the young man saw her said something to lucy then walked over and jerked open the drivers door of jennys car before she had time to lock it well she thought youve well and truly done it now this time havent you jenny there were no new developments at millgarth according to ken blackstone on the phone that morning the socos were getting to the point where there wasnt much left of the payne house to take apart both gardens had been dug up to a depth of between six and ten feet and searched in a grid system the concrete floors in the cellar and the garage had been ripped up by pneumatic drills almost a thousand exhibits had been bagged and labeled the entire contents of the house had been stripped and taken away the walls had been punched open at regular intervals in addition to the crime scene specialists going over all the collected material forensic mechanics had taken paynes car apart looking for traces of the abducted girls payne might be dead but a case still had to be answered and lucys role had still to be determined the only snippet of information about lucy payne was that she had withdrawn two hundred pounds from an atm on tottenham court road it figured she would go to london if she wanted to disappear banks thought remembering his search there for chief constable riddles daughter emily perhaps he would have to go and search for lucy too although this time he would have all the resources of the metropolitan police at his disposal maybe it wouldnt come to that maybe lucy wasnt involved and would simply ease herself into a new identity and a new look in a new place and try to rebuild her shattered life maybe banks looked again at the loose sheets of papers on his desk katya pavelic katya candys anna had been identified through dental records late the previous evening fortunately for banks she had suffered a toothache shortly before she disappeared and candy had directed katya to her own dentist katya had disappeared according to candy sometime last november at least she remembered the weather was cool and misty and the christmas lights had recently been turned on in the city center that likely made katya the victim before kelly matthews certainly candy or hayley lyndon as she was called had seen both terence and lucy payne driving around the area on a number of occasions but couldnt connect them directly with katya the circumstantial evidence was beginning to build up though and if jennys psychological probing into the old alderthorpe wounds turned up anything interesting then it might be time to reel lucy in for the moment let her enjoy the illusion of freedom katya pavelic had come to england from bosnia four years ago when she was fourteen like so many young girls there she had been gangraped by serbian soldiers and then shot saving herself only by playing dead under a pile of corpses until some canadian un peacekeepers found her three days later the wound was superficial and the blood had clotted her only problem was an infection and that had responded well to antibiotics various groups and individuals had seen that katya got to england but she was a disturbed and troublesome girl and she soon ran away from her foster parents when she was sixteen and they had tried in vain to find her and contact her ever since the irony wasnt lost on banks after having survived the horrors of the bosnian war katya pavelic had ended up raped murdered and buried in the paynes back garden what was the bloody point of it all he asked as usual he got no answer from the supreme ironist in the sky only a deep hollow laughter echoing through his brain sometimes the pity and the horror of it all were almost too much for him to bear and there remained one more unidentified victim the one who had been buried there the longest a white woman in her late teens or early twenties about five feet three inches tall according to the forensic anthropologist who was still conducting tests on the bones there was little doubt in bankss mind that this could easily be another prostitute victim and that might make the corpse hard to identify banks had had one brainstorm and pulled in terence paynes teacher friend geoff brighouse to help him find the aberdeen schoolteacher the two of them had taken up to their room at the convention luckily banks turned out to be wrong and she was still teaching in aberdeen though she expressed some anger about her experience she had kept quiet mostly because she didnt want to damage her teaching career and had written that one off to experience she had also been very embarrassed and angry with herself for being so drunk and foolish as to go to a hotel room with two strange men after all the things she had read in the papers she had almost fainted when banks told her that the man who had coerced her into having anal sex against her will was terence payne she hadnt made the connection from the photo in the newspapers and had only been on firstname terms with the two banks opened his window on another fine day in the marketsquare tourist buses pulling up already disgorging their hordes on to the gleaming cobbles a quick glance around the churchs interior a walk up to the castle lunch at the pied piper banks felt depressed just thinking about what had happened there yesterday then theyd pile back in the coach and be off to castle bolton or devraulx abbey how he wished he could go on a long holiday maybe never come back the gold hands against the blue face of the church clock stood at five past ten banks lit a cigarette and planned out the rest of his day plans that included mick blair ian scott and sarah francis not to mention the grieving parents christopher and victoria wray winsome had discovered nothing new from talking to the wrays neighbors none of whom had either seen or heard anything unusual banks still had his suspicions about them though he found it difficult to convince himself that they could actually have killed leanne he had suffered yet another restless night this time partly because of annie now the more he thought about her decision the more sense it made he didnt want to give her up but if he was to be honest it was best all around looking back at her onagainoffagain attitude toward their relationship the way she bristled every time other aspects of his life came up he realized that however much there had been the relationship had also been a lot of grief too if she didnt like the way his past made her face details of her own like the abortion then perhaps she was right to end it time to move on and stay just friends let her pursue her career and let him try to exorcise his personal demons just as he was finishing his cigarette dc winsome jackman tapped at his door and walked in looking particularly elegant in a tailored pinstripe suit over a white blouse the woman had clothes sense banks thought unlike himself and unlike annie cabbot he liked annies casual high style it was definitely her but no one could accuse her of making a fashion statement anyway best forget about annie he turned toward winsome come in sit down winsome sat crossing her long legs sniffing accusingly and wrinkling her nose at the smoke i know i know banks said im going to stop soon honestly that little job you asked me to do she said i thought youd like to know that your instinct was right there was a car reported stolen from disraeli street between ninethirty and eleven oclock on the night leanne wray disappeared was there indeed isnt disraeli street just around the corner from the old ship inn it is sir banks sat down and rubbed his hands together tell me more keepers name is samuel gardner ive spoken to him on the phone seems he parked there while he popped into the cock and bull on palmerston avenue just for a pint of shandy he stressed of course perish the thought we should try to do him for drinkdriving two months after the event what do you think winsome winsome shifted and crossed her legs the other way straightening the hem of her skirt over her knees i dont know sir seems a bit of a coincidence doesnt it that ian scotts in the neighborhood yes sir i know there are plenty of kids taking and driving away but well the timing fits and the location indeed it does when did he report it missing ten past eleven that night and when was it found not until the next morning sir one of the beat constables came across it illegally parked down by the formal gardens thats not very far from the riverboat is it tenminute walk at the most you know this is starting to look good winsome i want you to go and have a word with this samuel gardner see if you can find out any more from him put him at ease make it clear we dont give a damn whether he drank a whole bottle of whiskey as long as he tells us everything he can remember about that night and have the car taken into the police garage for a full forensic examination i doubt well find anything after all this time but scott and blair arent likely to know that are they winsome smiled wickedly doubt it very much sir banks looked at his watch when youve talked to gardner and the cars safe in our care have mick blair brought in i think a little chat with him in one of the interview rooms might be very productive right you are and have sarah francis brought in at the same time okay and winsome sir make sure they see one another in passing would you my pleasure sir winsome smiled stood up and left the office look said jenny i havent had any lunch yet instead of standing around here in the street is there anywhere nearby we can go though her immediate fears had dispersed somewhat when the young man simply asked her who she was and what she wanted without showing any particular inclination toward aggression she still wanted to be with them in a public place not up in the flat theres a café down the road he said we can go there if you want fine jenny followed them back to the arterial road crossed at the zebra and went into a corner café that smelled of bacon she was supposed to be slimming she was always supposed to be slimming but she couldnt resist the smell and ordered a bacon butty and a mug of tea the other two asked for the same and jenny paid nobody objected poor students never do now that they were closer sitting at an isolated table near the window jenny could she that she was mistaken while the girl definitely resembled lucy had her eyes and mouth and the same shiny black hair it wasnt her there was something softer more fragile more human about this young woman and her eyes werent quite so black and impenetrable they were intelligent and sensitive though their depths flickered with horrors and fears jenny could barely imagine laura isnt it she said when theyd settled the young woman raised her eyebrows why yes how did you know it wasnt difficult jenny said you resemble your sister and youre with your cousin laura blushed im only visiting him its not i mean i dont want you to get the wrong idea dont worry said jenny i dont jump to conclusions well not many she said to herself lets get back to my original question keith murray cut in he was more hardedged than laura and not one for small talk thats who are you and why youre here you might as well tell me what you were doing at alderthorpe too while youre at it laura looked surprised she was in alderthorpe on saturday i followed her to easington and then to spurn head i turned back when she got to the m he looked at jenny again well he was a goodlooking young man brown hair a little over his ears and collar but professionally layered slightly betterdressed than most of the students she taught in a light sports jacket and gray chinos highly polished shoes cleanshaven clearly a young lad who took some pride in his rather conservative appearance laura in contrast wore a shapeless sort of shift that hung around her in a haze of material and hid any claims she might have had to the kind of figure men like there was a reticence and tentativeness about her that made jenny want to reach out and tell her everything was fine not to worry she didnt bite keith also seemed very protective of her and jenny wondered how their relationship had developed since alderthorpe she told them who she was and what she was doing about her forays into lucy paynes past looking for answers to her present and both laura and keith listened intently when she had finished they looked at each other and she could tell they were communicating in some way that was beyond her she couldnt tell what they were saying and she didnt believe it was some sort of telepathic trick just that whatever they had been through all those years ago had created a bond so strong and deep that it went beyond words what makes you think youll find any answers there keith asked im a psychologist jenny said not a psychiatrist certainly not a freudian but i do believe that our past shapes us makes us what we are and what is linda or lucy as she calls herself now jenny spread her hands thats just it i dont know i was hoping you might be able to help why should we help you i dont know said jenny maybe there are some issues back there you still have to deal with yourselves keith laughed if we lived to be a hundred wed still have issues to deal with from back then he said but whats that got to do with linda she was with you wasnt she one of you keith and laura looked at each other again and jenny wished she knew what they were thinking finally as if they had come to a decision laura said yes she was with us but in a way she was apart what do you mean laura linda was the eldest so she took care of us keith snorted she did keith all right lauras lower lip trembled and for a moment jenny thought she was going to cry go on laura she said please i know linda was my sister laura said rubbing one hand against the top of her thigh but theres three years between us and thats an awful lot when youre younger tell me about it my brothers three years older than me well youll know what i mean then so i didnt really know linda in some ways she was as distant as an adult to me and just as incomprehensible we played together when we were little but the older we got the more we drifted apart especially with you know the way things were what was she like though linda she was strange very distant very selfabsorbed even then she liked to play games and she could be cruel in what way if she didnt get her own way or if you didnt do what she wanted she could lie and get you in trouble with the adults get you put in the cage she did that oh yes said keith all of us got on her bad side at one time or another sometimes we just didnt know if she was with us or them said laura but she could be kind i remember her treating a cut i had once putting some tcp on so it didnt get infected she was very gentle and sometimes she even stuck up for us against them in what ways little ways if we were you know too weak to or just sometimes they listened to her and she saved the kittens what kittens our cat had kittens and dddad wanted to drown them but linda took them and found them all homes she liked animals then she adored them she wanted to be a vet when she grew up why didnt she i dont know maybe she wasnt clever enough or maybe she changed her mind but she was also their victim too the adults oh yes said keith we all were she was their favorite for a long time laura added that is until she she what laura take your time laura blushed and looked away until she became a woman when she was twelve then they werent interested in her anymore kathleen became their favorite then she was only nine like me but they liked her better what was kathleen like lauras eyes shone she was like a saint she bore it all without complaining everything those those people did to us kathleen had some sort of inner light some i dont know some spiritual quality that just shone out but she was very fffragile very weak and she was always ill she couldnt take the kind of punishments and beatings they dished out like what the cage and no food for days she was too weak and frail to begin with tell me said jenny why did none of you tell the authorities what was going on keith and laura looked at each other in that intense way again we didnt dare keith said they said theyd kill us if we ever told a soul and they were they were family laura added i mean you wanted your mummy and daddy to love you didnt you so you had to do you know what they wanted you had to do what the grownups said or your dddaddy wouldnt love you anymore jenny sipped some tea to cover her face for a moment she wasnt sure whether anger or pity had brought the tears to her eyes but she didnt want laura to see them besides keith went on we didnt know any different how could we know life was different for other kids what about at school you must have kept yourselves apart been aware that you were different we kept apart yes we were told not to talk about what happened it was family and nobody elses business what were you doing in alderthorpe im writing a book keith said a book about what happened its partly therapeutic and partly because i think people should know what goes on so maybe it can be prevented from happening again why did you follow me i thought you might be a reporter or something poking about the place like that youd better get used to that idea keith it wont take them long to find out about alderthorpe im surprised theyre not swarming around already i know so you thought i was a reporter what were you going to do about me nothing i just wanted to see where you were going make sure you were gone and what if id come back keith spread his hands palms up you did didnt you did you realize it was linda as soon as the news about the paynes broke i did yes said laura it wasnt a good photo but i knew shed married terry i knew where she lived did you ever get together keep in touch not often we did until susan committed suicide and tom went to australia and keith and i visit dianne as often as we can but as i said linda was always distant older i mean we met up sometimes for birthdays that sort of thing but i thought she was weird in what way i dont know it was an evil thought i mean shed suffered the same as we had but it seemed to have affected her in a different way keith added what way i didnt see her nearly as often as laura did he went on but she always gave me the impression that she was up to something bad something deliciously evil it was just the way she spoke the hint of sin she was secretive so she never told us exactly what she was doing but she was into some pretty weird stuff laura said blushing s and m that sort of thing she told you once yes she only did it to embarrass me im not comfortable talking about sex she hugged herself and avoided jennys eyes and linda liked to embarrass you yes tease me i suppose wasnt it a shock to you what terry had done with linda so close by especially after the events of your childhood of course it was said keith it still is were still trying to come to terms with it thats partly why im here said laura i needed to be with keith to talk to decide what to do what do you mean what to do but we didnt want to be rushed said keith jenny leaned forward what is it she asked what is it you need to do they looked at each other again and jenny waited what seemed like ages before keith spoke wed better tell her dont you think he said i suppose so tell me what about what happened thats what weve been trying to decide you see whether we should tell but im sure you can understand keith said that we dont want the limelight anymore we dont want it all raked up again your book will do that jenny said ill deal with that when and if it happens he leaned forward anyway youve sort of forced our hand havent you we would probably have told someone soon anyway so it might as well be you now im still not sure what you want to tell me she said laura looked at her tears in her eyes its about kathleen our parents didnt kill her tom didnt kill her linda killed her linda killed kathleen mick blair was surly when banks and winsome entered the interview room at three thirtyfive that afternoon as well he might be banks thought he had been dragged away from his job as a clerk in the tandy shop in the swainsdale centre by two uniformed police officers and left waiting in the dingy room for over an hour it was a wonder he wasnt screaming for his brief banks would have been just another little chat mick said banks smiling as he turned on the tape recorders but well get it on record this time that way you can be certain theres no funny business from us very grateful im sure said blair and why the hell did you have to keep me waiting so long important police business said banks the bad guys just never stop whats sarah doing here sarah you know who i mean sarah francis ians girlfriend i saw her in the corridor whats she doing here just answering our questions mick the way i hope you will i dont know why youre wasting your time on me i cant tell you anything you dont know already dont underestimate yourself mick whats it about this time then he eyed winsome suspiciously its about the night leanne wray disappeared again but weve been over and over all that yes i know but we havent got to the truth yet see its like peeling off the layers of an onion mick all weve got so far is layer after layer of lies its the truth she left us outside the old ship and we went our separate ways we didnt see her again what else can i tell you the truth where the four of you went ive told you all i know you see mick banks went on leanne was upset that day shed just heard some bad news her stepmother was going to have a baby you might not understand why but believe me that upset her so i should think that night she was in a rebellious mood ready to say to hell with the curfew and lets have some fun make her parents suffer a bit at the same time i dont know whose suggestion it was maybe yours but you decided to steal a car now wait a minute a car belonging to mr samuel gardner a blue fiat brava to be exact which was parked just around the corner from the pub thats ridiculous we never stole no car you cant pin that on us shut up and listen mick said winsome blair looked at her then swallowed and shut up winsomes expression was hard and unflinching her eyes full of scorn and disgust where did you go on your little joyride mick banks asked what happened what happened to leanne was she giving you the comeon did you think it was going to be your lucky night did you try it on with her and she changed her mind did you get a bit rough were you on drugs mick no its not true none of its true she left us outside the pub you sound like a drowning man clinging to a bit of wood mick pretty soon youll have to let go im telling the truth i dont think so then prove it listen mick said winsome standing up and pacing the small room weve got mr gardners car in the police garage right now and our forensics people are going over it inch by inch are you trying to tell us that they wont find anything i dont know what theyll find said mick how can i ive never even seen the fucking car winsome stopped pacing and sat down theyre the best in the business our forensics team they dont even need fingerprints if theres just one hair theyll find it and if it belongs to you ian sarah or leanne weve got you she held a finger up one hair think about it mick shes right you know said banks they are very good these scientists me i know buggerall about dna and hair follicles but these lads could find the exact spot on your head the hair came from we didnt steal no car i know what youre thinking banks said mind reader too are you banks laughed it doesnt take much youre thinking how long ago was it we took that car it was the thirtyfirst of march and whats todays date its the sixteenth of may thats a month and a half surely there cant be any traces left by now surely the car must have been washed the interior vacuumed isnt that what youre thinking mick ive told you i dont know nothing about a stolen car he folded his arms and tried to look defiant winsome gave a grunt of disgust and impatience dc jackmans getting restless said banks and i wouldnt want to push her too far if i were you you cant touch me its all on tape touch you who said anything about touching you youre threatening me no youve got it wrong mick see i want to get this all settled get you back off to work home in time for the evening news nothing id like better but dc jackman here is well lets just say that shed be more than happy to see you in detention what do you mean in the cells mick downstairs overnight but i havent done anything you cant do that was it ian is that whose idea it was i dont know what youre talking about what happened to leanne nothing i dont know ill bet sarah tells us it was all your fault i havent done anything shell want to protect her boyfriend wont she mick ill bet she doesnt give a damn about you when the chips are down stop it winsome looked at her watch lets just lock him up and go home she said im getting fed up of this what do you think mick ive told you all i know banks looked at winsome before turning back to mick im afraid then were going to have to hold you on suspicion suspicion of what suspicion of the murder of leanne wray mick jumped to his feet thats absurd i didnt kill anyone nobody murdered leanne how do you know that i mean i didnt murder leanne i dont know what happened to her its not my fault if somebody else killed her it is if you were there i wasnt there then tell us the truth mick tell us what happened ive told you banks stood up and gathered his file folders together all right well see what sarah has to say in the meantime i want you to think about two things while youre in the cells for the night mick time can drag down there especially in the wee hours when all youve got for company is the drunk next door singing your cheating heart over and over again so its nice to have something to think about something to distract you what things first off if you come clean with us if you tell us the truth if it was all ian scotts idea and if whatever happened to leanne was down to ian then itll go a lot easier with you he looked at winsome i could even see him walking away from this with little more than a reprimand failing to report or something minor like that cant you dc jackman winsome grimaced as if the idea of mick blairs getting off with less than murder appalled her whats the other thing mick asked the other thing oh yes its about samuel gardner who the owner of the stolen car what about him mans a slob mick he never cleans his car inside or out jenny couldnt think of anything to say after what keith and laura had just told her she sat with her mouth half open and an astonished expression on her face until her brain processed the information and she was able to continue how do you know she asked we saw her keith said we were with her in a way it was all of us she was doing it for all of us but she was the only one had the guts to do it are you certain about this yes they said this isnt something youve just remembered like many of her colleagues jenny distrusted repressed memory syndrome and she wanted to make certain that was not what she was dealing with linda godwin might have been kind to animals and never wet the bed or set a fire but if she had killed when she was twelve there was something seriously pathologically wrong with her and she could have killed again no said laura we always knew we just lost it for a while what do you mean its like when you put something away where you can find it again easily but then you dont remember where you put it said keith jenny understood that it happened to her all the time or when youre carrying something and you remember you have to do something else so you put it down on your way and then you cant find it again laura added you say you were there yes said keith we were in the room with her we saw her do it and youve said nothing all these years laura and keith just looked at her and she understood that they couldnt have said anything how could they they were too used to silence and why would they they were all victims of the godwins and the murrays why should linda be singled out for more suffering is that why she was in the cage when the police came no linda was in the cage because it was her period keith said laura blushed and turned away tom was in the cage with her because they thought he did it they never suspected linda but why asked jenny because kathleen just couldnt take any more said laura she was so weak her spirit was almost gone linda killed her to sssave her she knew what it was like to be in that position and she knew that kathleen couldnt handle it she killed her to save her further suffering are you sure jenny asked what do you mean are you certain thats why linda killed her why else didnt you think it might have been because she was jealous because kathleen was usurping her place no said linda scraping back her chair thats horrible how could you say something like that she killed her to save her more suffering she killed her out of kkkindness one or two people in the café had noticed lauras outburst and were looking over curiously at the table okay jenny said im sorry i didnt mean to upset you laura looked at her and a note of defiant desperation came into her tone she could be kind you know linda could be kind the old house was certainly full of noises maggie thought and she was beginning to jump at almost every one wood creaking as the temperature dropped after dark a whistle of wind rattling at the windows dishes shifting in the rack as they dried it was bills phone call of course she told herself and she tried the routines she used to calm herself deep breathing positive visualization but the ordinary noises of the house continued to distract her from her work she put a cd compilation of baroque classics in the stereo ruth had set up in the studio and that both cut out the disturbing sounds and helped her to relax she was working late on some sketches for hänsel and gretel because the following day she had to go to london to meet with her art director and discuss the project so far she also had an interview at broadcasting house a radio four program about domestic violence naturally but she was beginning to warm to being a spokesperson and if anything she said could help anyone at all then all the minor irritations such as ignorant interviewers and provocative fellow guests were worthwhile bill already knew where she was so she had no reason to worry about giving that away now she wasnt going to run away not again despite his call and the way it had shaken her she was determined to continue in her new role while she was in london she would also try to get a ticket for a west end play she wanted to see and stay overnight at the modest little hotel her art director had recommended several visits ago one of the joys of a country with a decent train service maggie thought was that london was only a couple of hours away from leeds a couple of hours that could be spent in reasonable comfort reading a book as the landscape sped by one thing that amused and intrigued maggie was the way that the english always complained about their train service no matter how good it seemed to someone from canada where trains were regarded as something of a necessary evil tolerated but not encouraged maggie thought complaining about trains was probably a british institution that had begun long before the days of british rail let alone virgin and railtrack maggie turned back to her sketch she was trying to capture the expression on the faces of hänsel and gretel when they realized in the moonlight that the trail of crumbs they had left to lead them from the dangers of the forest to the safety of home had been eaten by birds she liked the eerie effect she had created with the tree trunks branches and shadows which with just a little imagination could take the shapes of wild beasts and demons but hänsel and gretels expressions still werent quite right they were only children maggie reminded herself not adults and their fear would be simple and natural a look of abandonment and eyes on the verge of tears not as complex as adult fear which would include components of anger and the determination to find a way out very different facial expressions indeed in an earlier version of the sketch hänsel and gretel had come out looking a bit like younger versions of terry and lucy maggie thought just as rapunzel had resembled claire so she scrapped it now they were anonymous faces she had probably once spotted in a crowd which for whatever mysterious reason had lodged in her unconscious claire the poor girl that afternoon maggie had talked with both claire and her mother together and they had agreed that claire would try the psychologist dr simms had recommended that was a start at least maggie thought though it might take claire years to work through the psychological disturbance brought on by terry paynes acts her friends murder and her own sense of guilt and responsibility pachelbels canon played in the background and maggie concentrated on her drawing adding a little chiaroscuro effect here and a silvering of moonlight there no need to make it too elaborate as it would only serve as the model for a painting but she needed these little notes to herself to show her the way when she came to the final version that would be different in some ways of course but would also retain many of the little visual ideas she was having now when she heard the tapping over the music she thought it was another noise the old house had come up with to scare her but when it stopped for a few seconds then resumed at a slightly higher volume and faster rhythm she turned off the stereo and listened someone was knocking at the back door nobody ever used the back door it only led into a mean little latticework of gennels and snickets that connected with the council estate behind the hill not bill surely no maggie reassured herself bill was in toronto besides the door was deadlocked bolted and chained she wondered if she should dial right away but then realized how silly she would look in the eyes of the police if it was claire or claires mother or even the police themselves she couldnt bear the idea of banks hearing she had been such a fool instead she moved very slowly and quietly despite the anonymous creaks the staircase was relatively silent underfoot partly because of the thick pile carpet she picked out one of charless golf clubs from the hall cupboard and brandishing it ready to use edged toward the kitchen door the knocking continued it was only when maggie had got to within a few feet away that she heard the familiar womans voice maggie is that you are you there please let me in she abandoned the golf club turned on the kitchen light and fiddled with the various locks when she finally got the door open she was confused by what she saw appearance and voice didnt match the woman had short spiky blond hair was wearing a tshirt under a soft black leather jacket and a pair of closefitting blue jeans she was carrying a small holdall only the slight bruising by one eye and the impenetrable darkness of the eyes themselves told maggie who it was though it took several moments to process the information lucy my god it is you can i come in of course maggie held the door open and lucy payne stepped into the kitchen only ive got nowhere to go and i wondered if you could put me up just for a couple of days or so while i think of something yes said maggie still feeling stunned yes of course stay as long as you like its quite a new look i didnt recognize you at first lucy gave a little twirl do you like it its certainly different lucy laughed good she said i dont want anyone else to know im here believe it or not maggie but not everyone around here is as sympathetic toward me as you are i suppose not said maggie then she locked bolted and put the chain on the door turned out the kitchen light and led lucy payne into the living room i just wanted to say im sorry annie told banks in his eastvale office on wednesday morning he had just been glancing over the garages report on samuel gardners fiat they had of course found many hair traces in the cars interior both human and animal but they all had to be collected labeled and sent to the lab and it would take time to match them with the suspects or with leanne wray there were plenty of fingerprints too it was certainly true that gardner had been a slob when it came to his car but vic manson fingerprints officer could only hurry to a certain degree and it wasnt fast enough for bankss immediate needs banks looked at annie sorry for what exactly sorry for making a scene in the pub for acting like a fool oh what did you think i meant nothing no come on that i was sorry about what i said about us about ending the relationship i can always live in hope cant i oh stop feeling sorry for yourself alan it doesnt suit you banks opened up a paper clip the sharp end pricked his finger and a tiny spot of blood dropped on his desk which fairy tale was that he found himself wondering sleeping beauty but he didnt fall asleep chance would be a fine thing now are we going to get on with life or are you just going to sulk and ignore me because if you are id like to know banks couldnt help but smile she was right he had been feeling sorry for himself he had also decided that she was right about their relationship fine as it had been most of the time and much as he would miss her intimate company it was fraught with problems on both sides so tell her his inner voice prompted dont be a bastard dont put it all down to her the whole burden it was difficult he wasnt used to talking about his feelings he sucked his bleeding finger and said im not going to sulk just give me a little time to get used to the idea okay i sort of enjoyed what we had so did i said annie with a hint of a smile tugging at the corners of her lips do you think its any easier for me just because im the one whos making the move we want different things alan need different things its just not working youre right look i promise i wont sulk or ignore you or put you down as long as you dont treat me like something nasty stuck on your shoe what on earth makes you think id do that banks was thinking of the letter from sandra which had made him feel exactly like that but he was talking to annie he realized yes she was right things were well and truly screwed up he shook his head ignore me annie friends and colleagues okay annie narrowed her eyes and scrutinized him i do care you know i know you do thats part of the problem itll get better over time sorry i cant seem to think of anything to say but clichés maybe thats what theyre for situations like this maybe thats why there are so many of them but dont worry annie i mean what i say ill do the best i can to behave toward you with the utmost courtesy and respect oh bloody hell annie said laughing you dont have to be so damn stuffy a simple good morning a smile and a friendly little chat in the canteen every now and then would be just fine banks felt his face burn then he laughed with her right you are hows janet taylor stubborn as hell ive tried to talk to her the cps has tried to talk to her her own lawyer has tried to talk to her even chambers has tried to talk to her at least shes got a lawyer now the federation sent someone over whats she being charged with theyre going to charge her with voluntary manslaughter if she pleads guilty with extenuating circumstances theres every chance shell get it down to excusable homicide and if she goes ahead as planned who knows its up to the jury theyre either going to give her the same as they gave john hadleigh despite the vastly different circumstances or theyre going to take her job and her situation into account and give her the benefit of the doubt i mean the public doesnt want us hamstrung when it comes to doing our job but they dont want us to get ideas above our station either they dont like to see us acting as if were beyond that law its a tossup really hows she bearing up shes not shes just drinking bugger indeed how about the payne investigation banks told her what jenny had discovered about lucys past annie whistled so what are you going to do bring her in for questioning in the death of kathleen murray if we can find her its probably a bloody waste of time after all it was over ten years ago and she was only twelve at the time so i doubt well get anywhere with it but who knows it might open other doors if a little pressure is judiciously applied ac hartnell wont like it i know that hes already made his feelings clear lucy payne doesnt suspect you know so much about her past she has to be aware there was a chance the others would talk or that wed find out somehow in that case she may have already gone to ground anything new on the sixth body no said banks but well find out who it is the fact that they couldnt identify the sixth victim nagged away at him like the other victims she had been buried naked and no traces of clothing or personal belongings remained banks could only guess that payne must have burned their clothes and disposed of any rings or watches somehow he certainly hadnt kept them as trophies the forensic anthropologist working on her remains had so far been able to tell him that she was a white female between the ages of eighteen and twentytwo and that she had died like the others of ligature strangulation horizontal striations in the tooth enamel indicated inconsistent nutrition during her early years the regularity of the lines indicated possible seasonal swings in food supplies perhaps like katya she had come from a wartorn country in eastern europe banks had had a team keeping track of all mispers over the past few months and they were working overtime now following up on reports but if the victim was a prostitute like katya pavelic then the chances of finding out who she was were slim even so banks kept telling himself she was somebodys daughter somewhere somebody must be missing her but perhaps not there were plenty of people out there without friends or family people who could die in their homes tomorrow and not be found until the rent was long overdue or the smell grew too bad for the neighbors to bear there were refugees from eastern europe like katya or kids who had left home to travel the world and might be anywhere from katmandu to kilimanjaro he had to inure himself to the fact that they might not be able to identify the sixth victim for some time if ever but still it galled she should have a name an identity annie stood up anyway ive said what i came to say oh and youll probably be hearing very soon that ive made a formal request to come back to cid think theres any chance you can have my job if you want annie smiled you dont mean that dont i anyway i dont know if theyve changed their minds about cid staffing levels but ill talk to red ron if you think thatll help we dont have a di right now so its probably a good time to make your application before winsome catches up with me shes sharp that lass pretty too is she i hadnt noticed annie stuck her tongue out at banks and left his office sad as he felt at the end of their brief romance he felt some relief too he would no longer have to wonder from one day to the next whether they were on or off again he had been given his freedom yet again and freedom was a somewhat ambiguous gift sir banks looked up and saw winsome framed in his doorway yes just had a message from steve naylor the custody sergeant downstairs problem no not at all winsome smiled its mick blair he wants to talk banks clapped his hands and rubbed them together excellent tell them to send him straight up our best interview room i think winsome when she was packed and ready to head for london maggie took lucy a cup of tea in bed the following morning it was the least she could do after all the poor woman had been through lately they had talked well into the previous night emptying a bottle of white wine between them and lucy had hinted at what a terrible childhood she had suffered and how recent events had brought it all back to mind she had also confided that she was afraid of the police afraid they might try to fabricate some sort of evidence against her and that she couldnt stand the thought of going to jail just one night in the cell had almost been too much for her to bear the police didnt like loose ends she said and in this case she was a very serious loose end indeed she knew they had been watching her and had sneaked out of her foster parents house after dark and taken the first train from hull to york then changed for london where she had worked on changing her appearance mostly through hair makeup and a different style of dress maggie had to agree that the lucy payne she knew wouldnt have been seen dead in the kind of casual clothes she was wearing now nor would she have worn the same slightly tarty makeup maggie agreed to tell no one that lucy was there and if any of the neighbors saw her and asked who she was she would tell them she was a distant relative just passing through both bedrooms the large and the small looked over the hill and when maggie tapped on the door of the smaller room she had given lucy and entered she saw that lucy was already standing by the window stark naked she turned when maggie entered with the tea oh thank you youre so kind maggie felt herself blush she couldnt help but notice what a fine body lucy had the full round breasts taut flat stomach gently curving hips and smooth tapered thighs the dark triangle between her legs lucy seemed completely unembarrassed by her own nakedness but maggie felt uncomfortable and tried to avert her eyes luckily the curtains were still closed and the light was fairly dim but lucy had held them open a little at the top and had clearly been watching the activity across the street it had let up a bit in the past couple of days maggie had noticed but there was still a great deal of coming and going and the front garden was still a complete mess have you seen what theyve done over there said lucy coming forward and accepting the cup of tea she got back into bed and covered herself with the thin white sheet maggie was grateful at least for that yes said maggie thats my house and theyve ruined it completely for me i cant go back there now not ever her lower lip trembled in anger i saw through the door into the hall when someone came out theyve taken all the carpets pulled up the floorboards theyve even punched big holes in the walls theyve just ruined it i suppose they were looking for things lucy its their job looking for what what more could they want ill bet theyve taken all my nice things too all my jewelry and clothes all my memories im sure youll get it all back lucy shook her head no i dont want it all back not now i thought i did but now ive seen what theyve done its tainted ill start over again with just what ive got are you all right for money maggie asked yes thank you we had a bit put away i dont know what will happen to the house the mortgage but i doubt well be able to sell it in that state there must be some sort of compensation maggie said surely they cant just take your house and not compensate you i wouldnt be surprised at anything they could do lucy blew on the tea steam rose around her face look i told you last night maggie said i have to go to london just for a couple of days will you be all right here by yourself yes of course dont worry about me theres plenty of food in the fridge and freezer you know if you dont want to go out or order in thats good thank you said lucy i think i really would just like to stay in and shut out the world and watch television or something try to take my mind off whats been happening theres plenty of videotapes in the cupboard under the tv in my bedroom said maggie please feel free to watch them there whenever you want thank you maggie i will though there was a small television set in the living room the only tvandvcr combination in the entire house was set up in the master bedroom for some reason and that was maggies room not that she wasnt thankful she had often lain in bed unable to sleep and when there was nothing suitable on television had watched one of the love stories or romantic comedies ruth seemed to favor with actors such as hugh grant meg ryan richard gere tom hanks julia roberts and sandra bullock they had helped her through many a long hard night are you sure there isnt anything else you need i cant think of anything lucy said i just want to feel safe and comfortable so i can remember what its like youll be fine here im really sorry i have to leave you so soon but ill be back before long dont worry its okay honest said lucy i didnt come here to interrupt your life or anything youve got your work i know that im only asking for sanctuary for a short time just till i get myself together what are you going to do no idea i suppose i can change my name and get a job somewhere far away from here anyway not to worry you go to london and have a good time i can take care of myself if youre sure im sure lucy got out of bed again put her cup of tea on the bedside table and went back toward the window there she stood providing maggie with a rear view of her finely toned body looking out across the road at what used to be her home i must dash then said maggie the taxi will be here soon bye said lucy without turning round have a good time okay mick said banks i understand you want to talk to us after his night in the cells mick blair didnt at all resemble the cocky teenager they had interviewed yesterday in fact he looked like a frightened kid clearly the prospect of spending several years in a similar or worse facility had worked on his imagination he had also banks knew through the custody sergeant had a long telephone conversation with his parents shortly after his detention and his manner had seemed to change after that he had not asked for a lawyer not yet yeah he said but first tell me what sarah said you know i cant do that mick in fact sarah francis had told them nothing at all she had remained as monosyllabic and as scared and surly as she had in ian scotts flat but that didnt matter as she had been mainly used as a lever against mick anyway banks winsome and mick were in the largest most comfortable interview room it had also been painted recently and banks could smell the paint from the institutionalgreen walls he still had nothing from the lab on samuel gardners car but mick didnt know that he said he wanted to talk but if he decided to play coy again banks could always drop hints about fingerprints and hairs he knew they had been in the car it was something he should have checked at the time with ian scott having a record for taking and driving away given scotts other offense he also had a good idea what the four of them had been up to would you like to make a statement then banks said for the record yes youve been made aware of all your rights yes okay then mick tell us what happened that night what you said yesterday about it going easier with me yes you meant it didnt you i mean whatever sarah said she might have been lying you know to protect herself and ian the courts and the judges look favorably upon people who help the police mick thats a fact ill be honest i cant give you the exact details of what will happen it depends on so many variables but i can tell you that youll have my support for leniency and that should go some distance mick swallowed he was about to rat on his friends banks had witnessed such moments before and knew how difficult it was what conflicting emotions must be struggling for primacy inside mick blairs soul selfpreservation usually won out in bankss experience but sometimes at the cost of selfloathing it was the same for him the watcher he wanted the information and he had coaxed many a weak and sensitive suspect toward informing but when he succeeded the taste of victory was often soured by the bile of disgust not this time though banks thought he wanted to know what had happened to leanne wray far more than he cared about mick blairs discomfort you did steal that car didnt you mick banks began weve already recovered a lot of hair samples and fingerprints well find yours among them wont we and ians sarahs and leannes it was ian blair said it was all ians idea it was nothing to do with me i cant even fucking drive what about sarah sarah ian says jump sarah asks how high and leanne leanne was all for it she was in a pretty wild mood that night i dont know why she said something about her stepmother but i didnt know what the problem was to be honest i didnt really care i mean i didnt want to know about her family problems weve all got problems right indeed we do thought banks you just wanted to get into her knickers then said winsome that seemed to shock blair coming from a woman a beautiful woman at that with a soft jamaican accent no i mean i liked her yes but i wasnt trying it on honest i wasnt trying to force her or anything like that what happened mick banks asked ian said why dont we take a car and do some e and smoke a couple of spliffs and maybe drive up to darlington and go clubbing what about leannes curfew she said fuck the curfew it sounded like a great idea to her like i said she was a bit wild that night shed had a couple of drinks not a lot like just a couple but she didnt usually drink and it was just enough to loosen her up a bit she just wanted to have some fun and you thought you might get lucky again winsomes interjection seemed to confuse blair no yes i mean if she was willing okay i fancied her i thought maybe you know she seemed different more devilmaycare and you thought the drugs would make her even more willing no i dont know he looked at banks in annoyance look do you want me to go on with this or not go on banks gave winsome the signal to keep out of it for the time being he could imagine the scenario easily enough leanne a little drunk giggly flirting with blair a bit as shannon the barmaid had said then ian scott offering ecstasy in the car maybe leanne unsure about it but blair encouraging her egging her on hoping all the time to get her into bed but all that was something they could deal with later on if necessary when they had established the circumstances of leannes disappearance ian stole the car blair went on i dont know anything about stealing cars but he said he learned when he was a kid growing up on the east side estate banks knew all too well that stealing cars was one of the essential skills for kids growing up on the east side estate where did you go north like i said we were going to darlington ian knows the club scene up there soon as we set off ian handed out the e and we all gobbled it up then sarah rolled a spliff and we smoked that banks noticed that it was always someone else committing the illegal act never blair but he filed that away for later had leanne taken ecstasy or smoked marijuana before he asked not to my knowledge she always seemed a bit straitlaced to me but not that night no okay go on what happened mick looked down at the table and banks could tell he was coming to the hard part we hadnt got far out of eastvale maybe half an hour or so when leanne said she felt sick and she could feel her heart was beating way too fast she was having trouble breathing she used that inhaler thing she carried with her but it didnt do any good made her worse if you ask me anyway ian thought she was just panicking or hallucinating or something so first he opened the car windows it didnt do any good though soon she was shaking and sweating i mean she was really scared me too what did you do we were in the country by then up on the moors above lyndgarth so ian pulled off the road and stopped we all got out and walked out on the moor ian thought the open spaces would be good for leanne a breath of fresh air that maybe she was just getting claustrophobic in the car did it help mick turned pale no soon as we got out she was sick i mean really sick then she collapsed she couldnt breathe and she seemed to be choking did you know she was asthmatic like i said i saw her use the inhaler in the car when she first started feeling weird and it didnt enter your mind that ecstasy might be dangerous for an asthma sufferer or that it might cause a bad reaction with the inhalant how could i know im not a doctor no but you do take ecstasy i doubt this was your first time and you must have been aware of some of the adverse publicity the leah betts story for example the girl who died about five years ago a few others since i heard about them yes but i thought you just had to be careful about your body temperature when you were dancing you know like drink plenty of water and be careful you dont dehydrate thats only one of the dangers did you give her the inhaler again when she became worse out on the moor we couldnt find it it must have been back in the car in her bag besides it had only made her worse banks remembered viewing the contents of leannes shoulder bag and seeing the inhaler there among her personal items doubting that she would have run away without it didnt it also cross your mind that she might have been choking on her own vomit he went on i dont know i never really what did you do thats just it we didnt know what to do we just tried to give her some breathing space some air you know but all of a sudden she sort of twitched and after that she didnt move at all banks let the silence stretch for a few moments conscious only of their breathing and the soft electric hum of the tape machines why didnt you take her to the hospital he asked it was too late i told you she was dead you were certain of that yes we checked her pulse felt for a heartbeat tried to see if she was breathing but there was nothing she was dead it all happened so quickly i mean we were feeling the e too we were panicking a bit not thinking clearly banks knew of at least three other recent ecstasyrelated deaths in the region so blairs account didnt surprise him too much mdma short for methylenedioxymethamphetamine was a popular drug with young people because it was cheap and kept you going all night at raves and clubs it was believed to be safe though mick was right that you had to be careful about your water intake and body temperature but it could also be particularly dangerous to people suffering from high blood pressure or asthma like leanne why didnt you take her to a hospital when you were all still in the car ian said shed be okay if we just got out and walked around for a while he said hed seen that kind of reaction before what did you do then after you discovered she was dead ian said we couldnt tell anyone what had happened that wed all go to jail so what did you do we carried her further out on the moor and buried her i mean there was a sort of sinkhole not very deep by a bit of brokendown drystone wall so we put her in there and we covered her up with stones and bracken nobody could find her unless they were really looking and there werent any public footpaths nearby even the animals couldnt get to her it was so desolate the middle of nowhere and then then we drove back to eastvale we were all badly shaken up but ian said we ought to be seen about the place you know acting natural as if things were normal and leannes shoulder bag that was ians idea i mean wed all decided by then that wed just say she left us outside the pub and set off home and that was the last we saw of her i found her bag on the backseat of the car and ian said maybe if we dumped it in someones garden near the old ship the police would think shed been picked up by a pervert or something and indeed we did thought banks one simple spurofthemoment action added to two other missing girls whose bags had also been found close to the scenes of their disappearances and the entire chameleon task force had been created but not in time to save melissa horrocks or kimberley myers he felt sick and angry there was mile after mile of moorland up beyond lyndgarth banks knew none of it farmed blair was right about the isolation too only the occasional rambler crossed it and then usually by the wellmarked paths can you remember where you buried her he asked i think so said blair i dont know about the exact spot but within a couple of hundred yards youll know it when you see the old wall banks looked at winsome get a search party together would you dc jackman and have young mick here go out with them let me know the minute you find anything and have ian scott and sarah francis picked up winsome stood up thatll do for now banks said whatll happen to me blair asked i dont know mick said banks i honestly dont know the interview had gone well maggie thought as she walked out on to portland place behind her broadcasting house looked like the stern of a huge ocean liner inside it had been a maze she hadnt known how anyone could find their way around even if they had worked there for years thank the lord the programs researcher had met her in the lobby then guided her through security to the entrails of the building it started to rain lightly so maggie ducked into starbucks sitting on a stool by the counter that stretched along the front window sipping her latte and watching the people outside wrestle with their umbrellas she reviewed her day it was after three oclock in the afternoon and the rush hour already seemed to have begun if it ever ended in london the interview she had just given had focused almost entirely on the generalities of domestic abuse things to watch out for patterns to avoid falling into rather than her own personal story or that of her cointerviewee an abused wife who had gone on to become a psychological counselor they had exchanged addresses and phone numbers and agreed to get in touch then the woman had had to dash off to give another interview lunch with sally the art director had gone well too they had eaten at a rather expensive italian restaurant near victoria station and sally had looked over the sketches making helpful suggestions here and there mostly though they had talked about recent events in leeds and sally had shown only the natural curiosity that anyone who happened to live across the street from a serial killer might expect maggie had been evasive when questioned about lucy lucy the poor woman maggie felt guilty for leaving her alone in that big house on the hill right opposite where the nightmare of her own life had recently come to a head lucy had said she would be okay but was she just trying to put a brave face on things maggie hadnt been able to get tickets for the play she wanted to see it was so popular it was sold out even on a wednesday she thought she might book into the little hotel anyway and go to the cinema instead but the more she thought about it and the more she looked out at the hordes of passing strangers the more she thought she ought to be there for lucy what she would do she decided was wait till the rain stopped it only looked like a mild shower and she could already see some blue clouds in the sky over the langham hilton across the road do some shopping on oxford street and then head home in the early evening and surprise lucy maggie felt much better when she had decided to go home after all what was the point going to the cinema by herself when lucy needed someone to talk to someone to help take her mind off her problems and help her decide what to do with her future when the rain had stopped completely maggie drained her latte and set out she would buy lucy a little present too nothing expensive or ostentatious but perhaps a bracelet or a necklace something to mark her freedom after all as lucy had said the police had taken all her things and she didnt want them back now she was about to start a new life it was late in the afternoon when banks got the call to drive out to the wheaton moor north of lyndgarth and he took winsome with him she had done enough work on the leanne wray case to be there at the end most of the daffodils were gone but white and pink blossoms covered the trees and the hedgerows glowed with the burnished gold stars of celandines gorse flowered bright yellow all over the moors he parked as close as he could to the cluster of figures but they still had almost a quarter of a mile to walk over the springy gorse and heather blair and the others had certainly carried leanne a long way from civilization though the sun was shining and there were only a few high clouds the wind was cold banks was glad of his sports jacket winsome was wearing calfhigh leather boots and a herringbone jacket over her black poloneck sweater she strode with grace and confidence whereas banks caught his ankle and stumbled every now and then in the thick gorse time to get out and exercise more he told himself and time to stop smoking they reached the team that winsome had dispatched about three hours ago mick blair handcuffed to one of the uniformed officers greasy hair blowing in the wind another officer pointed down the shallow sinkhole and banks saw part of a hand most of the flesh eaten away the stillwhite bone showing we tried to disturb the scene as little as possible sir the officer went on i sent for the socos and the rest of the team they said theyd get here asap banks thanked him he glanced back toward the road and saw a car and a van pull up figures get out and make their way across the rough moorland some of them in white coveralls the socos had soon roped off an area of several yards around the mound of stones and peter darby the local crime scene photographer got to work now all they needed was dr burns the police surgeon dr glendenning the home office pathologist would most likely conduct the pm but he was too old and important to go scrambling across the moors anymore dr burns was skilled banks knew and he already had plenty of experience of onscene examinations it was another ten minutes before dr burns arrived by then peter darby had finished photographing the scene intact and it was time to uncover the remains this the socos did slowly and carefully so as not to disturb any evidence mick blair had said that leanne died after taking ecstasy but he could be lying he could have tried to rape her and choked her when she didnt comply either way they couldnt go around jumping to conclusions about leanne not this time banks began to feel that the whole thing was just too damn familiar standing out there on the moors with his jacket flapping around him as men in white coveralls uncovered a body then he remembered harold steadman the local historian they had found buried under a similar drystone wall below crow scar that had been only his second case in eastvale back when the kids were still at school and he and sandra were happily married yet it seemed centuries ago now he wondered what on earth a drystone wall was doing up here anyway then realized it had probably marked the end of someones property long ago property that had now gone to moorland overgrown with heather and gorse the elements had done their work on the wall and nobody had any interest in repairing it stone by stone the body was uncovered as soon as he saw the blond hair banks knew it was leanne wray she was still wearing the clothes she had gone missing in jeans white nike trainers tshirt and a light suede jacket and that was something in blairs favor banks thought though there was some decomposition and evidence of insect and smallanimal activity a missing finger on her right hand for example the cool weather had kept her from becoming a complete skeleton in fact despite the splitting of the skin to expose the muscle and fat on her left cheek banks was able to recognize leannes face from the photographs he had seen when the body was completely uncovered everyone stood back as if they were at a funeral paying their last respects before the interment rather than at an exhumation the moor was silent but for the wind whistling and groaning among the stones like lost souls mick blair was crying banks noticed either that or the chill wind was making his eyes water seen enough mick he asked mick sobbed then abruptly turned away and vomited noisily and copiously into the gorse bankss mobile rang as he turned away to go back to his car it was stefan nowak and he sounded excited alan what is it stefan identified the sixth victim no but i thought youd like to know immediately weve found paynes camcorder tell me where said banks and ill be with you as fast as i possibly can maggie was tired when her train pulled into city station around nine oclock that evening half an hour late due to a cow in a tunnel outside wakefield now she had an inkling of why the british complained so much about their trains there was a long queue at the taxi rank and maggie only had a light holdall to carry so she decided to walk around the corner to boar lane and catch a bus there were plenty of them that stopped within a short walk of the hill it was a pleasant evening no sign of rain here and there were still plenty of people on the streets the bus soon came and she sat at the back downstairs two elderly woman sat in front her just come from the bingo one with hair that looked like a sort of blue haze sprinkled with glitter her perfume irritated maggies nose and made her sneeze so she moved even farther back it was a familiar journey by now and maggie spent most of it reading another story in the new alice munro paperback she had bought on charing cross road she had also bought the perfect present for lucy it nestled in its little blue box in her holdall it was an odd piece of jewelry and had immediately caught her eye hanging on a thin silver chain it was a circular silver disc about the size of a tenpenny piece inside the circle made by a snake swallowing its own tail was an image of the phoenix rising maggie hoped that lucy would like and appreciate the sentiment the bus turned the last corner maggie rang the bell and got off near the top of the hill the streets were quiet and the western sky was still smeared with the reds and purples of sunset there was a slight chill in the air now maggie noticed giving a little shiver she saw mrs toth claires mother crossing the hill with some fish and chips wrapped in newspaper and said hello then turned to the steps she fumbled for her keys as she made her way up the dark steps overhung with shrubbery it was hard to see her way a perfect place for an ambush she thought then wished she hadnt bills telephone call still weighed on her mind the house seemed to be in darkness perhaps lucy was out maggie doubted it then she got past the bushes and noticed a flickering light coming from the master bedroom she was watching television for a moment maggie felt the uncharitable wish that she still had the house to herself the knowledge that there was someone in her bedroom bothered her but she had told lucy she could watch television up there if she wanted and she could hardly just march in and kick her out tired as she was perhaps they should change rooms if lucy just wanted to watch television all the time maggie would be quite happy in the small bedroom for a few days she turned the key in the lock and went inside then put down her bag and hung up her jacket before heading upstairs to tell lucy she had decided to come back early as she glided up on the thick pile carpet she could hear sounds from the television but couldnt make out what they were it sounded like somebody shouting the bedroom door was slightly ajar so without even thinking to knock maggie simply pushed it open and walked in lucy law sprawled on the bed naked well that wasnt too much of a surprise after this mornings display maggie thought but when she turned to see what was on television she didnt want to believe her eyes at first she thought it was just a porn movie though why lucy should be watching something like that and where she had got it from were beyond her then she noticed the homemade quality the makeshift lighting it was some sort of cellar and there was a girl who appeared to be tied to a bed a man stood beside her playing with himself and shouting obscenities maggie recognized him a woman lay with her head between the girls legs and in the split second it took maggie to register all this the woman turned licked her lips and grinned mischievously at the camera lucy oh no maggie said turning to lucy who was looking at her now with those dark impenetrable eyes maggie put her hand to her mouth she felt sick sick and afraid she turned to leave but heard a sudden movement behind then felt a splitting pain at the back of her head and the world exploded the pond was gathering the evening light by the time banks got there after taking mick blair back to eastvale making sure ian scott and sarah francis were under lock and key and picking up jenny fuller on his way out of town winsome and sergeant hatchley could take care of things at eastvale until tomorrow morning the colors shimmered on the waters surface like an oil slick and the ducks having noticed so much human activity were keeping a polite and safe distance and no doubt wondering where the expected chunks of bread had got to the panasonic super camcorder lay still attached to its tripod on a piece of cloth on the bank ds stefan nowak and dci ken blackstone had stayed with it until banks could get there are you sure its the one banks asked ken blackstone blackstone nodded one of our enterprising young dcs succeeded in tracking down the branch where payne bought it he paid cash for it on the third of march last year the serial number checks out any tapes one in the camera said stefan ruined no chance of restoration all the kings horses only the one thats all stefan nodded believe me the men went over every inch of the place he gestured to take in the area of the pond if any tapes had been dumped here wed have found them by now so where are they banks asked nobody in particular if you want my guess said stefan id say whoever chucked the camcorder in the lake dubbed them on to vhs theres some loss of quality but its the only way you can watch them on a regular vcr without the camcorder banks nodded makes sense to me better take it to millgarth and lock it up safe in the property room though what good its going to do us now i dont know stefan bent to pick up the camera wrapping it carefully in the cloth as if it were a newborn baby you never know banks noticed the pub sign about a hundred yards away the woodcutters it was a chain pub that much he could tell even from a distance but it was all there was in sight its been a long day and i havent had my tea yet he said to blackstone and jenny after stefan had driven off to millgarth why dont we have a drink and toss a few ideas around youll get no objection from me said blackstone jenny jenny smiled not much choice have i i came in your car remember but count me in they were soon settled at a corner table in the almost empty pub which banks found to his delight was still serving food he ordered a beef burger and chips along with a pint of bitter the jukebox wasnt so loud that they couldnt hear themselves talk but it was loud enough to mask their conversation from any nearby tables so what have we got banks asked when he had his burger in front of him a useless camcorder by the looks of it said blackstone but what does it mean it means that someone payne presumably chucked it away why search me come on ken we can do better than this blackstone smiled sorry its been a long day for me too its an interesting question though said jenny why and when well it has to have been before pcs taylor and morrisey entered the cellar said banks but payne had a captive remember said blackstone kimberley myers why on earth would he ditch his camera when he was doing exactly the sort of things we assume he liked to videotape and what did he do with the dubbed vhs tapes if stefans right about that i cant answer those questions jenny said but i can offer another way of looking at them i think i know what youre getting at said banks you do uhhuh lucy payne he took a bite of his beef burger not bad he thought but he was so hungry he would have eaten just about anything by then jenny nodded slowly why have we still been assuming that this video business was all down to terence payne when weve been investigating lucy as a possible partner in crime all along especially after what laura and keith told me about lucys past and what that young prostitute told alan about her sexual proclivities i mean doesnt it make sense psychologically that she was just as involved as he was remember the girls were killed in exactly the same way as kathleen murray ligature strangulation are you saying that she killed them blackstone asked not necessarily but if what keith and laura say is true then lucy might have seen herself acting as a deliverer the way it appears she did with kathleen a mercy killing but you said earlier she killed kathleen out of jealousy i said that jealousy certainly could have been a motive one that her sister laura didnt want to believe but lucys motives could have been mixed nothings simple in a personality like hers but why blackstone went on even if it was her why would she throw away the camera banks speared a chip and thought for a moment before answering lucys terrified of jail if she thought there was any chance of imminent capture and it must have entered her mind after the first police visit and the connection between kimberley myers and silverhill school then might she not start making plans for selfpreservation it all seems a bit farfetched to me not to me ken said banks look at it from lucys point of view shes not stupid brighter than her husband id say terence payne kidnaps kimberley myers that friday night hes out of control becoming disorganized but lucys still organized she sees the end coming fast first thing she does is get rid of as much evidence as possible including the camcorder maybe thats what sets terry against her causes the row obviously she has no way of knowing that it will end the way it does at the time it does so she has to improvise see which way the winds blowing if we find any traces of her being in the cellar which we do which we do banks agreed then shes got a believable explanation for that too she heard a noise and went to investigate and surprise surprise look what she found the fact that her husband clobbers her with a vase only helps her case and the tapes she wouldnt throw them away jenny answered not if they were a record of what she of what they had done the cameras nothing merely a means to an end you can buy another camera but those tapes would be more valuable than diamonds to the paynes because theyre unique and they cant be replaced theyre her trophies she could watch them over and over again and relive those moments with the victims in the cellar its the next best thing to the reality for her she wouldnt throw them away then where are they said banks and where is she said jenny isnt it just remotely possible banks suggested pushing his plate aside that the two questions have the same answer maggie woke up with a splitting headache and a feeling of nausea deep in the pit of her stomach she felt weak and disoriented didnt know at first where she was or how much time had gone by since she lost consciousness the curtains were open and she could see it was dark outside as things slowly came into focus she realized she was still in her own bedroom there was one bedside lamp turned on the other lay in pieces on the floor that must have been what lucy hit her with maggie thought she could feel something warm and sticky in her hair blood lucy hit her the sudden revelation shocked her closer to consciousness she had seen the video lucy and terry doing things to that poor girl lucy looking as if she were enjoying herself maggie tried to move and found that her hands and feet were bound to the brass bed she was tied up and spreadeagled just like the girl on the video she felt the panic rise in her she thrashed around trying to get loose but only succeeding in making the bedsprings creak loudly the door opened and lucy came in she was dressed in her jeans and tshirt again lucy shook her head slowly look what you made me do maggie she said just look at what you made me do you told me you werent coming back for another day it was you maggie said on that video it was you it was vile disgusting you werent supposed to see that said lucy sitting at the edge of the bed and stroking maggies brow maggie flinched lucy laughed oh dont worry maggie dont be such a prude youre not my type anyway you killed them you and terry together youre wrong there said lucy getting up again and pacing the room arms folded terry never killed anyone he didnt have the bottle oh he liked them tied up naked all right he liked to do things to them even after they were dead but i had to do all the killing myself poor things see they could only take so much and then i had to put them to sleep i was always gentle gentle as i could be youre insane said maggie thrashing around on the bed again keep still lucy sat on the bed again but this time she didnt touch maggie insane i dont think so just because you cant understand me doesnt mean im insane im different true i see things differently i need different things but im not insane but why i cant explain myself to you i cant even explain myself to me she laughed again least of all to me oh the psychiatrists and psychologists would try they would dissect my childhood and toss around their theories but even they know when it gets right down to it that theyve got no explanations for someone like me i just am i happen like fivelegged sheep and twoheaded dogs call it what you will call me evil if it helps you understand more important right now though is how am i going to survive why dont you just go run away i wont say anything lucy gave her a sad smile i wish that were true maggie i wish things were as easy as that they are maggie said go just go disappear i cant do that youve seen the tape you know i cant let you just walk around with that knowledge look maggie i dont want to kill you but i think i can and i think i must i promise ill be every bit as gentle as i was with the others why me maggie whimpered why did you pick on me you easy because you were so willing to believe that i was a victim of domestic violence just like you true enough terry had been getting unpredictable and had lashed out on one or two occasions its an unfortunate thing that men like him lack the brains but they dont lack for brawn no matter now do you know how i met him no he raped me you dont believe me i can tell how could you how could anyone but he did i was walking to the bus stop after id been to a pub with some friends and he dragged me in an alley and raped me he had a knife he raped you and you married him you didnt tell the police lucy laughed he didnt know what he was getting into i gave him the rape of his life it might have taken him a while to realize it but i was raping him as much as he was raping me it wasnt my first time maggie believe me i know all about rape from experts there was nothing he could do that hadnt been done to me before time after time by more than one person he thought he was in control but sometimes its the victim whos really in control we had a lot in common we soon found out sexually and in other ways he kept on raping girls even after we were together i encouraged him i used to make him tell me all the details of what hed done to them while we were fucking i dont understand maggie was crying and trembling no longer able to keep her horror and fear in check now she knew there was no chance of reasoning with lucy of course you dont lucy said soothingly sitting on the edge of the bed and stroking maggies brow why should you but youve been useful and id like to thank you for that first you gave me somewhere to hide the tapes i knew they were the only things that might incriminate me other than terry and i didnt think hed talk besides hes dead now what do you mean about the tapes they were here all along maggie remember i came to see you that sunday before all hell broke loose yes i brought them with me and hid them behind some boxes up in the loft when i went up to the toilet youd already told me you never went up there dont you remember maggie did remember the loft was an airless dusty place she had discovered on her first and only look which gave her the willies and aggravated her allergies she must have mentioned it to lucy when showing her around the house is that why you made friends with me because you thought i might be useful i thought i might have need of a friend somewhere down the line yes a defender even and you were good thank you for all youve said on my behalf thank you for believing in me im not enjoying this you know i get no pleasure from killing its a pity it has to end this way but it doesnt maggie begged oh god please dont just go i wont say anything i promise oh you say that now now that youre full of fear of death but if i go you wont feel that way anymore and youll tell the police everything i wont i promise i wish i could believe you maggie i really do its true lucy took the belt off her jeans what are you doing i told you ill be gentle its nothing to be frightened of just a little pain then youll go to sleep no someone banged on the front door lucy froze and maggie held her breath be quiet lucy hissed putting her hand over maggies mouth theyll go away but the banging continued then came a voice maggie open up its the police we know youre in there we spoke to your neighbor she saw you come home open up maggie we want to talk to you its very important maggie could see fear in lucys expression she struggled to shout but the hand covered her mouth almost cut off her breath is she with you maggie the voice continued it was banks maggie realized the detective who made her angry if only he stayed broke down the door and rescued her shed apologize shed do whatever he wanted is that who it is banks went on the blond girl your neighbor saw is it lucy did she change her appearance if its you lucy we know all about kathleen murray weve got a lot of questions for you maggie come down and open up if lucys with you dont trust her we think she hid the tapes in your house be quiet lucy said and went out of the room im here maggie immediately yelled at the top of her lungs not sure if they could hear her or not shes here too lucy shes going to kill me please help me lucy came back into the bedroom but she didnt seem concerned by maggies screams theyre out back too she said crossing her arms what can i do i cant go to jail i couldnt stand to be locked up in the cage for the rest of my days lucy maggie said as evenly as she could manage untie me and open the door let them in im sure theyll be lenient theyll see you need help but lucy wasnt listening she had started pacing again and muttering to herself all maggie could catch was the word cage again and again then she heard an almighty crash from downstairs as the police broke the front door then the sound of men running up the stairs im up here she yelled lucy looked at her almost pitifully maggie thought said try not to hate me too much then she took a run and dived through the bedroom window in a shower of glass maggie screamed for someone who disliked hospitals as much as banks did he seemed to have spent more than enough time in the infirmary over the past couple of weeks he thought as he walked down the corridor to maggie forrests private room on thursday oh its you maggie said when he knocked and walked in she wouldnt look him in the eye he noticed but stared at the wall the bandage over her forehead held the dressing at the back of her head in place the wound had been a nasty one requiring several stitches she had also lost a lot of blood when banks had got to her the pillow was soaked with it according to the doctor though she was out of the woods and should be okay to go home in a day or so now she was being treated for delayed shock as much as anything looking at her banks thought of the day not so long ago when he first saw lucy payne in a hospital bed one eye bandaged the other assessing her situation black hair spread out on the white pillow is that all the thanks i get he said thanks for bringing in the cavalry it was my idea you know true i was only doing my job but people sometimes feel the need to add a word or two of personal thanks dont worry i dont expect a tip or anything its easy for you to be flippant isnt it banks pulled up the chair and sat at her bedside maybe not as easy as you think how are you fine really im all right a bit sore its hardly surprising was it really you was what really me maggie looked him in the eye for the first time hers were dulled with medication but he could see pain and confusion there along with something softer something less definable who led the rescue party banks leaned back and sighed i only blame myself that it took me so long he said what do you mean i should have worked it out earlier i had all the pieces i just didnt put them together quickly enough not until the soco team found the camcorder in the pond at the bottom of the hill thats where it was yes lucy must have dumped it there sometime over that last weekend i go there sometimes to think and feed the ducks maggie stared at the wall then turned to face him again after a few seconds anyway its hardly your fault is it youre not a mind reader no people sometimes expect me to be but i suppose im not not in this case we suspected from the start that there must have been a camcorder and tapes and we knew she wouldnt part with the tapes easily we also knew that the only person she was close to was you and that she had visited your house the day before the domestic disturbance she couldnt have known what was going to happen no but she knew things were coming to a head she was working on damage control and hiding the tapes was part of it where were they the loft maggie said she knew i didnt go up there and she knew shed be able to get at them without too much trouble that you were probably the only person in the whole country whod give her house room that was the other clue there was really nowhere else for her to go first we talked to your neighbors and when claires mother told us youd just got home and another neighbor said shed seen a young woman knocking at your back door a couple of nights ago it seemed to add up you must think i was so stupid to take her in foolish maybe naïve but not necessarily stupid she just seemed so so so much the victim yes i wanted to believe in her needed to maybe as much for me as for her i dont know banks nodded she played the role well she could do that because it was partially true shed had a lot of practice what do you mean banks told her about the alderthorpe seven and the murder of kathleen murray when he had finished maggie turned pale swallowed and lay back in silence staring at the ceiling it was a minute or so before she spoke again she killed her cousin when she was only twelve yes thats partly what set us looking for her again at last we had a bit of evidence that suggested she was more than she pretended to be but a lot of people have terrible childhoods said maggie some color returning to her face perhaps not as terrible as that but they dont all turn into killers what was so different about lucy i wish i knew the answer said banks terry payne was a rapist when they met and lucy had killed kathleen somehow or other the two of them getting together the way they did created a special sort of chemistry acted as a trigger we dont know why well probably never know and if theyd never met banks shrugged it may never have happened none of it terry finally gets caught for rape and put in jail while lucy goes on to marry a nice young man have two point four children and become a bank manager who knows makes sense shed done it before he hadnt she said she did it out of kindness maybe she did or out of selfprotection or out of jealousy you cant expect her to understand her own motives any better than we can or to tell the truth about them with someone like lucy it was probably some strange sort of combination of all three she also said they met because he raped her tried to rape her i couldnt really understand she said she raped him as much as he raped her banks shifted in his chair he wished he could have a cigarette even though he had determined to quit before the year was out i cant explain it any more than you can maggie i might be a policeman and i might have seen a lot more of the dark side of human nature than you but something like this for someone with a past like lucys who knows how topsyturvy things can get i should imagine that after the things that had been done to her in alderthorpe and given her peculiar sexual tastes terence payne was a bit of a pussycat to deal with she said to think of her as a fivelegged sheep the image took banks back to his childhood when the traveling fair came around at easter and in autumn and set up on the local recreation ground there were rides waltzers caterpillar dodgems and speedway and stalls where you could throw weighted darts at playing cards or shoot at tin figures with an air rifle to win a goldfish in a plastic bag full of water there were flashing lights and crowds and loud music but there was also the freak show a tent set up on the edge of the fairground where you paid your sixpence and went inside to see the exhibits they were ultimately disappointing not a genuine bearded lady elephant man spider woman or pinhead in sight those kinds of freaks banks only saw later in todd brownings famous movie none of these freaks were alive for a start they were deformed animals stillborn or killed at birth and they floated in the huge glass jars full of preserving fluid a lamb with a fifth leg sticking out of its side a kitten with horns a puppy with two heads a calf with no eye sockets the stuff that nightmares were made of despite what happened maggie went on i want you to know that im not going to let it turn me into a cynic i know you think im naïve but if thats the choice id rather be naïve than bitter and untrusting you made a mistake in judgment and it almost got you killed do you think she would have killed me if you hadnt come do you i dont know ive got a lot of thinking to do but lucy was she was as much a victim as anything you werent there you didnt hear her she didnt want to kill me maggie for crying out loud will you just listen to yourself she murdered god knows how many young girls she would have killed you believe me if i were you id put the victim thing right out of my mind im not you banks took a deep breath and sighed lucky for both of us isnt it what will you do now do will you stay at the hill yes i think so maggie scratched at her bandages then squinted at banks i dont really have anywhere else to go and theres still my work of course another thing ive discovered through all this is that i can also do some good i can be a voice for people who dont have one or who dont dare speak out people listen to me banks nodded he didnt say so but he suspected that maggies very public championing of lucy payne might well tarnish her ability to act as a believable spokesperson for abused women but perhaps not about all you could say about the public when it came right down to it was that they were a fickle lot maybe maggie would emerge as a heroine look youd better get some rest banks said i just wanted to see how you were well want to talk to you in some detail later but theres no hurry not now isnt it all over banks looked into her eyes he could tell she wanted it to be over wanted to stand at a distance and think it through get her life going again work good deeds the lot there still might be a trial he said a trial but i dont havent you heard heard what i just assumed oh shit ive been pretty much out of it what with the drugs and all what is it banks leaned forward and rested his hand on her forearm maggie he said i dont know how to say this any other way but lucy payne isnt dead maggie recoiled from his touch and her eyes widened not dead but i dont understand i thought i mean she she jumped out of the window yes but the fall didnt kill her your front path is overgrown and the bushes broke her fall the thing is though she landed on the sharp edge of one of the steps and broke her back its serious very serious theres severe damage to the spinal cord what does that mean the surgeons arent sure of the full extent of her injuries yet theyve got a lot more tests to do but they think shell be paralyzed from the neck down but lucys not dead no shell be in a wheelchair if she survives maggie looked toward the window again banks could see tears glistening in her eyes so she is in a cage after all banks stood up to leave he was finding maggies compassion for a killer of teenage girls difficult to take and didnt trust himself not to say something hed regret just as he got to the door he heard her small voice superintendent banks he turned hand on doorknob yes thank you are you all right love yes why shouldnt i be said janet taylor nothing the shopkeeper said only janet picked up her bottle of gin from the counter paid him and walked out of the offlicense what was up with him she wondered had she suddenly sprouted an extra head or something it was saturday evening and she had hardly been out since her arrest and release on bail the previous monday but she didnt think she looked that different from the last time shed been in the shop she climbed back up to her flat above the hairdressers and when she turned her key in the lock and walked inside she noticed the smell for the first time and the mess you didnt notice it so much when you were living in the midst of it she thought but you certainly did when you went out and came back to it dirty clothes lay strewn everywhere halffull coffee cups grew mold and the plant on the windowsill had died and wilted the smell was of stale skin rotting cabbage sweat and gin and some of it she realized turning her nose toward her armpit came from her own body janet looked in the mirror it didnt surprise her to see the lank lifeless hair and the dark bags under her eyes after all she had hardly slept since it happened she didnt like to close her eyes because when she did it all seemed to play over and over again inside her mind the only times she could get any rest at all were when shed had enough gin and passed out for an hour or two no dreams came then only oblivion but as soon as she started to stir the memory and the depression kicked in again she didnt really care what happened to her as long as the nightmares sleeping and waking went away let them kick her off the job put her in jail even she didnt care as long as they also wiped out the memory of that morning in the cellar didnt they have machines or drugs that could do that or was that only something shed seen in a movie still she was better off than lucy payne she told herself paralyzed from the neck down in a wheelchair for life by the sound of it but it was no less than she deserved janet remembered lucy lying in the hall blood pooling around her head wound remembered her own concern for the abused woman her anger at denniss male chauvinism appearances now shed give anything to have dennis back and thought even paralysis too slight a punishment for lucy payne moving away from the mirror janet stripped off her clothes and tossed them on the floor she would have a bath she decided maybe it would make her feel better first she poured herself a large gin and took it into the bathroom with her she put the plug in and turned on the taps got the temperature right poured in a capful of bubble bath she looked at herself in the fulllength mirror on the back of the bathroom door her breasts were starting to sag and the lardcolored skin was creasing around her belly she used to take good care of herself work out at the police gym at least three times a week go out for a run not for a couple of weeks though before dipping her toes into the water she decided to bring the bottle and set it on the edge of the tub shed only have to get out and fetch it soon anyway finally she lay back and let the bubbles tickle her neck at least she could clean herself that would be a start no more offlicense clerks asking her if she was all right because she smelled as for the bags under her eyes well they wouldnt go away overnight but she would work on them and on tidying up the flat on the other hand she thought after a good long sip of gin there were razor blades in the bathroom cabinet all she had to do was stand up and reach for them the water was good and hot she was certain she would feel no pain just a quick slit on each wrist then put her arms underwater and let the blood seep out it would be like going to sleep only there would be no dreams as she lay there wrapped in the warmth and softness of the bubble bath her eyelids started to droop and she couldnt keep her eyes open there she was again in that stinking cellar with dennis spurting blood all over the place and that maniac payne coming at her with a machete what could she have done differently that seemed to be the question that nobody could or would answer for her what should she have done she jerked to consciousness gasping for breath and at first the bathtub looked as if it were full of blood she reached out for the gin but she was clumsy and she knocked the bottle on the bathroom floor it shattered on the tiles and spilled its precious contents shit that meant shed have to go out and buy more she picked up the bath mat and shook it hard to get rid of any glass that might have lodged there then she hauled herself out of the tub when she stepped on to the mat she underestimated her capacity for balance and stumbled a little her right foot hit the tiles and she felt the sting of the glass on her sole janet winced with pain leaving a thin trail of blood on the bathroom floor she negotiated her way into the living room without further injury sat down and pulled out a couple of large slivers of glass then she put on some old slippers and went back for peroxide and bandages first she sat on the toilet seat and poured the peroxide as best she could over the sole of her foot she almost screamed out in pain but soon the waves abated and her foot just started to throb then turn numb she swathed it in bandages then went to her bedroom and got dressed putting on clean clothes and extrathick socks she had to get out of the flat she decided and not just for as long as it took to go to the offlicense a good drive would help keep her awake the windows wide open breeze blowing in her hair rock music and chatter on the radio maybe shed drop in on annie cabbot the only decent copper among them or perhaps shed drive out into the country and find a b ampb where nobody knew who she was or what she had done and stay a night or two anything to get away from this filthy smelly place she could pick up another bottle on the way at least now she was clean and no stuffy offlicense clerk was going to turn his nose up at her janet hesitated a moment before she picked up her car keys then pocketed them anyway what more could they do to her add insult to injury and charge her with drink driving fuck the lot of them janet thought laughing to herself as she limped down the stairs that same evening three days since lucy payne had jumped out of maggie forrests bedroom window banks was at home listening to thaïs in his cozy living room with the meltedbrie ceiling and the blue walls it was his first escape from the paperwork since he had visited maggie forrest in hospital on thursday and he was enjoying it immensely still uncertain about his future he had decided that before making any major career decisions he would first take a holiday and think things over he had plenty of leave due and had already talked to red ron and picked up a few travel brochures now it was a matter of deciding where to go he had also spent quite a lot of time over the past couple of days standing at his office window looking down on the market square and thinking about maggie forrest thinking about her conviction and her compassion and now he was still thinking about her at home lucy payne had tied maggie to the bed and was about to strangle her with a belt when the police broke in yet maggie still saw lucy as the victim and could shed tears for her was she a saint or a fool banks didnt know when he thought about the girls lucy and terry payne had violated terrorized and murdered of kelly matthews samantha foster melissa horrocks kimberley myers and katya pavelic paralysis wasnt sufficient it didnt hurt enough but when he thought of lucys violent and abusive childhood at alderthorpe then a quick clean death or a lifetime of solitary confinement seemed a more apt punishment as usual what he thought didnt really matter because the whole business was out of his hands the judgment not his to make perhaps the best he could hope for was to put lucy payne out of his mind which he would succeed in doing over time partially at any rate she would always be there they all were killers and victims but in time she would fade and become a more shadowy figure than she was at the moment banks had not forgotten the sixth victim she had a name and unless her childhood was like lucy paynes someone must have once loved her held her and whispered words of comfort after a nightmare perhaps soothed away the pain when she fell and scraped her knee he would have to be patient the forensic experts were good at their jobs and eventually her bones would yield up something that would lead to her identity just as the famous meditation at the end of the first cd started his phone rang he was off duty and at first thought of not answering but curiosity got the better of him as it always did it was annie cabbot and she sounded as if she were standing in the middle of a road there was no much noise around her voices sirens car brakes people shouting orders annie where the hell are you roundabout on the ripon road just north of harrogate annie said shouting to make herself heard over the noise what are you doing there somebody spoke to annie though banks couldnt hear what was said she answered abruptly and then came back on the line sorry its a bit chaotic down here whats going on i thought you ought to know its janet taylor what about her she ran into another car she what how is she shes dead alan dead they havent been able to get her body out of the car yet but they know shes dead they got her handbag out and found my card in it bloody hell banks felt numb how did it happen cant say for sure annie said the person in the car behind her says she just seemed to speed up at the roundabout rather than slow down and she hit the car that was going round a mother driving her daughter home from a piano lesson oh jesus christ what happened to them the mothers okay cuts and bruises shock the daughter its touch and go the paramedics suspect internal injuries but they wont know till they get her to hospital shes still stuck in the car was janet pissed dont know yet i wouldnt be surprised if drinking had something to do with it though and she was depressed i dont know she might have been trying to kill herself if she did its banks could sense annie choking up annie i know what youre going to say but even if she did do it on purpose its not your fault you didnt go down there in that cellar see what she saw do what she did all you did was carry out an unbiased investigation unbiased christ alan i bent over backward to be sympathetic toward her whatever its not your fault easy for you to say annie she was no doubt drunk and she went off the road maybe youre right i cant believe that janet would take someone else with her if she wanted to kill herself but whichever way you look at it drunk or not suicide or not its still down to what happened isnt it it happened annie nothing to do with you the politics the fucking politics do you want me to come down no im okay annie sorry got to go now theyre pulling the girl out of the car she hung up leaving banks holding the receiver and breathing quickly janet taylor another casualty of the paynes the first cd had finished and banks had no real desire to listen to the second one after the news he had just heard he poured himself two fingers of laphroaig and took his cigarettes outside to his spot by the falls and as the vivid orange and purple colors streaked the western sky he drank a silent toast to janet taylor and to the nameless dead girl buried in the paynes garden but he hadnt been out there five minutes when he decided he should go to annie had to go no matter what she had said their romantic relationship might be over but he had promised to be her friend and give her support if she didnt need that right now when would she he looked at his watch it would take him an hour or so to get there if he moved fast and annie would probably still be at the scene even if shed gone she would be at hospital and he would be able to find her there easily enough he left the tumbler still halffull on the low table and went to grab his jacket before he could put it on the phone rang again thinking it was annie calling back with more news he answered it was jenny fuller i hope i havent called at an awkward moment she said i was just going out oh an emergency sort of only i was thinking we might have a drink and celebrate you know now its all over thats a great idea jenny i cant do it right now though ill call you later okay story of my life sorry got to go ill call promise banks could hear the disappointment in jennys voice and he felt like a real bastard for being so abrupt with her after all she had worked on the case as hard as anyone but he didnt want to explain about janet taylor and he didnt feel like celebrating anything now its all over jenny had said banks wondered if it would ever be all over the aftermath of the paynes rampage if it would ever cease taking its toll six teenage girls dead one still unidentified kathleen murray dead these ten years or more pc dennis morrisey dead terence payne dead lucy payne paralyzed now janet taylor dead and a young girl seriously
