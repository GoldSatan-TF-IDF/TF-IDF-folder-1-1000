bardic voices four and twenty blackbirds mercedes lackey chapter one rain cold rain as icy as only a midwinter night could make it dripped despairingly into the dismal streets of the city of haldene it should have cleansed the pavements but instead it left them looking slick and oily glistening with a dubious sheen but not clean there was a single lamp burning outside a warehouse two doors down but although the flame burned bravely it did little to illuminate anything beyond the immediate area of the door it hung above the rain soaked through everything the piles of refuse waiting for the ragpicker beside each warehouse and tavern door tal rufens waxed cape and the woolen coat beneath it the limp and lifeless body of the streetsinger at his feet more wavering light from his stormlantern moved uncertainly across her pale cheek and gave her a cheating semblance of life she sprawled in a strange contorted snarl of limbs and wet garments lying half on her back and half on her side with her arms outflung to the uncaring sky her own ragged cape a garment of the poorest and shabbiest kind threadbare and patched and heavy with rain had been thrown partially to one side as she fell it had not given her much protection from the cold and rain when she had been alive nor had the thin chemise that served her as a blouse now soaked and clinging to her thin torso nor the coarsewoven skirt torn and muddy about the hem her feet though not bare wore poormans boots of thick stockings clumsily made of scraps of yarn salvaged and reknitted and soled with leather likewise salvaged from some other article too worn to save harnessleather tal thought judging from the wear spots on it her feet were slim enough that pieces cut from a worn saddlegirth would be just wide enough to serve her as soles such makedo footgear wouldnt serve to protect from rain and not much from snow but they would have served to keep the feet out of direct contact with frigid cobblestones her instrument a tambourdrum lay a little way from her hand skindown in a puddle on the street where it had landed when she fell it was a very cheap drum quickly made undecorated a drum was the usual instrument of the poorest musicians because drums were the most inexpensive of all forms of musicmaker the rim was already warped by the rain one of the crossbraces had popped out and even the skin would be ruined by now no longer useful it was another piece of flotsam for the ragpickers and scavengers who would soon be quarreling over the rest of the girls meager possessions she had been faintly prettywould have been quite attractive if poverty and hunger hadnt already left their marks on her in the form of bad teeth a sallow complexion and lank hair the witnesses said she had a pleasant enough voice but made up for all deficiencies of face and voice with a sunny outgoing disposition unlike some apparently she had never supplemented her streetsinging with other sources of income shed never at least in the course of cursory questioning of those who knew her ever been known to sell herself as well as her songsshe was too proud said one of the local stallkeepers whod come to identify her body a man who sold hot drinks and fried fish in the nearby fishmarket where she made her usual stand hed meant that in the best possible sense and as a compliment for the thin body beneath the threadbare clothing would only have attracted the attention of someone mistaking her for a preadolescent the cause of her death was obvious enough even without the witness to the murder despite the rain blood the color of black rubies still stained the front of her chemise and soaked into her skirt in a dark blotch not just a stabwound a blow like this one told tal a tale of rage rage against the victim that a simple thrust of the knife could not purge her murderer had practically disemboweled her with a single stroke and that simple fact just did not fit the stallkeeper had seen her murderer accost her hed even overheard a little of the conversation the man had offered a job spoken of a gathering of friends in one of the more reliable dockside taverns who wanted a bit of lively music and had even mentioned another musician who had agreed to come so far as the stallkeeper knew he was a stranger to this part of the docks the girl had spent the last year or more at the corner in front of the stallkeepers stand and the fellow swore hed never seen the man before today nor had the girl herself shown any sign of recognition when hed spoken to her a piece that doesnt fitthis murderer was a stranger by the accounts and bloody work of this level of savagery only came from the desperate power of a wounded animal or the rage of someone formerly close to the victim how could a stranger have built up such a terrible anger against the girl that level of anger needed reasons and a long and careful nurturing both of which required previous acquaintance the stallkeeper was somewhat in shock and hadnt been able to throw any light of knowledge on this terrible situation nor could the single witness to the murder itself a boy of about nine who sat a few yards away shivering in the shelter of his mothers tavernthe one to which the girl had allegedly been invitedso traumatized he was barely able to speak he rocked back and forth slowly with his arms wrapped around his thin torso the boy only knew what hed already told tal that the girl had been walking alongside a man as the boy waited outside the tavern for the breadbaker to make his delivery the man had stopped and pointed to something on the river the girl had turned to look while she was distracted the man had taken his knife from a sheath at his belt then with no warning at all the man stabbed her viciously ripping upward with such force that he lifted her off the ground caught on the crossguard of his blade his fist drove all the air from her lungs in a great choking gasp leaving her unable to cry out not that it would have done her any good for she bled her life away too quickly for help to arrive the boy had been completely paralyzed with shock and terror able only to shrink back into the shadows in hopes that he had not been noticed and certain he was about to be murdered on his own doorstep that instinctive reaction might indeed have saved his life the man had shaken the girl off the knifeas if he was shaking off a bit of fishgut that was the analogy the boy used and it looked apt judging by the way the girl had fallen she hadnt been dead when she hit the pavement but she was dying shed made a single abortive attempt to rise one hand clutching the wound in her stomach before she fell back again and died in a gush of blood the man had ignored her just as if he didnt realize he had just murdered someone he had looked around his face frozen in what the witness said was a horrible look tal wished he knew just what that horrible look was the expression might have given him more clues then the man had dropped the knife casually beside the body walked straight to the edge of the dock and kept going falling right into the kanar river the current was powerful here and the water cold and deep not even a strong swimmer would survive long and tal expected to hear that theyd pulled the murderers body out of the shallows by morning that was the point at which the boy had run for his mother who had sent the taverns peacekeeper for the constables rather than going out and investigating herself you didnt live long in the wharfdistrict by throwing yourself into the darkness after a murderer she and her son had stayed safely in the tavern until the constables arrived the witness had been very clear on one thing that had tal very puzzled the murderer had dropped the knife beside the body between his cursory examination and the witnesss description tal judged that it was a very unusual knife threesided like an icepick or a stiletto with a prominent hilt and here was the last of the pieces that did not fit for the knife was gone if someone had rifled the body in the time it had taken the boy to run to his mother and his mother to get the constables then why was the clothing completely undisturbed and why was the girls meager pouch of coins still on her belt why steal a knife especially one that had been used in a murder that was the real question for most people even the most hardened dockrat the idea of merely touching such a weapon would be terrifying there was a superstition about such knives that a blade that had once tasted a life would hunger for more driving the unfortunate owner to more murders or to suicide all of these things were small but they added up to a disruption of the pattern that should have been there familiar and inescapable but there was a pattern this casedid fit a series of four similarly horrific murders that had taken place over the past six months all of the victims were women all were poor all were streetentertainers and all were murdered between midnight and dawn all had been killed with a similar triangularbladed knife and presumably all had been murdered for some reason other than money he could not be sure of that last because this was the first such murder to have a witness three of the cases had been marked as solved two of the murderers had committed suicide on the spot even before their victims were actually dead and one murder was attributed to a man whod been picked up the next day raving and covered with blood and quite mad all of the women had lived alone without lovers husbands or children in small coffinlike basement or attic rooms in tenement houses rooms too small for a normalsized man to lie down in they owned little more than the clothing they stood up in a rude pallet to sleep on and their instruments they eked out a precarious existence balancing rent against food in a desperate juggling act played out day after day without respite they were like hundreds thousands of others in the city yet in this they were different they had not died of cold disease or starvation someone had murdered them and tal was convinced that there was more to these murders than simple random violence there was suspicion of sorcery and enchantment being involvedthere always was such talk around murders more from superstition than actual suspicion while he had seen the evidence of magic often enough from the legerdemain of street tricksters to the aweinspiring palpable auras of high magic he preferred to look for more conventional explanations than the supernatural tal believed that it was wisest to look for the answers that came from what normal people could devise afford and enact and kept his deductive powers clean since it was all too convenient to chalk up uncomfortable mysteries to dark forces tal its time to go the words uttered he now realized for the third time finally penetrated his consciousness he looked up to gaze into the weary and cynical eyes of jeris vane the constable who shared nightduty in this district with him you arent going to learn anything we dont already know jeris said as if explaining something to a braindamaged child we have a murderer and hes already taken his punishment into his own hands the case is closed lets go back to the station fill out our reports and make it official tal shook his head stubbornly holding up his lantern to illuminate jeriss face theres something about this thats just not right he replied and saw jeriss mouth tighten into a thin hard line i know itlooks cut and dried thats because it is jeris snapped water dripping off his hat brim as he spoke theres no reason to pursue this any further we have what we needone victim one criminal one witness one suicide end of question but why would jeris interrupted him againwhy is not your job or mine or any other constableswhat and whomaybe but not whywe dont worry about the reasons people do things we catch them and after we do we hand them over to the justiciars the gaolers and the executioners worrying about things that are not part of your job will only bring you trouble ill be at the station when you decide to straggle in from meddling in things that arent your business with that the unpleasant man turned and splashed up the rainslick cobbles towards the district station leaving the scavengers to do their work for a moment more tal hesitated hoping he could glean just that tiny bit more information from the scene but he wouldnt and in his heart he knew it even if he brought in a mage at this point the mage would learn nothing rain was running water and running water washed away magic just as in the other four cases which had all taken place on rainy nights as if there was anything other than a rainy night this time of year there would be no trace of anything magical on or about this body that was one more thing that didnt make sense about any of these murders people werent murdered in the street on rainy nights they were killed at home or in rooming houses inns or brothels where it was dry and at least a bit warmer than on the streetor they were killed in taverns and public houses where it was dry and the chill made people drink more than they had intended to but no one picked a victim then took her out into the pouring rain to kill her this was another odd circumstance that linked all five of these cases there was something very wrong here and he wanted very badly to find out what it was before any more women were murdered he hesitated a moment longer then followed jeris back to the station perhaps by now they would have found the body of the murderer and he would learn something more the rain showed no signs of letting up and would likely continue until dawn rain rather than snow was the dominant winter weather pattern in haldene and there were some who longed for snow instead tal didnt granted snow did make it easier for a nightconstable to do his job for with a layer of snow on the ground nights were brighter and fresh snow made it possible to track a nightcriminal in the lesstrafficked parts of the city even if he got into an area where there was a great deal of activity at night if hed left prints in the snow a constable could look for soles that matched those prints nevertheless tal didnt care for snow any more than he did rain what i would like would be to have a dry winter instead of a wet onea winter where no rain fell until spring he lengthened his steps to catch up with jeris without losing his dignity and running it was foolish but a great deal of status within the ranks of the constables depended on appearances you called for the wagon jeris asked as tal came up to him right after the woman sent for the constables and i responded he repliedand as if to prove that he had done his job the bodywagon rattled around the corner ahead of them heading their way the wheels rumbled on the cobblestones and the cart itself rattled as the uneven surface jarred every separate board and bit of hardware those were the only noises it made the pony hauling it its rainslick hide a mottled darkondark never made a sound and the wooden horseshoes it wore were muffled as per city ordinance for horses at night by leather boots tied over the hooves the driver enwrapped in his regulation blackhooded cloak spoke not a word as he drove past them in a few more moments the girls body would be ingloriously tossed into the back of the cart covered with a blackdyed bit of canvas and taken away to the city morgue which was operated by the church in weather this cold theyd probably keep her there for a week hoping for some friend or relative to step forward claim the body and pay for the burial at some point however they would give up and with reluctance and scant ceremony drop her pitiful remains into a shallow unmarked paupers grave in church grounds at the churchs expense as a murder victim and not a suicideand in default of any evidence that she wasnot a loyal daughter of the churchshe was the churchs responsibility the only paupers that the church was not responsible for were nonhumans suicides pagans heathen and hereticsall ofthose placed themselves out of church hands by their beliefs or actions if no relatives came to claim them the city would dispose of them in potters field in the pits left after clay was dug up this assumed however that the medical college didnt need a subject for dissection in that case a priest would bless the body and hand it over and the girl might have a real marked grave although the bits and pieces that had once been a human being would not be reassembled before burial it would be the medical colleges job to pay for that burial and to do them creditthey did not skimp on ceremony or expense in either case he doubted that it would matter to her she was done with the envelope of flesh and what became of it could not concern her anymore outside of a haunting but assuming that therewas something beyond that envelopeand assuming she had any reason to be concerned with anything in the here and now anymoresurely her only concern would be revenge or justice there was a fine line between the two that tended to blur in most folks minds including tals he was not convinced that she had or ever would have either revenge or justice even if someone pulled up the body of the man who had killed her in the next few moments on those other four occasions of the past several weeks someone had written case closed after a murdered womans name because her killer had slain himself and in a few more days or weeks another woman had died in circumstances that were all too similar to the previous supposedlyclosed case either there was a sudden rash of murdersuicides going on in this city or there was something very wrong with the deductions of the city constables youre asking too many questions tal jeris said as the wagon passed by the captain doesnt like it youre taking up too much time with this obsession of yours too much time he felt as if he should be angry but he was too tired for anger he weighed his next words down with heavy contempt since when areyou concerned with my private interests most of this has been on my own time jeris the last time i looked what i did with my own time whether it was beadwork plowing or criminal investigation was no ones business but my own jeris grunted scornfully charming hobby you have tal and frankly i dont give a rats ass what you do on your time off the only problem is that youve cooked up some halfcrazed idea that theres a force out there walking the night and murdering women even that would be all right if you kept it to yourself but you cant do that can you you have to tell every gypsy bitch and street whore you meet why she should be more careful at night as if a few stupid cows more or less in this town would make any difference to anyone now anger did stir in him dull and sullen smoldering under a heavy weight of sheer exhaustion it had been a long night before this happened and the end wasnt in sight jeriss arrogance made him want to give the man a lesson in humilityand in how it felt to be the one under the hammer so far thereve been five murder victims that look enough alike to make anyone with a brain think twice about them these murders are too damned similar to be coincidental and these murdersdont fit the patterns of anything ive ever seen before not in twenty years as a constable just for one moment why dont you play along with me and pretend im right dont the women who have to be out in the street to make a living deserve to be warned of danger a sudden gust of wind blew rain into their faces theyre streettrash tal jeris replied crudely never once slowing down to look at him just pulling the brim of his hat down over his face anybody out on the street at night instead of decently home where she belongs is out looking for trouble try getting it through your head that scum doesnt deserve anything they arent worth considering but decent taxpaying citizens are beginning to get wind of your stupid idea and theyre getting nervous the higherups dont like it when citizens get the idea that theres something dangerous on the street that the constables cant stop tals anger burned in the pit of his stomach warming him more efficiently than his sodden cloak but he knew better than to make a retort jeris was a bootlicker but as such he had the ear of the captain with an eye to making himselfjeristheupstartlook better jeris had only been a constable for four years to tals twenty but he was already tals equal in rank and probably his superior in advancement prospects because of his lack of personal modesty and his artistically applied hostility ordinarily tal wouldnt have cared about that hed never wanted anything more than to be a good constable maybe even the best if that was how things turned out keeping the streets safe solving the cases that were less than straightforward but jeristhetoady interested only in what the job could gainhim grated on tals nerves and enraged his sense of decency this was not the least because jeris represented not only everything tal found despicable in the city constables but also precisely the kind of constable who would advance through ambition and eventually become tals superior in rank captain rayburn was exactly like jerisand when rayburn gave up the job no doubt jeris would be promoted into it so jeris was only reflecting the sentiments of those in charge streettrash didnt matter forget that those who jeris and rayburn styled streettrash were also taxpaying citizens rayburn would dismiss that simple truth with an unverifiable allegation that everyone knew that the streettrash cheated to avoid paying their taxes and so did not warrant service as if the good citizens of haldene that rayburn favored never did anything of the sort how did he think some of themgot their fortunes that didnt matter really nothing was going to make any difference to the rayburns and jerises of this world the real fact was that the underdogs of the city had no power in the politics and policies of the city and never would and for that reason rayburn and his ilk discarded and discounted them always had and always would tal slowed his steps deliberately allowing jeris to splash on ahead let jeris the ambitious be the one to file the initial report let him get the credit for the case tal would file a second report and he would see if jeris could find a way to explain the missing murderweapon or the myriad of discrepancies and illogics in the story then again it probably wouldnt matter if he couldnt this was just another inconvenient blot on the record an unfortunate incident that no one would bother to pursue any further neither the victim nor the murderer were of any importance to anyone who mattered and thus it would be simpler and easier for the authorities to ignore everything connected with them that realizationor rather the final acceptance of something he had known in his heart of heartssickened him if he had not been so weary he would have been tempted to turn in his baton badge and braids as soon as he reached the station and find some other job in the morning perhaps as a private guard for one of the wealthy merchants but hewas tired his head ached his joints complained his stomach was knotted into a burning ball and the only thing he could really muster any enthusiasm for was the fact that his shift would be over in an hour or two and for half a day he would no longer have to tolerate jeris and his ilk in fact by the time he reached the station made out his report and did the followup with the searchers at the river it would probably be time to stop for the day he plodded on head down for many reasons through the cold wind and intermittent rain and because he had deliberately lagged behind jeris when he arrived at the station he discovered that the other constable had already commandeered the single clerk on duty at this time of night that meant tal would have to write out his own report instead of dictating it to the clerk one more miserable item in the long list of the evenings miseries the station a cramped narrow building three stories high with a basement lockup for violent cases was unusually busy for a cold and rainy night the waiting room was full and the sergeant at the desk looked as haggard as tal felt for a moment he simply leaned against the wall and let the warmth and babble wash over him with oil lamps along the walls and a small crowd pressed together on the benches there was enough heat being generated to make up for the fact that one of the two stoves supposed to heat the place was cold this was the captains idea a means to economize during the hours that rayburn was not on duty and never mind that there were other people who were forced to shiver through the coldest hours of the night due to his economies this was the only part of the building that the general public ever saw but it was enough to make them nervous no one ever came to the station who was not forced to the first story consisted of one main room and several smaller offices and the wardroom behind them all the main room had a half dozen benches arranged in front of a desk at the desk sat the dutysergeant and on the benches were ranged a variety of folk who either had complaints that needed a constables attention or were here to see about getting someone out of the general lockup on the second floor where drunks and minor troublemakers landed they were the source of the nervous babble and unfortunately also of a variety of odors none of them pleasant sweat dirt garlic wet wool beer and wet rawhide bad breath and flatulence and a hint of very cheap perfume from the one or two whores waiting to register complaintsthe people who came here at night were not among the citys elite by any stretch of the imagination and they brought the atmosphere of their lives with them judging by the crowd out front the offices were probably all full either of constables interviewing witnesses or constables interviewing people with complaints more accurately given the attitude of the night watch the truth was closer toenduring thaninterviewing the second floor was divided into the general lockupa temporary holding area for drunks vagrants general undesirables and as many participants in a fight as could be rounded upand a second wardroom third floor held the records it would be quieter up there but much colder there was a clerk in the recordsroom by day who refused to work if the stove wasnt fired up but there was no one to keep it stoked at night and no one cared if the prisoners in the lockup were comfortable the harried sergeant barely acknowledged tals presence as the latter entered and saluted since he was dealing with three different arguing parties all at the same time tal didnt blame him instead he went in search of pen and paper to make his report and a relatively quiet corner to write it in when he finally found both in the wardroom his headache was much worse and his jaw achedand he realized to his chagrin hed had it clenched tight ever since jeris started in on him it was enough to give him a deep throbbing at the root of his teeth which faded slowly as intermittent shocks of pain until only a background discomfort remained by that time the sergeant had managed to throw out all three of the contending parties which had cleared the waiting room considerably while hed been searching for writing materials jeris had finished his report the sergeant gave him a look at it and as tal had suspected no mention was made of a missing murderweapon or even that the weapon had been something other than the usual beltknife he went up to the third floor in search of quiet with his fingers stiffening in the cold tal rectified those omissions wishing a similar headache and bout of indigestion on jeris who according to the sergeant had chosen to go off shift early once his report had been written when he came back down with his stack of closely written papers in hand the sergeant waved him over to the desk the riverside searchteam come in tal he said with a gleam in his redrimmed eyes they found the body of a man they figger was the murderer whats more they know who twas he handed the new report a short one to tal who read it quickly his eyebrows rising as he did the body certainly fit the description that the boy had given and he had been identified almost as soon as he had been pulled from the water by a most extraordinary chain of coincidences both the discovery of the body and the identification were exceedingly fortunate for tal if not for the prospects of turning inhis shift early for he had not expected the body to turn up until it floated by itself but as luck would have it a barge had gotten torn from its moorings this afternoon before he arrived for his shift it had run up against a bridgepier downstream then sunk now the usual scavengers were out in force on the water with all manner of implements designed to pull cargo out of the water one of the scavengers had netted the body and brought it up as it happened several of the riverrats had recognized who it was immediately though they had no idea that the man had murdered a girl before drowning himself so now tal had his identification and the searchcrew had happily retired from the scene their job completed the desksergeant had the particulars the murderer had been the owner of a shabby shop in jeriss district who made a living buying and selling secondhand goods the scavengers had sold their pickings to him more than once and knew him not only by sight but by habitsand the one who had pulled him out was actually in the station waiting to be interviewed although jeris had officially declared himself offduty the sergeant noted with a sly smile that he was still proclaiming his genius in the secondfloor wardroom to the clerk and anyone else who would listen the boy come to witness wants out of here the sergeant said hes not likely to wait much longer he did not offer to send someone after jeris the sergeant was as old a veteran as tal and with just about as little patience for bootlickers they both knew that since the shopkeeper was from jeriss district it would look very bad if someone else took the report because jeris had gone offduty early and had not bothered to check back at the desk any sign of jeris checking back in then tal asked the sergeant shook his head not that itsyour job no tal replied deciding to get subtle revenge by grabbing the interview for his own reportwhich was without a doubt what the sergeant had in mind but a good constable concentrates on the case not the petty details of whose district the witnesses and victims come from thats the truth the sergeant agreed your witness is in the fourth crib along righthand side tal collected more paper left his initial report with the sergeant and found the man waiting patiently in one of the tiny cubicles in the maze of offices and interviewrooms in the back half of the first floor there were oil lamps here as well and it was decently warm at least maybe too warm as tal sat down behind the tiny excuse for a desk at the back end of the room he caught himself yawning and suppressed it he had brought with him a steaming cup of the evil brew that was always kept seething in a pot on another pocketsized stove in the first cubicle allegedly it was tea though tal had never encountered its like under that name anywhere else it was as black as forbidden lust bitter as an old whore and required vast amounts of cream and whatever sweetener one could lay hands on to make it marginally palatable but it did have the virtue of keeping the drinker awake under any and all possible circumstances the witness had evidently been offered a cup of this potent concoction for it stood cooling and barely touched on the floor beside his chair tal didnt blame him for leaving it there it was nothing to inflict on the unprepared and unprotected and offering it to a citizen came very close to betraying the constables oath to guard innocent people from harm he just hoped it wouldnt eat its way through the bottom of the cup and start in on the floor since hed be held responsible i understand you and some of your friends located the body of a man who drowned he said as he slowly dropped down in the chair after setting his cup on the table within reach of his right hand can you tell me how that came about the young man lean and sallow with a rather pathetic excuse for a beard and mustache coming in nodded vigorously we been salvagin an i hooked im knowed im right off milas losis im as got the secondhand story on lily just off long in the ware quarter tal nodded so the murderer had not even come from the same quarter as the victim although wharf and ware were next to each other and in this district still lily street was a considerable distance away from edgewater where the girl had made her usual stand and more significantly edgewater held nothing to interest a dealer in secondhand goods being the main street of the fishmarket with luck this boy would know a bit about milas losis did milas losis have any reason to want to do away with himself he asked the boy shook his head hard t tell about some of these old geezers but not as i think shop was doin all right old man had no family to worry about an never had no reason t want one useta make fun of us that came in and talked about our girlstold ushed be laughin and free in a brace of years anwed be slavin to take care of a naggin wife and three bawlin brats an wishin we was him the young man shrugged ony thing he ever cared for was chess hed play anybody thas it and i doubt that the girl was one of his chess partnersdid he ever show any interest in music tal persisted in musicians in female musicians in women at all to each of these questions the boy shook his head looking quite surprised nay he said finally like i said ony thing he ever seemed to care for was his chess games an his chessfriends he could care less bout music e was half deaf an about wimmini dunno but i never saw im with one and there wasnt much in is shop a womand care for after more such fruitless questioning tal let the youngster go the boy was quite impatient to be off doing something more profitable than sitting in the constablestation and only pressure from the team searching for the body had induced him to come here at all there were a few more hours of fishing he could get in before traffic on the river got so heavy that he would legally have to stop to allow daycommerce rightofway and pull his little flatbottomed salvageboat in to the bank until night he had money to make and no reason to think that milas had been the victim of anything other than an accident or at worst a robbery gone wrong tal sat at the tiny desk staring at his notes for a moment then decided to go prowling in the recordsroom again this was a good time to go poking through the records for during the day the clerk defended them as savagely as a guarddog allowing access to them with the greatest of reluctance he took his notes with him since the recordsroom was as good a place as any to write his addition to the report besides now that he officially had the identity of the murderer he wanted to check the file on current taxcheats debtors heretics and other suspected miscreants to see if milas was among them there was always the barest chance that the girl was a blackmailer whod found something out about him that could ruin him notlikely but best to eliminate the possibility immediately and leave jeris no opportunity for speculation as he had expected the old shopkeepers records were clean from the complete lack of paper on him it would seem that this murderer had up until this very night led an amazingly boring life there wasnt a file on him as there would have been if he had ever been noticed during a surveillance or a raid on an illegal or quasilegal establishment interesting so once again he had the same pattern the perpetrator was perfectly normal with no previous record of violent or antisocial behavior and no indication that he was under undue stress he had no interest in weapons music or musicians and none in womenand no obviousdislike of these things either he had no record of interests outside his shop except for chess in short he had led an utterly blameless and bland existence until the moment that he pulled out a knife and used it on the girl he even had a perfectly good reason to have an odd knife anyone who owned a secondhand shop would get all kinds of bizarre weapons in over the course of time maybe im going about this wrong maybe i should be concentrating on the missing knife it seems to be the one thing that ties all these cases together very well then it was an unusually long knife with a strange triangular blade a bit longer than a stiletto talhad seen knives like that very occasionally as part of the altarfurniture during certain holy days no one ever touched the knives during the service and they were evidently the remnants of some earlier older ceremony tal was not particularly religious but one couldnt help picking up a certain amount of religious indoctrination when one was in school since the schools were all taught by priests hed had the knack even then for putting things together that other people didnt particularly want put together and his guess was that the knives were from an old pagan ceremony of sacrifice that the church had coopted and turned into a holy day good idea thatif people were going to celebrate something make them celebrateyour ceremony keep them in the church all day so they cant go out and get up to an unsanctified frolic in the woods and fields tal sat back in his chair for a moment thinking about that perhaps it was the late hour but his imagination normally held in check began to paint wild pictures for him some of the more lurid tales that had given him goosebumps as an adolescent rose up out of memory to confront him with bizarre possibilities what if some of the knives in church regalia were theoriginal sacrificial knives of an unholy blooddrenched ritual out of the ancient past what if this one was one of those knives one of the cursed blades out of legends craving blood now that it was out of the safe hands of the church magicians could it be taking over the murderers somehow and forcing them to use it so that it could drink its fill of blood and lives as it used to do but why pick musicians as targets and most importantly where did it go when it wasnt killing someone more to the point have i got the chance of a snowball in a bakery oven of convincing the captain that a knife with a curse on it is going around killing people not likely captain rayburn believed wholeheartedly in magic but in magic of the practical kind cursed weapons were a matter of legend and not something to be found lying about in this city what do i have for proof a handful of men who killed for no apparent reason who all used if not the same knife a very similar knife they all murdered women who were also streetentertainers rationally even i have to admit that killing entertainers could be nothing more than a matter of convenience and coincidence the only woman who is likely to go off with a stranger is going to be either a whore or an entertainer and of the two professions a whore is going to be more suspicious than an entertainer finally the murder weapon always vanishes and the murderer often commits suicide not a lot of proof for anything and no proof whatsoever for the notion of a knife with a mind and will of its own stupid idea i must be getting lightheaded from lack of sleep what were the possibilities that fit this particular pattern thereasonable possibilities that is not some taletellers extravaganza the religious angledid have possibilitiesa cult of some kind was actually possible people would do some very strange things in the name of religious belief including commit murder and suicide odd cults sprang up in the twenty kingdoms from time to time and most of them were rightfully secretive about their practices and membership the church did its best to wipe out every trace of such cults once church officials got wind of them either directly or by threat of holy wrath and while the latter might not impress anyone not born and steeped in the fear of the sacrificed god practically speaking since every lawenforcement official in the twenty human kingdoms was likely to be a loyal son of the church there was secular wrath to deal with as well as holy wrath thats a dangerous suggestion to make though politically sensitive it wasnt that long ago that there were people saying nonhumans were demonic and accusing them of this kind of bloodletting claim that there are humans going around doing the same thingcaptain isnt going to like it if that comes up again still it was the most feasible and would explain the disappearance of the murder weapon or weapons other members of the cult could be watching the murderer waiting for him to act then nipping in and stealing the ritual dagger when he was done thats more reasonable than a dagger with a curse on it im more likely to get the captain to believe that one even if he doesnt much like it i dont like it though what if he decides that its nonhumans whove somehow seduced humans into their cult another outside possibility was that there was a slowly spreading disease that drove its victim to madness murder and suicide people who went mad often had a mania about certain kinds of objects or whatnot he personally knew an account of a hatter who went about trying to bludgeon redheads for instanceand that could explain why all the victims were musicians maybe the disease made it painful to listen to music but in that case why were they all killed with the same kind of weapon and where did it go afterwards his deathblack tea grew cold as his thoughts circled one another always coming back to the mysterious vanishing daggers until tonight there had been the possibility that the women were being marked by the same person who also murdered men possibly witnesses to make the crimes look like murdersuicides that possibility had been eliminated tonight by the presence of a witness who had not been detected lastly of course it was possible that jeris and the captain were right there was no connection these were all acts of random violence but there were too many things that just didnt add up there had to be a connection all of his years of experience told him that there was a connection his resolution hardened and he clenched his jawim going to solve this one no matter how long it takes no matter what it costs for a moment the anger and his resolution held him then he looked down at the papers on the desk and his cold tea and snorted at his own thoughts getting melodramatic in my old age still he picked up the pages of his second report and stood up idiot its duty thats what it is responsibility which too damn few people around here ever bother to think about i became a constable to make a difference too many young asses these days do it for the uniform or the chance to shove a few poor fools about and the rest take up the baton as a quick road to a fat salary and a desk and political preferment damn if i dont think jeris did it for all three reasons he made his papers into a neat stack and carried them down to the desksergeant who accepted them without the vaguest notion of the thoughts that were going through tals head by now itwas quitting time the constables for the next shift were coming in and he could return to his two rooms at the gray rose a hot meal his warm bath and bed and a dose of something that would kill his headache and let him sleep he could and this time he would for there was nothing more that he could learn for now he went out into the cold and rain with a sketchy salute to the sergeant and the constables coming on duty he hunched his shoulders against the rain and started for home but somewhere out in that darkness was something darker still he sensed it as surely as a hound picking up a familiar scent whoever whatever you are he told that darkinthedarkness silently i will find you and when i do i will see to it you never walk free again never doubt it the darkness did not answer but then it never did chapter two there was no one waiting in the station as tal came on duty two days later under other circumstances that might have been unusual but not on this night it wasnt rain coming down out of the sky it was a stinging sleet that froze the moment it struck anything solid the streets were coated thickly with it and no one in his right mind was going to be out tonight tal had known when he left his rooms at the gray rose that this was going to be a foul shift it had taken him half an hour to make the normally tenminute walk between the inn and the station as a rare concession to the weather both stoves were going in the waiting room he stood just inside the door and let the heat thaw him for a moment before stepping insidewhat got into the captain charity before he left the inn tal had strapped a battered pair of icecleats on over his boots and took a stout walkingstick with a spike in the end of it the kind that was used by those with free time for hiking in winter in the mountains even so he didnt intend to spend a moment more than he had to on his beat and from the hum of voices in the back where the wardroom was neither did anyone else what was the point there werent going to be any housebreakers out on a night when they couldnt even carry away their loot without breaking their necks not even stray dogs or cats would venture out of shelter tonight the constables would make three rounds of their beats at most and not even that if the weather got any worse a constable with a broken neck himself wouldnt be doing anybody any good the desksergeant crooked a finger at tal as he took off his cloak and shook bits of thawing ice and water off it tal hung his cloak up on a peg and walked carefully across the scarred wooden floor to avoid catching a cleat in a crack he couldnt possibly ruin the floor not after decades of daily abuse and neglect got another mysterykilling this afternoon the sergeant said in a low hoarse whisper once tal was within earshot or better say murdersuicide like the other ones you dont like want to see the report tal nodded after a quick look around to be sure they were alone and the sergeant slipped a few pieces of paper across the desk to him tal leaned on the desk as if he was talking intently with the sergeant and held the report just inside the crook of his elbow in this position he could read quickly and if anyone came in unexpectedly he could start up a conversation with sergeant brock as if theyd been gossiping all along brock wasnt supposed to pass reports along like this they were supposed to be confidential and for the eyes of the captain only evidently brock had gotten wind of tals interest and had decided to give him an unofficial hand tal thought he knew why he and brock were both veterans but brock was considerably his senior and would never get any higher than he was now it would be almost impossible to discharge him but his hopes of advancement were nil hecould have spent his time as a placeholder and probably rayburn expected him to do just that but like tal brock had unfashionable ideas about the duties and responsibilities of a constable and if someone tied a bag of rocks to the captains ankles and threw him in the river to drown him wed both consider it a fine public service but a waste of good rocks evidently since brock was no longer in the position to do any good out on the beat he had decided to help out tal who was and perhaps he was getting back at captain rayburn by offering tacit support of a project the captain didnt approve of somewhat to tals surprisethis murder had taken place at the very edge of the district upstream where the grain and haybarges came in unlike this area of the docks the barges were not towed by steamboats nor sailed in instead they were pulled along the bank by teams of mules and horses the presence of all those animals plus the kinds of cargoes that came in there gave the grainwharf an entirely different atmosphere than this end of town more like that of the inland farmmarket tal didnt know the dayconstable on that beat but from the tone of the report he was competent at least the grainwharf played host to a completely different crosssection of workers than the downriver docks as well a peculiar mingling of farmers and bargedrivers stockmen grainmerchants and riversailors in some ways it was a more dangerous place grifters and sharpsters of all kinds and avocations were thick there waiting to prey on naive farmboys just down to see the town but there were businesses there you wouldnt expect to find on the waterfront to serve the many interests that converged there blacksmiths for instance for the first time the murderer was a plain craftsman a guild man even the secondhand store owner had been operating on the fringes of society buying and selling things that if not stolen were certainly obtained through odd channels this man had been one of captain rayburns honest taxpayers though his victim had not perhapsthis would get rayburns attention tal read the report quickly grateful that the author had a gift for being succinctgiven the paucity of actual detail there were constables who would have padded the text shamelessly since a thin report could be construed as lax performance that pure word count might disguise this time though there really hadnt been much to report there were no witnesses to the murder though there were plenty who had rushed into the smithy at the first cry including the smiths two apprentices by then of course it was too late this was the first murder at least to tals knowledge that had taken place in broad daylight but it might as well have been in the middle of the night it had occurred in the smiths backcourt where his wood and charcoal were stored the court was open to the sky but otherwise completely secluded the victim was a known whorea freelance and not a member of the guild or a house her official profession was dancer but theres a tamborine and a set of bones listed among her effects which means she had at least pretended to be a musician theres the musical link again the smith had actually killed her with a single stab of a long slender knife with a triangular blade there it is again but this time the victim was beaten unconscious first and rather cut up before she died she must have taken a long time to die at least an hour or so no one had heard any of this probably because anyone whomight have noticed the sound of blows would assume that one of the apprentices was chopping wood rain had been pouring down all day again and as dusk neared it was just turning to ice the smith had finished with the knife the job he had begun with his fists and then went into the smithy picked up a pitchfork hed been asked to mend took it back out into the court braced it in a pile of wood and ran himself up onto it hed screamed as he did so and that was the sound that had brought the apprentices and neighbors running but hed done a good job of killing himself he hit numerous vital spots with the tines and by the time they arrived he was dead and so was the girl there was the expected panic and running about before someone thought to summon the law the knife was missing by the time the law arrived a fact that the constable in charge carefully noted this fellow was competent and thorough giving the case his full attention he stayed for several hours questioning those who had been at the scene about the missing blade hed even had the apprentices searching the entire smithy for the missing knife and had ordered them to take the wood and charcoal out piece by piece until they either found it or had determined that itwas gone good for him tal handed the report back to sergeant brock who tipped him a wink i know youre amindful of this sort of affair its the sort o thing agood lawman would find odd bodies are at the morgue he whispered as he slipped the report back inside his desk and iveheard theres something peculiar about one of them he shrugged night like this no priest is likely to sit about minding corpses tal nodded his thanks and went back to the wardroom to see if there was anything in the way of orders at his locker he didnt expect anythingthe weather had been so miserable all day that it wasnt likely the captain had bothered to stir from his own comfortable house just for the purpose of appearing in his place at the station when he made his way past all the tiny cubicles and entered the wardroom he found his assumption was correct the stove back here had another cheerful fire in it and the desultory comments of those going offshift told him that the captain had indeed sent word by a servant that if he was needed he could be found at home today no wonder all the stoves were fired upthe captain wasnt here to economize nice to be able to work from home when the mood hitshe thought sourly for captain moren captain rayburns predecessor had spent most of his waking hours at his post and the only time weather had ever kept him away from the station was the icestorm of the year he died even then hed actually set out for the station and it was only the urging of the constables that knew his ways and came to persuade him to turn back that prevented him from trying to reach his appointed place but tal kept those words behind his teeth you never knew who was listening anything i should know about he asked the constable he was relieving not a thing nobody wants to move outside in slop like this the man said holding his hands over the stove i looked in on a couple folk i thought might be in trouble down by the docks but theyve got smarter since the last storm families are moving in together to share fuel he laughed sardonically course with twelve people packed in a room they dont need much fuel to warm the place up even the joygirls have doubled up until the weather turns i guess they figure they might as well since there wont be any customers out tonight or maybe they think theyll get a tip to split if theyre two at once hey tal shrugged there wasnt much he could say except that at least now some of those women he feared were in jeopardy would no longer bealone not for the duration of this cold snap anyway and for tonight at least none of them would be on the street but the last one wasnt taken on the street was she i wonder what she was doing there the girls who pose as streetsingers dont usually visit blacksmiths futile to speculate he could find out for himself tomorrow that was his day off and he would be free to invade any beat he chose to tonight he would take advantage of the storm to go a little out of his area and visit the church morgue technically there should be a priest there at all hours praying for the repose of the dead and the forgiveness of their sinsbut as sergeant brock had pointed out in weather like this it wasnt at all likely that anyone would be there the deadcart couldnt go out in an icestorm for the pony might slip and break a leg and no amount of roughing his shoes would keep him safe on cobblestones that were under a coating of ice an inch thick so there was no reason for the priest in charge of the morgue to stir out of his cozy cell for he could pray for the souls of those laid out on the stone slabs just as well from there as in the icy morgue if his conscience truly bothered him he could always take his praying to the relative discomfort and chill of the chapel so tal would be able to examine the bodies at his leisure and see what if anything was true about the story the desksergeant had heard that there was something strange about one of the bodies he got his uniform cape out of his locker and layered it on beneath the waxedcanvas cape his baton slid into the holster at his belt his dagger beside it his shortsword balancing the weight on the other side beneath the weight of his wool tunic and breeches knitted shirt and hose and two capes he was starting to sweatbetter get out before he got too warm and killed himself with shock walking into the icestorm he took his spiked staff in hand and clumped slowly back out saluting sergeant brock as he headed for the door to the street there was a constable at the front entrance handing out the stormlanterns he took one gratefully and hung it on the hook in the end of his staff it wasnt much but on a night like tonight every tiny bit of light would help and if his hands got too cold he could warm them at the lantern he opened the door and stepped into the street there wasnt much wind but the pelting sleet struck him in the face with a chill that made up for the lack of wind he bent his head to it and told himself it could be worseit could be hail he reminded himself but it was hard to think of how anything could be worse than this ice so thick that if he had not been wise enough to strap on those metal icecleats hed have broken an arm or his neck in the first few paces and cold fierce enough to drive every living thing from the street tonight it would be a bad night for taverns and families with an abusive member no one would be going out for a drink and people with bad tempers didnt take being cooped up well more often than not the abuser would take out everything on people who could not run out of doors to escape him a colicky baby that wouldnt stop crying a child with a cough that couldnt be soothed or a woman with the bad luck to say the wrong thing at the wrong timethe triggers were many but the results were all depressingly the same there would probably be a fewchildren mostlybeaten to death before morning nights like this one brought out the worst in some people as the inability toget away set tempers and nerves on edge try not to think about it theres nothing you can do to prevent any of whats coming tonight youd have to have a million eyes and be everywhere at once tal set the spike of his staff carefully lifted a foot and stepped forward driving the cleats into the ice before lifting the other and repeating the motion his beat would take three times as long to walk tonight he was glad that he was not the morning man who would be the one to deal with the bodies that would turn up with the dawn sometimes the perpetrator would manage to hide his crime by burying the corpse or dumping it in the river but it would take a truly desperate person to manage that tonightthey never learn they call the deadcart and say the mate or the kid froze to death the constable shows up with the deadcart and sees the bruises or the smashed skull and thats the end of it another battering another hanging it generally never even came to a trial a justiciar would see the evidence and pronounce the verdict before the end of the day an easy conviction but tal was weary of them for nothing ever seemed to change no matter how many batterers were hung maybe thats because for every one we see and catch there are a dozen that we dont because they dont actually manage to kill anyone they only cripple the bodies and kill the souls of their loved ones they never actually commit murder and as long as the wife doesnt complain we have no right to step into a quarrel or a parent punishing his child more than the weight of the ice on his shoulders weighed him down and he wondered for the hundredth time if he should give it all up no not yet let me solve this last one then ill give it up it was all a noble motive tonight he was ready to acknowledge that part too part of it was sheerest curiosity i want to know what can drive a man to kill someone he doesnt even know with a weapon that vanishes as icy as the morgue was it was warmer than being outside the icestorm had finally passed as tal finished his beat but its legacy would make the streets impassable until well after daybreak even inside his boots and two pairs of socks tals feet felt like two chunks of ice themselves at least in here he could walk without having to calculate each step and he didnt have to worry about the cleats scarring the stone floor the morgue was a cheerless building of thick gray stone with tall narrow windows set into the stone walls glazed with the poorest quality glass thick and bubbly and impossible to see through the anteroom was supposed to hold a priest who would conduct visitors to bodies they wished to claim when such appeared and otherwise he was supposed to be on his knees before the tiny altar with its eternal flame praying more often than not he would probably be at his desk reading instead but just as tal had assumed there was no priest here tonight and the door had been left unlocked just in case the deadcart ventured out onto the ice before dawn the flame on the altar was the only other source of illumination besides his own lantern but there wasnt much to see in its dim and flickering light the morgue was not made for comfort either spiritual or physical the only place to sit besides the chair at the desk was on stone benches lining three of the walls beneath the slit windows these benches which were not softened by so much as a hint of a cushion were intended to encourage the sitter to think on the chill of death and the possible destination of the one who reposed beyond the door two of the benches were single pieces of carved granite that stretched the entire length of the wall the door to the street was framed by two more uncompromising structures just as imposing though only half the length of the wall the matching granite altar kneelingbench and the door to the morgue proper were ranged with mathematical precision on the fourth wall and the priests desk holding the records of all bodies currently held here sat right in the middle of the room the desk was a plain wooden affair but it hid a secret a charcoal brazier in the legwell that would keep the priest nicely warmed all day tal began opening drawers and discovered more secrets one of the drawers held goosedown cushions and a sheepskin pad to soften the hard wooden chair there was a stack of books most of them having little to do with religion and a flask and a secret store of sweets finally he found what he was looking forthe records detailing what body lay where a quick glance at the book told him where to look for the smith and his victim tal put the book back then turned and crossed the intervening space with slow and deliberate steps disliking the hollow ring of his cleated bootheels in the dim silence and pushed the door open on the other side of the door what appeared at first glance to be multiple rows of cots ranged out beneath the stone ceiling but a second look showed that the cots were great slabs of stone disturbingly altarlike and the sheetdraped forms on top of the slabs were too quiet to be sleepingalthough tal had known a priest or two more ironnerved or insensible than most who would take a latenight nap among his charges on an overly warm night it would almost be pleasant in here then a special spell kept the temperature low so that the bodies would not decompose as quickly on one of those sweltering nights of high summer when the air never moved and rain was something to be prayed for the only place to escape the heat besides the homes of the ultrawealthy was here the morgue was crowded season and weather were taking their toll of the very young the elderly and the poor judging by the lumpy forms beneath the sheets the priests had laid out several children on each slab and tal swallowed hard as he passed them he could examine the bodies of adults with perfect detachment but he still could not pass the body of a child without feeling shaken there was something fundamentallywrong about the death of a child and even after twenty years as a constable he still had not come to terms with it his targets were at the very end of the morgue a little apart from the rest as if distaste for what had happened made the priests set them apart from their fellows tal was mostly interested in the smith but just for the sake of seeing if he spotted anything the first constable had not he pulled back the sheet covering the girl the sight of her battered face shocked him and he had not expected to be shocked when hed read that she had been beaten he had not really expected that shed been beaten nearly to death he spotted three injuries that by themselves would have killed her in a day or less he could hardly imagine how she had survived long enough to be killed with the knifeher jaw was surely broken and there was a pulpy look about her temple that made him think the skull might be crushed there broken ribs had been driven into lungs and her internal organs must have been pulped she was so bruised that he could not really imagine what she had looked like before the beating and that took some doing the places where shed been cut up were oddsymmetrical forming patterns her clothing was tasteless and gaudy cheap but not shabby indicating that she was not as poor as the last victim that was probably because the last victim had insisted on earning her bread in ways that did not involve selling her body as so many girls had found when men were willing to pay more for sex than any other kind of unskilled work it was hard to say no to what they offered not that i blame them youve got to eat he couldnt spot anything that caught his attention so he pulled the sheet back over her and moved on to the smith even on a freezingly cold day like this one the heat in a forge was as bad as the full fury of the sun in high summer and most smiths were halfnaked most of the time this one was no exception leather trews and a leather apron were his only clothing and it was because of that lack of clothing that tal saw immediately what made sergeant brock whisper that there were rumors that one of the bodies looked odd in fact if tal had not known that the mans victim was a relatively frail woman he would have sworn that the smith had been in some terrible fight just before he died there were bruises all over his arms and shoulders especially around his wrists that couldnt be postmortem lividity could itthe marks were so very peculiar that he picked up the mans stiff arm and rolled the body over a little so he could examine the back no those bruises were real not caused by blood pooling when the body lay on its face he opened the shutter of his lantern more and leaned over to examine the bruises closely this is very very strangehe wished that he was a doctor or at least knew a healer so he could get a more expert second opinion he had never seen anything quite like these bruises before the closest he could come had been in the victim of a kidnapping the perpetrators had ingeniously wrapped their victim in bandages to keep him from injuring himself or leaving marks on his wrists and ankles the victim had been frantic to escape full of the strength of hysteria andhad bruised himself at the wrists ankles and outer edges of his arms and legs in straining against his swaddlings the bruises had looked similar to thesegreat flat areas of even purpling without a visible impactspot but no one had bound the smithso where had the bruises come from tal stared at the body for some time trying to puzzle it out before dropping the sheet and giving up there was no saying that the smith had not had those bruises before the girl ever showed up at his forge and in a man as big and powerful as this one was no one would have wanted to ask him where they had come from if he himself wasnt forthcoming about it some people have odd tastes andthat could have been what brought the girl to his business today if she was a girl hed picked up last night no one would be aware that he knew her and if she thought she could get a little extra businessor hushmoneyout of him he grimaced as he walked back towards the door all this wayand this could very easily be a perfectly ordinary killing if murder could ever be called ordinary the girl ventured out into filthy weather because she needed money and he was the nearest source of it and perhaps she threatened him in some way hoping to get that money or wouldnt go when he ordered her out and he snapped but as he put his hand on the door he knew suddenly that this was just too pat an explanation and it all depended on the very fragile supposition that the smith was a man with peculiar appetites just as he could not be sure that the bruises had not already been present when the girl came to the forge he could not be sure that theywere furthermore that did not explain the strange suicide nor the vanishing murderweapon why would the man kill himself at all the forge had been vacant at the time but fully stoked it would be more logical for the smith to throw the body on the flames and hope it incinerated before anyone looked in the furnace the temperature required to smelt iron and steel was high enough to deal with one small human body and why with the variety of weapons and even poisons available in a forge had he chosen the particularly excruciating death he had no this was another of his mysterycrimes again he had the scent and he knew it by now but for the moment there was nothing more to be done about it except let it all brew in his mind he stepped back out onto the icy street and the sardonic thought crossed his mind that in weather like this even murder came second to getting across the street without falling weak sun shone out of a high sky full of even higher wispy clouds as it hastened across the sky towards the horizon the only ice now was in the form of icicles hanging and dripping from most eaves as if relenting a little for the battering the city had taken beneath the icestorm winter had worn a smiling face for the last few days and it was tals day off with all of his leads gone cold he was pursuing his private time for once in a little ordinary shopping he needed new shirts preferably warmand having no vanity and not a great deal to spend he was looking through the bins in one of the better secondhand clothing stalls although it was late for shopping in the better part of town in the district where tal lived full of folk who had to work during most of the daylight hours streetvendors and shopkeepers accommodated working folk by opening late and staying open past sunset tal a vaguely familiar voice hailed him from across the street and he looked up from beneath the overhanging eaves of the building directly opposite constable kaelef harden beckoned slightly the shirts hed found so far werent all that good a bargain and there didnt seem to be anything better hidden in the deeper layers of the bin so he dropped them back and made his way across the street to his colleague brock says youre collecting the murdersuicide vanishingknife cases harden said without any preamble whatsoever and his voice seemed strained to tal i had one first thing this morning he said to come tell you about it little streetbeggar girl got snuffed by a trashcollector then he threw himself under the wheels of a carriage weird very weird in broad daylight tal asked surprised witnesses harden nodded me for one isaw it or most of it anyway and i couldnt stop it it all happened so fast now his voice had a tremor in it that tal didnt like he took a second look at harden who was one of the younger constables less than a year on the job harden was white beneath his weathertanned skin and visibly shaken tal put a steadying hand on the mans arm and harden made no move to shake him off hell poor lads in shock and he doesnt recognize it because it doesnt occur to him that a constable could or would have any such weaknesses are you on duty now he asked harden shook his head just got off and brock was just coming on he made a point of saying i should come talk to you since rayburn just threw the report in a drawer and didnt even glance at it i checked at the gray rose and they told me where youd gone huh brock probably wants me to talk him through this one and thats why he sent the lad to me whether or not this case fits my pattern its an excuse to get him to a veteran still harden was a good man and it was pretty obvious that rayburn wasnt going to do his duty by the lad the captain was supposed to help a new man through things like this but rayburn rayburn is too busy kissing feet to take care of his men and thats the end of it come on back to the rose he replied well get something to eat and you can tell me about it there notim not really hungry harden said his lips white but he didnt pull away when tal took his elbow and steered him back to the inn that was his home there were never really crowds in this part of town and a constables cape always made traffic part as if there were flunkies clearing the way two constables togethereven if one was out of uniformprompted people to choose the other side of the street to walk on it wasnt long before they paused under a wooden sign boasting a rose that might once have been red but which had long since faded to a pale pinkishgray the gray rosewhich may once have been known as the red rose when its sign was in better repairwas a modest little inn in a shabbygenteel part of town and encouraged longterm residents in the dozen tworoom suites in the third story these were right above the single rooms normally let out by the night for a price just a little more than he might expect to pay for private lodgings and food tal got the benefits of living in an innmeals he didnt have to prepare himself and servants cleaning up after himand none of the disadvantages of living in a boardinghouse where he might have had similar benefit granted the menu never varieda fact which he tried to look upon as being reliableand the rooms were tiny compared to a lodging but he had privacy that he wouldnt have gotten in a boardinghouse he didnt have to tailor his hours to the preferences of a boardinghouse keeper he could bring home whatever visitors he cared to whenever he wanted and he never had to come home to unswept floors and an unmade bed during the day the inn was quietall the really noisy activity associated with carousers and private parties in the rooms below his took place while he was onshift the girls cleaned his rooms as soon as he left them in the early evening just before the evening rush and after cleaning everyone elses rooms for their part the proprietors appreciated having a constable in residence that fact alone ensured that although things might get noisy they never got past the stage of a generally happy ruckus and knowing that there was a constable living here kept thieves from eventhinking about trying their luck under the tiled roof he steered an obviously shaken harden past the broadshouldered mintak who minded the door and raised two fingers and an eyebrow at one of the servinggirls as he went by her she nodded responded with a quick mime ofeating then turned away after tal nodded back he led harden up the stairs to his rooms knowing that food for two would be arriving shortly he preferred to supply his own drink the wine here was cheap and beer was not to his taste he unlocked his door and motioned harden in ahead of him the cleaninggirl had already been through this morning so he knew that his sittingroom was presentable there actually wasnt a great deal to tidy up his needs were few and so were his possessions he had a single comfortable chair beside the tiny fireplace shared with the bedroom a bookcase and a lamp standing next to it a braided rag rug covered the worn boards of the floor a wooden table and four stools standing on it and a cupboard holding a few bottles of good wine four glasses knives and plates some preserved fruit bread crackers and cheese stood opposite the armchair there was a chest just under the window that contained all of his other odds and ends and a tiny desk beside it as an awkward nod to the amenities two mediocre landscapes purchased because he felt sorry for the artist decorated the yellowwhite walls one of the few women to ever come here as a guest had seemed surprised that there was so little that was personal in this room its like your face tal shed said as if she found it disturbing it doesnt tell me anything about you but fellow bachelors felt comfortable here and harden settled onto one of the four stools with what seemed like real relief the room was in every sense a very public room and right now tal sensed that the younger constable would not be comfortable with anything that verged on the personal he left the outer door slightly ajar as a signal to the girl that she should bring the food straight in and set about making harden feel at ease hanging his cape and hardens on onceornamental pegs beside the door tal mended the fire and put fresh logs on then fetched a bottle of wine and two glasses extracting the cork deftly he poured both glasses full put one in front of harden then took the other and sat on the stool opposite the younger man he hadnt been there more than a moment when one of the servinggirls tapped on the door with her foot and then pushed it open with her hip she carried a large tray laden with bowls and plates fragrant steam arising from most of them dinner was as usual stew with fresh bread and butter pickled vegetables and baked apples if tal wanted anything other than the house meal he had to pay a little extra and once in a while for variety he did so but his tastes in food were plain and easily satisfied and he doubted that harden was going to pay very much attention to what he ate so long as it wasnt absolutely vile the girl maneuvered her heavy tray deftly in the cramped space before harden even reacted properly to her presence she had placed his bowls of stew pickles and apples in front of him and tal plunked the plate holding a hot loaf and a pannikin of butter between them and dropped wooden spoons in each bowl of stew then she was gone empty tray held loosely in one hand closing the door firmly behind her harden blinked and picked up the spoon automatically tal cut slices from the loaf for both of them and buttered them generously you might as well eat he said casually gesturing with his spoon its not bad and its hot you may not feel hungry but you need food by way of example he dug into his own meal and in a moment harden slowly began eating as well neither of them said a word until all their plates were empty nothing was left of the bread but crumbs and the wine bottle held only dregs tal collected the dishes and the empty bottle and put them outside his door then returned to the cupboard for a second bottle of wine he poured fresh glasses then resumed his seat all right he said as harden took the glass in both hands but did not drink now tell me what happened harden shivered his sober angular face taking on a look both boyish and lost it was this morning he began late morning i was on my third round theres a little halfmad beggargirl that always takes a particular corner and i have to keep an eye on her because sometimes she darts out into the street and starts dancing in the middle of the road she scares the horses and holds up traffic people get angry he shrugged apologetically tal understood what he did not saythat when something like that happened people always blamed the constables but what werethey supposed to do you couldnt lock up every crazy beggar in the city thered be no room for real criminals in the gaols so you kept an eye on her tal repeated she ever done anything worse harden shook his head mostly she just sits like today and sings hymns except she makes up words for them you can tell when shed be going to cause trouble she acts restless and wont sit still and she wasnt like that today so once i saw that i ignored her shes harmlesswas harmless he corrected himself growing pale again no one ever minded her i was on the opposite side of the street from her ii really dont know what happened then because i wasnt really looking for any troubleshe wasnt going anywhere and no one out in the street was going to bother her i thought anyway he sat quietly for a moment and tal sensed his internal struggles as the constable warred with the seriously shaken man all i can tell you is that the very next thingi knew was that people on the other side of the street were screaming and pointing a couple were trying to run and there was a ragpicker standing over her waving a bloody knife in the air then he threw the knife away and beforei could move he ran out into the street and i couldswear honestly he actually threw himself right under the wheels of a heavy waterwagon the driver couldnt stop the wagon turned over and the barrel burst and flooded everything and by the time i got it all sorted out the ragpicker was dead too his hands were trembling as he raised his glass and drained it in a single gulp ididnt do anything i didnt stop him i didnt evensee him kill that mad girl i didnt stop him from killing himself his voice rose with each word and he was clearly on the verge of hysteria a natural reaction but not at all useful better snap him out of this are you a mage tal interrupted him harden stopped in midsentence and blinked owlishly at him probably the question seemed utterly irrelevant but tal had a particular strategy in mind ahno he stammered then you couldnt have done anything could you tal countered there was no reason to assume that a ragpicker was going to murder the beggar theyre normally pretty feeblebodied and just as often theyre feebleminded too they dontdo things like that right ragpickers wander along the gutter collecting trash and half the time they dont even see anything thats not in the gutter in front of them you had no reason to watch him you didnt even know what hed done until it was too late but after harden began you said it yourself it all happened quickly how close were you across the street you said and id guess half a block down tal shrugged as harden nodded people were shouting screaming blocking the streetpanicked you couldnt possibly have gotten across to him with any speed there wascertainly no reason to think hed throw himself under a wain and short of using magic to do it you couldnt have stopped him from where you were standing right harden nodded again numbly tal poured his glass full and topped off his own that was a hell of an experience he said with a little less force a hell of a thing bad enough when you come pick up the pieces but when it happens right in front of you its natural to thinkyou could have done something the cits couldnt but just because youre a constable that doesnt give you the ability to read thoughts move faster than lightning and pick up waterwagons with your bare hands harden took a few deep breaths closed his eyes for a moment then took a small sip of the wine youre right of course he replied shakily i wasnt thinking no one could be in those circumstances tal replied dryly lad most of the cits think we can do anything and expect us to on a regular basis that kind of thinking can get you believing youre supposed to really be able to but youre just a man like any of the citsjust you have a baton and some authority people listen to you and you can handle yourself against a couple of armed ruffians and none of those things make you either a priest or a mage to save a soul or a body either now what made brock think you should talk to me about this welli guess because it was another murdersuicide and the knife is missing harden said after a moment of thought he told me about your theory and it seems to fit i suppose you could say that the beggar was a musician at least she was always singing she didnt know the mani had never seen him on my beat judging by the wound it was a strange knife too like a stiletto but with a longer blade we looked for it too believe me after he threw it away it just vanished from the moment that harden mentioned the ragpicker throwing the knife away tal had the feeling that this murderdid match his profile now he was sure of it once again the knife was gone and he was already certain that it would never be found he was also certain that no links would be uncovered joining the beggarwoman and the ragpicker no matter how diligently he looked the ragpicker probably was not even from this part of town and he normally would never have been on that street it was the same pattern all over again the same damnable frustrating pattern the use of magiccould explain it some kind of compulsionmagic perhaps operating through the medium of the knife butwhy all the victims were utterly insignificant what was more all the victims were utterly unalike especially the last three a real streetmusician a whore and a beggaraside from being poor and female and marginally connected with music they had nothing in common he shoved it all into the back of his mind and concentrated on coaxing harden to talk himself out the wine helped it loosened the boys tongue to a remarkable extent and once harden started he kept going until he ran himself out just like i did the night that fellow jumped off the bridge in front of me he hadnt thought of that in many years now but there had been a time when he literally could not get it out of his mind now he knew that his presence or absence would have had no effect on the man but then half the time i thought id somehow caused him to jump by just being there and half the time i thought if id just tried harder i could have talked him out of it in both cases the guilt and selfrecrimination were the same now it was his turn to listen and say all the things that harden wanted desperately to hearthings heknew were logical but that guilt told him could not be true they emptied that bottle and another between them though most of it went into harden at one point tal ascertained that harden lived alone and had no woman or relative waiting anxiously for him to come home and just kept replenishing his glass until he finally broke through the final barrier and wept that was what he had needed more than talk more than sympathy he needed to cry in the presence of someone who understood not all men needed the release of tears after something like this but many did and may rayburn find himself in this position one day with no one willing to listen to him and pour the wine he came very close to hating his superior tonight and only the fact that rayburn was not worth wasting hatred on kept him from doing so if the captain himself did not feel capable of offering such important moral support to his men it was his responsibility to find someone who could and would it should not have been left up to old brock to find someone and getting the lad drunk was not the most optimal way to get him to unload his troubles but it is the only way i know tal thought glumly he should have been with someone who knows how to handle situations like this one not with me hes going to have a head in the morning poor boy on the other hand he was hardens senior he could legitimately report him in sick rayburn would have to find a replacement for his shift hell rayburn can walk the lads beat himself and do some real work for a change although emotion wore a good bit of the wine off harden was still not fit to leave the inn either so when the tears were over the guilt somewhat dispersed and harden reduced to telling tal what a fine fellow he was in slurred and halfincoherent speeches tal excused himself long enough to tap on the door of one of the two mintak brothers who worked as peacekeepers in the bar downstairs he knew ferg would still be awake they had the same taste in books and the mintak would often come tapping onhis door about this time of the night if his own library ran dry he liked ferg and his brother and if anyone ever said a word against nonhumans in general and these two in particular he took care to let them know just how he stood on the matter if he hadnt been a constable that might have gotten him into a fight or two but between his baton and the brothers muscle troublemakers generally took their prejudices elsewhere ferg answered the door quickly enough to have been awake and reading sticking his shaggy brown head out of the door cautiously a pair of mild brown eyes looked down at tal out of a face that was bovine equine and human all at once he opened the door a little further when he recognized tal and as if to confirm tals guess there was a book in his broad brown hand a thumb stuck in it to keep his place got a friend who needed to get drunk tonight tal said shortly knowing ferg would understand i need to get him down to a room for tonight the mintak nodded wisely hold a moment he said in that deep voice all mintaks shared regardless of gender let me put the candle somewhere safer he withdrew his head there was a little shuffling and he returned without the book nobodys using the guestroom the mintak offered might as well put him there and we wont have to move him down any stairs that might be best tal agreed hes a good lad but id just as soon not run up too big a bill on his behalf there was a single very small room on this floor a room not much bigger than a closet that the tenants hadwith the agreement of the proprietors of the innfixed up as a bedroom for their own guests sometimes it was used for visiting relatives and sometimes for those who were in the same condition as harden once or twice it had been used by quarreling couples and on those occasions the rest of the tenants were very careful not to ask any questions of either party those who were going to entertain visitors for more than a day were careful to schedule the guestroom well in advance but at any other time it was open for spurofthemoment use harden would be less embarrassed to wake up in what was obviously a guestroom removed from tals lodging than he would be if he woke up in tals sitting room and tals charity did not extend to giving up or sharing his own bed ferg followed tal back to his rooms harden looked up at their entrance and squinted at the sight of the mintak who towered over tal by a good several inches din i shee you downshtairs harden slurred that was my herdbrother good sir ferg replied calmly do you think you can stand not by mshelf harden acknowledged ruefully after an abortive attempt that left him staggering and finally sitting right where hed begun m drunk butsha couldn tell by m dancin all right then old man tal said slightly amused were going to get you to a bed where you can sleep it off harden nodded wisely goodidea he said carefully f i can stand i sure can walk eh tal and ferg got on either side of harden and assisted him carefully to his feet both of them knew better than to move abruptly with him at the moment he showed no signs of getting sick but any toosudden movements could change that and neither of them felt much like cleaning the mess up right you are ferg said cheerfully now well take your weight and keep you balanced you just move one foot in front of the other and well get you safely into a nice warm bed obediently harden began to walk swaying from side to side supported by ferg and tal good youre doing fine ferg encouraged right left right left now through the doorinto the hall this was hardly the first drunk ferg had assisted into a bedthe gray rose encouraged patrons who had a bit too much to spend the night if they werent rowdy it was good for all concernedthe inn got a paying customer overnight and the customer found himself only a bit lighter in the pocket rather than waking up in an alley or a worse place the mintaks with their enormous strength were usually the ones called upon to help the inebriated into their rooms so ferg had plenty of experience either of the brawny brothers could have carried harden on their own but the companionability of ferg and tal doing this together would likely be important to harden when he thought back upon it in a much shorter time than tal would have estimated they had harden down the hall in the bed with his boots pulled off and under several blankets since the room was too tiny to have a fireplace of its own tal closed the door quietly and marked his name down on the schedule outside there would be a linen charge and a cleaning charge and since harden was his guest he would be the one responsible ferg nodded approvingly a friend of yours ferg asked a fellow constable and what brought him to this pass a bad incident on his beat tal replied grateful that ferg knew enough of the constables to know what a bad incident was ah his first no doubt well better to purge himself in the presence of one with the experience to advise himbut i misdoubt hell be fit for duty in the morning the mintak cocked his head in obvious enquiry and tal had to chuckle at his curiosity tal never ceased to be bemused by the blazing intellect and extensive vocabulary possessed by mintaks other humans too often dismissed mintaks as being as stupid as the beasts they resembled but tal knew better oh i plan to take care of that tal replied in my opinion as a senior constable that boy has a touch of something food poisoning maybe ill have a note run over to the station to that effect before i go to bed ferg chuckled mendacious but reasonable a good captain would have excused him from his duty for a day or two anyway it is a pity there is nothing in the rules requiring that absence from duty well good nightand i have a history i think you might enjoy when you have the leisure for it and i have a deliambren travelbook i think youll like he replied and saluted the mintak as he opened his own door he stayed up long enough to write sicknotes for both harden and himselfafter all theyhad eaten the same meal and theywere both suffering similar symptoms uhhmm were both lightheaded dizzy flushed and in the morning well both have headaches and nausea well harden will brock will probably guess but he wont let on to the captain tal decided that if his hangover wasnt too bad in the morning he would go ahead and appear for duty on his shift but in case it wasnt he was covered he left a third note telling harden that hed written him up for sicktime and not to go in on his shift on the tiny table beside the bed and sent one of the inns errand boys around to the station with the other two notes harden when he took a final look in on him was blissfully if noisily asleep tal nodded to himself with satisfaction closed the door and sought his own bed after taking the precaution of drinking a great deal of water but when he finally lay in the quiet darkness with only the faint sounds of creaking wood and faint footsteps around him his mind wrestled with the problem of this latest case it fit it certainly did there was no doubt of that but what did it all mean the whole thing is madhe thought tossing restlesslythe pattern is there but no motive maybe that was why rayburn was so stubborn about admitting that the cases were all tied together there was no discernible motive to any of them that was one of the first things drummed into a constables head when they taught him about murderfind the motive and you find the killer but in this case the killers were obvious it was themotive that was missing why why why why why these people why that particular kind of knife what was there to gain it has to be the same hand behind all of them but what is the motive no the killerwasnt obvious after all the people who used the knife and spilled the blood couldnt be anything more than tools hands to wield the blade and nothing more so the law still held true find the motive and you find the killer so what was the motive what could drive a man to use other people to kill like this if there was a purpose what was it where was the killer all this time andwho was the killer chapter three the next murder got the attention of the entire city it was a nineday wonder that kept the taverns abuzz for long enough that even tal got tired of it but this time like some strange disease that strikes three homes in a row then suddenly occurs halfway across the city this crime happened so far outside of tals district he would never have heard of it if the circumstances hadnt been so bizarre whoever whatever was behind all this he had moved his area of operation from the waterfront side of the city to the tenement district farthest inland once again the poverty of the murderer and victim should have relegated the incident to a mere item in a few records tal heard about it over his morning meal in the commonroom of the gray rose and his first cynical thought was that if the deaths themselves had not been so outrageous the entire package of murder and suicide would have been put down as a sordid little sexcrime even so the details were so unbelievable that he was certain they were exaggerated it was only when he reached the station that he learned that if anything the public rumors were less horrific than the truth and that was enough to send cold chills over him when he heard the official report for himself he had one of the oddest feelings he had ever experienced in his long career as a constable part of him was horrified part sickenedand part of him knew a certain sense of selfrighteous pleasure he knew what it was of course hadnt he beensaying something like this was going to happen well now it had and he had told them so it was a base emotion butmaybe it was justified as tal read the report though he found it very difficult to keep his detachment a jewelcrafter too unskilled to be called a full jeweler named pym who made inexpensive copper brass and silverplated trinkets was the perpetrator a gypsywench called gannet was the victim and what had happened to the poor whore at the hands of the smith palled by comparison with what happened to the gypsy gannet showed up at pyms workshop just before he closed with a handful of trinkets she wanted him to purchase that much was clear enough from a neighbor who had probably been the last one to see either of them alive the neighbor had been loitering about the area in front of pyms shop and her own other neighbors said she had an interest in pym and what they probably meant was that she had her mind set on inveigling him into marrying her the neighbor was not pleased to see a younger woman show up at the shop and drew close enough to hear the ensuing conversation the gypsy insisted that someone had sent her to pym specifically to sell her goods and although the jeweler seldom made such purchases tonight he waved the wench into his shop and shut and locked the door behind her that had been so unlike pym that the neighbor suspected something illegal or so she told the constables and set herself to watch pyms door right tal snorted to himself as he read that particular bit of nonsense more like she suspected pym of a bit of funnybusiness with a skirt and was nosy and jealous enough to wait around for details but the gypsy didnt come out although there were lights and shadows moving about in the back of pyms workshop all night long and in the morning the neighbor whose imagination had been running at high speed ever since the girl showed up knocked insistently on the door on the excuse that she had smelled something burning then she called the constables when pym didnt appear to open his shop or answer the door the constables unable to rouse anyone broke the door down there was no one in the front of the shop nor in the rooms above but what met them when they opened the door to the workshop sent one of them running to empty his stomach in the gutter and the other to rouse the entire station to come and cope with the scene what was left of pym lay on the floor in a posture of agony at the foot of his workbench the girl lay spreadeagled on the top of his biggest workbench also dead pym had used the entire contents of his workshop to make a strange displaypiece out of the girl beginning by clamping wrists and ankles down to the table filling her mouth with wax then setting to work with copper wire semiprecious stones and most of his tools she was quite chastely covered in a garment of wire and gems all of it laced through her muscles and skin and riveted to her bones to anchor it in place her eyes were wired open her head covered with a wig of fine wire riveted to her head the pain must have been excruciating and because the wounds were so small she wouldnt even have lost consciousness because of bloodloss the knife he had plunged into her breast must have come as a relief now the detachment tal had been looking for finally came and with it that odd ability to analyze even the worst information if shed lived she would have been crippled for life the amount of nervedamage he must have done would have been impossible to repair let alone whatever he did to her brain by spiking that wig into her skull but she was not to be alone in her suffering for pym finished his night by drinking every drop of acid and poisonous chemicals in his shop it was the horrified judgment of the healerpriest brought in to decide on the cause of death that pym probably lived about as long as his victim before he died once again the girl had been murdered with a knife with a triangular blade and once again the knife was missing theofficial version was that pym had stabbed her with one of his files but none of the files had even a trace of blood on themin fact the files were the only tools pymhadnt used to make his display tal would have given five years of his life to see pyms body but unfortunately the acid he had drunk had rendered it unfit even to be placed in the morgue or as one of the constables with a mordant sense of humor said the only way to put him in the ground was to scoop him up in buckets and pour him in but i wish i knew if he had the same bruises as the others ive seen the gypsywench was buried the next day with all the pomp due a guildmaster a funeral that was paid for by donations if she had any relatives they were lost in the throng of spectators who came to gawk rather than mourn searching for some sign of what had been done to her under the burialgown of stiff snowwhite silk that covered her from chin to toes tal didnt go but captain rayburn made a prominent appearance the last murder took place right under tals nose he was making another attempt to find a decent set of shirts because by now he needed more than one and this time had gone much farther afield than his usual haunts lately bargeloads of clothing came in at the southern end of the city on a semiregular basis brought up out of places where a species of establishment called amanufactory was becoming common there were manufactories in the high kings capital of lyonarie but only lately had anyone set them up along the kanar river such establishments produced large quantities of simplymade garments in a limited range of sizes and colors and shipped them off by water since shipping them overland would have made them too expensive to compete with locally made garments tal was not certain that he would fit any of the sizes available and he was more than a little dubious about the quality of such garments but by now he was desperate enough to go look at them when word came that another shipment had arrived it was a pleasant enough day sunny with no more than the thinnest of cloudcover and tal took his time about reaching his goal the only thing on his mind was the book that hed just started and a vague wish that hed brought it with him to read if there was going to be a queue as he arrived it was obvious that he had come to the right address by the crowd just outside the door and he resigned himself to a wait he was only one among a throng of customers at the dockside warehouse and was met at the door by a man who looked him over with an appraising eye and sent him to stand in a particular queue one of six altogether the warehouse was only dimly illuminated by light coming in at some upperstory windows and by skylights in the roof enough of the people here felt compelled to chatter at the tops of their lungs that a confusing din echoed and reechoed through the warehouse adding to the confusion as tal inched forward in his queue never having been here before he was a little bewildered about why the fellow had directed him into this line until he arrived at the head of the queue and found himself confronting four piles of neatly folded shirts each pile being shirts of the same size but a different color his choices were brown gray blue and white apparently and the man at the door was evidently practiced in sorting peoples sizes out by eye tal took two each of the brown and the gray on the grounds that they would show dirt and wear less than the white and fade less than the blue and moved to one side quickly for the man behind him seemed very impatient he shook out one of the gray shirts and held it against himself then examined it carefully aside from the fact that the stitching was mathematically evenwhich was entirely possible even when sewn by a human rather than a machine if the shirt was of high qualityhe saw nothing wrong with it it was just a trifle large perhaps but no few of his secondhand purchases were also oversized there was no real style to it and the pattern it had been made to was a very simple one but a city constable hardly needed style surprised and pleased he took his prizes to the front of the warehouse where he paid about the same as he would have for four secondhand garments even though there was no haggling permitted the clerk wrapped his purchases into a packet with brown paper and string and gave them back to him given that these should last longer than secondhand shirts which already had a great deal of wear on them he had gotten quite a bargain and left the warehouse with a feeling of minor euphoria in fact he had enough left over for a decent lunch so he decided to treat himself he seldom got to see the wharfs in daylight by night they were dirty dangerous places to walk but by day it was no worse than any other mercantile area there were several warehouses here where individuals were buying things directly this was something new to the city and he wondered how the merchants were going to take it it probably isnt going to bother them too much he decided nobody with any significant money is going to come down here and stand in lines when they can go to a fine warm shop and be waited on even fawned over there might be some loss of secondhand trade but that would even itself out eventually those who bought secondhand garments would rightly point out that the market value of such goods had decreased and be able to buy them at a lower value than heretofore and the very poor who could not afford even cheap goods like these would then be able to afford the secondhand goods the merchandise leaving those warehouses wasnt what he would call luxury goods either most of those who were buying these new items were those who would bargain fiercely leaving a secondhand merchant with less of a profit anyway taking advantage of the crowds other vendors had set up shop along the street there were no entertainers probably because there was no room for them performing on the docks would be dangerous with wagonloads of heavy goods going in both directions and the wharfs on one side not only that but the wheels of those wagons rumbling on the wooden planks of the wharf made it too noisy for anyone to hear an entertainer but there were other peddlers and vendors anyone who could set himself up in a small space a flash of color caught tals eye and he wormed his way through the press of people to a ribbonseller midwinter festival was coming up and he liked to get small things for people who were decent to him he bought a bit of scarlet for the black hair of the little wench who cleaned his room and the little blonde who usually waited on him in the tavern would receive a streamer of blue farther along there was a candymonger an orangegirl a man selling feathers and a knifesharpener with his grinder in a barrow the candymonger had a cleanlooking cart and display and little bags of candy would make appropriate gifts to the tavern errandboys tals mind was entirely on the complicated problem of differentbutequal bags of sweets as he wormed his way towards the cart when suddenly the noisy but relatively peaceful scene changed dramatically he had looked down long enough to tuck his bits of coiled ribbon into his beltpouch and make certain the antipickpocket flap was in place when the crowd surged into him knocking him offbalance people screamed and surged into him again as they tried to escape from something just ahead training went into effect as people tried to move surged back and forth mindlessly and generally made things worse all the way around reacting as a constable and not as a man in the crowd he fought free of them with a few precisely placed kicks and elbowjabs and broke out into an open space for a moment looking for the source of the trouble he didnt take long to spot it ahead of him the knifesharpener brandished a bloody blade in one hand a woman covered in blood lying motionless at his feet tals eyes went immediately to the knife and not the man for it was obviouswho the attacker was and in this press of bodies he would not be able to get away though he only saw it for a moment he knew he would be able to draw a picture of it from memory alone at any time in the next year it was unusually long with a wicked point the crossguard was minimal the hilt undecorated and the blade itself was exactly like a triangular file except that it was polished to a satingleam on all three flat sides and glinted razorsharp on all three edges tal dropped his package of shirts at the feet of the candymonger and launched himself at the murderer in spite of the fact that he wasnot frozen with shock or surprise and in fact was already moving towards the man as his eyes and mind took in every detail of the murderweapon he was not fast enough to prevent the next scene of the tragedy with the speed of the weasel he resembled the knifesharpener flung the blade wildly into the crowd turned and plunged off the dock into the murky icy water of the river and since he was wearing a belt encumbered with several poundsworth of metal tools even if hecould swim it wasnt likely he was going to come up again tal knew that even before the man hit the water and sank without a sound tal ran to the edge of the dock anyway but there was no sign of the murderer but a trail of bubbles he debated plunging in after himand even teetered on the brink for a momentwhen one of the dockworkers grabbed his elbow dont the man said shortly the bastards a goner wont last a minute in that water and neither will you youre right tal acknowledged and turned back to the womans body she was dead and he was unsurprised to find that the woman had been stabbed as viciously as the very first victim hed seen she had probably died instantly the amount of blood soaking the dock and her clothing indicated that the knifesharpener had used his blade with brutal expertise although it seemed to him that the better part of an hour had passed he knew it had only been a few minutes and the crowd was still milling about in panic he took charge of the scene at once getting the crowd settled separating out witnesses from those who only knew thatsomeone had died and eventually dispersing all those who were not direct witnesses he also gathered up a few levelheaded volunteers you and you he ordered picking two large steadylooking fellows you two go north and south along the river and see if you cant find the constables patrolling this district he turned to a smaller soberly clad man plain and ordinary you go to the station and alert the constables there all three nodded and went briskly off on their assigned errands that left him with four more all dockworkers who should know this area you see if you cant find that knife he told them although he knew it was a hopeless quest the mysterious vanishing blade was going to vanish again and there wasnt anything he could do about it you saw him throw it away something about it may tell us why he went crazy that way the four looked at him a little oddly but began their search the moment he explained that he was a constable he dealt with the murder scene a few moments later draping the girls body with a tarpaulin given him by a bargeman at least this time i saw it and i know exactly what it looks like he thought bleakly i can describe it to knifemakers armorers smithsthere cant be that many knives like that in this city i can check with secondhand stores and have people keep a watch for it maybe i can track it down that way or at least find out what kind of a knife it is or he wouldif this wasnot some strange cult of murder and suicide with special ritual blades of their own there were not many things more secretive than a religious cult and doubly so in a circumstance like this one still someone has to forge these things ill check with smiths by the time the local constables arrivedmore than a bit annoyed that an apparent outsider had so cavalierly taken overtheir crimehe had all of the information that really mattered to him the girl was local she cleaned and gutted fish at one of the saltinghouses the knifesharpener was new no one had ever seen him here before the orangegirl the candymonger and the fellow with the feathers were all locals as well and knew the fishcleaner by sight everyone knew her the orangegirl sobbed weeping messily into her apron she was always singing whistlingso cheerful her voice so pretty we always told her she ought to go for a free bard tal froze inside although he knew there was no sign of his reaction on his face there it was the music connection again what was going on here he patted the girl on the shoulder trying awkwardly to comfort her then turned to the newly arrived constables im sorry to have barged into your territory like this he began knowing that if he apologized immediately the new arrivals would stop being annoyed and start being grateful that he had done all the preliminary work for them i would never have except that i know from my own experience that if you dont take over in a case like this theres a panic wild tales spread like a fire in dry grass and the next thing you know youre getting reports of a wholesale massacre of fishwives and if you dont herd all these people together at the start theyll manage to wander off on their own errands before you can get any sense out of them he handed the man he judged to be the most senior his own notes heres what ive gotten sir and i hope it will be of use to you he continued as frowns softened to reluctant approval the ones who swore theyhad to go i got addresses for in case you have to do a followup any my statement is in the pile as well and my own address oh we know where to find you the senior constable replied with more approval showing when tal made no mention of getting credit on the report or indeed having anything to do with this other than be a witness you can go ahead and go now if you like we can take it from here tal turned to go and the candymonger with a display of honesty that was quite remarkable handed the package containing his shirts back to him undamaged except for a bit of dirt you tried sir the sadeyed little man said most wouldnt have done that for her thankee tal nodded accepting the compliment in the spirit intended and tucked his package under his arm but his mind was elsewhere planning the report he was going to write for captain rayburn he had several cases now including one with an impeccable eyewitness in the person of himself now the captainmust believe him enthroned in splendid isolation behind the walnut bulwark of his desk captain rayburn gazed down his long thin aristocratic nose at tal with mingled contempt and disbelief would you mind telling me what you were drinking when you wrote this bit of imaginative fiction he asked sarcastically id like to get hold of a bottle or two myself tal considered any number of possible responses and confined himself to a civil one you cant argue with the facts chief he replied all the murders are in the records they were all committed with the same kind of weapon which always disappears they were all committed with aknifelike object the captain corrected we dont know what that object could be and there is no evidence that it is the same or even a similar object in any two of the murders the instrument of death could have been a fileor a piece of barstockor an icepickor for that matter an icicle there is nothing connecting any of these murders except your halftoasted idea that the victims were all musicians of a sort and that is too absurd to even credit there isalso no trace of magic involved in any of these deaths and theyhave been checked by a reputable priestmage tal clamped his mouth shut on the things he wanted to say for there was no point in going any further hewanted to point out that the examinations of the wounds of the victims showed identical characteristics consistent only with a tripleedged blade and remind rayburn that none of the weapons had ever been recovered much less identified he wanted to tell the captain that the priestmage was less interested in finding traces of magic than he was in getting his unpleasant task over with as soon as possible and that this particular man was hardly as reliable and reputable as rayburn painted him he wanted to say all of these things but he said none of them the priest in question is in his position because he is out of favor with the current bishop and liaison with the constables is the lowest position a priestmage can have but im not supposed to know that rayburn wants this thing covered up and it suits him to pretend that the man is careful and competent the only question is why is he so intent on covering this up i hope you arent planning a new career in sensational storytelling constable rayburn continued tapping the pile of papers with his index finger because this is too farfetched to attract any publisher tal dropped his eyes and studied the top of rayburns immaculate desk knowing that if he wanted to keep his job he was going to have to keep his temper but im beginning to wonder if this is a job worth keeping why is it worth rayburns while to sweep this under the rug rayburn waited for him to say something and when he did not speak the captain shook his head i would have expected a piece of nonsense like this out of one of the green recruits not out of a senior constable he said with an undisguised sneer really you make me wonder if you are not ill with a brainfever yourself i hope you havent been spreading this nonsense about ive told no one tal replied stoically no one else would have cared you bastard except a few idiots like me who want to do their jobs right and they dont have any power or influence the rest are all too busy playing politics just like you i saved it all for my report oh did you tals hands hidden by the desk clenched at rayburns tone in that case i wont have to order some punitive assignment for you for spreading rumors designed to cause panic or unrest rayburn drummed his fingers on the desktop for a few moments in that case because of your fine record i am going to forget i ever saw this tal looked up in time to see the captain turn in his seat take the report that he had labored over for so long and toss it into the stove beside his desk tal stifled an oath as rayburn turned back to him now iorder you to say nothing more about this rayburn said with a cold core of steel underlying the false cordiality i wont have wild rumors of deathcults or renegade mages circulating through the streets do i make myself clear the weak blue eyes had turned as icy and flat as a dead fishs and tal said what he was expected to say go to hell captain yes captain he replied trying not to choke on the two words rayburn settled back into his chair with an air of satisfaction this district is quiet and i intend to keep it that way he warned tal even if any of that nonsensewas true i would order you to hold your tongue on the subject rumors like that are all that it takes to spark a riot and iwill not have a riot on my watch he waved his hand in a shooing motion at tal now get out of here and dont let me ever see anything like this report again tal shoved the chair back watching rayburn wince as the legs grated on the floor and left the office before he could say anything he didnt want rayburn to hear he wont have a riot on his watch as if he paid any attention to his district at all he seethed all the way back to his rooms at the gray rose and only long practice helped him to keep his stoic expression intact not even the mintaks notoriously sensitive to bodylanguage and able to read trouble from the most subtle of expressions had any idea that tal was suffering from more than his usual moodiness when he reached the safe haven of his rooms his first impulse was to reach for a bottlebut he did not give in to it hewanted a drinkhe wanted to numb his mind and his soul wanted the oblivion that a bottle would give him the few hours of respite when nothing mattered anymore but that respite was a lie and oblivion cured nothing and he knew the depth and shape of the trap far too well to fall into it himself liquor had been the ruin of many a constable in part because they needed to numb their feelings and their memories and in part he suspected because more and more of late the good constables were not able to do their jobs properly you can drop into despair or you can beat the bastards at their own game ill be damned if i let a pinheaded little shoelicker keep me from doing my job instead of reaching for that bottle he sat down at his desk with pen and paper in hand there was more than one mystery here and the second one was a question that concerned him intimately why had rayburn suppressed all of this why was he so adamant thatnothing was to leak out sometimes it helped him to make physical lists and he began two of them writing slowly and carefully with his tongue sticking out at the corner of his mouth as he concentrated writing did not come easily to him although reading did but working at a difficult task would keep him from doing something he might regret later like reaching for that bottle murdershe headed the first list andrayburn was what he put on the second page he started the second page first rayburn is trying to cover up the murders he wrote hes trying to make them appear perfectly common why why indeed the victims were all poor insignificant their neighborhoods were those where crime was if not a daily occurrence certainly not a stranger except for the gypsy girl whose death had not even occurred in his district there had been no notoriety attached to any of the cases and there were no relatives clamoring for any other solution than the official one maybe he shouldnt be looking at the victims for his answermaybe he should be thinking about the hand behind the murders who or what could be doing this he wrote on the first page a disease of the mindpossibly spreading a curse or more than one a mage now he returned to the second pagerayburn could be trying to prevent people knowing that there is a disease that makes them kill for no reason but that assumed that rayburn would be aware there was such a thing huh he might there was that taintedwheat scandal nearly two dozen people died raving mad from eating flour made from it the moneyed in this town would not want anyone to know about tainted food especially not if it was a common article like flour a good reason for rayburns superiors to want it hushed upthe only thing wrong with that theory was that in the wheat scandal there were a lot more victims spread across all classes for they had all bought their flour from the same merchants it could still be a disease or a taint but it would have to be coming from something only the poor are likely to come into contact with he racked his brains on that one maybe the water the poor got their water from common wellpumps that stood on every street corner the rich he didnt know and decided to let the idea lie fallow for the moment a curse is more problematicive never actually seen a curse that worked but that doesnt mean it hasnt happened elven curseseverybodys heard of those i cant imagine why a curse would take this particular form though unless it happens to be as undiscriminating in who it attaches itself to as any disease why a curse why here and why now and why were all the victims of the poorer classes it would make more sense for a curse to strike the rich and powerfulwouldnt it or was that just wishful thinking i suppose a curse or a cursed object would be able to work itself out no matter who was the victim so long as they fit its qualifications if the qualification is something as broad as human well just about anyone would fit he made a note but he didnt expect to get much information he just didnt know enough about the subject of curses and cursed objects to ask the right questions but there was another question that was relatedwhy did rayburn keep talking about riots if any of this got out did the captain have some information perhaps passed on from his superiors that would make him think that there was a possibility of a riot if wild enough rumors began to spread it could be thereve been riots and nearriots over nonhumans recently there was that nonhuman ghost that carried off a high bishop when people talk about curses that work they usually claim they came from nonhumans elves and the like most of the time but still people tend to lump all nonhumans into one group and figure that if elves work magic they can all work magic there were a fair number of nonhumans working in this city some of them quite prosperous and the usual prejudices and resentments against them by those too lazy to make their way by hard work nonhumans were easy targets whenever someone wanted a scapegoat maybe rayburn knew more about the riots and disturbances in other cities than tal didand maybe he was keeping a lid on this because he was afraid there would be more of the same here if rumors of curses and nasty magic got out that certainly fits in with all that talk of civil unrest and rioting oh talk of a knife with a curse on it would certainly set people off especially if they thought it was part of a plot things had been unsettled lately and he doubted that they were going to get any calmer there were a lot of changes going on deliambrens moving huge machines across the countryside new mechanical devices showing up and putting people out of work as more machines replaced handlabor more and more nonhumans moving into the twenty human kingdoms that would make a lot of people unhappy and uneasy and ripe for trouble there were always troublemakers happy to supply the trouble maybe rayburn wasnt as much of an idiot as tal had thought and maybe he is doing the right things for the wrong reasons keeping things quiet because he wants to make some rich patrons happy instead of keeping things quiet so troublemongers dont have anything to work with he shook his head not enough information without knowing what rayburn knew and who if anyone had ordered him to keep all this under the rose it was still most likely that rayburn was being a sycophant and a toady last of all on his listwhat if it all was being done by magic magic that was directed and purposeful rather than random like a curse well that kind of magic meant a mage was working it and that meantwhat elves are mages they dont like humans and we humans are encroaching more and more into their lands if it was an elf or it was rumored that it was an elf that was doing this that would bring up more resentment against nonhumans that just didnt feel right though as he understood it when there was some indication that nonhumans were going to have their rights taken away the rich were in favor of the move because they would have had first chance at confiscated properties and would have been able to purchase former free creatures as slaves rayburns patrons would not want riotsunless the ultimate goal meant more profit oh im making this far too convoluted im not certain any of rayburns patrons are that smart who else could be working this kind of magic they say that some gypsies are mageswell gypsies have some friends in questionable places but ive never met a gypsy that would have done to one of their own what was done to that poor girl of course there are bad cases in everyones family and i suppose it could be a gypsy mage but that wouldnt cause any trouble with rayburns superiors gypsies elveswho else worked magic some free bards allegedly through music but how would that figure in the fact that the victims were all musicians of a sort themselves free bards getting revenge on substandard minstrels the idea made him smile reluctantly no thats too farfetched even for me who else could it be the only other mages that i know of are priests priests suddenly an entirely new range of questions opened up before him what if this is being done by a priest who is a mage he wrote on the first page why well by strict church standards every single one of the victims and their putative killers were unrepentant sinners of course the church wouldnever condone murdering unrepentant sinners but the priest could be mad he could imagine himself to be the punitive arm of a stern and judgmental god could even believe that god was commanding him to do away with these people in fashions that would horrify other sinners into instant repentance right assume it is a priest assume that the church doesnt know for certain but suspects this is what is going on that would definitely fit the other question which was rayburns behavior one word from a priest to rayburn advising him to keep all of this quiet and rayburn would be scratching to cover it like a fastidious housecat if the church didnt even have a suspect yet there wouldreally be a cat among the pigeons as every priest that was in on the secret watched his fellows with suspicion next ideaassume they have a suspect or two but dont have evidence yet theyd have rayburn digging holes to dump evidence if they had to nextthey know who it is and they have him locked up but hes still doing this a barred cell isnt going to stop a really determined magician but ive never heard of a priest being executed as far as i know they cant be executed only imprisoned and nothing is going to stop a renegade mage but execution certainly the church would not want anyone to know that they couldnt keep a crazy priestmage from killing people the resulting scandal could rock the church to its foundations calling into question virtually every aspect of control now exercised by church officials there had been enough scandal already associated with the churchs possible involvement in the great fire at kingsford and the trickery and chicanery of high bishop padrick had caused great unrest riots thered be riots over that one all right with the church claiming its tithe and doing damned little for the poor with that tithe all it would take would be a hard winter bad storms and food shortages a real fullscale riot directed against the church would produce enough angry people to level every churchowned structure in the city if the priestwasnt madif he was doing this with church sanction a chill ran down his spine dont think that dont write it down it could be some terrible experiment in magic gone wrong and that would be another reason for rayburns superiors to want it nicely sunk in the bottom of the harbor no one would want people to know that the church permitted anyone to dabble in the kind of magic that would drive a man to murder a relatively innocent woman and then kill himself something else occurred to him and he wrote that down under the murders topic what if this isnt local what if we arent the only city to have this going on well if it wasnt local itprobably had nothing to do with the church not that the churchcouldnt be involved but mages couldnt work magic at great distance and something that caused murders in more than one city couldnt be hidden for long if church officials knew about it things like that leaked out novices learned things they werent supposed to know spreading rumor and truth more effectively than if the church was spreading the tales deliberately there is a bare possibility that this is a mad priest that the church knows about it and they keep moving him from town to town every time he starts doing things like this trying to cover up the murders and hoping that at some point hell just stop or god will stop him for them well there was one way of telling if it was local or not he put his two lists aside and took a fresh sheet of paper addressing it tothe keeper of the mortality lists highwaithe which was the nearest town upriver he sighed and flexed his hand to ease the cramps in it dipped the quill in the inkwell then set the pen carefully to the paper again good sir he began i am collecting mortality statistics in relation to the weather and am particularly interested in the occurrence of murdersuicides over the past five years there let rayburn try to stop him now the only thing that is going to stop me now he thought wryly is my aching hand and the number of letters im willing to write about the time he began getting replies to his letters the rash of murders ended as inexplicably as they had begun there were no more streetmusicians cut down with vanishing knives the only murders occurring now were the sordid and completely uninteresting kind but tal was not relievedrather he was alarmed every one of the clerks to whom he had written had responded and most had been delighted thatsomeone was showing interest in their dreary statistics hed gotten everything he asked and moreone enterprising fellow had even sent him a breakdown of his violentcrime statistics by moonphase tal had set up one corner of his sittingroom with a map pinned to the wall and his pile of return letters beneath it he sorted out the letters that showed no real increase in the number of murdersuicides then stuck a pin into the map for every occurrence in those towns and cities where the numberhad gone up the result was a crooked line that beganat least as far as he could tellat a small town called burdon heath at first the grisly trail followed the route of the newgate trade road then it left the road where it crossed the river and followed that instead there was no doubt in tals mind now that it was laid out in front of him whatever this was it was following the course of trade the pattern was quite clear and he knew that it was not over although the deadly shadow was no longer stalking the streets ofhis city the mind that had conceived of these murders in the first place was not going to simply stop needing to commit them he sat back in his chair and closed his eyes his first partner had been a constable who had solved the case of a madman whod gone about mutilating whores tal remembered what the man had told him a man like this has a need in him lad the old fellow had said its a craving like drugs or strong liquor he needs what he gets from doing things like this and what he gets is power the ability to control everything that happens to these girls the moment they get into his handswhat they feel how much they feel and the most important control of all when and how they die thats what he gets when youve got to find the man who does things like this thats what you look forthats whatll tell you what hes made of not how he does it look for what he gets if ever there was a case that those words fit this was it and tal knew that the mind behind these crimes the mind that craved the power he had over the victims had not suddenly been cured of its particular brand of madness rather that mind was aware exactly how dangerous that last death had beenand he had moved on before he could be caught being caught was no part of his plan he had to have been watching somewherehe wont get the thrill he needs just by hearing gossip he must have seen and understood what was going on when i took over the situation and recognized that i was a constable he wasnt going to take any more chances at that point the murderer knew how perilous it was that there had been a constable close enough to witness that last death and to have seen the knife and know it had vanished for certain tals attempt to find the knife only proved to the murderer that tal knew what he was looking for the murderer had probably taken himself and his associates if any to another hunting ground mortality clerks were both cooperative and incurious a fabulous combination so far as tal was concerned they not only supplied him with the bare statistics hed asked for they usually gave him the particulars of each murder the musician connection was still there and the dates were in chronological order the further a town is from here the farther back the rash of murdersuicides goes there was no overlap of datesno case where there were times when the deaths occurred in two different places at nearly the same date the unknown perpetrator staged his deaths no less than three and so far no more than nine then at some signal tal could not fathom he decided it was time to move on and did so he was finished here that was the good news the bad news was that he had moved on unfortunately the most likely place was the one city in the entire kingdom where his depredations would be likely to go completely unnoticed for weeks if not months due to the chaotic conditions there the kanar river was the obvious and easiest road it flowed easily and unobstructed through a dozen towns between here and the place that must surely attract this man as a fine clear stream attracted trout fishers the great halfburned and halfbuilt metropolis of kingsford chapter four reading too longespecially letters with terrible penmanshipalways made ardiss eyes ache and the justiciarpriest closed and rubbed them with the back of her thumb rank did have its privileges though and no one asked the priests of her order to sacrifice comfort in return for devoting their lives to justice and god though plainalmost to the point of austerity ardiss quarters were warmed by a fine draftfree stove her readingchair comfortably cushioned and the light falling on her papers was as clear as fine oil a carefullytrimmed wick and a squeakyclean lamp could provide but im tired overworked and getting no youngerbriefly she wondered what her life would be like if she had wedded according to her stature as her family had expected her to at this hour she would probably be receiving callers in a luxuriouslyappointed reception room giving final orders for a sumptuous formal dinner and thinking about which dress she would wear to the evenings ball or party id be bored which would be worse than overworked my mind would have gone to mush and i would probably have joined some stupid group devoted to mystical rubbish out of sheer desperation for something different in my life or id be having affair after frantic affair like so many of my female relations are doing because they are shackled in loveless lifeless marriages with nothing to occupy their minds i could read those and give you a summary said her secretary kayne davenkent a clever and steady young novice that ardis had plucked from the ranks of the scribes just last summer ardis didnt immediately reply but she smiled to herself as she recalled the occasion that the novice had been brought to her attention like most novices in the order of the justiciars she had been assigned to the copying of legal documents from all over the twenty kingdoms these copies were sent out to church libraries everywhere in order to keep everyone current on legal precedent in all of the kingdoms there were only two forces common to all of human life on alanda the church and the high king and of the two only the church substantially affected the life of the common man kayne had persisted in questioning the authenticity of a recently acquired document she was supposed to be copying which had irritated her superior ordinarily he would have taken care of the problem himself but he was of the faction that had not been in favor of ardis when she asserted her control over the abbey of the order of the justiciars at kingsford and he delighted in taking the smallest of discipline problems directly to ardis rather than dealing with them himself he probably hoped to overwhelm her with petty details so that he and his faction could proceed to intrigue her right out of her position while she was drowning in nitpicking nonsense unfortunately for his plans she was already aware of his intentions and in particular this attempt to irritate his superior had backfired intrigued by the notion of a novice who stood her ground against a priests judgment ardis demanded the particulars and discovered that kayne was right and father leod was wrong further she discovered that in disputes of a similar nature kayne was usually right and father leod wrong intelligence acute observation courage wit and persistence and the ability to think for herself rather than parroting the opinions of her superiorthose were qualities all too often lacking in novices and qualities that ardis appreciated knowing the young woman was wasted in her position she had snatched kayne up for her own staff before father leod knew what was happening i know you could give me a summary and a good one too but you know why i wont let you ardis replied putting her head back against the padded leather of her chair her eyes still closed i told you why a week ago when you made the same offerwhich is appreciated by the way even if i dont accept it because a summary wont give you the sense of things they arent putting down kayne repeated with a little wellbred irritation of her own that sounds rather too much like mindreading and i cant see where its all that important in personal correspondence her irritation showed a little more it also sounds frankly as if you simply didnt want me to see the letter and if thats the real reason i wish youd justtell me instead of making something up ardis laughed at that and opened her eyes kayne was very young to be a novice but her clever tongue acidic wit sharp features and sharper temper were unlikely to win her many friends much less suitors so perhaps that was why she never attracted a marriage proposal ardis appreciated her sharp tongue but she was going to have to teach kayne how to curb it kayne was really too intelligent to ever remain a mere secretary but if it hadnt been for ardis she probably would have been kept in a subordinate position all her life and shewould remain subordinate if she made too many enemies to advance she might have done well enough in secular society but she had told ardis in her initial interview that there really hadnt had any choice but to go into the church she was too poor to become a merchant and there were not too many masters in the more interesting guilds and crafts who would take on an apprentice without the apprenticing fee not much like myself at her agebut i think shes going to go far if the church will let her and it will if i have any say in the matter and she can learn when it is better to keep your observations behind your teeth its not mindreading and its not intuition either ardis told her its all based on patterns that i have observed after many years of dealing with these same people i know what they say how they say it and how they conceal things they dont want me to know by the way they choose their words its knowledge you cant describe briefly to someone else but its knowledge all the same and its all the more important in personal correspondence when the people who are writing to me are the movers and shakers of their areaslike my cousin talaysen kaynes brow wrinkled as she took that in i dont suppose you could give me an example could you she asked as a matter of fact i can from this letter ardis tapped the sheet of thick creamcolored vellum on the desk just above the seal of free bard master talaysen currently the advisor to the king of birnam my cousin mentions that his king has had three visitors from raydenfromour part of the kingdom in factbut goes into detail on only two of them he knows all three of them from his life at court before he gave up his position as a master of the bardic guild although it seems that none of them recognized him as he is now i know from things we have written and spoken about in the past that he believes that the third man who appears to be an ordinary enough fop is actually playing a much deeper game involving both secular politics and the church hes warned me about this fellow before i also know from other sources that this fellow has said things aboutme in the past that are less than complimentary my cousin doesnt like to worry me and if he believes there is something going on that threatens me he will take whatever steps he can to thwart it himself without involving me hence this third visitor has said or done something that makes talaysen think he is gathering information for possible use against me and talaysen is trying to spike his wheelsprobably by feeding him misinformation she raised an eyebrow at her crestfallen secretary now assume youve read this letter would you have made those deductions from it no kayne replied properly humbled i probably wouldnt even have mentioned the visitors at all thinking they came under the heading of social chitchat nothingcomes under the heading of social chitchat when people have managed to make a high bishop out of you ardis corrected sourly may god help me that last came out with the fervor of the prayer it actually was ardis would have been much happier if no one had ever come up with that particular notion i thought you wanted to become a high bishop kayne said in surprise how could you not what how could i not want to become a bigger target for slander libel and intrigue than i already was she responded tartly if i were only the abbess and the chief justiciar i would have been much safer as a woman they would always underestimate me so long as i didnt intrigue for a high position if i had the power but not the title i would not be nearly the threat to other powerholders inside and outside the church as i am since i wear the miter i am not so fond of fancy hats that i was pleased to put up with all that just so i could wear one kayne snickered at ardiss designation of the high bishops miter as a fancy hat ardis leaned over her desk and fixed her young secretary with a stern look if you are going to prosper in the church youd better keep in mind that a woman is always in a more precarious position than a man she said carefully it is much better to hold power quietly without trappings than it is to make a show of it the men will resent you a great deal less listen to you a great deal more and might even come to respect you in time kayne nodded slowly so thats why she spread her hands indicating the office correct the appearance of austerity and modesty the reality of a certain level of comfort ardis smiled you should have seen this office when my predecessor sat here it looked like a cross between a cathedral and a throne room i cleared most of that out sold the expensive trash to pay for this and donated the rest to one of the orphanages arden established after the fire she chuckled reminiscently somewhere in kingsford there are orphans bouncing on his overstuffed plushcovered sofa and grinding muddy little feet into his appalling carpet and i do hope he finds out about it kayne snickered again well is there anything youd like to dictate to me before i retire to my office and catch up on the last of the work from yesterday ardis considered the stack of correspondence before her how are things coming across the river by across the river ardis meant in the city of kingsford which had been half burned down by a disastrous fire a little more than two years ago the fire itself was not natural it had been set by conspirators hoping to murder duke arden who had joined forces or so ardis suspected with members of ardiss own order in an attempt to usurp control of the cloister and cathedral of the justiciars and then take full control of all of the church holdings in kingsford and put the lot in the hands of a group of closedminded fanatics ardis only suspected that the two groups had been in league with each other even though there was nothing but rumor to link themthe fires had certainly been started magically in the rafters of the dukes theater while the duke was attending a performance so far as ardis knew the only humans in kingsford and the surrounding area who could use magic were priests of the order of justiciars there had been any number of the fanatical faction preaching and stirring up trouble before the fire and there were a few witnesses among the actors and musicians who had seen a figure in the robes of a priest loitering about the theater in a suspicious manner just before the fire and the uprising within the cloister walls had occurred so simultaneously with the fires in the theater that even the most skeptical were convinced that it could not be a coincidence but a hot high wind combined with the driest summer on record had contributed to spreading the fire out of control while the uprising within the cloister walls had ensured that there were no mages to spare to fight those fires and when it was all over the greater part of kingsford lay in ruins it was only the personal effort of arden himself that kept the disaster from being worse than it was the duke had led the battle against the fire himself working side by side with the lowest citizens of the city his actions had earned him the undying loyalty of all of kingsford and the title good duke arden two years later the city was still partly in ruins and ardis felt very sorry for the grand duke he had beggared himself to help pay for the rebuilding with the intentions of creating an ideal city out of the ashes a city with no slums a city that was planned from the beginning a city where residential districts would not sit cheekbyjowl with tanneries and sewers would not dump their noisome contents upstream from places where people drew out their water but the bestlaid plans of men and grand dukes were subject to the whims of fate and fate had decreed otherwise unwilling or unable to wait on the dukes plans to rebuild their homes and businesses those who had money of their own proceeded to put those homes and businesses wherever they pleasedusually building on what was left of their old property the result was that half of the rebuilt city was laid out along duke ardens plans and the other half was laid out the same way it had beenin as haphazard a fashion as could be expected the only real change was that he had been able to decree that streets would be laid out on a grid so there were no more dead ends and culdesacs or meandering alleys that went nowhere arden finally got the fireboats he ordered kayne reported they arrived today whether they work or not she shrugged if they dont ill make a point of assigning someone to get those pumps working by magic providing arden doesnt browbeat a deliambren to come up with something better ardis replied she still suffered from twitches of mingled guilt and anger when she thought of how easy it would have been for church mages to halt the fire before it had spread more than a block or two not thatshe was responsible for the fact that they hadnt but still i am a mage and a justiciar and what happened to the people of kingsford was a gross miscarriage of justice he probably will he already has them working on a system to pump water to every part of the city kayne observed whats a little thing like fixing the pumps on a fireboat compared to that ardis nodded absently if the idiots that started those fires didnt perish in the conflagration they had better be so far from kingsford that humans are an oddity because if i ever get hold of them theyll pray to be handed over to the duke for punishment hell only hang them she had already taken care of those she had been able to catch recalling a magic transformation discovered and abused by another renegade priestmage she had put his discovery to better use the miscreants were serving out life sentences toiling under baskets of rubble and ashes and wearing the forms of donkeys titularly the property of the abbey they were under longterm loan to the city and when all the rubble was cleared away they would be hitched to the carts that carried away the dead they were well cared for housed in their own stable in the city where a special priest of one of the service ordersa close personal friend of both ardis and the dukewho knew what they were had been assigned to their physical and spiritual needs they were awakened every morning at dawn with prayer put to bed in their stalls with prayer and prayed over while they worked they would have ample opportunity for repentance redemption and contemplation they were also performing the hardest physical labor they ever had in their lives seven days a week from dawn to dusk in pouring rain burning sun or blinding blizzard they would never be human again for ardis had locked the spell on them herself no one knew of their fate except ardis the grand duke and the young priest assigned to their care who was far more concerned with the state of their souls than the discomfort of their bodies even duke arden agreed that the punishment was sufficient ardis had similar fates planned for any more miscreants that turned up as for the rest arden has given up on the carpenters and now hes trying with the weavers and dyers kayne looked thoughtful i think hell have a bit more luck with them they need water for their work more than the carpenters do arden was trying to persuade those who had built according to their own plans to tear down what they had put up and rebuild according to his he was having mixed success and often it depended on the season and whether or not he had alternatives available while those who were displaced waited for the new construction to be completed people who might not mind spending a month or two in a wellappointed tent in the summer would get decidedly testy about the idea in midwinter and those whose businesses required that their materials stay dry were not likely to give up a roof for the sky ardis chuckled poor arden hell never give up not as long as there is a single crooked street in kingsford perhaps or perhaps he will find other things to occupy him kayne observed he cant stay out of politics forever as you have pointed out in the past speaking of politics have you anything youd like me to take care of for you since you havent got anything to dictate to me here ardis handed the young woman a small packet of invitations accept the invitation to duke ardens musical entertainment give permission for the novices choir to sing at the opening of the new wool guild hall with the stipulation that no more than half the repertory be hymns mentioning sheep shepherds spinners weavers or wool and decline everything else with my sincere regrets she shook her head i never got this many invitations to dinners and parties when i was a maiden looking for a husband i cant conceive of why im getting them now kayne accepted the packet with a shrug i havent the background to tell you she said with callous frankness maybe they hope god will judge their entertaining with charity when they die if you attend ardis stretched the heavy sleeves of her scarlet robe falling down around her elbows thats as good a theory as any she replied now ill just write a brief letter to my cousin and you can pick it off my desk and address it in the morning taking that properly as her dismissal kayne rose and made the ritual bows a brief nod of respect to ardis and a deeper genuflection to the small altar in the corner of the room when she was gone ardis picked up her pen and took a clean sheet of paper it never took long to write to talaysen words flowed as easily as if she was talking to him rather than writing no matter how long it had been since they last saw each other or how many leagues lay between them they were still closer than many siblings when she had finished she sanded the letter to dry the ink then set it aside in the tray for kayne to take in the morning there were more records to deal with for recordkeeping had not been a priority when there were people who were going to die of injuries or exposure if something wasnt done about their needs right that moment ardis had never minded recordkeeping or paperwork unlike some of her colleagues these days it gave her some time to herself time when she was not the high bishop even now it still gave her a twinge when she realized that the title and all that went with it were hers it was an honor and a responsibility she had not expected to attain before her hair was totally white if ever she had known all along that the position would be as much trouble as honor and she was resigned to dealing with the former these records were a part of that extremely sensitive information that she did not want in the hands even of her loyal secretary these were the abbey records that dealt with crime and punishment priests who failed the faiththe euphemism for criminalswere seldom turned over to secular authorities and were never punished publicly every abbey had a section of cells with locks on the outside of the doorseffectively a gaoland some even referred to that section by that name others like the justiciars kingsford abbey were more discreet and called the section by the term repentance retreat those who stole committed fraud or violated church canon law ended up there until they truly sincerely repented sometimes however there were cases that were more serious and required a solution that went beyond simple incarceration there had been four such cases locked in the cells at the time of the rebellion and fire three of whom had been mages and like the others who had been down there they had been released by the rebels one had died in a magebattle the one who was not a mage had fled though not to the rebels but to ardiss people and had earned a certain amount of forgiveness by warning them and fighting at their side two had vanished completely since they had last been seen fleeing for the city it was presumed that they were dead but ardis didnt much care for making such presumptions especially not where these two were concerned since both of them like her little donkeys had been locked into forms that were not human one of them was the renegade priestmage named revaner who had discovered transformative magic in the first place and his transformation was public knowledge since it had occurred very dramatically at the midsummer faire it was a tale that had been made into more than one song revaner had lusted after a young free bard and gypsy named robin she had spurned his advances and in revenge he had conspired with a guild bard named betris to catch and confine her when she was caught revaner transformed her into a huge brightlycolored bird that he displayed as a curiosity and forced to sing for his guests at the faire master talaysen his apprentice rune and another free bard called heron had discovered what had happened to robin and appealed to the justiciars ardis had directed them to bring the bird before her they had stolen the captive and after a long and dramatic chase through the grounds of the faire had brought not only the transformed bard but had brought revaner who had been pursuing them the priest made the mistake of underestimating ardiss power and had claimed the bird as his property ardis and the other two justiciarmages with her had demonstrated by breaking his spells that the bird was the gypsy after all they had been not only his judges but the instrument of his punishment in breaking his spells they turned his magic back on him and he was the one who was transformed ardis was senior enough to decree that this was fit punishment and transformed he had remained until the day of the fire there were two more rebellious priests who were among the unaccountedfor although they were not mages ardis had spent the last several days going over the records of the unidentified dead from the fire hoping to find matches for her missing miscreants she frowned as she came up emptyhanded this is not good i would rather not contemplate the consequences of renegade priestmages wandering about feeding their own mad agendas granted they had been stripped of their powers but it hadnt been their magic powers that were the cause of their incarceration they could still do harm they could set themselves up as priests of some other order out in the back of beyond and go back to abusing those who are in their care and we wouldnt know unless someone reported them or the local priest got curious because they stopped attending services in his chapel even then we wouldnt know unless he made an inquiry she shook her head the only thing that she could think to do was to send letters to the clerks of the records of all the other orders describing the runaways advising that they might try to set themselves up in their own parishes and asking that copies of any suspicious inquiries be sent to kingsford abbey if they dare try that and we catch themshe gritted her teeth they would be made very unhappy i wonder how they would like serving the church as oxen at one of the hermitage farms that would be particularly appropriate in the case of revaner she did what she could among the records made a first draft of the letter she was going to have to send to the other orders and locked it in a drawer shed have to make some special preparations tomorrow but this was one time when it made more sense to make copies magically than by hand someday perhaps she could allow kayne to know this particular secret but for now it was best kept as private as possible she turned back to the letter from her cousin for the final paragraph troubled her talaysen very seldom asked her for anything and the request he had for her this time was a disturbing one i have been receiving reports from rayden of the murders of several free bards and gypsies he wrote ardis i will be the very first to admit that my people tend to get themselves into trouble of their own accord and occasionally some of them do end up on the wrong end of a knife but these have all been violent senseless horrible murders by absolute strangers no one understands why or how they happened and all the victims have been women some of my people are becoming very alarmed they dont know how to explain it but the ones with magic think that there is some power that is deliberately seeking them out to slay them i dont know what you can dobut you are a priest a mage and a justiciar can you try to find out what is going on and put a stop to it she smoothed her short hair back with both hands and stared at that last paragraph cursing talaysen for not sending her all the facts but that assumed that hehad them he might know nothing more than what he had told her still if she had names dates placesshe might have been able to start an investigation it would be a great deal more difficult to do so with information that was this vague she had already told him though in an equally vague sentence at the end of her letter that she would do everything she could to help him with his problem she folded up his letter and locked it away with the other sensitive material in her special desk drawerill put it in the back of my mind and sleep on it she told herself knowing that she often came up with solutions to difficult situations that wayright now more than anything i need a little time to myself my mind feels as bloated and stiff as a cowgut balloon nownow was her one hour of indulgence the hour she kept solely for herself when she could read in silence and peace and not have to think of anything but the words on the page before her shed only begun taking this hour for herself in the last few weeks until now things had been too hectic even to steal a single hour for herself this was the quiet time she had been hoping for since the great fire in the months that had followed the conflagration she had been forced to do the work of four people there had been the situation in her own order to consolidate by making certain thather allies in the order were placed in every position of importance and those whose loyalties were in doubt were put in positions of equal stature but where they could do her no harmsuch as father leod occasionally she had been forced to manufacture such positions to avoid making an outright enemy by demoting him then there had been the relief effort in the citythe number of deaths had been appalling and as the days passed more and more of the missing had to be added to the rolls of the presumed dead the number of burned and injured was even worse than the number of dead for at least the dead no longer suffered the injured suffered terribly for fatal burns made for a long drawnout agonizing death when there were not enough painkillers to treat more than a fraction of those hurt for those who were most likely to die anyway she had had to make the unpleasant decision to give them the painkillers with the worst longterm side effectssince after all they would not survive long enough to suffer thembut while they still breathed they could have less agony then there were the homeless and the illnesses that followed exposure to the elements food and water that could not be kept clean and of course the overwhelming shock and grief the one saving grace had been that it was summer rather than winter the one miracle was that some of the warehouses where the tents used in the kingsford faire were stored had been spared one of ardiss first acts was to order the warehouses broken into and the tents erected on faire field to shelter the homeless no matter who owned them her second had been to commandeer as much canvas as existed within several days journey and arrange for it rope tools and poles to be made available to the refugees it was amazing how many of them acquired tentmaking skills when the raw materials were left at hand for them to use she had ensured that no avaricious profiteer could scoop it all up and sell it by having the canvas parceled into reasonable bits and rationed by armed guard all of the resources of the church had been put to the task of making it possible for people to begin salvaging their lives again and between the church and their duke by that winter most people had some sort of reasonable shelter to meet the snow and now most people had real walls and roofs and it wastheir duty to get their lives in order and not the churchs things were not back to normal and would not be for many years to come but they were at the point where people could take over their own lives and ardis could at last go back to some of her old habits she might even be able to devote more of her time to reading than just that single hour kingsford was not a jewel without a flaw there were plenty of them the dukes coffers were far from bottomless and he could not remedy every ill he would very much have liked to build places where the poor could enjoy walls and roofs as solid as those of their betters but he had to budget his resources and there were others with fewer scruples ready to supply the needs of the lowborn nor had the nature of the people who had lived there been changed by the fire so as a result the new kingsford was a great deal like the old kingsford there were blocks of ramshackle tenements that looked as if they would fall down in the first strong windbut somehow managed to survive all the same there were a few lawless places where even the constables would not walk at night there were thieves cutpurses sharpsters gamecheats procurers unlicensed streetwalkers and those who preyed upon their fellow humans in every way that had ever been thought of ardis who as a priest was far more cognizant of the breadth of human nature than duke arden could have told him that this would happen she had also known that it would be useless to tell him as this was the last thing he wanted to hear so she had held her peace and as kingsford rose phoenixlike out of the ashes she did her best to counsel and console him when some of his citys newgrown feathers were broken dirty or stunted at least now that winter had settled in there would be less violent public crime for her people to handle dealing with that was yet another task of the justiciars although they generally only were involved when a putative criminal was apprehended and not before the death rate wouldnt drop off for the very old the weak and the very young would succumb to the cold and the illnesses associated with the cold those deaths were the purview of the charitable orders in the city itself and not of the justiciars justiciars and justiciarmages could and did work limited healing magics but not often and it was not widely known that they could do so the fact that the justiciars worked magic at all was not exactly a secret but detailed knowledge was not widely disseminated the problem with doing magical healing was that it was difficult to know when to stopand who to help it would be easy to spend all ones time or energy on healing and get nothing else done that would certainly be a cause for rejoicing among the citys miscreants and criminals who would be only too happy for the justiciars to spend their time on something besides dispensing justice well theyre all bottled up until warmer weatherwhen the winter wind howled even the cutthroats huddled beside their stoves and waited for spring and just as they she settled into her oftenuneasy new position huddled besideher stove and took an hours consolation each night in books this wasnt frivolous readingshed left all that behind her outside the cloister wallsbut she didnt often choose devotional works either usually it was law or history occasionally works on magic today it was to be a very private work on magic which had arrived with her cousins letter written expressly for her by one of talaysens gypsy friends and to be destroyed as soon as she finished reading it it was a short manuscript on gypsy magicor rather the fashion in which gypsies used the power that was magic another manuscript had come with this one which had been hidden inside the larger tomealso written by a gypsy it described the means by which miracles could be faked after some editing for form rather than content ardis intended to have this one published for the general public then perhaps there will be less of a chance for another high bishop padrik to deceive the public she evened the manuscript and set it down on the desktop before her but before she had read more than the introductory sentences kayne returned a frown on her face theres a fellow here who insists on seeing you she said with annoyance he wont leave and short of getting guards to throw him out i cantmake him leave he claims to be a constable from haldene and he says he has information its vital to give you ardis sighed and it cant wait until my morning audience hours tomorrow she asked wearily kayne shook her head he says not and he wont talk to anyone else ardis weighed duty against desire and as always duty won send him in she said with resignation putting her manuscripts safely away in that special drawer and locking it she secured the lock with just a touch of magic as the importunate visitor came in escorted by kayne who made no effort to hide her disapproval but ardis was not so certain that kaynes disapproval was warranted the fellow was quite clearly exhausted his plain workaday clothing travelstained and his face gray and lined with weariness first impressions were important and this man impressed her because of his physical state if whatever he had to tell her wasnot really important he would have taken the time to clean up and don his finest garments constable tal rufen of haldene kayne announced with an audible sniff and ardis rose and extended her hand rufen took it went to his knee in the appropriate genuflection and pressed it briefly to his forehead in token of his submission to the authority of god and the church so he was a churchman not all humans werethe gypsies for instance held to their own set of deities chief of whom was the lady of the night very different from the churchs sexless sacrificed god sit down tal rufen ardis said as soon as he rose to his feet she turned to her secretary kayne please bring us some hot tea and something to eat would you kaynes disapproval dropped from her like a cloak when she saw that ardis was going to take the man seriously yes high bishop the young woman said respectfully as ardiss visitor dropped into the chair she indicated with a lack of grace that bespoke someone nearing the end of his strength ardis ignored that and settled into her own chair steepling her fingers together as she considered the constable before her the man was of middling stature and middling years she would guess he was very nearly her own age perhaps a year or two older he had probably been a constable for most of his adult life he exhibited his authority unconsciously and wore his uniform tunic with an easy familiarity that suggested he might be more uncomfortable in civilian clothing than in his working garb no paperpusher this he had the muscular strength of a man quite used to catching runaway horses and running thieves wrestling rowdy drunks and breaking down doors the lines on his face suggested that he didnt smile much nor did he frown his habitual expression was probably one of neutral sobriety he had an oblong face with a slightly squared chin high flat cheekbones and deepset eyes of an indeterminate brown beneath moderately thick brows gray in his brown hair suggested that he might be a bit older than he looked but ardis didnt think so he probably earned those gray hairs on the streetshe looked competent and a competent constable took his duty seriously so what was he doing so far from haldene tal rufen of haldene she said breaking the silence and making him start youre a long way from home the entrance of kayne with a loaded tray gave him a reason not to answer but kayne didnt stay ardis caught her secretarys eyes and made a slight nod towards the door kayne took it as the order it was and left them alone ardis poured out tea and handed him a cup and a plate of cheese and unleavened crackers tal drank his cup off in a single gulp asked permission with a glance and poured himself a second cup that he downed while he wolfed crackers and cheese as if he hadnt eaten all day perhaps he hasnt very curious but if he did his work the way he ate his superiors would never be able to find fault with him he was quick efficient and neat without being rude or illmannered he made the food vanish as thoroughly as if he were a sleightofhand artist and settled back into his chair with a third cup of tea clasped between his hands i dont see very many constables from outside of kingsford ardis continued and then it is usually only in the summer i would say that it must have been some very urgent errand to urge you to travel so far in the middle of winter if you consider murder an urgent errand you would be correct high bishop the man replied quietly in a ringing baritone for it is murder that brings me here he waited for her to interrupt then went on i want to beg your indulgence however and allow me to tell you this in my own way if your way is to begin at the beginning and acquaint me with the facts as you discovered them then proceed she told him watching him from beneath lowered lids he nodded soberly and began his narrative he was precise detailed and dry in a way that reminded her of a history book that in turn suggested that he had more than a passing acquaintance with such books interesting most of the constables she knew were hardly scholars she had interviewed any number of constables over the course of the years and he had already stated it was murder that brought him here so it was no surprise when he began with the details of a particularly sordid case the solution seemed straightforward enough for the murderer had turned around and immediately threw himself into the river but it cant be that straightforward her conclusion was correct for he described another murder then a thirdand she very quickly saw the things that linked them all together the bizarre pattern of murder then suicide and the missing knife she interrupted him as he began the details of a fourth case whatis going on in haldene tal rufen she demanded with concern is there some disease driving your people to kill each other i cannot ever recall hearing of that many murdersuicides in a single year in kingsford and this is a far larger city than little haldene he gave her a look of startled admiration i dont know my lady bishop he replied with new respect i did consider that solution but it doesnt seem to match the circumstances shall i continue she gestured at him to do so and continued to listen to his descriptions not only of the chain of murdersuicides in haldene but similar crimes that he had uncovered with patient inquiry over the countryside they began in a chain of villages and towns that led to haldene then moved beyond beyondto kingsford which was the next large city in the chain if the pattern was to follow the kanar river he came to the end of his chain of reasoning just as she came to that realization interesting she watched him narrowly he didnt flinch or look away and you think that kingsford is now going to be visited by a similar set of occurrences that is what brought you here yes high bishop he told her and only then did he raise a hand to rub at his eyes wearily i do and now i must also make a confession to you i am a priest she said dryly im rather accustomed to hearing them she had hoped to invoke at least a faint smile from him but all he did was sigh i fear that i am here under somewhat false pretenses iwas a constable of haldene but im rather afraid that i am no longer i began investigating this string of tragedies over the objections of my superiors i continued against their direct orders when they discovered what i had learned they dismissed me he waited to see if she was going to react to that or say something and continued when she did not i would have quit in any case when i saw where thisseries of coincidenceswas heading he smiled with no trace of humor there is a better chance that the king will turn gypsy tomorrow than that my superiors would permit me to take leave to inform authorities in kingsford about this after all the plague has left haldene it is no longer a problem for those in authority there i see she wondered for a moment if he was going to ask her for a position had all of this been manufactured just to get her attention have you gone to the captain of the constables in kingsford i tried he replied and this time hedid smile faintly hes not an easy man to get to hmm true in fact captain fenris was the hardest man tofind in kingsford but not because he was mewed up in an office behind a battery of secretaries it might take weeks before tal was able to track him down i believe that at the moment he is on doubleshift training the new recruits he could be anywhere in the city at any given moment and his secondincommand is unlikely to make any decisions in a situation like this more to the point im hardly going to get a glowing recommendation from my former superiors in haldene if his secondincommand were to make an inquiry about me tal pointed out theyll probably tell him im a troublemaker with a history of mental instability honest and he hasnt said a word about wanting a position i will admit that im becoming obsessed with this case tal continued and then she saw a hint just the barest glimpse of something fierce and implacable it gazed at her out of his eyes for a moment then vanished who or whatever is behind this i want it stopped and you want from me ardis spread her hands now if there was going to be a plea for anything she had given tal an opening he hesitated i wantauthority he said finally credentials not a great deal just enough that if anyone asks me why im snooping around i can say im acting on your behalf and with your knowledge of course ill keep you informed every day even if i find nothing and i wont actuallydo anything unless it is to stop a murder in progress i wont search houses or people i wont try and haul anyone off to gaol i wont threaten or bully ill just observe and ask questions ardis graced him with her most skeptical look and thats all you want well obviously idlike to have all of the kingsford constables working on this idlike the services of a mage and idlike four or five personal assistants he replied a little sarcastically but id also like to be made captain of the constables stop this madness before it infects kingsford and be rewarded with the grand dukes daughter obviously none of this is possible so im asking for the least i need to continue to track this case and what had you planned to do to make ends meet she asked bluntly i assume you arent independently wealthy he shrugged i was working on the case in my offtime anyway i have enough muscle and experience to get a job as a private guard or even a peacekeeper in a tavern i can still work on it in my offtime and without being harassed for doing so if i can just get minimal credentials so hes willing to support himself in a strange city just so that he can continue following thiswhatever it is hes right hes obsessed i wish more people would become that obsessed when it is necessary let me assume for the moment that there reallyis aforcethat is causing these deaths it occurs to me that alerting the entire constabulary to this case might also make that force go into hiding she said aloud not quite willing to answer his request yet that could easily be true he agreed which is unfortunately a good reasonnot to inform captain fenrisor at least to ask him not to inform the rest of the constabulary and it also occurs to me that this force knows a great deal about how both investigation and magic operate he raised one eyebrow at her it hadnt escaped my notice that every one of the suicides was eitherby means of running water orunder running watereven the jeweler now she was surprised for she had thought that last horrific case had all been perpetrated indoors how could the jeweler he worked with acids and he had a kind of emergency downpour rigged in his studio tal replied he had a pipe coming down from his rooftop cistern that ended in the ceiling of his studio with a valve on the end that was operated by a string with a drain beneath it after he drank his acids and poisons he staggered over beneath the pipe and pulled the string when he was found the cistern was emptythe initial investigation missed that because by then the floor was dry he looked at her expectantly obviously i dont have to tell you that running water is the only certain means of removing evidence of magic she tapped the ends of her forefingers together and frowned this is beginning to form a picture i dont like because most of thehuman mages are in the church tal asked quietly surprised but pleased at his audacity she nodded there is the possibility that it is not a human but franklywhat youve told me fits no pattern of a nonhuman mind that i am aware of at least not a sane one and the nonhuman races are very careful not to allow their problems to escape to human lands just as we are careful not to let ours escape to theirs he corroborated still elves she shook her head elves take their revenge in a leisurely fashion and an artistic one this is both too sordid and too hasty for elves to be involved haspur arent mages nor mintaks nor deliambrens he said thinking out loud it could be someone from a very obscure racebut then id have known about him hed stand out in those neighborhoods like a white crow what about gypsies ive heard some of them are mages again she hesitated there are bad gypsiesbut the gypsies are very careful about policing their own people if this is a gypsy he has somehow eluded hunters from among his own kind and that is so difficult that i find it as unlikely as it being an elf i have information sources among them and i have heard nothing of she stopped in midsentence suddenly struck by something her cousins letter tal waited watching her expectantly i was about to say that i have heard nothing of this she said very slowly but i have hadsome distressing information from my sources the victimshave they by any chance been free bards or gypsies again she got a startled look from him i can only speak for the cases in haldene i didnt get much detail on the ones in the other towns and villages and frankly i didnt spend much time investigating when i learned that the murders were going in the direction that i had feared no free bards and only one gypsy he told her licking his lips butperhaps this will seem mad to you which is why i hesitated to mention itevery one of the dead women was either a musician of sorts or posing as one ardis pursed her lips so there is a link between the victims even when they seem disparate in everything but their poverty i dont like this i dont like this at allardis was not aware that she was frowning until she caught a brief glimpse of worry on tals face she forced her expression into something smoother i believe you tal rufen she said at last anyone planning to hoodwink me would have concocted something less bizarre and more plausible the constables visible relief conjured at least a tiny smile onto her face so youll vouch for me if i have trouble getting information he asked hopefully ill do more than that she pulled the bellcord that summoned kayne from the next room when the novice arrived eyes brimming with suppressed curiosity ardis motioned for her to sit down as well tal this is novice kayne my personal secretary i suspect you will be working at least peripherally together they eyed one another warily a grayhound and a mastiff trying to decide if they were going to be friends or not she hid her amusement kayne i am making tal one of the abbey guards and my personal retainer she smiled a bit wider as they both turned startled eyes on her please get him the appropriate uniforms and see that he has housing with the others a room to himself if you please and a key to the garden doors his hours are likely to be irregular he is going to be a special inquisitor so draw up the papers for him no one else is to know of that rank for the moment except you and the guardcaptain however to the rest he is simply to be my personal guard kaynes eyes danced with excitement this was obviously the sort of secret she had hoped to be privy to when ardis appointed her to her post yes high bishop at once guard rufen have you any belongings you wish me to send to your quarters i have a packmule in your courtyard and a ridingmule tal said dazedly i left them tied to the post there ill see that they are taken care of she rose quickly to her feet and looked briefly to ardis for further instructions you can come back for him here ardis said ohand draw out his first quarters pay would you of course high bishop the young woman left in a swirl of rustcolored robes and anticipation ardis settled back in her chair secretly a little pleased to have so startled the stonefaced constable there are times when it is very useful to have no one to answer to but ones own self so guard rufen you are now a special inquisitor that means that no one can hinder you in whatever you wish to ask or wherever you wish to go that which is told to you is under the same veil of secrecy as the confessional you may tell it to no one except your direct superior which is myself since you are the only inquisitor the kingsford abbey now boasts within reason and kayne will tell you when you have transgressed those bounds you may requisition anything you need from the abbey resources that includes bribemoney she laughed at his shocked expression oh come now inquisitor rufendo you take me for a cloistered unworldly you will have to bribe people often only money will loosen the tongue when not even threat of eternal damnation will have an effect simply tell kayne what it is for and keep strict accounts yes high bishop he said faintly come to kayne for whatever you need she continued report to me once a day if you have anything new to report to kayne if you have nothing take your meals in the abbey or in the city as you prefer but meals in the city will have to come under your own expenses wear your uniform as you deem advisablealways within the abbey but outside of the abbey you may choose to wear civilian clothing as a special inquisitor your duty is to investigate whati deem necessary not religious irregularities those are for the general inquisitors of which this abbey has none the city constables will not interfere with you when you show them your papersbut in any event once they know you by sight they wont bother you ill tell fenris only that you are conducting an investigation for me only duke ardens men might continue to impede you and they wont after i send my cousin a little note the people who will know your true rank will be myself captain fenris captain othorp duke arden and novice kayne any questions tal rufen still looked as if he had fallen from a great height onto his head ahjust one he said finally why as an answer she tossed him her cousins letterfor those who did not know talaysenor gwydain the name he had been born withthe contents were innocuous enough tal read it through quickly that answered one of her questions he was obviously not only able to read but fairly literatewhich means he may well be an amateur scholar of history i shall have to be sure to let him make free with the abbey library he got to the last paragraph and she watched him as he read it through twice he looked up at her this talaysenthis is free bard talaysen master wren laurel bard and advisor to the king of birnam and the leader of the free bards as well as a person respected and admired among the gypsies i see he handed the letter back to her i think we can probably assume that most if not all of the murders he speaks of bear the same signature as the ones i told you about i would say so she put the letter away in her desk you also asked for a mage i can offer you two the first is a fellow justiciar who also has some other abilitieshe can touch minds and sometimes read the past from objects his name is arran and he just happens to be another cousin of mine the corner of tals mouth twitched a little at that the first hint that he had a sense of humor are you related to half the kingdom he asked she sighed only a third oh not really but sometimes it feels as if i am she replied feelingly especially when they all seem to have favors they want granted well it looks as if you are granting another he observed cautiously she shook her head no that wasnt what i meant when i handed you that letter i would have done this if talaysen hadnt sent that letter and that request it was simply a confirmation of everything you told me with the additional information that there were more victims than evenyou knew about it is the duty of the justiciar to see that all creatures have justice generally miscreants are brought before us but it is fully within our power to order investigations when the secular authorities are moving too slowly or not at all tal muttered bitterly giving her a brief glimpse of how deeply his anger ran that he had not been heeded or not at all she agreed it is our duty to see to it thatnothing impedes an investigation that needs to be made not even when suspicion indicates a suspect within the brotherhood of the church another startled glance from tal made her nod this isnt the first time i have suspected a priestmage of wrongdoing she told him with brutal frankness the only difference is that all the other times i at least had actual suspects now i have only thewhat did you call itthe signature the signature he confirmed the methods and the victims change the settings change but the signature stays the same there are some very basic needs being addressed here a great anger is being fed and i suspect there is some he hesitated sexual link she asked shrewdly by now he was over being shocked or surprised by anything she would say and noddedprobably due to the fact that i suggested it could be a priest if itis a member or former member of the brotherhood that would not be a surprise sometimes the appearance of chastity is used as a disguise rather than being part of a vocation sometimes it is used as an escape sometimes it is a symptom of a great illness of the spirit rather than being embraced joyfully he nodded his face very sober domination manipulation and control thats what drives these murders for certain maybe revenge with the ultimate control being of course the control of the victims life and death she nodded her understanding not one constable in a hundred thousand would have reasoned that out i do not think my confidence is misplaced she would have said more possibly embarrassing the man but kayne returned at that moment your belongings are in your quarters as are your uniforms and your firstquarter pay inquisitor rufen she said as she came in the door your mules are in the stables and you will have just enough time to clean yourself and change into a uniform before dinner where you will have an opportunity to meet the rest of the abbey guards and by the time you are ready for dinner your papers will also be ready and i will bring them to your quarters she beamed at both of them and ardis rewarded her well done kayne very well and efficiently done and thank you she stood up and tal rufen did likewise again making the genuflection when she extended her hand that will be the last time you need salute me in that fashion unless we are in the presence of others inquisitor she told him i do not stand on formality in private with my associates he stood up and gave her a half salute thank you high bishop he said with more feeling than he had yet shown under any circumstance thank you for he was at a loss for words but she already knew what he would have said if he could have thankyou for competence and courage she replied thank you for being ethical even at a cost both of you those traits are too rare and should be cherished now if you would kayne took the hint and so did he the new inquisitor followed her secretary out the door and she resumed her chair wondering what box of troubles she had just opened even as she turned her eyes towards her page chapter five ardis could no more have settled down to a book now than she could have renounced the miter and gone back to being a simple priest she rose from her desk but rather than pace as she might have done when she was younger she turned with a soft sigh of heavy woolen robes and went directly to the small altar in the corner of her office she genuflected then knelt there and clasped her hands on the rail before her put your body in the attitude of meditation and your spirit will followthat was the precept and she had generally found it to be a true one this time was no exception as she stared at the eternal flame upon the altar she found her mind slipping into the proper state where she could examine what she had just done without any emotion intruding now she played justiciar for her own actions answerable to her own conscience and the will of god had she been too hasty in coming to a decision had she been so desperate for a way to shift the burden of gwydains request from her shoulders to someone elses that she had grasped at the first opportunity to be shed of that responsibility that presented itself the answer to the second question wasno decidedly not murder was a dreadful thing tal rufen was accustomed to solving dreadful crimes and hewanted in fact already had assumedthat burden if he was forever after this night unable to solve these murders and stop the fiend responsible he should be honored for that that he had not been aware of the murders of gypsies and free bards meant nothing there was no point in launching a belated second investigation when tal rufen was already well along on his all she had done was to make it possible for him to continue the work he was already doingand it just so happened that her problem and his were the same i would make a very poor constable just as i would make a very poor carpenter rather than solving this set of crimesor building a houseit is far better that i give those whose business it is all of the means at my disposal to do what they are suited for what was the point of having authority if you did not delegate it appropriately what was the point of having rank if you did not exercise it in order to smooth the way for someone accomplishing something important no she was not shirking her responsibility if tal rufen got himself into trouble with captain fenris or duke arden she would bear the brunt of the blame not that this was likely but she had known when she ordered kayne to write up those papers that she would be answerable not only to the secular authorities but to the conclave of bishops if anything went drastically wrong that too was justice and now that she knelt here she felt a deep certainty that none of thisgwydains letter tals appearance and all the rest of itwas a coincidence when circumstances conspired to involve a priest in some situation or other it was her experience that it was never coincidental when they moved to involve a justiciar that was doubly so and when the justiciar happened to be a mage as well the odds against it being a coincidence were insignificant tal rufen had been guided to her just as she had been guided to the decision to make him a special inquisitor only a justiciar could create an inquisitor and only the high bishop who was also a justiciar could create a special inquisitor tal rufen was in effect a constable who was answerable to no secular authority for his actions if he but knew it if he left kingsford now with those papers in his hand he could go anywhere and do anything he pleased but he wont hes driven by this as surely as the one behind this is driven in turn by his needs the hunter and the hunted and which was which or perhapsthe hunted and the haunted tal has his ghosts to exorcise and i suspect so does our unknown enemy blessed godthe burden of the justiciar who would and must always see all sides to a problem and what kind of life must it have taken to drive this man to feed his hungers on such a dreadful feast of blood and thatshe was now involved with her link to the gypsies and her experience with renegade clergy what did that say about this situation she sighed and closed her eyes bowing her head over her handslet it not be that i have been blind to the faults of those who are my friends she prayed it wasnt likelythere wasnt anyone in this abbey that she could think of who had been in haldene a month ago let alone in all the other towns and villages tal mentioned but that was she felt her besetting sin she was hard on herself implacable with strangers but with her friends soft too forgiving she remained kneeling for the rest of the time left to her before dinner praying first that she had not forgiven too much been too compassionate it was so hard to balance justice with compassion second for the souls of all those unfortunates that she and gwydain had not known about as well as those that they had and third for tal rufen his way had been hard and it was likely to be harder still for even if he found and caught the person behind all of this he would still have to come to terms with the fact that he had not caught this evil creature earlier and forgive himself for all of those who had perished and so shall iwas her last grave thought before the bell rang for dinnerand so shall i tal had never seen the uniform of a church guard before and he was a bit taken aback by its jaunty splendor he had expected something a great deal more sobersomething all in dull black perhaps or dark gray this bold scarlet trimmed and edged with black piping was more like the uniform he would expect to see on the grand dukes guards than anything the guard of the clergy should wear he felt much the better for a hot bath and the bit of food the high bishop had given him his headache was almost gone and he was finally warm again with a good meal inside of him he would feel better still after his bath and a change into the only clean clothing he had left he had returned to his tiny room to find the bishops secretary and his new uniforms waiting for him we dont have many guards at the abbey kayne observed as he picked up the wool tunic and sniffed at the scent of cedar that still clung to its folds we have the uniforms of course to fit just about anyone but most of them have been in storage for as long as ive been here thats lucky for you that uniform has probably never been worn but we novices get nothing but handeddown robes until we become full priests she chuckled i suppose thats to get us used to sharing with sweet sister poverty she handed him his papers he took them still feeling altogether dazed by the high bishops swift and decisive actions he hadnt quite believed that she had been serious even though he had made free of her hospitality tucked his belongings into the tiny cell of a room that kayne had shown him and used the abbeys hot water and soap with abandon now thoughwith this uniform and two more like it waiting on the narrow but comfortable bedhe had to believe it im a church guard a special inquisitor ive been assigned to the hunt the official papers only confirmed the reality he looked them over carefully but they simply reiterated what the high bishop had told him and heres your first quarter pay kayne added handing him a black leather pouch thatchinked softly as it went from her hand to his ardis didnt tell you how much it isshe wouldnt of course she never thinks about things like moneybut im told its not bad not as much as a specially licensed and bonded bodyguard but not bad ten silver a week for twelve weeks enough supposedly to make you unbribable since that sum was more than he had made per week after all his years on the force at haldene he hardly knew what to say exceptit is and with no personal expenses to speak ofitsquitegoodfood lodging uniformsthe church supplied all of these what would hedo with ten silver pieces a week she nodded briskly good anything else you need to know he held the tunic up a little this its not what i expected he flushed actually it seems a bit gaudy i thought id be wearing black or something kayne laughed her dark eyes sparkling with amusement thats because youve never been in an abbey of the justiciars before you should see all of us in our ecclesiastical bestyoud think the room was on fire ah hed noted the red robe that ardis wore and the rustcolored one of the novices but it hadnt occurred to him that these were their equivalent of working clothes so on an occasion like a high holy day we guards wouldnt stand out at all would we in fact youll blend in she assured him and if you wore say blacklike the guards of the healing ordersyoud stand out like crows against a sunset at that moment a bell sounded somewhere and kayne cocked her head to one side thats the bell for dinner and i believe i hear one of the other guards coming to show you the way no sooner had the words passed her lips than a shadow blocked the door and a discreet tap on the frame proved that she was right she turned as the biggest man that tal had ever seen eased himself into the room well this is an honor indeed tal rufen this is the captain of our guards herris othorp the huge blackhaired man who was clearly several years tals junior gravely offered a ham of a hand to tal to shake tal took it and was pleased and relieved when the handclasp was firm without being a test of dominance it seemed that herris othorp saw no reason to prove he was a better stronger man than those under his command what a pleasant change i am pleased to welcome the new special inquisitor othorp rumbled actuallysounding pleased i have told the high bishop more than once that her office requires at least one no one among the guards has had any experience in investigation i wouldnt have the faintest idea of where to start if i were assigned to a case dont be too pleased tal warned maybe i have experience but im not sure im any good at that othorp laughed a deep bass rumble tal decided that this man was going to be not only easy to work with but a definite ally i think we should let god and time judge that and go to our dinner and on that note i shall take leave of both of you kayne said and turned with that swift agility that tal had noted in the high bishops office and left them othorp waited expectantly and after a moment tal realized that the captain was waiting for tal to assume one of his new uniforms feeling a little selfconscious tal shed his old worn canvas trews and knitted woolen tunic and did so when he belted the new tunic and pulled it straight the captain beamed with as much pride as if he had tailored the uniform himself you make a fine show inquisitor and thats a fact othorp told him when you arent out investigating id like to have you up in the front ranks at our major ceremonies if youve no objection its a pity but half the old fellows here are just thatold fellows one short step from collecting their pensions they look sad thats the truth of it what used to be their chest has gone south you might say and im afraid they think more of their dinners than they do of why they need to be in shape and why do they need to be in shape tal asked curiously as he preceded the captain out the door and into the hallway other than for ceremonial occasions that is he coughed i hope youll forgive me for saying this but it would seem to me that an abbey full of justiciars would be the last place a troublemaker would care to go constables in general reckon a position like church guard is a soft berth othorps face darkened but not with anger he was very clearly worried youd think that wouldnt you he made it a statement not a question think about it though someone has a suspect they want the truth out of himthey bring him to justiciar arran to see if arran can use his magic to call it out city constables have evidence have a group of suspects they call in the high bishop or one of the other mages to link the two and when its judgment time for misuse of magic murder rape serious crimes who is the one who sets the penalties if the duke and his two judges dont have the time or dont feel qualified to make a judgment justiciars thats who and the more serious the crime the more likely it is that itll be passed here across the river he shook his head as he walked tal suddenly felt very stupid thats a lot of enemies he said slowly the bad lads tend to put the blame on anybody but themselves for what happens to them and not all of them wind up doing the ropedance some of them even see out their time and get turned loose othorp sighed heavily and do you think i can getone of them to believe that they might be the chosen target of some very bad people and take care about their movements he shook his head thatswhy i wish we could just retire our old men when they get too fat to run but theyre sentimental around here though you wouldnt think it they wont hear of sending a man off to pasture on halfpay and replacing him with someone younger tal shrugged there wasnt much he could add to that maybe you could urge it on appearancesit doesnt look good for church guards to look fatlike arent we supposed to be part of the chastity and poverty business othorp chuckled and rubbed his heavy eyebrow with his forefinger i could try that at the least it might get the high bishop to order some of these old fellows on a serious training regimen reducing diets wont work most of them are steady customers of the inns across the river by now they had reached the tall wooden door at the end of the hallway othorp pushed it open and tal looked into the refectory hed had occasion to stay at abbeys of the wayfaring order a time or two when hed taken excursions into the country and these dininghalls all looked alike the one thing that struck him as odd about this one was the relative quiet beneath a high ceiling crossed with age and smokeblackened beams tables and benches were arranged with mathematical precision on a plain scrubbed wooden floor at two of them rows of scarletclad guards were already waiting for their meal talking in hushed voices from another door priests in the scarlet robes of the justiciars and novices in the same rustcolored gowns that kayne wore were filing in silently to take their places at the rest of the tables they must have been wearing softsoled boots or slippers of some sort as their footfalls were barely audible all four walls were plastered white with dark beams exposed one wall held a huge fireplace the opposite one nearest tal and othorp had three windows glazed with tiny diamondshaped panes of glass in lead there was a raised dais of dark wood at the far end of the room with a wooden lectern on it beside the lectern was another table this time with only a single bench behind it othorp led tal to the second table full of guards there were wooden plates of bread and cheese already on the table wooden spoons mugs plates and bowls before each place someoneprobably kaynehe thoughtmust have informed the kitchen staff of his arrival for there was an extra place laid ready for him he and othorp were the last of the guards to arrive and it was plain that othorp had only spoken truth when he commented how important their dinners were to some of these men when the last of the priests had taken his or her place at a bench the high bishop entered followed by four other priests all male all of them wore the standard cowled scarlet robe belted with a black cord the high bishop wore a small round cap of scarlet on her short blond hair the rest went bareheaded thats arran leod harden and cole othorp whispered chief justiciar chief clerk chief exchequer and chief household youll only have much to do with arran and cole youll only see harden if you need to draw out some extraordinary expense and kayne cant handle it for youand as for leod write your own letters he has a knack for making a man feel like a chunk of streetscum of the four arran and cole looked the easiest to deal with ardis took her place in the middle of the table arran a tall rawboned man with a mouth like ardiss and the kindest eyes tal had ever seen took his place beside ardis on the right cole lean bald and goodhumored took the left a novice stepped up to the lectern opened the book there and began to read aloud as other novices with white aprons tied over their robes passed among the tables ladling soup into bowls and cooked vegetables onto plates the guards passed the bread and cheese up and down the table ignoring the novice who was reading some religious text tal with the edge taken off his raging hunger took a modest amount of both bread and cheese and passed the rest on the soup proved to be pea and the vegetables a mix of squash beans and root vegetables in a thick sauce this is tal rufen othorp said as he tore off a hunk of bread for himself new man high bishops own guard from now on recommended by justiciar brune from haldene tal gave othorp points for giving him the story he should follow and nodded affably at the rest of the guards hoping there would be no jealousy over what should have been a prime position going to an outsider about time she got her own guard one man said without prompting a fellow with a weathered face and graying black hair stop messing up the dutyroster every time she takes a notion to go across the river hard on us trying to reshuffle so that nobody gets stuck with doubleduty the others nodded in total agreement and tal was taken a bit aback for a moment then he realized what was going onas othorp had hinted these men were used to a fairly set routine with very little variance and resented any change in it they had the soft berth that he had described as he listened to them talk he had no doubt that most if not all of them would spring to the defense of their charges if one of the justiciarswas attackedassuming some of themcould spring anymorebut if there was no crisis they simply didnt want to be stirred from their set ways dont envy you tal rufen said another one of the very men othorp had complained about whose uniform tunic strained over a decided paunch that overlapped his belt high bishops always gadding here gadding thereyoull miss half your meals leave your bed early and get to it late when you arent running your legs off to keep up with her youll be standing around outside of doors for hours and hours oh im used to that by now he replied easily i was on third shift dockside duty in haldene at least now if it rains i wont be spending a full shift out in it there is that but i wouldnt have lasted a year on a third shift agreed the second man and tucked into his food with a will there seemed to be plenty of that food at least the novices kept serving the guards as long as any of them wanted further helpings although the priests and their fellow novices were apparently restricted to single servingsmore of that asceticism he decided grateful that they did not impose their rules on their secular servants at the end of the meal all of the brotherhood rose as one and filed out again leaving the guards to wipe their plates with the last of their bread and make a more leisurely exit high bishop will want to see you id expect othorp said as tal hesitated just outside the door not certain what he was expected to do next i doubt she finished with you before dinner you remember the way he nodded he would have made a poor constable if he couldnt remember a few turns and twistings of corridors a constable was supposed to be able to negotiate an unfamiliar neighborhood in the dead of night they parted at the first intersection of hallways and tal made his way back to the high bishops office there was no one outside and he tapped tentatively on the door wondering if he was supposed to have gone first to kayne but it was kayne who opened the door and she seemed pleased enough to see him come in please she said the high bishop is just finishing up some business but she has already mentioned that she wanted to talk with you before evening services evening services hed forgotten that part of abbey life his dismay must have shown on his face for kayne chuckled oh dont worry she whispered a conspiratorial sparkle in her eyes the guards arent expected to attend all the services just one of the ones on sevenday its like the rest of the abbey lifewe have vocations we dont expect you to and we dont expect you to abide by the rules made for those who do he sighed just a little and hoped his relief didnt show too much kayne gestured him inside and shut the door behind him he resumed the chair he had vacated only a few hours ago and waited for the high bishop to finish whatever she was doing it seemed to involve a great deal of paperwork and some whispering between herself and her secretary eventually though kayne went trotting off with a huge sheaf of papers and ardis turned her attention back to him this is a little backwards she said with a crooked smile i usually know all about someone before i engage them and i would like to rectify that situation now so i know what kind of man i am dealing with she settled back into her chair and clasped her hands in her lap so tell me inquisitorwhat kind of a manis tal rufen what does he care for what does he despise what makes him the man he is her shrewd gray eyes regarded him soberly from beneath winglike brows the same color of gold as her hair tal rufen is a man who never wanted to be anything other than a constable he told her as soon as i was old enough to play i had a baton id made from an old broomstick and a constables cape from a scrap of canvas the others would play at robbers and id capture them and hang them when i got old enough i learned everything i could about the job and as soon as theyd take me i applied ive been a constable since i was sixteen and if theyd taken me younger id have gone if youre looking for what drives me thats it and do you consider this position to be a step back for you she asked unexpectedly he had to think about that for a moment nono i dont think so this is what being a constableshould be like youve put me in a position to be able to do my job again which was more than my captain was doing when this case is over though youre afraid it might turn into a glorified bodyguard position she stated with a little nod he shrugged i dont know i dont think id be satisfied to stand at attention at ceremonies for the rest of my life a brow lifted i dont think there will be any danger of that she told him crisply you may not pursue investigations as she paused to search for the correct word as tense and distressful as this one but you will be pursuing investigations i have needed someone with your skills to aid me as a justiciar for some time and now that i am high bishop i need your skills more than before magic isnt always the right way to find the answers and when it is useful it doesnt always supplyall of the answers i mislike making a judgment without all of the information he nodded grave agreement and she continued now besides wanting to be a constable all your life what else are you dull he laughed as a person im afraid i tend to become my work i dont have many interests outside of that gamesskill games not cards or dice reading history mostly she smiled at that and he wondered why but she made no comment parents she asked other ties he shook his head parents are both dead i was a lateborn child came long after mother thought she was past having any and i dont think either of my parents was comfortable around a child they both died a few years ago no close friends no women who cared to put up with the hardships of being a constables wife i understand she contemplated him for a moment perhaps you are more suited to our sort of life than i had thought i was afraid it would be too dull for you our entertainments are mostly mental if you had a vocation you could be one of the brotherhood shes right actually how many of the lads on the force told me that i lived like a priestthat may be he agreed since most of my life could be packed up on the back of a mule and carried off with me he thought about that for a moment and added the only things im really going to miss in haldene are the books i left behind and the friends i left them with a pair of mintak brothers we used to play castleboard and share books wed read other than that he surprised himself with a bark of laughter other than that the only thing id like is to see the captains face if he ever finds out what im doing now i have the feeling that as a special inquisitor technically i outrank him a broad grin sprang up on ardiss face making her look very like a vixen in her coat of scarlet and little round red cap i sometimes think that the reason god demands that we leave revenge to him is because he prefers to keep such delights to himself she said sardonically i quite understand well tal before i send you off to the bed you very much deserve i only want to tell you three things make free of the abbey library use of it is one of the privileges of being attached in service to the abbey and i think youll be pleased by what you find he flushed a little and ducked his head obscurely ashamed for some reason that his hunger for books had been found out and her smile softened tomorrow you can present your papers to whomever you think you will need to work with trust me no hour is too early for captain fenris if you can find him use your own discretion as to who you inform of your true rank ill take care of notifying the duke myself he started to object and stopped himself she was right she had ways of getting to the duke quickly where he would have to wait days or weeks for an audience ill probably tell this captain fenris high bishop and id rather tell him in person myself i want him to see me i want to see him so we can so the two hounds can sniff noses and decide not to fight she interrupted with an ironic look that dared him to say otherwise and since that was pretty much what was going to happen he couldnt deny well we do have to know that we can trust each other he pointed out where im going to be prowlingwell i might need someone to come to my aid and if i have to ask fenris for help i want him to be willing to send a man with me he wont do that if hes never seen me i rather thought that she lost her smile that brings up the last pointremember that you cant track this murderer down if youre dead tal this is a ruthless creature and if he realizes that someone is tracking him he may deviate from his chosen victims to remove you from his trail with a feeling of shock he realized that she was right it had not occurred to him he had been so preoccupied with the pursuit and so focused on thefemale victims but she was right whoever this was he was smart enough to not only elude pursuit but to avoid it in the first place that meant he was not only clever he was intelligent someone like that would be smart enough to watch for pursuit and if he could not shake that pursuit from his trail he would eliminate it or at least try im going to have to think like someone who is stalking one of the great cats in unfamiliar territory at any moment it could be the cat who becomes the stalker and the former hunter becomes the prey tal had never been in a position like this it gave him a very unsettled feeling to think of himself as the hunted rather than the hunter ill remember he promised and i wont go picking up any strange knives she nodded accepting that promise with nothing else to be dealt with he took his leave kayne was waiting outside the door with another sheaf of papers and hardly waited for him to clear the doorframe before entering the office he wondered a little at this did the woman never rest it was long past the time when most folk would have considered that they had put in a good days work when he returned to his little room and sat down on the side of the bed he realized that he had been working on nervous energy for some time the moment he got off his feet it ran out leaving him exhausted for a while he simply sat there examining his new quarters this was the first time hed had a chance to get a good look at them as was to be expected in an abbey this little room about the size of his bedroom back at the gray rose was not what anyone would call luxurious at least it didnt have penitential stone walls though like the rest of the abbey this room was plastered and painted white with all woodwork and exposed beams stained a dark sable there was a closet opposite the door the closet stood open and his bags were insideobviously he was expected to tend to his belongings himself the narrow bed was set along one wall and a small table and chair on the other there was a bookcaseemptyat the foot of the bed a nightstand with a candle alight in a pewter holder on it at the head except for a hook on the door and two more on the wall that was all there was the bed was firm enough with plenty of blankets which would be welcome since the room did not boast a fireplace but there were no windows either so at least there wouldnt be any draftsthough in summer there wouldnt be any cooling breezes how are we supposed to deal with these woolen uniforms in summer or do they have a summer uniform as well he couldnt imagine the priests wearing those long woolen robes in summer either so perhaps the summerweight clothing had been packed away for the season well if i dont get my things put up now i probably wont get to them for days somewhere he dredged up a last bit if energy and got back to his feet the books he had brought with him all fit nicely into one half of the first shelf of the bookcase he hung his civilian clothing up first then his new uniforms all the rest of his belongings such as they were fit into the two drawers of the nightstand except of course for his weaponry he had seldom employed it as a constable but he kept in constant practice a handcrossbow and a beltquiver of bolts went on one hook on the wall his shortsword on the other his various boot belt and wristknives he laid out on the table along with his cudgel and a bag of lead shot that last served doubleduty both as a weapon in and of itself and as ammunition for the sling tied to it over the back of the chair he laid his wide stiff leather belt that served as kidneyprotection and the leather collar that protected his throat his leather wristbraces went on the table with his knives hed worn none of this for his interview with ardis he hadnt known what kind of guards shed have and how theyd take to a man bearing arms into her presence but he had no doubt that someone had looked through his weaponbag when they put it in this room and that othorp knew precisely what hed brought with himand that it all had that wellworn look hed wear all of this tomorrow when he went into the city to find captain fenris he got out of his new uniform blew out the candle and was surprised at howdark the room was without the light there wasnt even a line of light from the hall under the door he might have been inside a cave and it was quiet unnervingly quiet to a man used to sleeping in an inn he couldnt hear anything out there in the hall and if there was someone on the other side of his walls he couldnt hear any sounds from them either he felt for the head of the bed and climbed under the thick soft woolen blankets but once he was there he kept staring up at the ceiling in the darkness unable to quite get to sleep partly it was the silence so thick it made his ears ring but partly it was a belated state of nerves it was all catching up with him now and he found himself a little dazed he had come here to the abbey on a whim when hed been unable to locate the captain of the kingsford constables or the kingsford sheriff everyone knew about the justiciars of course and down in kingsford he had heard stories about ardis and had taken the chance that she might hear him out and perhaps get him an appointment with captain fenris he had not expected her to take a personal interest in the case he had expected even less that she would turn around and coopt it and him after trying to deal with the authorities in haldene he had really been anticipating that he would be put off in fact if his suspicions were correct and a priest or high church officialwas involved in this ardis would have had every reason to deny him an interview at all hed been steeling himself for the long trudge across the bridge to kingsford again a scant dinner and the cheapest room he could find his resources never large to begin with were dwindling quickly and now now he was beginning to get the feeling there was much more going on here than he had dreamed of and he was afraid that the high bishop was privy to more and more serious information than he had yet uncovered was it possible that he was getting in over his head wasthat why everyone in haldene had tried to put him off this case was it more serious than he knewdid it involve suspicion of someone with avery high rank it didnt have to be a noble it could be a priest as he had suspected many times nowand it could be that she knew it even had some suspects but had no way to prove who it was perhaps that was why she had conscripted him so quickly oh wouldnt that just open a box of beetles and i could end up being the scapegoat when i catch the manhecould if ardis was like other highranking people hed worked under but nothing hed seen and heard so far made him inclined to think that she was in fact her reputation was that she protected her underlings from those who were higher in rank provided that those underlings were on the side of the angels so i just have to make sure im on the right side if it was a priest in one of the other orders say he and othorp and fenris might end up having to go in and pry the fellow out which could get very ugly then again at least if it was a priest as a special inquisitor he wouldnt have the problems with bringing him to justice that he would have had as a constable a priest could claim immunity from secular authority but not from someone delegated by the church im the enforcement arm of the church i can throw anyone i need to into gaolit wasnt the heady thought it might have been hed never cared for the power of the baton only for its use as a tool to get bad people put where they couldnt hurt anyone again it only meant that there was nowhere he could not go in the course of this investigation he hoped that he wouldnt need to use that authority the other complication was the one ardis herself had briefly touched on if his target was a priest and a mageor just a magewell he would know that tal was coming and who tal was long before tal ever learned whohe was and there would be plenty of opportunity for accidents to occur magic opened up an entirely new set of problems given that tal really didnt know the full breadth of what a mage could and could not do this is no time to get cold feet he chided himself youve never backed away from a case before not when you had to go after mad drunks murderers and cutthroats any one of them could have disposed of you if youd made the wrong move shes already told you that you can go to her or any of the other justiciarmages she thinks is discreet and get help which includes finding out what a mage can do and besides the high bishop is counting on you she thinks you can handle this or she wouldnt have given you the authority in the first place yes and just whathad convinced her to give him the authority hed like to think that he showed his own competence as clearly as she showed hers but he doubted that was the case how could he have looked like a professional when hed come in exhausted travelworn in shabby clothing he wouldnt have impressed himself and he doubted that his outward appearance had impressed her i probably looked like one of her gypsy friendsthen again maybe that wasnt so bad if she had contacts among the gypsies and free bards she must be used to looking past shabby clothing and weary faces it could have been his careful investigation thus far that had impressed herand hed really like to think that was the case hehad done good work especially considering all the opposition hed faced he could have done more if hed just had some cooperation and she probably knew that as well but the reason why she trusted him could also have been desperation if you didnt have the faintest idea where to start with a problem wouldnt you take the first person who came along and said i know what to do and throw the whole thing at him shed had that letter on her desk when he came in shed probably just gotten it she wasnt supposed to track criminals she was supposed to sentence them and considering that the bardic guild had its guild hall in kingsford she might not get much cooperation from the kingsford authorities in trying to hunt down a killer of free bards for that mattermaybe the killer was some highranking crazed master bard hadnt he heard it said more than once that bards were supposed to be mages it might be that when he walked in her door with additional evidence shed been disposed to welcome him as gods answer to her difficulty maybe so but she didnt get where she is now by being incompetent to handle her own problems for that matter why did he agree so readily to become her servant or the churchs servant really but it amounted to the same thing in this case what in heavens name made him throw away everything hed done to this moment to take this position hednever imagined himself serving the church not even as a secular adjunct he neverwanted to be a guard even one with other duties he would have done so if that had been the only answer but he hadnt even begun to explore his options in kingsford he certainly hadnt come into that office looking for a position it might have been the personality of ardis herself that had persuaded him tal knew that in some respects he was a follower not a leader he felt more comfortable with someone competent in authority over him for all of his cherished independence and what was more he was honest enough to admit it at least to himself competentid say she couldnt run this abbey better if she was a general and it was a military barracksnot that hed been in alot of abbeysbut there were little signs when things werent being run properly dirt in the corners things needing repair indifferent food an aura of laziness or tension a general sense of unhappiness a lot like the headquarters back in haldene as a matter of fact people werent tense here but they werent slacking either nobody was running around as if they were always forgetting to do things until the last minute but no one dawdled that novice kayneshe moved briskly got things done but there was no panic about it no sense of being harried and that went for every other person hed seen even the rest of the guardsthough othorp sighed over their condition theywere competent and they got their jobs done properly their biggest problem was that they were set in their ways they werent lazy just so used to routine that changes in it made them uneasy when it came down to it that would probably hold true for all the priests as well and why not routine waspart of an abbey no ardis had this place well in hand maybe that was what he had responded to the moment i got here i felt ithe hadnt even ridden all the way into the courtyard before someone came to greet him and ask his businessone of the guards he realized now a stablehand had come to take his mules and tie them up for him a novice had led him to a little chamber just inside the front door and brought novice kayne to him kayne had questioned him briefly and everything had fallen into place and all without a lot of running about and fuss and feathers not what i would have expected from a place being run by a womanbut just as he thought that he knew it could just be prejudice on his part i dont expect much out of women when it comes to running thingsbutreally look at the women hed had the most to do with you didnt expect much of women when all you saw them doing was falling apart in a crisis the women he saw on a daytoday basis mostly seemed to be looking for men to take care of them and they werent very bright or if they were it had been starved or beaten out of them a long time ago you could have some pity for the pathetic streetwalkers of the dockside district you could have sympathy for all the hard work a tavernwench had to dobut the women who took those jobs were not exactly the cream of the days skimmings when it came to intelligence so far as that went most of themen he saw were not long on mindpower well more than half the battle in getting rid of a prejudice was in recognizing that itwas one ardis would have been as formidable as a man the abbey would have been just as well run hence there were other women who were her equals in intelligence and he had just never run into any before which was not too surprising when you considered his social circleor lack of one that brought him to the high bishop herself she seemed very young to be wearing a miter and even younger to be wearing the gold miter most of the bishopshe had seen had been gray hairedand male he might have a prejudice but so did the church females inany position of authority were rare birds indeed so how had ardis not only female but relatively young gotten where she was now it couldnt have been an accident that she had been the highest ranking priest in this abbey when the previous high bishop diedand even then it wasnt the usual thing for a priest to simply step into the vacancy he vaguely recalled that high bishops had to be elected by the council of bishops which meant she had to pass muster before all of themgrayhaired menshe cant be any older than i am or not much he decidednot that im all that young but im not all that old either well she was related by blood to a lot of important people including grand duke arden after almost singlehandedly saving kingsford from a fire whichso rumor had itrenegade priests had a hand in settingwell if duke arden suggested that his cousin ought to be made high bishop he rather suspected that there were plenty of people on the council of bishops who would take that as a very good idea the great fire might have had something to do with the decision he hadnt been in kingsford long but stories about the fire had spread all the way to the high kings capital the grand duke was considered a herobut ardis was considered a saint for throwing herself and the abbey into the problem of healing housing and feeding all of the refugeesif i have my politics rightmaking ardis high bishop might solve some problems here for the church in the case of those rogue priests the bishops wouldnt want to give up their authority over their own renegades but unless the grand duke had assurance that the caught priests would get full and appropriate punishment well ifhe had been duke arden hed have been tempted to hang the bastards from the highest tree and let the church complain all they liked about it but by making ardis high bishop everybody would be satisfiedthe duke had assurance that the criminals would get everything they deserved and the punishment would all come from an instrument of the church she might also know a few inconvenient secrets about the other bishops herself most people in power did still she was a remarkable woman she would have stood out in any setting and in this one shes amazing nothing short of amazing attractive too at least to him that vixengrin shed flashed him full or humor and what almost looked like mischief she could charm the boots off a man with that one if she ever used it as a weapon another prejudice hed always thought of female priests as being unattractive waspish something like young kayne but more so it was odd to think of a physically attractive woman in a priests robes very odd actually why had she become a priest in the first place she didnt seem the type to have been pulled in by religion she just didnt have that glassyeyed sort of devotion he expected out of someone dedicating their life to religion but maybe thats another prejudice on my part i just dont know that many priests i suppose still she was well connected probably money or titles or both attractive intelligentwhy had she become a priest might have been the traditional thing ive heard some of the noble families do thatfirstborn inherits the estate secondborn goes into the military third goes to the church whether they like it or not but he couldnt picture ardis being coerced into anything so she must have had some reason to go a disappointment in love no she didnt seem like the type to moon tragically around because someone she wanted didnt want her more than thata tragedy the man she loved had died she wouldnt dive into the church unless she thought she could exorcise the grief in work but she doesnt seem at all griefridden theres usually a shadow over people who lose a loved one maybe it had something to do with the fact that she was a mage he didnt know of too many places that could train a person in magic and most of them wouldnt be the sorts of places that would appeal to someone as wellbred as ardis and the rest were all in nonhuman lands i certainly cant picture her marching up to an elf hill and demanding to be let in the elves would drive her mad with their ways but he also couldnt picture ardis ever letting a talent go to waste maybe that was the reason it made more sense than anything else except maybe she went into the church because the church was the only place where she would be expected to exercise all of her intellect this was all sheer speculation he didnt know enough about the church the lives of the nobles or ardis herself to make a really intelligent guess that was part of the trouble he knew nothing about the high bishop except the little that she had told him herself he had nothing to make judgments on and that left him at a disadvantage im going to have to make it my business to learn everything i can about herhe decided this clearly wasnt going to be the kind of situation hed had back in haldene where he was just one constable among many he was the only special inquisitor he and she were going to be working closely together it wasnt even the equivalent position to the other abbey guards in a sense shes going to be both my superior and my partner ormaybe a little more like when i first came into the force and i was attached to a senior constable i had to learn as much about him to work smoothly with him as i was learning about being a constable it was a long time since hed been in that kind of position it was going to take some getting used to stillwhy not the only trouble was that it meant he was going to be working on two investigations not one the murder chase and the investigation of ardis what the hell i work better under pressure and with that thought his exhaustion finally overcame his nerves and he slept chapter six visyr hovered wings pumping furiously to keep him in place roughly a hundred wingspans above archer lane hovering was harder than any other kind of flying but visyr was used to it and his chest and wingmuscles were stronger and heavier than any of the haspur who specialized in fancy flying and aerobatics he kept taking deep breaths of the icy air to bring new fuel to those muscles as he made notes on his pressuresensitive deliambren dryboard with the tip of a needlesharp talon notes too small for mere human eyes to read after each entry he glanced down at the street below and concentrated on the next building on the north side of the street measuring it by eye and noting its position relative to its neighbors this was his special talent any haspur could hover above a street and any haspur could make a rough map that would show the placement of buildings and their sizes relative to one another but very few could gauge the dimensions so precisely that a physical measurement would be off by no more than a fraction of an inch it was a peculiarly haspur talent this ability to create accurate maps from memorya useful talent in a race that flewbut visyr was an artist among the talented when he had filled his dryboarda flat white board sensitive to pressure used by the deliambrens as a notepadhe would fly back to his drafting room at the ducal palace and transform the notes into an actual city block on the new map he was making for the grand duke when he was done duke arden would have a map of kingsford that showed not only every tiny lane and backalley he would have one that showed every structure that existed at the time the map was finished including sheds and fences his constables wouldnt have to guess where miscreants might be hiding to ambush the unwary they would know where every blindalley deadend street and culdesac lay this was making captain fenris very happy in fact the captain had a page checking on visyrs maps and making copies of them as visyr completed each sectionhe could hardly wait for the whole thing to be done with the rebuilding of kingsford proceeding rather chaotically in some sections fenriss people were at a distinct disadvantage when they had to pursue a footpad into an area that might have changed since the last time they were there this however wasnot why visyr had come down out of the mountains although the duke and his people certainly appreciated what the haspur was doing and although he was gaining a great deal of support for himself and other nonhumans with this work this was not what he had intended to do eventually or so visyr hoped he would be part of the great deliambren mapping expedition that was why he and his beloved dynamic mate syri had left their homeland in the first place but humans were dreadfully shortsighted when it came to permitting nonhumans to doanything in their lands and the deliambrens didnt want to mount this project until they had ironclad agreements of cooperation as well as permission from the rulers of all of the twenty kingdoms agreements that no subsequent monarch could overrule not that i blame them visyr mused as he noted down the size of the warehouse below him and the dimensions of the tiny scrap of yard behind it taking that ship out is going to be an effort worthy of an epic song and if they ever have to stop it they may not be able to get it started again the ship and many of the machines the deliambrens intended to use were ancient parts were difficult to duplicate and had to be made one at a time by hand and the mechanisms themselves were often poorly understood intended to be manned by an assortment of races controls were not always suited to the hands hooves or beaks of those who were to operate them visyr didnt envy those assigned to tend and use the things the expedition itself was a massive effort on the part of not only the deliambrens but of many other nonhuman races and even of some humans as well there would be hundreds of people tending and operating the ship and all of its mechanisms and more working outside it his assignment with the ship would be simpler basically what he was doing now he would be one of a few mappingscouts making an aerial survey of heavily inhabited areas where the ship couldnt go other scouts would roam ahead to find a safe route for the behemoth that contained the bulk of the expedition once and for all the deliambrens hoped to surveyall of alanda or this continent anyway to locate mineral resources underground watercourses and ancient ruins as well as mapping the surface accurately this wasnt altruistic although the deliambrens would provide copies of the general topographical maps to anyone who wanted them besides their mechanical wonders the deliambrens trafficked in informationin return for permission to cross their land the rulers of each kingdom would get copies of any of the surface maps they wanted but if they wished to know the locations of other things the deliambrens uncovered they would have to pay all of which seemed perfectly reasonable to visyr but apparently there were those who were incensed by the idea they felt that information should be given away no matter how hard someone had worked to obtain or create it as a result the expedition was stalled and he was taking little jobs like this one to prove just how useful those accurate maps would be if the deliambrens could point out that even the basic maps would contribute to generating revenue or solving problems the various rulers who were causing difficulties might see their way clear to removing their objections they might also find it easier to accept the very moderate fees that the deliambrens would charge for other information of course visyr thought noting down the dimensions of another building they could always go out and look for their treasures themselves this was no bad way to pass the time while he waited it was useful and needed work and the duke was being quite generous in his wages the duke had always wanted absolutely accurate maps of his cityand now that kingsford was being rebuilt such maps were more important than ever and not just for the constables people now had the opportunity to build whatever they pleased wherever they pleased and many of them were doing just that property owners were taking advantage of the situation to move original property lines stealing inches and even whole feet of property from their neighbors sadly there were many who were no longer around to care what their former neighbors did and their heirs were either children or too wrapped still in grief to realize what was happening eventually though they might discover what had happened and want some legal redress and visyrs maps would give evidence of what had happened the trouble with human groundpounding surveyors was that they took more time than visyr did they had to lay out measuring tapes and use other equipment to do what he did by eye they often stalled traffic while they were working and they got in the way of pedestrians and while they could measure the size of something they wouldnt necessarily get its placement correct humans do this very well when they are measuring out open fields for a job like this you need someone like me that was the long and the short of it so far as visyr was concerned another problem that surveyors encountered was that people were building things behind walls and fences that they wouldnt let the surveyors pass without going and getting an authority who would force the owners to let the surveyors inside there was no way of telling what was or was not in there and most surveyors simply didnt want to take the chance of angering home and business owners walls and fences didnt hinder visyr and there would be a number of folk who would be very unhappy with him when this survey was over and they got taxbills for outbuildings workshops and secondary dwellings that they hadnt reported but by then ill be gone so they can be as unhappy as they like frankly i think arden deserves the extra tax money if it werent for the money he is putting into the city these people wouldnt have public water covered sewers or any of the other more pleasant innovations hes building in visyr liked duke arden most people did he suspected it wasnt difficult to like the duke as arden was personable persuasive and really did have the welfare of his people first and foremost in his mind he had made some very sensible laws about the rebuilding in kingsford that were being violated every day there would be some unhappy people when the dukes men appeared to levy fines or tear down illegal constructions that visyr had uncovered but some of those structures were fire hazards and others were clearly not supposed to be where they were it was one thing to keep pigs and goats in the country but putting them in a tiny scrap of yard in the middle of a residential district was going to makesomeone sick eventually visyr had even spotted a man keeping cows in a shed barely large enough to hold them unfortunately it will probably not be the fellow who is keeping the livestock who pays the price of their being therevisyr didnt want to think about what all those little goat and pigyards would smell like when summer came hopefully by then the dukes inspectors would have most of them cleared out dovecots and rabbithutches fine those created manageable waste not farm stock not to mention the possibility of the damage a large animal could do if it got outhorses and donkeys were necessary evils and were properly kept in stables in areas meant for them but even so visyr distrusted such large and unpredictable creatures he was just glad that he spent the largest part of his time that he was outside the palace in the air it might have seemed odd to conduct this survey in the dead of winter but cold didnt particularly bother visyr and he would much rather fly in a snowstorm than in a rainstorm besides in winter no one was doing any exterior construction any building going on was all interior work that meant that if he could finish this work before spring and he certainly should be able to he wouldnt have to backtrack to add new buildings so far no one but the duke and a few of his people were aware of what visyr was up to plenty of people knew that the duke had a haspur at his court but after the great todo caused by another haspur at the court of the high king the masterful musician and singer tfyrr they probably all assumed he was a musician too and he was but not a professional like tfyrr all haspur could sing and any haspur would probably impress a human whod never heard one before but anyone who had heard tfyrr would never mistake visyr for a professional im not even a really talented amateur but then tfyrr cant make maps either hed probably even get lost in the high kings palace but as long as people thought he was a musician no one would wonder why he was hovering over their houses if they asked he had a standardand quite truthfulreply research a delightful word that covers any number of circumstances theyll assume im making up some epic about the rise of kingsford from the ashes of the great fire and ignore me at the worst theyll want to tell me the story of how they survived the fire which might be entertaining actually very few people seemed to notice him the humans here in the twenty kingdoms were remarkably unobservant creatures especially when it came to scanning the sky maybe because their eyes are so bad humans poor things are remarkably deficient in that area hardly anyone ever looked up at him not even when his large shadow passed over him curious really a haspur noted every little floating seed and tiny wren in the sky and never went more than a few heartbeats without taking a glance upward the humans who lived in partnership with the haspur were the same glancing up at even a hint of a shadow or a moving mote in the sky i suppose its all in what youre used to the dryboard was almost full visyr made a few more notations about a building with an extension hidden behind a tall fence cupped his wings a bit and dropped losing a few dozen feet of height to get some forward momentum it was a good trade shortly he was well on the way to the ducal palace where it rose above the rest of the city rivaling even the kingsford cathedral he reveled in the feel of free flight in the force of the wind through his nares in the powerful beats of his own wings it was a lovely day in spite of being overcast a recent snowfall covered the raw places in the earth that surrounded new construction hiding signs of dilapidation and shoddy building and softened the lines of roofs and fences with clean white snow everywhere this really looked like the model city the duke had dreamed of and straight ahead rose the palace a fine piece of architecture in its own right he had his own separate entrance into the tower that served him as workroom and private quarters an aerial entrance of course humans would probably refer to it as a balcony but the railing was just the right size to land on the wood sturdy enough to hold up under his talons and the servants who tended the room had orders to keep the railing and the balcony icefree the room had an unparalleled view too right over the city and across the river where the abbey and cathedral of the justiciars presided over faire field he hadnt been there yet there wasnt much to survey in that direction so he was leaving it until the last at the moment he was working his way along the kanar river at the point farthest from the high stone bridge that crossed over to faire field he had an idea that the bridge itself was older than kingsfordit was so tall in the center that virtually any ship that could navigate the river could sail beneath it and certainly the river barges had no difficulty getting between its massive white piers the only damage time had done to it was cosmetic and although it was commonly thought of as being made of stone the material didnt resemble any stone visyr was familiar with the only improvement that humans had made to it was a toll booth on the kingsford side the road leading to the bridge was unpaved but that didnt mean anything the paving could have been pried up by the people whod built the abbey and cathedral to use for construction materials this sort of destruction drove the deliambrens crazy visyr thought it was rather amusing it certainly proved the humans were resourceful devils antlike in their ingenuity for picking things up and carrying them away he pumped his wings through full powerstrokes angling the surfaces to gain altitude rather than speed soon if there was anyone watching him from below he would be just another dot in the overcast heavens no different from a crow or a sparrow he had to go around to the back of the palace in order to reach his balcony from here he came around the building and made a wide turn sideslipping he angled in towards his room the ducal palace stood in one of the districts that had been mostly spared by the great fire but if the church mages hadnt come when they had it too would have gone up in flames and the facade still showed the marks of flame and smoke in places arden wouldnt have them removed he wanted those marks as a constant reminder of what the city had endured the gardens had been destroyed though and only steady work by the gardeners for two years had brought them back to their former beauty even in winter under a blanket of snow they were lovely although there were no longer any of the trees and bushes sculpted into fanciful shapes the gardeners had replaced them with trellises that would be covered from spring to fall with flowering vines and which in winter formed the basis for snow sculptures visyr was above the palace now and he folded his wings and dropped in a dive that ended as he backwinged with his taloned feet outstretched to catch the railing of his balcony it was a pity there was no one in the balcony below to see him it was a particularly good landing ah well they wouldnt appreciate it anyway he balanced for a moment then hopped down onto the surface of the balcony itself and let himself in through the door made of dozens of little square panes of thick and wavering glass set in a wooden frame it let in welcome sunlight but a somewhat distorted view still it was better than nothing and without it visyr would have felt rather claustrophobic this was his bedroom with the bed replaced by a peculiar couch shaped to be comfortable for a sleeping avian and many padded backless stools searching for an alternative to a human bed he had found the couch in a usedfurniture store the first week he had been living here and had bought it immediately the servants had all sniggered when they saw it he wasnt sure why and he didnt think he really wanted to ask whatever it had been used for before it was comfortable for him and that was all he cared about and the odd little stirrups made a nice place to tuck his elbows or knees beside the couch was a pile of light but warm down comforters one of the dukes people asked him once if it made him feel odd to be sleeping under something made from dead birds and in answer he snapped his decidedly raptoral beak and in case the fellow hadnt gotten the message he had added only in that i didnt get to eat any of those birds the only other furniture was a chest that contained the bodywrappings that haspur used in lieu of clothing there was no point in wearing clothing with open legs or arms such garments would get tangled up when a haspur flew and the idea of wearing a shirt or a long robe was ludicrous possibly even dangerous a haspur wore as little as possible something that clung as closely to the body as possible and was as lightweight as possible hence clothing that was essentially wrapped bandages he walked through the bedroom without a sidelong glance and into the second room of his suite which had been converted into his workroom four large drawingtables tables built with surfaces that could be tilted upwards stood against the walls with maps in progress on all of them the first was a general view of the city river and surroundings showing only the major streets and no buildings the second was a closer view adding the minor streets but still showing no buildings the third was more detailed with all possible thoroughfares shown but still with no buildings displayed except for the largest or public structures the last was the completely detailed map made in sections with the current one pinned to the board that was the table visyr went to taking up a set of drafting implements made for taloned haspur hands and setting to work translating his notes into deft patterns of streets and structures the duke was often surprised at how unexact those buildings and streets were when drawn out as measured the streets themselves even when laid out by the dukes surveyors and engineers often meandered a foot or two at a time so that they were never perfectly straight the buildings tended to be more trapezoidal than square or rectangular though the odd angles were more obvious to visyr than to a human this was nothing like the deliambren strongholds which looked like patterns of crystals from above so exact were their angles then again these people had none of the advantages the deliambrens had no clever machines to give them the advantage of haspur eyes no devices to measure without the need for tapes or cords no machines that flew and in a haspur aerie there is scarcely a right angle to be seenhaspur tended to build curves rather than straight lines and avoided right angles as much as possible a haspur aerie looked like a patch of strange plants clinging to the cliffside all of which only proves that theres no one way to build a househe finished the last of his drawings put down his instruments in their tray and looked around for a pitcher of water although a haspur beak was a bit more flexible than a birds it was still more comfortable for him to drink from a pitcher with its pouring spout than from a human cup the page had evidently been and gone the waterpitcher was on a sideboard rather than the table visyr had left it on he got a quick drink of water while he stretched his wings as wide as they would go then put the pitcher down and roused all his feathers with a brisk shake he looked back over his shoulder at his progress so far had he done enough for the day well yesbut theres still plenty of daylight and im not particularly tired i can do another trip easily then quit flying for the day and add this section to the larger maps he picked up the dryboard took the cleaningrod out of its pouch on his belt and passed it over the surface of the board leaving it pristine and white he stowed the rod back in the pouch and hung the board from his belt then trotted out to the balcony again with no hesitation he leapt up onto the balcony rail and out onto the back of the wind returning to the river and the section of taverns inns and businesses that catered to rivermen whom he had left behind it was just about time for the midday meal as he kited to his next position and it was a pleasant enough day that there were streetmusicians setting up all over the city to play for the crowds coming out to find a bite to eat he was pleased to hear the strains of music drifting up from below as he approached the next area to be charted and when he glanced down he saw that a streetmusician had set up on one corner with a stringed instrument that she played with a set of hammers from the multicolored streamers fluttering from each shoulder visyr gathered that she was either one of the humans known as a free bard or was at least pretending to that status she was probably the real thing she was a good enough player to qualify visyr relaxed and listened with one ear to her music habitually filtering out the rushes of wind noise from his own wings as he went into a hover and took out his dryboard again now that the noon hour had come the streets were full of people there was a knot of them around the musician and traffic flowed around them like riverwater around a rock human surveyors would have had a terrible time with the crowd visyr of course was unaffected and felt rather smug about it people would be tripping all over a human all over his equipmentit just goes to show that humans dont have all the answers even deliambrens would be having trouble with people interfering with their measurements sometimes theres no substitute for an expert this was an interesting block one with buildings that were all different in style as if every propertyowner on the block had gone to a different builder for his construction proportions were all different and he began to suspect that there were some nonhuman merchants operating here for some of the buildings had proportions more suited to say a mintak than a human that made his job even more interesting as was often the case he soon became so absorbed in his measuring that he was very like a hunter at hover over prey he lost sight of everything but the work ignoring the people and the traffic entirely right up until the moment that movement on the street below snapped him out of his hovertrance and into instant awareness that something was wrong nothing alerts a predator like the movement of another and in the moment that the young welldressed man on the street began his rush towards the musician that movement broke straight through visyrs concentration whathe glanced down thinking perhaps it was another pursesnatcher who had caught his attention he had caught one in the act a week ago and had pinned the urchin in an alley until the constables could come get him the child would likely have nightmares for ages of giant scarlet hawks dispensing vengeance thats no streetbratalert startled in fact but not mentally prepared to act he watched in stunned horror as the man lunged pulling something from his belt then plunged a dagger into the womans back one or two of those nearest her screamed others stared as numbly as visyr as the man pulled his weapon out of the womans back and stabbed her three times more in lightningfast succession before she fell forward over her instrument and brought it and herself crashing to the ground blood spilled out on the snowpack in a crimson stain beneath her even more startling against the whiteness the sight of blood elicited killrage in the haspur instinctive and overpowering as if the man had attacked one of visyrs own aerie without a second thought visyr screamed a challenge pulled his wings in and dove straight at the man foreclaws outstretched to kill time dilated for him and everything around him began to move in slow motion the man had taken a single step backward the crowd had just barely begun to react some trying to escape one fainting on the spot one trying to seize the man most just staring the man looked up eyes blank visyr noted in a detached part of his mind that he had never seen a human face look so masklike before the rest of him was intent on sinking his talons into the masklike face already he had closed the distance between them to half of what it had been a moment ago and he was still accelerating the man reacted faster than visyr had thought possible for a human spinning as quickly as a haspur he dashed off into the crowd of terrified onlookers shoving them aside with hands smeared with blood those he shoved fell to the ground tripping his pursuers further adding to the confusion many of the onlookers screamed or cried out and either tried to escape or to catch him others milled like a flock of frightened herbivores some trying to get away from the area some just standing and staring some confusedly trying to get closer to see what was going on inevitably they got in each others way some fell to the ground and were trampled resulting in more confusion and enabling the man to get away from those who were trying to stop him by now visyr was in a flat trajectory above the heads of the crowd they all got in his way as the man ducked and writhed through the confusion and visyr had been forced to pull up at the last moment turning the stoop into a tailchase that didnt concern him at allhell dive into one of those alleys thinking i wont be able to follow him but i will and since they all turn into dead ends ill have him the man didnt belong here he was too welldressed for this section of town he couldnt possibly know the area as well as visyr visyr zigged and zagged to follow his erratic movement through the crowd mindful of his wingspan and taking purposely fast shallow strokes still going much faster than a human could run even though he had to keep changing direction but he didnt go the direction visyr expected he dashed down the street to the first intersection and made an abrupt turn towards the river dumbfounded visyr was forced to pull up again and do a wingover to continue the pursuit losing valuable time but the man was heading straight for the smallboat docks he was going to have to stop there with still and shallow water suitable for the smallest craft these docks were surrounded by ice he couldnt possibly get across the river on the ice there was no ice at all in the middle it was far too thin except right near the bank and there were clear channels cut for the barges all along the larger docks but he didnt stop he got to the riverbank and jumped down onto the ice expecting him to stop visyr overshot him talons catching at the air as he shot past his momentum taking him all the way across the river before he could do another wingover and start back now he had seriously lost speed he had to pump his wings furiously to get any momentum going at all miraculously the ice beneath the man held but he kept going angling away from visyr but headed right towards the other side scrambling and slipping but still going straight towards the open water visyr clawed his way upwards intending to make a shallow stoop down on the man hit him in the head and knock him to the ice he didnt make it of course just as visyr got overhead the ice broke beneath the man and he went in he didnt even make a sound when he did so either visyr stooped but this time it was to try and seize the man before the current pulled him under he grabbed just as the man began to sink and managed to snag the shoulders of the mans tunic in his talons pumping his wings with all his might to pull him out of the water the man suddenly looked up at him and still his face was utterly expressionless no terror no anger no nothing only as visyr heaved and pulled for one brief instant the eyes of a trapped and horrified animal looked up at him out of that lifeless face then the man suddenly began to writhe and thrash like a mad thing is he trying to get away whygranted hewas in the talons of a giant predator but he was also about to drown no matter at that moment the fabric of his tunic tore loose and before visyr could snatch another hold on him he actuallydove under the water and beneath the ice and was gone visyr landed on the ice as a group of humans on the docks stared screamed and gestured towards him he stared at the black water in dumbfounded amazement had he really seen what he thought had the man actually gone under the ice on purpose he leapt up into the air struck by a sudden thought maybe the madman had hoped to make open water swim to firmer ice and escape he gained a little height and hovered there for a moment searching for movement in the water the flash of a sleeve the hint of a hand nothing he beat up and down the river from the bridge to the end of the docks and back and there were still no signs of the man if he had hoped to escape in any way except into death he had been cheated of his hope someone beckoned frantically to him from the crowd on the docks he caught the movement in his sidevision and turned his head it was a constable and he obeyed the summons flying with wings that felt heavy with more than mere fatigue are you the birdman in service to the duke the constable called as he came within shouting distance visyr waited for a moment as it was difficult to speak and concentrate on landing at the same time he fanned his wings hard blowing up quite a wind as he powered in to a landing and the hair and garments of those waiting on the dock whipped wildly about for a moment he made quite a creditable landing considering how little room theyd left him a landing that restored some of the confidence hed lost in failing to catch the murderer i am he answered in his most authoritative and deep voice flipping his wings to settle them that voice always surprised humans whod never heard a haspur speak and expected a harsh scream or a fluting whistle i am profoundly regretful that the miscreant escaped me sadly i cannot swim so i could not pursue him escaped he practically tore himself in half to get away one of the spectators said and he dove right under the ice when he tore loose the constable looked up at visyr a little startled by both the voice and by visyrs height did yousee any signs of him in the water visyr shook his head none i am sorry to say he replied i believe he is beneath the ice a grizzled old fellow in the garb of a riverman hawked and spat into the river hell be there a while current therell take him in to shore away from the docks you wont find him till the thaw or if we get a justiciar and locate the body then chop through the ice to get him the constable said with resignation which is probably whats going to happen that was a free bard he murdered the duke wont rest until he knows why he turned back to visyr im afraid im going to have to take you to the station to make a statement visyr jerked his beak up in the haspur equivalent of a shrug i expected as much constable he replied with equal resignation lead on fortunately the station wasnt far because visyr attracted many stares and a lot of attention as he walked but it wasnt a single statement that visyr made it was several he was required to repeat his story twice for lowerlevel constables then for captain fenris himself then just as his temper was beginning to wear thin two new humans were ushered into a room that was beginning to seem far too small his wings were starting to twitch and it was harder and harder to get full breaths he knew why of course for what haspur would ever voluntarily confine himself to a room that wasnt big enough to spread his wings in humans didnt know that though and he kept reminding himself to be charitable although it was very difficult he faced the newcomers with a distinct sense that his patience was at an end one a woman wore the robes of a priest in scarlet and the other a scarlet and black uniform it was the latter who peered at him with a slight frown then said abruptly sirra visyr would you care to move to another venue are you feeling confined here yes visyr replied with surprise and yes how did you know the man in the uniform glanced at the woman who nodded briefly thus telling visyr immediately who was the superior here you were twitching and your eyes were pinning and since we arent questioning you at the moment it had to be because of the room i have mintak friends and they have spoken of haspur particulars the man said as he opened the door for visyr and held it open for the woman visyr nodded he knew he had been twitching his feathers but he hadnt been aware that his eyes were pinningthe pupils contracting to mere pinpoints then dilating again rapidly many birds as well as haspur did that in times of acute stress and mintaks taller than humans felt uncomfortable in places with low ceilings so the man would have known how to interpret those signs of stress for what they really represented still it was surprising to find a human in one of the human kingdoms who was sensitive to what made nonhumans uncomfortable rather than leading visyr to another room in the station the man led them out into the street as they paused in the doorway though it was the woman who spoke she had a low voice pleasant though not particularly musical have you any objections to going across the river with us she asked to the abbey and the cathedral visyr looked up and down the street thinking about the last time a haspur fell into church hands and if i say i do you can go back to the ducal palace of course she replied dryly wed rather that we were able to question you while all of this is still fresh in your mind we arent barbarians here no matter what may go on elsewhere but you should know that no matter how irritated you are with all of this the duke will most probably ask you to make a statement for us he feels very strongly about the free bards now with his permission it could be done at the palace but by then the incident will be a day or more older in your mind they couldnt know just how accurate haspur memory was of course visyr considered that option and also considered the fact that he had been curious for some time about the abbey and the human church and that this was an excellent chance to ask some questions of his own the fact that the duke would definitely want his involvement was another consideration he could not imagine that the duke could be coerced by anyone not even a church official after what hed been told about the great fire so it was unlikely that this priest was using the statement as a bluff if this is any reassurance to you the woman said still in that ironic voice i give you my word that you need not fear the kind of welcome that tfyrr received at the hands of bishop padrik so she knows about thatand whose word would i be taking he asked boldly as passersby glanced at them with curiosity then stared harder then abruptly looked away that was an interesting actionthey did not act as though they were afraid of attracting attention but as if they did not want to intrude upon someone they respected visyr often saw the same reaction when he walked out with the duke she smiled as if his question did not offend her in the least though the man looked a bit irritated the word of high bishop justiciar ardis she replied mildly he felt as if he had been hit with a blast of wind shear the high bishop the dukes cousin she had come herself to question him this must be a more serious situation than i thought there could be no doubt of it now that he looked at her more closely the family resemblance was not to be mistaken especially not for someone whose job it was to estimate relative proportions as well as exact measures she had the same cast of features as her cousin ah i beg your pardon high bishop he said snapping out of his introspection and minute examination of her features of course i have no objections do you mind if i fly over though i shall be able to shake off the last of my feeling of being confined the high bishop glanced skyward and shook her head not at all shall we meet you at the main gate of the abbey then you should have no trouble spotting it from above without waiting for an answer she and her escort turned and went down into the street leaving him to do as he pleased and at the moment it definitely pleased him to take to the skies and make for the spire of the cathedral across the river he flew slowly well aware that even with the crowd parting to make way for the scarlet robe he would beat them to the rendezvous unless of course they had some of those unreliable fourlegged beasts to carry them across just out of curiosity he landed on one of the bridgepiers and waited for them perched atop the white monolith like an ornamental carving sure enough he had not waited long enough to feel the chill when he saw two humans in scarlet mounted on a pair of gray beasts making their way to the bridge the tolltakers waved them throughno great surprise thereand they moved out onto the span the one slightly in the lead moved his head constantly as if he was watching all about them bodyguardvisyr decided just as the head pointed in his direction and the figure raised one hand in a brief but unmistakable salute visyr saluted back pleased to have discovered at leastone human who was as observant as the ones back home observant anddare i say itsensitive and in the uniform of the church but in the service of someone who is supposed to be unusually broadminded very interesting he took wing again landing before the main gate and startling the gatekeeper there no small amount i am to meet high bishop ardis he said shortly as the gatekeeper also clad in a scarlet uniform stammeringly asked his business the man asked nothing more probably supposing that if he was here to do some mischief he would not have landed so openly a reasonable supposition that though not an intelligent one if he had been prepared to challenge the high bishop he would also have landed openly sometimes these humans were not very bright besides being unobservant the same could not be said of the high bishops guard as they moved into view visyr watched his eyes once they had registered the haspurs presence they flitted here there everywhere someone might be concealed even in the shadow of visyrs wings that did not offend visyr in the least it was the mans duty to think of such things the two dismounted and left their longeared creatures in the hands of the gatekeeper once again the man took the lead escorting them into the building and down a wide highceilinged corridor that led to a huge elaborately carved wooden door there he paused with one hand on the handle sending an inquiring glance towards the high bishop she smiled i can think of no more appropriate place she said in answer to his unspoken question he opened the door and held it open as visyr and the high bishop walked in his beak parted in amazement as he looked upand upand up we are very proud of our cathedral the high bishop said behind him although it is no match for the one in gradford is this open enough to make you feel comfortable more than open enough he replied taking in the sweep of the building with admiration interesting that is twice that she has mentioned gradford and i believe this is meant to assure me that she knows what went on there unlike the cathedral in the heart of the city which was built all of stone this one was constructed entirely of wood many kinds and colors of wood the vaulted ceiling was of a light almost white wood while the curved beams supporting the vaults were of a honeycolored wood the floor was ambercolored the walls inlaid with geometric mosaics in every color of wood imaginable figures adorned every pier supporting the vaults of the ceiling and at first visyr thought that they were impossibly figures of haspur then he realized that they were humans but humans with wings and most impractical flowing robes were very fond of our angelvault the high bishop said following his gaze there is no cathedral in any city that has one to match it each of the angels is different i am told that the carvers took as models all of the priests in this abbey that they admired that must have caused some hard feelings when some searched the vault for their likenesses and did not find them visyr replied and bishop ardis chuckled i would prefer to think that all of the priests were admired and that is why there are extra angels tucked up in odd places where you wouldnt expect to find them she replied the choir members sometimes complain that there are so many angels in the choir loft that there is scarcely room for all the singers and speaking of music the organ loft might be the best place to conduct this interview the man interjected or the choir loft depending on whether or not you care if this interview is overheard the organ loft i think she replied this time she led the way to the front of the cathedral where the enormous pipes of the organ were ranged against the wall in shining splendor there was a veritable flock of angels here supporting everything that could be supported frolicking singly and in pairs and amid all of this flurry of pinions was hidden the place where the organist sat they climbed a steep little staircase more of a ladder really and behind a cluster of widespread wings was the alcove holding the keyboard of the instrument a bench and two small seats visyr hesitated for a moment but the two humans took the seats leaving the backless bench for him this area was designed so that sound doesnt escape it bishop ardis explained the noise made by turning music pages can be very distracting im told but more so if someone is in here between services meditating or at prayer is the sound of the musician practicing silently if the bellows arent pumped up there is no sound and the organist can practice without disturbing anyone so long as you cant hear the noise of him pounding the keys and the pedals if we keep our voices down no one will hear us in the sanctuary the man added are you comfortable enough here although the alcove was small the fact that the ceiling was still far above their heads made the situation tolerable it was very chilly here but with his insulating feathers visyr was comfortable enoughwhich interestingly the humans wouldnot be sitting here they would soon get chilled and they probably knew that so they were accepting discomfort that he might be comfortable and that was exceedingly interesting visyr nodded well try not to keep you too long then bishop ardis said then began a series of questions that were far more thorough than anyone had yet asked him even the redoubtable captain fenris he didnt mind because neither she nor the manwhose name he finally learned was tal rufenever repeated a question as the others had they might backtrack and ask something that would elicit more details from him but they never repeated the same question over and over as if they were trying to trip him up in fact he felt surprisingly comfortable with them occasionally one would pause for a moment and look thoughtful and that was when the other would pause in the questioning to make normal conversation and answer any of his questions after a little while the organ loft seemed cozy the carved wings cupping them could have been the natural sides of a nestingcrevice and although haspur were quite beyond nesting in cliffs they still reacted well to such surroundings the soft voices did not travel beyond the wall of wings and they could easily have been at the top of a cliff in the middle of inaccessible mountains all of which was infinitely more reassuring to him than a windowless room a few paces across he did not learn nearly as much as they did but he did find out why they were so concerned about this one incident it was not the first but the latest of many they didnt tell himhow many and he didnt ask but he had the feeling that it was a larger number than a handful he didnt think that the local constables were aware of this their questioning had not tended in the direction that ardis and tal rufens did he could not imagine the high bishop getting personally involved unless this problem extended beyond kingsford and he wondered just how far itdid go he was torn between wanting to volunteer his services and wanting to stay out of it all he really didnt have time to act as a kind of aerial constable he wasnt trained to do so he wasnt deputized to do so and he did have another and very important job to perform on the other hand the more the bishop and tal rufen spoke the more he admired them he found himself wanting to help them however he could and he could not deny the fact that he was curious very curious about what was going on never mind that these were not his humans not of his aerie nor allied directly with the haspur never mind that he was very busy with his own work he was intensely curious alive with curiosity dying to ask questions he knew would not be answered unless perhaps he volunteered his services perhaps not even then but the only chance he would have that theymight would be if he volunteered it was altogether disagreeable in the end he couldnt make up his mind and they finally ran out of questions themselves thank you sirra visyr the high bishop said gravely i know that we have among us all rather thoroughly disposed of most of your day and i apologize for that not at all he replied graciously and before he could say anything more tal rufen had escorted him out of the cathedral and left him in the courtyard behind the main gate and at that point there was nothing left for him to do but endure his curiosity and spread his wings to fly across the river in the last scarlet light of sunset chapter seven once they were safely ensconced in her office ardis turned to tal one eyebrow arched significantly after a week of spending most of his time in her presence he knew most of her signals this one meant well which in turn meant tell me everything you think about what just happened when ardis chose her expressions could be very eloquent it was convenient having a way to convey a broad request with a simple gesture of a single eyebrow he wished he could do the same thing but his face didnt seem inclined to oblige him he began with the first supposition that the kingsford constables had come up with i never for a moment suspected the haspur of being involved with this and i doubt that he deliberately murdered the real killer to keep us from finding out that he was involved she tilted her head to one side which meant oh why for one thing there werent any haspur anywhere near any of the other places where weve had similar murders and it would be cursed hard to hide a haspur anywhere around a village of less than a hundred people he raised his own eyebrow and she nodded for another i never heard anything about haspur being able to work magic and if they could wouldnt you think that poor bird your friend padrik tried to turn into the centerpiece of a holiday feast would have worked some magic to get his tail out of that cage only a few humans have the powers of magic so just becauseone haspur is not a mage does not imply that all of them lack that capacity but your point is taken she replied why dont you think he killed the man deliberately because hes a predator tal said firmly you can see it in how hes builttalons and beak like a falcon or a hawk eyes set in the front of his head rather than the sides like a mintaks predators do their own killing hell kill for food or in the heat of rage and hell do it himself but he wont let the river do it for him thats what padriks captive haspur didtore his guard apart in the heat of fear and rage with his own talons thats what this haspur wasgoing to do before the killer cheated him and fell through the ice at that point the rage ran out and the haspur stopped wanting to kill the man as a theory i would say that is reasonable in this case she paused for a moment i would say that in this case it probably is true it certainly fits the facts and all the other reports of the witnesses he pointed out they did say that the haspur grasped the man by his tunic shoulders and tried to pull him out of the water and the man tore loose and dove under the ice it was certainly not too far from the docks for them to see clearly despite the distracting effect of this haspurs colors all right all right she held up her hands i believe that i can trust your reasoning i am pleased to see that you dont rely on instincts alone he flushed at one point he had waxed eloquent on the subject of a trained constables instincts perhaps he had been a little too eloquent never mind she continued i think you are correct and my instincts also agree with yours ive sent one of the mages to the river to try and find the body but as we both know finding it now will probably be of limited use because its been in running water he sighed what about the victim she shook her head sadly useless she replied the poor child was wearing a gypsy amulet and the mere presence of that contaminated any slight aura there might have been from her attacker it would be analogous to looking for a trace of incense smoke in the presence of a smoldering campfire damn he bit his lower lip then hit his fist on his knee angrily were still reacting after the fact we have to anticipate him somehow her face darkened and she looked away from him for a moment im sending warnings out but i cant reach everyone not even all the free bards some of them simply wont hear the warnings especially the ones who are still traveling some wont heed them even if it comes from me i am still of the church and they do not trust the church and as you yourself discovered there are many unfortunate women who are not free bards who are still streetentertainers and most of them will never hear anything but the wildest of rumors and most of them cant afford to spend a single day or night off the street much less weeks or months he muttered he thought it was too low to hear but her ears were better than he thought and she bowed her head and there too the church has failed she sighed very very softly her lips moved silently and her eyes remained closed and he flushed again feeling as if he was spying on something intensely personal she looked up again her face stony evidently god had given her no revelations not even a hint of what to do we wont be able to prevent him she said bitterly her voice steady and calm we both know that and i cant think of any way that we could even catch him in the act except by accident it was unpalatablebut it was truth he winced and nodded so we continue to react as quickly as possible and we pray that he makes a mistake somewhere sometime he nodded again i cant think of anything else to do he replied helplessly and hes proven twice that he can act right in the middle of a crowded street at the height of the day and still get away he doesnt have to wait for the cover of darkness anymore he has us at a complete disadvantage because hell always wear a different face witnesses do us no good i cant think ofanything that will help except to instruct the constables to keep an eye on female entertainers unfortunately neither can i she bit her lip it was getting a distinctly chewedon appearance illthink on this for some time perhaps something will occur to me think she meant that she was going to pray about it he knew exactly what she was going to do she was going to spend half the night on her knees hoping for some divine advice maybe shed get it but he wasnt going to hold his breath her eyes were focused on something other than him and he tried to be as quiet as possible to keep from disturbing her abruptly she shook her head and looked at him again you might as well go she told him you go do whatever it is that lets you think perhaps you can evolve some plan if anything happens or if they find the body i shall have someone fetch you he stood up gave a brief stiff nod of a salute and took his leave his own form of meditation was to sit and focus his eyes on something inconsequential while his mind worked when he got back to his room that was precisely what he did leaving the door open so that if kayne came for him she would know he was waiting for the summons he sat down on his bed with his back to the wall and stared at a chipped place on the opposite wall this case was precisely like all the rest with nothing left to tie the murderer to an actual person tal had been studying casehistories in the files of the justiciars with kaynes help over the last week and he had found one other murderer like this onea man whod been compelled by some demon inside him to kill over and over again demon was the word the church clerk had used but tal and ardis had both been a bit less melodramatic i would sayneed rather than demon she had commented when he showed her the case as you yourself pointed out domination manipulation and control this man was driven by his own need not by some other creatures he was the only director of his actions that particular man had taken mementos from each of his victims some personal trinket from each of them and once the justiciarmages realized what he was doing it was through those mementos that he was caught they had done something that allowed them to follow those objects to the place where they were lyingwhich happened to be the mans apartment hidden behind a false wall in a closet it was obvious to tal that the missing knife or knives served the same purpose here but a mage would know better than to leave such a knife uncleansed after the murders so there was no hope that a trace of the victims blood would provide the link they needed to find him tal was certainand so was ardisthat the person they sought was male the fact that all the people taken over had been male was the telling clue rather than the fact that all the known victims were female a woman who hated other women usually felt that way for some other reason than confusion about her genderin fact other than women who were of the cutthroat variety of thief females who murdered other females usually did so out of jealousy or rivalry and considered themselves intensely female it was ardiss opinion that in order to control the secondary victims the murderer would have to identify intensely with them and it was tals opinion that most females even one with severe mental and emotional warping would find that distasteful they could both be wrong of course but again women who murdered women almost always killed people they knew and it would simply not have been possible for the murderer to get to know all of the widely disparate victims in the short period of time between murders men kill strangers women dont except by accident or as part of another crime that was the pattern that had emerged from tals study of the records as to where their killer got his knowledge of magicthe most logical place to look was the church itself this troubled ardis and although she faced it unflinchingly tal avoided bringing the topic up but that made it yet more likely that the killer was male for ardis knew all of the female justiciarmages in all twenty kingdoms personally none of them had gone missing was subject to strange or inexplicable trances lately or indeed ever had been in all of the cities towns and villages in question i dont think its possible to do this remotely ardis had told him i think the killer has to be there nearby somewhere there are just too many things that can go wrong if he cant actuallysee whats happening which meant their killer was hidden somewhere in plain view of the scene it would have to be somewhere above the level of the street too in order for him to have a decent view tal wished that there was some way to conscript that birdman ifanyone had the ability to spot someone watching the murders it would be him and no one in the entire city of kingsford had a better chance of stopping another murder in the act than this visyr at least he would if the murder took place in daylight in the open street after this last incident the murderer was quite likely to go back to murders at night or even indoors we still dont know how hes taking control of his secondary victims how hard would it be to take a room in a big inn stand up on the balcony and take over one of the patrons tal thought glumly then when the constables come to question everyone the murderer can either be gone completely out the window or protest that like everyone else he was tucked up in his virtuous bed frustrating but if visyr would just volunteer his services ah but why should he he wasnt human he had no interests here except for hispaid position in the dukes household he probably hadnt the least notion what a free bard was he was a predator how would he feel about murder well obviously he felt strongly enough about it to try to kill the presumed murdererthere was that tal just wished he could have read the birdman a little better obvious things like feathertrembling and eyepinning were one thing but what had it meant when the creature went completelystill what had some of those head wing arm and talon movements meant you cant coerce a flying creature and i dont know what to say or do that would tempt him or awake whatever sense of justice lives in him i fear the answer is that there is no answer for this one unless the duke lends us his services that meant that the duke would have to do without whatever the birdman was doing for him and he didnt know just how willing the duke would be to sacrifice anything he personally wanted to this manhunt especially when there was no guarantee that there would be any concrete result from the sacrifice well hed mention it to ardis she had more channels to the duke than anyone else he knew of if only visyr had managed to snatch the knife but once again it was missing visyr definitely recalled that the man had had it in his hand when he bolted from the murder scene and hadnot had it when he ran out onto the ice it was a point of pride with the birdman how accurate haspur memory was and tal was not inclined to doubt him so once again the telltale knife had vanished into the crowd which meant it probably had beendropped deliberately in a place where the real murderer could find it the knives were probably serving the same memento purposeor more accurately perhaps serving as trophiesas the small personal objects had served for that other killer one other thing they had learned that they had not known before it wasnot the same knife although the blade was the same shape this one unlike the one that tal had seen the knifegrinder use had boasted a gaudy jeweled hiltprecisely the kind of toy that a young welldressed man might wear as an ornament so it was reasonable to assume that the murderer had several knives of the same type each suited to a particular tool for murder for the jeweler it might have been this very piece for the blacksmith the plainer blade that tal had seen or even a rough halffinished blade so the curse notion at least could be discarded it wasnt at all likely that there were two or more knives of the same type carrying so powerful a curse well thats one small spot of progress anyway then again it could be the same blade with a different handle movement at his open door caught his eye and he nodded in greeting to kayne theyve brought the body in ardis is with it she said shortly he nodded again and rose to follow her ardis assisted by another justiciar was already in the process of examining the body with a detachment that tal found remarkable in someone who was not used to seeing the victims of violence on a regular basisand certainly someone who was not used to seeing nude young men on a regular basis either the other justiciar was a much older man thin bald with an oddly proportioned face very long as if someone had taken an ordinary mans face and stretched it his eyes were a colorless gray or faded blue his hands and fingers as long and nimble as any musicians well theres no trace of magic which is what we expected but its more than merely frustrating she was saying to her assistant as tal and kayne entered kayne went white then red at the sight of the nude body then excused herself ardis didnt even notice tal took his place on the other side of the table the body hadnt been in the water long enough for any real damage to have occurred but tal did notice one thing he doesnt look drowned he pointed out look at the expression he doesnt look as if the last thing he was doing was struggling for air in fact the expression on the corpses face was one of profound relief if tal hadnt known better he would have thought that the man had died in his sleep it was most unsettling to seethat expression onthis body true ardis frowned of course that could be simply because the cold rendered him unconscious first his lungs are full of water at any rate so drowning is definitely what killed him but tal had already moved on to the next thing he was looking for again the fact that the fellow had drowned in very cold water and soon after committing the murder had kept the formation of those strange bruises to a minimumbut the bruises were there ardis and the other justiciar bent over them to study them at close range when tal pointed them out you say youve seen these on the other killers ardis asked delicately turning the mans arm to avoid further damage as she looked at the bruising on the inside of the upper arm all the ones i was able to examine tal replied they dont look like the bruises that would come from falling or from being struck no they dont the other justiciar replied theres no central impact point on them its more as if the limb was shoved or struck by something large and soft but shoved or impacted hard enough to leave a bruise he looked up at tal from across the table and nodded you must be the special inquisitor im father nord hathon the infirmarian that accounted for his presence here his medical knowledge ardis was calling in anyone she thought might give her a clue tal had no doubt of the priests competence for no one who worked closely with ardis had ever proved less than competenti just hope that the same can be said about me look on the legs for the bruises too tal told him youll probably find them on the backs of the thighs and the calves fascinating father hathon murmured following tals suggestion i cant account for this kicks would have been directed towards the shins or the knee blows to the head or torso and attempts to seize the hands probably wouldnt have left these bruises on the wrists and hands those are particularly odd they dont look like ligature marks but they dont look like blows either falls would have left bruises on the outside of the arms not the inside and on the shins again this isnt quite the damage one would see from crushing but it isnt far off from it tal shook his head i dont understand it either he confessed all i know is they look just like the ones i saw on the other bodies fascinating father hathon said again ardis straightened up from her own examination and wiped her hands on a towel placed nearby i dont think well learn anything more here she sighed theres nothing magical in the clothing no traces on the body we might as well turn his corpse over to his relations were questioning the relatives but im virtually certain that theyre going to say precisely what all the friends and relatives of other secondary victims have said this is a most curious case ardis father hathon said still examining the body i fear the only way that you will apprehend this perpetrator is when he makes a mistake so you agree with me she asked turning to look at him the man didnt simply go mad and murder a stranger like the fellow at the cathedral father hathon looked up and nodded absolutely he replied this is not behavior that can be rationalized even by a very disturbed soul and despite what the laity might believe people do not suddenly run mad and begin killing strangers without giving very powerful signs that all is not right with them long beforehand people dont suddenly run mad and murderstrangers at all tal interjected it might look as if they have but either a person they really wanted to kill was one of the joblot or else the people they kill bear some strong connection or similarity to someone theydo want to kill but dont dare when both ardis and father hathon turned to look at him in surprise he flushed ihandled a case like that he murmured apologetically we caught the murderer and i got a chance to question him fellow ran mad in the marketplace and killed three older women turned out he really wanted to murder his mother i got curious and looked up other cases of supposed strangerkillings and indeed they were like his ardis and hathon exchanged a look hers was rather proud and proprietary his was an acknowledgement hathon continued this time including tal i shall question these relatives myself to assure myself about signs of a disturbed mind but i believe with you that i shall find no such signs for i find no accompanying signs of physical neglect or abuse on this body and no signs in the belongings that he planned this crime he shrugged i cannot account for these bruises and they trouble me i concur with your analysis if i did not know better i would argue for demonic possession tal couldnt resist the obvious question what do you mean father hathon that you know better he smiled thinlymore a stretching of his lips than a real smile i have seen nothing in all my years to make me believe in demonic possession there are spirits certainly even ones we humans might term evil there may even be demons but i do not believe that such a creature can infest a human soul and make it do its bidding that a human couldinvite one to infest i do truly believe but that is voluntary hosting and not involuntary possession and the creature that is hosted is no greater in evil than the one doing the hosting he lost what was left of that faint smile believe me special inquisitor the human heart is as capable of evils as any supernatural creature of legend it is capable of things more terrible than any poor homeless spirit could engender on its own in my time i have seen the worst that man can wreak and i would prefer to face the worst that a spirit could do than fall into the hands of one of my fellow humans who harbors such a damaged soul ardis drew a sheet over the body shrouding it from view father hathon if you would see to dealing with the relatives i would be grateful you can tell them that the church believes their son was a victim himself and that he can be buried in hallowed ground with all the appropriate rites and i shall be suitably vague when they ask me what i believe he was a victimof he nodded briskly you can trust my discretion i never had any doubts ardis replied and gesturing to tal to follow her left the room that evidently served the justiciars as a morgue once again they retreated to the haven of ardiss private office once they were in their accustomed seats ardis leaned back and watched him under halfclosed eyelids you surprised me back there she said slowly pleasantly i might add i knew that you were intelligent but i did not know that you were inclined to supplement that intelligence with research what other oddities have you studied in the casebooks tal rufen perhaps we might find some similarities with this case kayne came in at that moment bearing a tray with the dinner they had both missed which was just as well since tals stomach was beginning to tell him that it didnt matter what turmoil his head was in his body needed food she set mugs of hot tea and plates of bread cheese and pickles in front of both of them rank hath its privileges including raiding the kitchenstores and i borrowed your rank and your keys on your behalf kayne said crisply you two need to eat or youll collapse and nothing will get done may i stay if you cant find anything for me to do as a secretary i can take a toastingfork and make you toastedbreadandcheese ardis seemed more amused than annoyed tal was simply grateful for the food certainly ardis replied picking up the mug and taking a sip at this point you should be part of our investigation you may be in my position one day and have to conduct another like it kayne made the sign of the flame with her two hands against her chest god forbid she exclaimed i dontwant to see any such thing happen ardis only arched a brow and waited for tal to begin she knows that once a crime has been committed sooner or later someone will emulate it he grimaced well the first thing that comes to mind probably doesnt have anything to do with this one he replied seeing the page before his minds eye as vividly as if he had a haspurs memory thats the one i call the wouldbe hero hes a fellow that does something deliberately to put peoples lives in danger so that he can be the first on the scene to rescue them the fellow in the archives set fires then rushed in and rescued those who were in peril but i suppose it would be possible to make holes in boats set up situations where things could fall on people lure a boat onto a hidden obstruction i suppose you find this type out because hes a hero once too often kayne hazarded or he keeps turning up at the scene whether or not he gets a chance to rescue anyone or as in this case a justiciarmage found a link between him and the fire hes lucky no one died so he was only sold into servitude to pay for the damages tal personally felt that the man might have gotten off too easilybut then again it didnt saywho hed been sold to a life of hard labor on a roadcrew would certainly have kept him out of any further mischief though it might not have cured him of wanting to be a hero at the expense of others another characteristic of people with this nature is that they tend to try and mingle with constables fire crews guardsthe people they would like to emulate ardis noted and smiled at tal yes i am aware of this type also very often you will discover later that they applied to be a constable or something of the sort and were let go or turned down because they were clearly unsuitable go on please kayne had taken up a tablet of foolscap and was busily making notes after making good her offer as toastingcook tal continued taking time as he spoke so that she could keep up with him there was the fellow i mentioned earlierthe one who walked into the marketplace with an ax and cut down three women before he was stopped he went on i had that casei brained him with an awningpole and dropped him where he stood that one was so sensational that the city council sent for a special justiciarmage from here in kingsford to examine him and read his thoughts ardis nodded i recallthat would be my cousin arran the one who can sometimes read what is in a mans mind well this priest discovered that the man hated his mother who was one of those nagging selfish women who raise children by telling them what incompetent asses they are no matter what they do or how well they do it he shook his head she constantly belittled him then expected him to serve her like a slave all her life hewanted to kill his mother and had gone after her to the market to do just that he actually struckat her but she got away and then he just struck at anyone that looked like her once again he shook his head i have to say that i thought and still think that the man deserved hanging which he got but once i met the mother i wished there was a way to hang her alongside him there was another when i was just beginning in the force who slaughtered whoreshe was inept where women were concerned never able to handle himself with them the only women whod have anything to do with him were the ones he paid he was punishing all the women whod mocked him and turned him down by killing the whores and the similar cases you found in the records ardis prompted looking interested as kayne scribbled along as fast as she could there was a young man whod been denied very unpleasantly by a girl who went up into a tower and began shooting crossbow bolts into the crowd belowheavy crossbow too meant to carry far and kill with a single strike at first it was at her and anyone else he imagined had slighted him but after hed killed three or four people he started shooting anything and anyone that moved his rage and madness fueled his strength and he fired more quickly than even a professional soldier would with such a hefty weapon tal closed his eyes a moment and tried to recall the rest of the cases hed seen a fellow made a practice of murdering wives because the first one was faithless and ran off with a horsetrader but he didnt do it wholesale he did it over the course of ten years and he didnt do it in public that would come under another heading i would imagine ardis agreed clasping her hands in front of her on her desk in fact that might be the pattern we are seeing here punishment of many for the sins of one who cant be reached he nodded it made a lot of sense thats what ive been thinking for some time now of course if he ever killed the one person hes obsessed with that doesnt mean hed stop punishment of manythat would account for the fact that all the women concerned have some connection to music and musicians kayne put in looking excited for she had not been privy to most of the discussions tal and ardis had had on the subject if this is true and we could deduce what kind of person is the source of his anger we might be able to anticipate him tal continued for kaynes benefit the trouble with that is in order for the deduction to be of any use we would have to allow that sort of person to walk in danger and he shook his head its morally reprehensible we cant be everywhere and protect everyone i agree ardis said firmly to his immense relief but lets do what we can for the purpose ofwarning exactly that sort of person this was the first time that they had made a point of delineating all of the similar characteristics of the primary victims it didnt take long to deduce that the targets that had been attacked with the most ferocity and in the riskiest circumstances were all young darkhaired or of the gypsy clans andreal musicians even the halfmad woman tals colleague had seen attacked was a real musician in that the source of what little income she had came from her hymnsinging the trouble was because of regional tendency half the young women in kingsford were darkhaired and from the way the murderer was behaving he would probably react to someone simply singing because she was happy this is an awfully broad description kayne said dubiously her brows knitted as she studied their toobrief notes tal licked a bit of hot cheese off his finger thats not the only problem the trouble with this is that even if we get this sort of woman to be careful hell either find a way to ambush his chosen victims or hell switch to something else tal replied glumly hes done that before and if he doesnt get the satisfaction of a perfect victim hes likely to make up in quantity what his kills lack in quality look at that list in derrytonsixover the course of four evenings ardis winced and nodded and finished her own slice in a few quick neat bites that would take a mage of considerable power and endurance unless he was fueled by his determination like that crossbowman you spoke of theres another problem in that we dont have any physical characteristics for him we certainly cant search doortodoor for every man who feels hes been wronged by a gypsy musician without arran along to know if they told us the truth that wouldnt exactly be productive even if we could confine every man in kingsford to his own house until we questioned him kayne pointed out if he knows were looking for him hes hardly going to tell us the truth if we find and question him she folded a bit of paper over and over a nervous habit tal hadnt noticed until now tal gritted his teeth so were back to where we were when we started maybe not ardis said slowly tapping the desk with her forefinger we actually know a few things about the man himself hemust have a source of wealth hes been moving freely from city to city and evidently has leisure to seek out victims that match his needs conversely hes unexceptional unmemorable because no one has commented a word about seeing strangers lingering conspicuously before the murders except for the secondary victims tal pointed out theyre often strangers to the area themselves ardis nodded and picked up a slice of cheese nibbling it delicately if hes doing this within lineofsight as i think he must be hes either in the crowd or above it which means hes either very good at getting himself into other peoples homes or businesses and up to a second story or hes climbing about on roofs she finished the cheese and started as a knot popped in the fire if i were in his place id offer myself as a cheap roofrepair service after a snowfall followed by a day of sun roofs are always leaking tal felt a rising excitementnow were getting somewhere we could see if there was anyone having his roof repaired at the last site tal offered thats a start ardis said brightening a little we could also check with all the businessowners down by the docks and find out if there were any strangers working around their buildings at the time workers it wouldnt necessarily have to be workerspeople who claimed they were inspectors maybe or surveyors tal put in as kayne scribbled madly or extra workers they cant account for checking inns for strangers kayne began catching the excitement then shook her head impractical and besides an inn isnt the only place a stranger to kingsford might lodge good heavens he could evenrent a place and with all the disrupted neighborhoods he might not be recognized as a stranger for a moment there was silence as they ran out of ideas theres another reason why he must have considerable resources tal put in the daggers we already know that there was more than one and the second one was jeweled decorated well enough that a welldressed man did not look out of place carrying it he either had to buy or make them and i dont expect that sort of blade is the kind of thing you could pick up at an arms shop he gave ardis a sidelong glance to see if she admitted that the daggers were what he thought they were ardiss face darkened for a moment at that reminder and she finally shook her head and put down her tea perhaps not as rare as one would think since this is a city recovering from a great fire and trading an heirloom dagger for a cookstove or some wood would not be out of place when hunger and cold tap on ones shoulder i also dislike saying it after how helpful the haspur was but a haspursor most birdsvision would be good enough that if this killer is seeing the murder scenes from above perhaps he is also somehow seeing through the eyes of birds and is nowhere near the murder site itself tal nodded grimly and kayne looked bewildered despite her best attempts to appear matteroffact ardis continued i think we are looking for someone who has a grudge against the church as well she said to kayne with some reluctance tal and i have touched on this before perhaps even a defrocked priest i cannot imagine why anyone else would be using an ecclesiastical dagger probablya defrocked priest kayne snapped then colored she must have been thinking the same thing after seeing visyrs description of the murderweapon forgive me ardis i know this is probably the last thing you want to hear but im only a novice and i dont have the she searched for words the emotional investment in the church that you have maybe i can see things more clearly because of that there just arent that many lay people who know about ecclesiastical daggers ardis sighed and covered her face with one hand for a moment perhaps you are right she murmured from behind that shelter it must be said or we wont consider it seriously write it down kayne write it down i dont want to cost people their lives because i dont happen to like the trend the investigation is taking it might not be a priest at all tal pointed out hoping to spare her some distress by giving her other options to consider now that she had made the effort to include this one she would be honest enough to pursue it to whatever end it led to it could be someone who like those wouldbe constables is trying to emulate a priest in some way it could simply be someone who wants to make the church out to be a villain ardis removed her hand and looked up at him there is no one who wishes to make the church out to be a villain so much as someone who has been cast out of the brotherhood ardis said slowly and kayne is right the number of laymen who know about the ecclesiastical daggers is very low the ceremonies in which they are used are so seldom performed publicly that it is vanishingly unlikely our particular miscreant could have seen one of them an uncomfortable silence reigned and it was tal who interrupted it by clearing his throat ififit is a priest or a defrocked priest it probably isnt anyone you know he pointed out lamely after all the murders didnt start here kingsford is only the last link in a path that goes out past burdon heath i dont actually know where it started rinholm was just the last place i got an answer from and it could be that it isnt a defrocked priest kayne admitted after a moment i can think of another enemy of the brotherhood who would know about the daggers it could be someone who was sentenced to lifelong penal servitude and excommunication by a justiciar youdo have the dagger on view at the sentencing of those you are casting out of the church ardis and you use it very prominently when you symbolically cut all ties to the community of god and the fellowship of man she made a few flamboyant and stylized flourishes as if she was using a blade to cut something in the air its pretty theatrical and i would imagine it would stick in someones mind the ceremony of excommunication is performed on those whose acts are so heinous that the church cannot forgive them and sometimes they are people we nevertheless have to allow to live ardis murmured aside to tal granted we dont do that often but but when you do its on pretty hard cases tal pointed out thatswhere i saw it a justiciar was excommunicating a particularly nasty piece of workhe hadnt killed anyone butwell what hed done to his own daughters was pretty foul caught in the act no less and the poor child no older than nine the local sire had him castrated and the church excommunicated him then they both bound him over into penal servitude and hestill defied all of us theres a hard case for you i thought it was a mocksacrifice of some kind oh we use the daggers there too in another rare ceremony kayne said cheerfully and it isnt a mock sacrifice its a case wherewell never mind the point is there is no way you would have seen that ceremony unless it was being performed on your behalf and i dont think you qualify for that degree of urgency in fact no one who is the beneficiary of that ceremony is likely to hate the church theyre more likely to want to spend their lives scrubbing chapel floors to repay us huh he was surprised at her candor he hadnt expected anyone in the church to admit that they performed paganstyle sacrifices we also excommunicate heretics kayne screwed up her face for a moment we dont do that often you have to be doing more than just making a priest angry or disagreeing with him six high bishops have to agree on ititshard to be declared a heretic ardis interrupted we havent excommunicated a heretic since we did it posthumously to padrik the original priest who bound the ghost at skull hill and all those who sent the ghost further victims the point is suppose our murderer did something really heinous that warranted excommunication maybe a secular punishment too hed have seen the dagger and hed know it was an important object intimately connected with the church kayne said in triumph especially if a justiciarmage was the one involved ardis added looking more normal we tend to dress the ceremony up quite a bitinvoking ghostflames on the blade and auras around the priest well in that case well need to get access to the great archives and find the records on excommunications in the last ten to fifteen years and while were at it we should get the ones on defrocked priests theres no point in ignoring a theory just because we dont like it ill go take care of that now kayne said getting quickly to her feet ill send it by a messenger and have him wait for the records we need this informationnow not next spring if theres a priestmage there have him send it to me directly ardis ordered kayne nodded and headed for the door she was gone before tal could say anything more leaving him alone with ardis he tilted his head to one side watching her as she subsided into brooding the crackling of the fire was the only sound in the room youve never had a case like this one before have you he asked softly so as not to break the silence too harshly she shook her head the dark rings under her eyes bespoke several sleepless nights the case was making inroads on her peace of mind as well as tals well ive had difficult cases but not ones that were personally difficult that involvedyour emotions he persisted she gave him a rueful glance true never one of those ive had cases that made me angry even ones that involved other members of the brotherhood but they werent people i liked in fact i must confess now as i did then that it gave me some inappropriate personal satisfaction to put them away where they couldnt hurt anyone else she looked positively fierce at that moment i above all know that the physical body of the church is far from perfect and some blemish cant be helpedbut those who misuse their power and authority arenot to be tolerated but nownow that it looks as if its a priestmage itcould be someone you know someone you like he nodded its like knowing theres a bad constable on the force and knowing it probably is someone you know and like because otherwise he wouldnt be able to get away with it for long she sighed and rubbed her temple as if her head hurt thats it exactly we overlook things in friends that we are suspicious of in enemies or strangers and we do it because we just know in our heart that the friend couldnt possibly be doing something bad the trouble is ive known enough criminals to be aware that they can be very charming very plausible fellows and they make very good friends they use friendship as a cloak and a weapon and someone in the brotherhood he ventured thats doubly hard to face she said looking off beyond him somewhere we have no families of our own you see that makes the ties of friendship within the priesthood doubly special andquite frankly weresupposed to be able to weed bad apples out long before they get out of the novitiate weresupposed to be able to police our own ranks but if someone entered the church intending from the very beginning to conceal his real motives tal shook his head you wouldnt be able to catch him until he did something its as if someone planned to have a double identity of criminal and constable from the beginning and kept the false face intact until he was actually caught in the act wed never know never guess and even after being caught perhaps still never believe she glanced at him sharply then looked away this isnt what i anticipated when i joined the church was her only answer why did you join the church he asked feeling that an insolent question might take her mind off her troubled conscience and what did you expect when you got here the fire flared up for a moment briefly doubling the light in the room and casting moving shadows where no shadows had been a heartbeat before she cast him another sharp glance but an ironic smile softened her expression as the fire died down again and although she had no reason to answer him she chose to indulge his curiosity well i actually joined because i convinced my father that it was moreeconomicalto send me here i was sixteen and betrothed to a man who was forty and not at all looking forward to my coming marriage tal winced not exactly a pleasant prospect for a young woman he ventured oh itcould have been there were people in my fathers circleolder menwho were quite attractive and clever i was a precocious child audacious enough to be amusing intelligent enough to be worth educating many of fathers friends found me charming and several said outright that if they were not already married theyd have snatched me up as soon as i was of legal age marriage to one of them would have been no hardshipbut not the man my father had chosen she made a little face of distaste he wasnt one of my fathers intimate circle rather he was someone my father had wanted to cultivate boring interested only in his business and convinced that women were good only for bearing and caring for children and being ornamental at the occasional dinner hed already buried two wives wearing them out with multiple sets of triplets and twins and i was to be the third he wouldnt hire a proper overseer for the little ones and not one of his children was older than twelve you were supposed to shuttle from his bedroom to the nursery and back i take it tal asked sounds as if he expected you to be a nursemaid as well as an ornamental bedpiece well what heexpected and what he would have gotten were two different things she replied tartly i already had plansbut as it turned out around the time when the wedding would have been scheduled the old goat lost his political influence through a series of bad choices since political influence was the reason father had arranged the marriage in the first place it was fairly easy to convince him that he would gain more by sending me to the church instead he was skeptical until i proved to him i had what it took to become a mage priestmages arenever without influence in the church and it didnt take him a heartbeat to realize how much good it would do him to have one of his own blood saying whathe would say in closed church conclaves she grinned sohe told the old goat id discovered a genuine vocation the old goat didnt have so much influence now that he was willing to fight the church for a promised bride my father told the justiciars that i had magetalent and the justiciars didnt give a hang if i had a vocation or not so long as they could make a justiciarmage out of me and you tal asked in the church i would get things i wanted education primarily and eventual independence bless his heart father never intended for me to act against my conscience or against the church itselfwhat he wanted is essentially what i have been doing especially with regard to softening the churchs hardening attitude towards nonhumans it was a good enough bargain to me she shrugged if i didnt have a vocation when i entered i discovered that there was pleasure in using my abilities to the utmost pleasure in being of service and yes a certain pleasure in piety not the kind of pietyforshow that makes up most church ceremonies butwellbeliefbelief and living what you believe i see tal said though he didnt really understand that last perhaps he just didnt believe enough in anything to know how it felt then what she chuckled then after several years of fairly pure service i discovered that my fathers talent for politics hadnt skipped my generation i found myself in the thick of politics lured in by my own sense of justiceor injustice perhaps eventually that led to a rift in the kingsford brotherhood which led to one faction allying itself with enemies of the grand duke which led in turn to the great fire that essentially hastened a purge that would have been inevitable though less immediate costly and dramatic than it was after the fire her smile turned a trifle bitter a trifle feral to be plainspoken it was a little war a war of magic and of physical force it was a war i didnt intend to lose not after seeing the fire raging across the kanar in a way the worst mistake they ever made was in helping to set the fire everyone here knew it had to have been set by magic and that brought many of the brotherhood over to my side who might otherwise have remained neutral or helped the opposition so i won the war and won it in hours and i willnever permit its like here again he took in her expression and decided that he didnt want to be involved with any faction opposing this woman if she was opposed and was certain to the depths of her soul that she was right she would never relent never admit defeat and what happened to the old goat he asked changing the subjector rather returning the conversation to the original subject he found another bride within a month he still had money even if he didnt have the influence hed once possessed his political star had set and he knew it so he found a pretty little kitten with no more brains than a duck two more sets of twins thenhe died somewhat to everyones surprise she shook her head the girl managed to hold her looks so now she had beautyand money and needed to answer to no man for what she chose to do she hired an army of tutors and nursemaids to care for the children and has been working her way through a series of lovers unencumbered by offspring scruples or husband and there are plenty of my former set who envy her her gaze wandered off elsewhere and he thought that perhaps she was wondering what she would have been like had she tamely allowed the wedding to take place she might have been able to prevent having children entirely until he died she would have had the old mans money and as a widow shed have been able to do whatever she chose she could have bought that education she craved helped her father politically traveled had freedom she doesnt have now he wondered if she had thought of that at all was there anyone you would have rather married he asked curiously your own age i mean you were sixteen thats a pretty romantic age after all at sixteen every pretty girl hadme ready to pledge my all but i was never more romantic than i was practical she pointed out to him unfeminine of me but there it is in some ways tal you and your peers have far more freedom than me and mine i knew that the boys my age were all under the same constraints that i was we had to marry or take positions to suit our families if we didnt wed be cut off the way my cousin gwydain was when he passed the trials and joined the bardic guild against his fathers wishes even when he became a master bard and was feted by everyone his father refused to acknowledge him of course she smiled crookedly being in the guild was no great hardship and being a master bard meant he had any luxury he wanted so he didnt lose anything by his choice and neither did i if it came to that and once i knew icould be a mage id have gone into the church whether or not my father consented he knew it i think so she chuckled its a good thing were a great deal alike he knew not to push me too far and i knew not to push him either but running off with an inappropriate boy would have gotten both of us cut off from family and support with neither of us suited to or trained for a trade and i didnt care to live in poverty she said crisply love in a hovel quickly turns sour for those who arent mentally and emotionally inclined to sacrifice great sacrifice anyway all for love and all of thatthere was some sacrifice involved in going into the novitiate but those who are granted exceptional gifts get exceptional treatment inside the church as well as outside of it but there was a tinge of regret in her voice and tal was suddenly taken with a devilish wish to pursue the subject but she might have sensed that and she turned the tables on him and youtheres nothing wrong with your looks and the constabulary doesnt require celibacy so why arent you married she asked a wicked gleam in her eye what happened to all those pretty girls you yearned after he flushed in confusion i dont know he confessed for a while none of those girls was interested in anyone who was earning barely enough in the constabulary to support himselftheyd flirt with me but they married tradesmen then later when i was a full constable i didnt ever see anyonei wanted to pursue i suppose it was because i was always in districts that didnt have any decent women i mean they had decent women but the ones who werent married were brainless even most of the ones whowere married were brainless and when i saw ones who had a few brains they spoiled it all by falling in love with some musclebound idiot whod get them with child then leave them with the baby and spend most of every night with a pretty barmaid he shook his head i never understood it well maybe they fell in love with musclebound idiots because thats what they thought they were supposed to do ardis commented sardonically its amazing what sheep women are sometimes but its equally amazing how happy men are to have them that way so theres plenty of blame on both sides i suppose so tal began and she fixed him with that penetrating stare again yousuppose so did you ever go to one of those women who attracted you and encourage her to think for herself did you ever compliment her on making a clever decision did you ever show her that you valued brains over looks at his shamefaced flush she nodded i thought so well whats a girl to do when her parents are telling her she has to be a pretty little fluffhead her peers are rewarding the behavior of a pretty little fluffhead and the handsome fellows only seem impressed by big empty eyes and a slender waist if her parents cant afford to apprentice her and they dont have a business she can learn or they wontlet her learn it what is she to think and do he felt obscurely ashamed i supposethey do what they feel theyre supposed to do ardis was clearly relishing her lowkey but heartfelt tirade if someone ever gave them encouragement to think for themselves youmight get a few girls outside of the novitiate who find pleasure in spending as much time cultivating and nurturing their intelligence as they do their hair she said crisply you know i tried starting a school down in kingsford for girls with brains and ambition and it got nowhere because there werent anymen saying that girls with brains and ambition were attractive the ones that stuck ended up in the novitiate where theyd have gone anyway that was then he pointed out rather desperate to get his gender out of trouble maybe now you would be able to make it work youre a high bishop youre a woman young girls haveyour example things have changed in kingsford and there are a lot of women whove had to make their own way yes well maybe now it would work she admitted grumbling a little especially now that i could get a free bard tutor or three from my cousin some help and encouragement from duke arden and lady asher and i could requisition quite a few folk from this abbey as teachers i know kayne would be perfectly happy to provide her services as exampleand teacher you see he said eagerly you just took on too much by yourself all you needed to do was to wait until you had the authority to get more help and the power yourself to be an example she gave him an odd sideways look you can be very persuasive yourself tal rufen she said i shall have to requisitionyour skills for this school then well see what you have to say about it so long as all you ask me to teach is history i have no particular objection he said surprised by the sudden longing that came over him when she made the suggestion i am not suited to teaching much of anything else again she gave him one of those sidelong glances perhaps i shall do just that but in the meanwhile we have another sort of work ahead of us she brooded for a moment i want you on the street tal go make those inquiries we spoke about get some coin for bribery and see if anyone knows anything and warn the women that could let him know were looking for him tal pointed out if hes watching for such things well have to take that chance her face had taken on the look it had when she spoke of the little war shed fought within the church you can defend yourself tal what defenses have those women got he sighed none ill do everything i can ardisand there is this we may not be able to catch himbut perhaps we can make it so difficult for him that he becomes desperate desperate men make mistakes her face sobered we will have to hope for those mistakes at the moment that is the only hope we have chapter eight orm kalend settled into the corner formed by the intersection of the boothbench he sat on and the wall of this tavern his eyes discreetly hooded as he toyed with his mug of dark ale around him the muted sounds of conversation and eating provided a soporific background for his thoughts this was precisely the sort of tavern he most favored one with such good food that the meals themselves were the attraction for customers not the liquor nor any form of entertainment the drink available here was only average in taste and below average in strength that fact when combined with the excellent provender assured that there were never any fights inthis inn this was precisely as the proprietor a famous cook himself preferred it in fact orm suspected that if he could have managed it he would have omitted serving wine beer and ale altogether and relied entirely onkaffa and teas he was of the pious churchgoing sort that frowned on strong drink and prohibited intoxication but he probably knew only too well that if he were to do that not even the finest food in the world would keep his customers returning most selfstyled gourmets demanded light wines and passable beer at the least to accompany their meals this was a good place for orm to do business especially business with some of his moresensitivecustomers the lighting was low the clientele incurious and the atmosphere very soothing to the nerves of gentlemen who might otherwise have second thoughts about working with orm not that orm appeared to be anything other than a gentleman himselfbut if he had insisted on meeting his customers in a place only scoundrels frequented those customers would naturally assume that orm belonged among them so long as we appear respectable in all ways the polite fiction of appearance is maintained as if that thought had been a magic spell to summon him one of those gentlemen entered the door of the tavern along with a few flurries from the light snowstorm outside as the flakes settled to the wooden floor and melted the gentleman peered around the tavern until he spotted orm at his usual seat and in his usual posture he made no sign of recognition but he did move straight to that corner booth intercepting a serving wench on the way to place his order orm noted with satisfaction that the young man bore a roll of paper in his hand good one more section of the dukes maps rand will be pleased greetings friend orm said lazily paying no outward attention to the rolledup document youre just in time to join me for luncheon always a pleasure since you pay replied the fellow as he slid into place opposite orm and placed the map on the table against the wall ridiculously thin the young man resembled nothing so much as a normal man who had somehow been stretched an extra few inches lengthwise even his face had the oddly disconcerting proportions of a normal face that had been elongated he clearly had difficulty in finding clothing that fit his sleeves ended above his bony wrists and his breeches exposed the ankles of his boots his fingers were stained with ink in the manner of all clerks and he squinted as if he was a little shortsighted orm chuckled the pleasure is mine both for the sake of your company and the opportunity to reward one of good duke ardens hardworking clerks you gentlemen earn little enough for your efforts that a good citizen should feel obligated to treat you now and again the scrawny young man grinned as the wench brought his meal and orms i wish more of the good citizens of kingsford felt the way you do he said then wasted no more words as he dug into a portion of exquisitely seasoned oysters orm never stinted his gentlemen especially clerks who were usually perpetually hungry every meal was a full one beginning with appetizers and ending with a fine dessert orm knew that men with a good meal in their stomachs were ready to please the person who arranged for that meal to be there a full stomach makes for poor bargaining the young clerk and orm continued to exchange pleasantries as their meal progressed just as the others in this room were doing at some point during the progress of the meal several silver coins made up in a paper packet found their way beneath the basket of delectable yeast rolls at another point they vanished againand an intelligent deduction could be made that they vanished into the clerks capacious pockets since orm didnt reclaim them but no one could actually claim to have seen the coins change hands at no time during the meal did either of them refer to the coins or to the rolledup map nor did orm ever refer again to the fact that his companion was in the dukes service but when the young man stood up after finishing the last morsel of a bowl of bilberry trifle smothered in brandy and whipped cream and took his leave he left behind the map and his beltpouch bulged a little more than it had when he arrived orms own meal had been lighter than his companions and he lingered over his own dessert and over the mug of black tea that ended his meal only when enough time had passed that the tables nearest him held different customers than they had when the young man arrived did he casually pick up the roll of paper and carry it away with him once outside the door of the inn he waited while his eyes adjusted to the thin gray light he stood in the street out of the way of traffic as the continuing snowfall dusted the shoulders of his coat with white to anyone watching it would look as if he was debating his direction then with no sign of hurry he tucked his map under his arm and strolled off towards old town and the house he had rented old town was all of kingsford that had not burned in the great fire the fire itself had been no respecter of rank and had eaten as much into the sections housing the wealthy as into the sections housing those of middling fortune only the poor had suffered complete devastation which was hardly surprising considering that most of the homes of the poor had been and were again poorlybuilt firetraps but enough time had passed now that there was no longer a shortage of housing in fact in some places there was a surplus there were now segments of old town where one could rent modest homes for modest fees and that was becoming easier all the time the reason was simple as more new homes were constructed the older ones became less desirable the owners of those modestbut olderhomes had often capitalized on the shortage of livingspace by renting out as much of their dwellings as they could spare with the resultant added wear and tear that was only to be expected when strangers moved into a dwelling they had no vested interest in keeping up now the owners of such houses coveted a place with more space in a better neighborhood with more of the modern conveniences and they had the means put by to begin building a new homerenting the entirety of their current abode made the acquisition of such a property much easier so long as the tenantlooked respectable and paid down the requisite sum most such absent landlords saw no reason to be curious orm had counted on this when his employer rand decreed that it was time for them to move their operations to kingsford it had not taken orm very long to find the perfect house for them orm had further plans for the place if rand decided to stay here it might even be possible to purchase the property outright it would all depend on what rand wanted of course rand was the one with the money orm merely spent it for him that genteel little house looked exactly like its neighbors in the row tall narrow houses made of pale brown stone with gabled slatecovered roofs with passages between them too small for most muscular men to squeeze through out of habit orm did not enter the dwelling from the streetentrance instead he went around to the end of the block and slipped into the alley when no one was looking entering his own house like a thief through a window at the rear it was good to stay in practice although orm hadnt stolen anything in years it was wise to keep the old skills up rand wasnt around which didnt surprise orm in the least he was probably out celebrating the senses as he called it he always did that when his curse left him and he was able to walk the streets unremarked orm was in no hurry for that condition to become permanent for now rand needed him and his skills and paid well for them if rand ever became normal again he would no longer require orm until orm amassed enough wealth thathe no longer needed rand orm would prefer that the curse remain intact the twostory rented house was divided into two suites each one comprising an entire floor linked only by a staircase at the front orm had the ground floor and rand the second orm seldom entered his employers domain unless as now he had something to leave there whistling cheerfully he stepped into the unheated foyer at the front of the dwelling and climbed the stair leading off the tiny room to the second level at the top of the staircase was a door usually left locked unlocking the door which led directly into the first room of the suite he stepped just far enough inside to lay the rolled map down on rands empty desk he never went farther than this unless rand himself was here and that was not just because he respected rands wishes for privacy orms employer was a mage and mages had very unpleasant means of enforcing their desires besides there was nothing in rands suite that orm was at all interested in he already knew everything he needed to know about rand himself and rand had no information orm was at all interested in although rand had several sources of wealth orm was not tempted to steal from him either stealing from rand would be as unproductive as draining a pond to get the fish left alone rand would be the source of far more wealth to orm than he would be if orm was foolish enough to steal and run so leaving the new map in plain sight orm descended the stairs to his own cozy den rand would return soon enough and orm would reap the pleasant results orm built up the fire in the stove he had instead of a fireplace and settled into a chair at his desk beside it with a pen and a ledger although orm had begun his professional life as a thief and had in the course of things been forced to injure or even kill he was now for the most part in the less risky business of buying and selling information and expediting though not carrying out the plans of others rand was not his only client although all of orms other commissions were of strictly limited scope rand had been orms chief concern since they met in a tiny village many leagues and months ago since that day orm devoted his time and energy to rand and rand paid him handsomely for information for personal services and to ensure rands safety and security rand needed someone to take care of even the tiniest tasks for him because rand was generally not human rand particularly needed orm now that they were operating in the city although orm was not a native of kingsford he was quite familiar with both old town and new rand only knew kingsford as it had been before the great fire and as a result was frequently disoriented when he went abroad in the streets this had frustrated him to the point of fury and orm had been trying though with little success to draw diagrams of the city as it was now then when orm had learned that a birdman in the service of the duke was making detailed and highly accurate maps of the city he had moved heaven and earth to find a clerk who could be bribed to supply him with ongoing copies to the clerk he was an enterprising merchant looking for the best spots to place friedpie stalls the clerk found nothing amiss in this a merchant prepared to put money into a large number of friedpie stalls could stand to make a fortune or lose one depending on whether he found good locations or poor ones vendors of foodstuffs had been operating from barrows since the great fire precisely because no one knew yet where the good locations werebut that meant that there was no such thing anymore as a place that people could patronize regularly other than an inn the first person to capitalize on this situation could find himself a very wealthy man and it would be more than worth his while to bribe a clerk for advance copies of the new city maps rand had been very pleased when orm presented him with the first of his new maps pleased enough to make orms reward a golden one even though the map was of an area that rand would not be able to use at least not effectively the mage rightly considered the reward to be one for initiative rather than immediate services rendered and had brooded over his acquisition with his strange eyes halfclosed in pleasure he would not have been nearly so pleased if hed known that orm knew why he was going to want those mapsknew why he had wanted to come to kingsford in the first placeknew what hisreal name was its really very amusing actuallyorm thought as he finished the last of his little notes and sat back in his chair listening for the sound of rands footsteps on the walk outsidehes quite quite naive to think that he really believed that since i was not a native of kingsford i would not have recognized him for what he was perhaps it was only that it never occurred to him that his employee would turn his considerable skills to ferreting out everything he could about his new employer perhaps it was that he completely underestimated the ability of the free bards to spread information in the form of songs and overestimated the ability of the bardic guild to suppress it when they tried or perhaps it was that he simply had no idea how good a tale the story of the foul deeds and punishment of priest revaner was very singablethough that shouldnt be surprising considering it was composed by the free bard they call master wren oh orm knew all about his employermore than was in the song for there were still plenty of people in kingsford who knew the story in its entirety and even a handful who had seen the end of it themselves those acrobats for instance once they had reached kingsford orm had made it a part of his business to sniff out those who had actually been witnesses to the tale of priest revaneror as master wren titled it the faithless priest now he knew just about everything there was to know including a few secrets known only to revaners fellow priests for even a priest likes to talk priestmage revaner of the kingsford order of saint almon had often claimed that he never wanted to be a priest he had felt himself restricted by the rules of his order his vows before god and the constraints associated with being a priest in the first placemost notably celibacy and chastity but also poverty and humility orm personally didnt see where he had anything to complain aboutpresumably he should have known those rules before he ever took his final vowsbut it hardly mattered the fact was that revaner wanted many things wealth for oneand that state was attainable only to those of sufficiently high office even then it was wealth that in the end belonged to the church and not to the priest and that wasnt good enough for revaner so priest revaner had set about using or misusing his magics to help him gain wealth and hide it away from the prying eyes of his superiors so much for that obstacle and although it chafed him the virtue of humility was easy enough to feign celibacy while irksome was constricting only in that it meant he could not attain further wealth and the position he had not been born into through marriage but chastitythere was a problem revaner craved women but not just any women his women had to be subservient to him in every way since he did not consider himself to be particularly impeded by his other vows the vow of chastity made no difference to his desires unfortunately confined to the abbey cloister it was difficult to get away for long to indulge himself and impossible to bring a woman there but when faire season came he saw a possible answer to his problems for a few weeks at least so with a little judicious bribery a bit of flattery and cultivation of one of the masters of the bardic guild he got himself assigned as a faire warden patrolling for unlawful use of magic for the duration of the faire that much had orms admiration clever that he had his own tent on the grounds of the faire and he knew that on his watch the only person who would have been checking for magic was himself revaner saw the faire as his own private huntingpreserve a place where he could indulge himself in ways he had only dreamed of before he had his own private tent and servants whose minds were so controlled by magic that they never saw anything he didnt want them to see his duty only lasted from the time the faire opened in the morning until sunset and mostly consisted of walking about the faire searching for the signs of magic and while he was doing that he was marking women for further attentions thus combining duty with pleasure orm rather fancied that revaner had assumed that as long as he confined his attentions to those technically outside church protectiongypsies for instance or other folk who did not consider themselves churchmenhis victims would never dare report him to church authorities for the most part he would have been right there arent very many pagans or gypsies who would trust the church to police its own and those who had turned from worship of the sacrificed god to some other deity would be afraid of being taken and punished as heretics complaints against a priest to secular authorities would be turned over to the church and where would they be then revaner had used his magic to coerce women who didnt cooperate with himwhich was another violation of secular law twice over first for using coercion inside the faire boundaries and secondly for using magic as the instrument of coercion then there was the violation of church law in using his powers and his position to further his own ends altogether he was a very naughty boy revaner had enjoyed himself to the fullest with nothing more than merest rumor to alert his superiors to the fact that he was a lawbreaker so many times over that he would be doing penance until he died if he was caught the blatant misuse of everything the church gave him would have had even the most corrupt of them livid not to mention the amount of keepquiet money they would have had to pay to his victims they did not even knowwho the cause of the rumor was he had managed to keep his identity secret but he had already made one fatal error and that had been when he had checked to see who the prior of the abbey of the justiciars at kingsford was without also making the effort to discover who his underlings were the prior was lazy and subject to a venial sin now and then of his ownbut immediately beneath him in rank was justiciarmage ardis already known for dispensing the purest justice without regard for rank privilege or station and it was ardis who was truly in charge of the faire judiciary then after three weeks of enjoyment revaner had made his second fatal error he had approached a gypsy free bard named robin and was rebuffed publicly vehemently and in such a way as led to a great deal of humiliation on his part and amusement on that of the witnesses but his success had bred overconfidence and inflated his pride and his pride would not tolerate such a blow obsessed with the girl and angered at her contemptuous refusal he had conspired with a guild bard named beltren one of his cronies to kidnap her even that might only have earned him exile to some distant ascetic abbey in a harsh and unforgiving climate constant penance and prayer and perpetual confinement to his cell if he had been caughtbut his pride was too high to merely use her and discard her no he had to triumph over her and keep her as a private trophy he had used his magic to transform her into a mansized bird of gaudy plumage placed her in a cage and compelled her with further spells to sing for his pleasure then he displayed her for all the faire to see pride and folly went hand in hand and he was bound to fall over such a blatantly stupid action revaner was found out of course and he was condemned by the justiciars to the same condition he had forced upon the gypsy girl transformed into a black bird of amazing ugliness he was displayed in a cage above the gate of the abbey as an example to others and since he was a bird without access to his wealth his connections or his persuasive tongue no one was tempted to try to defend him when fall came that year he was taken down and lodged in a cell in the abbey until the warmer weather arrived in larger if not more luxurious quarters but when spring came it was easier to keep him there instead of putting him back on display eventually he became a fixture in the abbey gaol then came the great fire and the revolt within the abbey itself and presumably during the confusion or perhaps out of misguided compassion someone left the cage door open and the bird escaped the gypsy transformed into a bird had not been able to fly but even as a bird revaner was still a mage and he could use his magic to aid his wings he had put as much distance between himself and kingsford as possible ending up at last in sandast a tradecity situated below a cliff riddled with caves there revaner had made a home stole food and attempted to work out how to change himself back that much orm had managed to reason out for himself what he didnt know was how revaner had learned that the key to transforming himself back to a man was the death of someone else and it was the one thing that he was not likely to ever find out there were only two people who had ever known that and revaners first victim was the second short of bringing back the dead spirit to speak orm was unlikely to discover what the circumstance had been orm had recently removed himself to sandast from the vicinity of kingsford until a certain party returned to his homeland a business deal had gone awry and it wasnt particularly healthy for orm to linger in the vicinity of duke ardens city although his original customer was no longer available it had occurred to orm that the information he possessed could easily be sold elsewhere sandast for instance and it was in the course of trying to find a buyer for that information that he had come upon revaner in the moment of his third attempt at transformation now there had been rumors of a madman stalking the streets at night and murdering unwary victims by driving an enormous spike or spear through their chests but orm had dismissed it after all such a person would hardly be inconspicuous loping about with a spike the size of a small tree trunk over his shoulder so when his search for a client took him out into the dense fog of a typical sandast evening he wasnt particularly worried about coming across anything worse than a pickpocket or backalley assaultist either of which he could handle easily not until he rounded a corner and found himself in a dimly lit culdesac facing a scene out of nightmare filtered light fell down from windows above onto the murderer and his latest victim and the murderer was a great dealmore conspicuous than a madman with a spike a huge black bird with the body of a streetsinger impaled on its lancelike beak glared at orm out of angry red eyes blood was everywhere turning the dust of the street into red mud plastering the feathers of the bird in sticky tufts splattered against the peeling walls of the buildings surrounding the culdesac orm had been so startled and sofascinated that instead of running he had simply stood and stared and so he had the unique experience of watching the bird transform into a blackrobed man or rathertry to watch it do so for there was something about the transformation that made his eyes hurt and his stomach churn as if whatever was going on was not meant to bewatched he looked away for a moment and when he looked back there was a man in the black robes of a priest standing over the body of the girl the man was unarmed but orm did not for a moment assume that he was helpless the very opposite in fact so he did the only thing logical under the circumstances well you seem to have a situation on your hands i believe you can use my help he had said as calmly as if the man had just walked into an inn looking for him would you care to come with me to my quarters where we can discuss it whether it was due to revaners own desperation or orms glib tongue revaner engaged his services on the spot revaner still had most of his money and a great deal of it all deposited with the goldsmiths guild and thus accessible to him any time he cared to write out the proper papers to get it but when it took seven days to get the money and he was able to remain in human form for considerably less than that well he had a problem to say the least in the first few days of their partnership orms role had been a simple one he got a suite of rooms with windows overlooking a bare courtyard used for storage so that revaneror rand as he now called himselfcould come and go at his leisure when he was a bird orm made certain that all of rands physical needs were cared for both as a bird and as a man but rands period as a human did not last more than three days and when he transformed he was nearly beside himself with rage orm let him rage for there was nothing much in his room he could damage and waited for him to calmor at least to exhaust himself randasbird had learned how to speak although his gypsy captive had not had the time to master that art so when he finally stopped stabbing holes in the bedlinens orm ventured a few words this is hardly a surprise he had pointed out you knew you were going to revert eventually the birds voice was a harsh croak unpleasant but understandable not sosoon rand protested and made another stab at a pillow white feathers flew out of the hole and orm shook his head but it held for longer this time than the last orm replied you told me the last time it only held for two days things are improving rand tossed the pillow aside with a savage twist of his head scattering more feathers across the floor as it landed it should have been longer he muttered it should have beenpermanent orm shrugged and spread his hands im no mage he replied but this is the most powerful piece of magic that i have everheard of outside an elf hilland cast by aa mage that powerful i cant imagine how three paltry deaths could negate anything likethis he had caught himself for a moment realizing that he had been about to say something about a spell cast by a justiciarmage and even though he hadnt actually said anything incriminating he caught rand giving him a suspicious look out of those rubyred eyes it occurred to him that rand might well consider him expendable at that moment and he hastened to deal with that contingency its obvious to me that if each death lengthens the time you are he chose his word delicately curedyou simply have to find more victims the trouble with that is obvious already people in this little town are beginning to talk and its only a matter of time before someone has the bright idea of starting a housetohouse search granted youcould fly away during the search but you wouldnt be able to pick your moment to fly and what if someone saw you and made the obvious conclusion you clearly need more sacrifices but you simply cannot stay here and keep killing people so what am i to do rasped rand move somewhere else and kill people why not orm countered ican move you comfortablywell more comfortably than flying all that distance i can find you safe quarters i can stand watch for youi can even find potential victims for you but i think you ought to find a safer way of doing your killings a way in which youre less likely to be caught in the act its already happened once and you were just lucky that it was me and not a constable who discovered you think about life in the long termwe dont have to stay in once place we can move on when things become risky think about what you need to accomplish instead of frantically slaughtering in the hopes that this time something will work never before or since had he seen such a transformation come over a creature rand went from a creature dangerously enraged and making no effort to hide that fact to one suddenly locked in thought literally locked in thoughtrand went rigid and his eyes unfocused silence prevailed for some time but orm was in no hurry to leave so he waited the creature out he had he thought just proved to rand that his services were indispensable rand had a great deal of ready cash and orm wanted as much of that money transferred to himself as possible he also wanted to continue living and he was under no illusions about his continued existence if rand decided to get rid of him this of course was not the first time he had found himself in that position a man who sells information often comes into possession of knowledge that others would rather he didnt know and sometimes those others are willing to take drastic steps to ensure that the information is lost again orm had always saved himself in the past by proving that it was more expensive to eliminate him than to purchase his cooperation and he was fairly certain he could do the same thing this time finally rand shook all of his shabby drab feathers and fastened his gaze on his wouldbe partner you are right the bird croaked and i want to think about this for a while i have been very shortsighted until this moment in that case orm had said rising and making a little bow i shall leave you in peace to think he knew then that he was safe for rand had spoken the key wordshortsighted rand had just made the jump from thinking only about the immediate need of becoming and staying human and had moved on to other desires as well and a man who looked as rand did probably had a major desire driving him revengeorm loved that motive it was one of his most profitable revenge was complicated and expensive it involved elaborate plots and a great deal of planning and given that rand would probably want revenge on at least one person moderately difficult to findwell the possibilities for profit were staggering rand made several requests of orm over the next couple of weeks with the most difficult being the acquisition of an ecclesiastical dagger rand had probably intended for orm to steal one but orm had no intentions of leaving that kind of trail for the church to follow it wouldnt be too difficult for church mages to put the theft of a piece of regalia of that sort together with a murder by means of that kind of weaponand orm had the suspicion they might be able to tell who had taken it and what had been done with it instead he broke into a chapel all right but when he found one of the daggers he only studied it the next day he purchased a triangular file of approximately the correct dimensions broke into a smithy whose owner was out of town and ground it into a similar knifeblade himself since the new knife already had a wooden hilt of sorts orm had judged that it would do when he brought it to rand the creature studied the offering closely then clacked his beak in a way that orm had come to learn signified his approval very clever and usable for the first attempt anyway the bird croaked we may have to do something else next time but this will do nowi want you to find me two people rand outlined the kind of victim orm had already assumed he would want female a musiciana gypsy or a free bard by preference but any musician or dancer would do so long as she was female but he also wanted aman someone who might plausibly pick up the clumsy knife that orm had constructed at least for a moment orm already had a few candidates for the first position but the second was something of a puzzle for him in the end he chose a petty tough with a penchant for knives the man couldnt resist a blade no matter how clumsy or poorly made and once he had one he could be counted upon to carry it with him if the man ever fell into the river hed sink to the bottom from the weight of steel he carried rand made the final selection of the girl and gleefully chose a wench who at least wore the ribbons of a free bard though orm privately suspected that if any real musician heard her sing theyd demand the ribbons back too much drinking and other abuses of her own body had taken a heavy toll of her voice mind and musical talents all of her songs sounded alike and all of them were similar in theme as well she fancied the company of people precisely like that young streettough perhaps for the thrill of association although she claimed that they gave her ideas for more of her songs bitter uncertain of temper aggressive and yet cowardly she made trouble just for the sake of seeing what happened orm privately considered that he would be doing the world a favor in helping to rid it of the illnatured creature orm got the blade into the hands of the streettough as rand requested only then did he hear the rest of the plan well be using the knife for the killing rather than this beak ive been cursed with for the moment dont worry abouthow ill explain that in a moment you seem to know enough about magic to know that mages can read where objects have been and you were probably wondering how i intended to deal with the traces ofyour personality that you left on that knife as well as the magic that i shall imbue it with randthebird rasped smugly as he cocked his oilsheened head to the side to gauge orms reactions its simple really after the woman is deadyou move in and steal the knife before anyone else can touch it rand had probably expected orm to put up a strenuous objection to this orm just waited for the details rand wouldnt have tried to shock him with this if he didnt have a damned clever plan to avoid the two of them getting caught orm had been correct in his assumption rand did have a damned clever plan and the more he outlined the more at ease orm became rand knew what a justiciarmage could and could not do as well he should and he had planned for everything i use the knife to gain control of the streetthugs body rand explained carefully once i have done that i use him to murder the woman then i have him throw the knife away which is when you will look for it and carry it off bringing it back to me when that is done i have the man throw himself into the river as a suicide the very few traces of magic contamination will be washed off in running water this will look like a simple crime of passion or a robbery gone awry and no one will think that this is anything out of the ordinary people are murdered all the time in an area like the one these two frequent you take control of him orm had asked fascinated in spite of himself how if rand had possessed such a thing as an eyebrow he might have raised it sardonically it is a great deal more simple that you would think rand had replied assuming the manner of a vulture the wicked bird chuckled harshly an odd sort of crow and fluffed his feathers orm had laughed softly with delight this was the kind of clever scheme he enjoyed the most and when rand detailed just how he would control the bodies he gave the mage credit for even more cleverness than before the only unanswered question was why rand didnt suggest that after orm stole the knife he get rid of it elsewhere orm had a suspicion that rand wanted it for personal reasons that was perfectly acceptable to orm and orm planned from the beginning to see that the knives rand used were clean of even the slightest trace of blood before he ever turned them over to his employer blood could also be used to mark a trail for a mage hunting a murderer but if there was no blood there would be no way to follow the path of the knife it had all followed just as rand had wished from the first killing to the last orm would find several possible victims and rand would watch them stalking them in either human or avian form when he had chosen who he wanted if he had not already reverted to birdshape he would wait until he had done so while orm made a note of every movement of their days finding places and times where it would be easy to ambush them orm would construct the knife then find a way to get the knife into the hands of the man often commissioning a hilt to suit the victim but always making the blade from a triangular file so that there would be no trace of where it came from he was no fool sooner or later someone would begin to notice that there were strange murdersuicides committed with a very odd weapon and he didnt want any smiths recalling the fellow who had asked for triangular blades when everything was in place rand would follow the first victim and take him over then make his kill when their activities began to draw the attention of constables or other people in positions of authority they moved on before the civil authorities could begin a real investigation in small towns and villages they would move after only a single death in larger they might take four or five victims before judging it prudent to move to the next venue occasionally circumstances would permit rand to enjoy a lingering and elaborate ritual of mutilation of his primary victimthis of course increased the anguish of his secondary victim almost as much rand relished these opportunities although they were few and looked forward with anticipation to opportunities for more such rand kept with him a growing collection of knives and he would take them out to gloat over them as soon as they were established in their new home orm had a secret of his own which he had no intention of sharing with the mage he enjoyed watching the murders it gave him all of the pleasure with none of the risk and the moment he got his hands on the blades that did the deed he experienced a thrill that was almost as good as being with a woman he wondered sometimes if rand felt the same well whether he did or not each successive victim allowed him to spend time as a human being again although how much time varied from victim to victim the best had been the jeweler and the gypsy both for orm and for rand once the girl had been pegged down to the worktable rand had made the jeweler let them in and they had both watched every step of the proceedings when the girl was dead and the man had drunk every drop of caustic chemicals in his workshop it had been orm who dragged the body beneath the waterbarrel and let the water flow over him erasing the taint of magic that was on him the beautifully jeweled knife had been sold to him by a thief who had in his turn stolen it from ormcareful study had shown that at least half the jewelers income had come from the purchase of stolen property and the sale of the component parts orm himself had directed the gypsy to that jeweler on the fatal night after seeing to it that the clasp of her belt of copper coins was broken past amateur repair rand had stayed human for an entire week after that some of the murders had gone slightly awry which was inevitable considering the neighborhoods in which they were operating twice the knife was stolen by someone else before it could be used on its intended victim and a new victim of opportunity had to be foundrand had hated that but there was nothing to be done about it if he wanted to take on human form again but on the whole things were going entirely to plan or to the plan as orm knew it he suspected that rand had some specific goal in mind which was likely to be the murder of the justiciarmage who had put him in the form he now wore a few wenches more or less wouldnt cause an authority to issue an allout manhunt but the murder of a high bishop would bring out every hound of god every constable and every private guard until the killer was caught too risky far too risky if that was the case orm had plans of his own once the deed was done the knife wouldnot be stolen and carried away because orm would not be there rand was so busy controlling his victims that he had no time to watch for orm and on this final occasion orm would be elsewhere possibly even on a horse on his way out of kingsford this would neatly circumvent the problems that would arise when his employer no longer needed his services once rand was caught and punished orm would be free to return and take up his old profession again the very construction of this house would make it possible for orm to claim that he had no idea that the other tenant of the place had been up to no good no matter what claims rand madefor although the suites did share the common entrance that wasall that they shared orm would be shocked and appalled professing horror and relief that he himself had escaped the fate of so many he would express the opinion that a man mad enough to murder so many people was mad enough to claim anything including the idea that his innocent fellow tenant had a hand in the evil deeds and as for how many victims the madman had claimedwell the collection of blades in rands bedroom would serve as mute testimony so powerful that the justiciars would need to look no further for their killer a light tap on his door alerted him to the fact that rand was home again and he went to answer it no one but rand ever knocked on his door none of his other clients knew where he lived as he expected rand was standing at his door impatiently tapping a foot did you get it rand asked in lieu of a greeting he was probably a handsome man in his human form though orms taste more mundanely ran to women his body was kept in perfect physical shape by the exertion of flying in his avian form his features were regular and almost aggressively masculine although he no longer wore the black robes of a priest he continued to favor black clothing it seemed that when he transformed whatever he was wearing became his feathers and a black bird was less conspicuous than any other color its in your room orm replied and rand smiled in a way that had very little to do with good humor at least he transformed immediately this timerands birdform made orm feel a little queasy although he managed to hide his reactions and he was always very well aware of the deadly potential of those claws and that spearlike beak well how did it go did anyone see you rand continued without bothering to thank orm for what orm considered to be a very neat little bit of theft he had plucked the knife literally out of the gutter with at least a dozen people around him looking for it as well no one saw me he said restraining his irritation the birdman set off after your man and everyone was watching the birdman they never even noticed i was there much less saw me taking the blade good with an abrupt nod rand turned on his heel and went up the steps to his own rooms leaving orm standing in his own doorway like a dismissed servant his breath steaming out into the icy foyer orm repressed more irritation and simply closed his door he reminded himself that rand had been a highranking priest and a wealthy man with servants who were accustomed to being ordered about like deliambren automata rand would never change and that was that stillhe grumbled a little as he threw the latch on the door it would be nice to be appreciated for good work once in a whileit annoyed and sometimes angered him to be treated like a scullerymaid but then again if he suspected how clever i am he might be more wary of me and more inclined to get rid of me i am a convenience he reminded himself he is used to having me around to do his work for him but now he could be rid of me without harm if he chose all he needs me for is to steal the daggers and he could hire a petty pickpocket to do that for him given thatperhaps it wasnt so bad to be dismissed orm went back to his chair before the fire settled in with his feet near the grate and considered his actions for the rest of the day and eveningi should go down to the purple eel he decidedby sunset every constable not on duty will have heard what happened and all of the ones in that district will be there to flap their mouths over it this was an easy way to discover what the constables knew and what they didnt and orm had used it in every city theyd worked so far orm had been a constable himself for about a year in between being a thief and becoming a broker of information he had come very near to being caught after a theft that had resulted in the death of his victim and had decided to learn how the constables themselves thought and reasoned so that he would know what they were likely to do in a given situation and assess the risks of a given action in an instant as a result he was able to pretty well anticipate every move that the constables made so long as he knew how much information they had it did bother him that the murder victims were always women of a particular type that was a pattern and patterns made them vulnerable if the particular women rand insisted on ever took this seriously enough to start staying off the streets altogether rand would either have to pursue them insidewhich was very very dangerousor choose another type of victim knowing rand it wouldnt be the latter he was brilliant but obsessed and quite insane more than that although it hadnt yet occurred to them the constablescould set up a trap for them by using a seemingly ideal victim as bait of course that would mean setting her up in such a way that neither rand nor orm detected the trap which would mean that her behavior would have to be perfectly consistent for several days and that in turn would mean either that the constables were able to deduce that these werenot victims of opportunity or that the constables planned to set up a trap around a streetgirl who was unaware that she was being used as bait the former wasnt likely he decided for the most part he had been very careful to select potential victims that no one cared about the closest they had ever come to getting caught was that obsessive fellow a few towns backand he had been working alone without the cooperation of the constabulary officials as for the latterwell there were hundreds if not thousands of potential choices in kingsford and the chance that the constables would select exactly the same one as orm and rand was minimal but i should listen for such a plan he decided the purple eel is definitely the place to go tonight but he was loathe to leave his chair just now hed gotten horribly cold out there waiting for rand to make his move before he went out again he wanted to be warmed down to the bone he thought back once again over the last set of murders and could see no flaws in them most murders not committed for gain were committed by people who knew the victims often very wellmost often relatives orm made very certain that no one ever connected him with the recipients of the knives generally finding ways of getting the blades into the chosen hands indirectly as he had with the jeweler the only pattern was in the women and none of them wereever seen near much less with orm rand would be unbearable this evening exulting in his stolen power and his new form but by tomorrow he would be pleasant enough if overbearing that was the pattern and orm was used to it therewould be a generous reward for a successful hunt as rand termed the murders and as soon as rand calmed down from the intoxication of success he would want to know who orm had singled out for the next prey orm of course would have his list and rand would be very pleased which would make him generous its too bad hes so obsessed orm thought idly if he didnt mind spending time in that birdform he would make a good thief as soon as it got warm and people in the fine houses began opening their windows at night for fresh air he could nip in snatch up jewelrycases and fly out without anyone ever knowing hed been there well that was not likely to happen rand wanted to break his spell entirely which is probably a very good reason why he would like to choose high bishop ardis as a victim not only is she female not only is she the direct cause of him being the way he is but she cast the spell in the first place not only would he gain revenge but since shes the mage involved the only way to break the spell might be to kill the caster i hope he doesnt think of that he sighed it was a pity that rand couldnt be more content with life as it washe wouldnt mind spending about half his time as a bird think of all the things he could overhear perched in the shadow of chimneys or lurking in the branches of trees in private gardenslistening outside windows or on balconies too bad but things arent going to change and i need to start for the purple eel he decided getting reluctantly up from his armchair all of his brilliance and my cleverness arent going to help if someones got an unexpected card up his sleeve you couldnt plan for the unexpected but you could prepare your mind to deal with it that was orms motto and he went out into the dusk to make good on it chapter nine ardis tal and kayne sat in ardiss office with the door locked and a guard posted to ensure that no one disturbed them unless it was a lifeordeath emergency ardis had finally gotten the last of her information some came from the farthest town with murders that matched the pattern and more detailed information arrived from master wren her cousin she also had something that tal would never have access to the records from the confessional for all of the victimsor at least all of those that attended confession rather surprisingly a majority of them had and she now possessed detailed glimpses into their personalities im going to try something different this time she said to the other two instead of trying to deduce anything more directly about the murderer i want to look at his victims and come up with more information about him based on what they were like and i want to start from the negativewhat those victimsarent kayne looked alert and thoughtful but it was tal who spoke first rich tal said promptly or even moderately welloff im talking about the women of course but only one of the men was what you would call rich and that was the last onethe first one we know about in kingsford the rest were never better off monetarily than working tradesmen they arent whores either in fact most of them would have been insulted if you suggested they were kayne put in as ardis noted that the word whore slid off her tongue without eliciting so much as a blush which was in itself an interesting development there are more whores in any town or city than there are street musicians so hes really having to make an effort to find them ardis nodded for that agreed with the information she had when she had been able to find the female victims in the confessional records they had been honest musicians who left paid love to the professionals what about the men she asked tal scratched his head there you have me he admitted they dont match a pattern not even close theyre all kinds now was the time to spring her surprise until you look in here she tapped the folder of records i have access to certain confidential records i cant letyou look at them but what i see shows at least one pattern which is that our murderer worked very cautiously at first oh tal said skeptically he doesnt seem all that cautious to me the men who attacked women in the open in daylight in front of witnesses are all recent i think hes gotten bolder with success she placed her palm on top of the folder now the others the ones that occurred in the street at night under cover or even under the protection of a roofthats where im seeing a pattern the men all confessed to sins of the flesh and preferred lightsoflove who at least pretended to be musicians if at all possible they wanted a mistress even for an hour who was more than just a whore it made them feel as if they had discernment and taste according to what i read here interesting tal chewed his lower lip so what we have is a man who is likely to be out in the street in the first place and equally likely to accost women who are acting like musicians to see if they might have otherahtalentshe blushed which was interesting it was unlikely he felt embarrassment on his own behalf so it was probably because he was in kaynes presenceor hers so the question is why go to all this trouble to pick that kind of victim so that he wouldnt break a pattern of behavior and alert the neighbors or the family that there was something wrong kayne declared her head up but tal shook his head not logical most of the murders took place too quickly it wouldnt matter if the neighbors saw something just before that made them think there was something wrong with the man i still dont think there was a pattern there or a reasonunless he paused as if struck by a thought unless what ardis asked he frowned and rubbed one closed eye before replying unless it was a peculiar sort of revenge weve got one theory that hes taking revenge on the girls for being scorned by a female musician but what if hes also taking revenge on the men theyare willing to sleep with thats not a bad thought ardis replied after a moment it has a certain twisted symmetry she considered it for a moment but what about the others where there was no previous contact with streetwomen there was at least one man who had no interest in women whatsoever as i recall tal shrugged i agree with you that there is a pattern of increasing complication and risktaking at first he takes men who have a reason to be alone with women who make their living in the street and women who have a reason to go along with these men this of course keeps him from breaking the established patterns of his male victims which keeps anyone from noticing that there is something wrong there were some cases early on where that isnt true kayne protested tal nodded agreement but those could have been cases where something went wrongeither he couldnt get the kind of victims he wanted or something else interfered and remember all ofthose took place under cover of night and four walls in neighborhoods where no one ever looks to see whats going on if there are cries or screaming in the night ardis couldnt find anything to disagree with yet go on she said what next next is more risk tal told them as kayne frantically scribbled notes he takes longer with the victims mutilating them as well as killing them next he goes out into the street into the open and takes men who are strangers to the women he kills and women who wouldnt normally go off with a stranger unless they thought his purpose completely honest he breaks the patterns of the lives of his male victims but hes moving quickly enough that even if anyone notices theres something wrong with the man they dont have time to do more than wonder about it thenwe have things like the killing here in broad daylight with a male victim whonever set foot in that part of town who might well have been stopped by a family member or retainer before he had a chance to act on behalf of the murderer a thousand things could have gone wrong for him at that last killing they didnt which only means that either his luck is phenomenal or hes studying his victims with more attention to detail than weve guessed and the jeweler kayne asked ardis shook her head i dont know the jeweler often had women in his home but that doesnt mean that the gypsy girl didnt go there with legitimate business in mind if hes clever he could have manufactured that business tal pointed out gypsies often wear their fortune she could have come to the man with coins to be made into a belt or necklace all hed have to do would be to drop a good handful of silver into her hat and shed be off to the nearest jeweler to have the coins bored and strung before she lost them a good point ardis said with a little surprise since it wasnt a possibility shed have thought of but what else do the victimsall have in common tal made a sour face theyare people no one will miss the fact is all of his male victims were such that even if they did things that were out of character no one would care enough to stop them until it was too late even their relatives dont pay any attention to them until theyre dead and the way of their death is a disgrace to the family even then they seem relieved that the man himself is no longer around to make further trouble for them ardis smiled sardonically you caught that did you she asked referring to the behavior of the young dandys parents when she had questioned them tal nodded and so did kayne so we can assume that these men the secondary victims are people who would not question the origin of a stray knife that came into their hands especially if they had any reason to believe that it was stolen she raised an eyebrow inviting comment and once again the other two nodded they would simply take the object especially if it appeared valuable they would most probably keep it on their persons tal held up a finger and at her nod added a correction all but one or twoi think the knifegrinder i saw had been given the knife to sharpen and its possible the jeweler was brought the knife to repair some damage to the hilt in both those cases the men were perfectly innocent of everything but id say it was more than possible in a couple of cases that the men who had the knife actually stole it themselves tal told her and that may account for a couple of the victims where the connection with music is so tenuous it might as well not be there he took what he could get in those cases in other words ardis made a note of that on the side of a couple of the dubious cases that argues for a couple of things either there is only one knife that isnt right unless hes changing the hilt tal interrupted the one i saw didnt look anything like the one visyr saw then in that case it is a very powerful and complicated spell and he cant have it active on more than one weapon at a time ardis made another note to herself suggesting a line of magical research to a mage that is very interesting because it implies a high degree of concentration and skill and one begins to wonder why so powerful a mage isnt in duke ardens court maybe he is kayne began but ardis shook her head theres only one mage in his court and shes one of my fellow justiciars furthermore she hasnt detected anyone casting a spell that requires so much power anywhere in the ducal palace ardis sighed for it seemed to her that the answer was more and more likely to involve a church mage there simply arent that many powerful mages in the human kingdoms outside the church tal grimaced and kayne shook her head it certainly seems to be the direction the hunt is tending she sighed philosophically ardis closed her eyes and told her stomach to calm itself i would much prefer to be able to point a finger at an elf since there are plenty of elves who would gleefully slaughter as many mortals as they could get their hands on but i have been assured that no elf would be able to cast magic on anything made of iron or steel so thats the end of that idea what about other nonhumans tal asked idont think its likely mind you but what about them i dont think its likely either she told both of them any nonhuman is going to be very obvious and a nonhuman mage even more so even if a nonhuman mage didnt practice magic openly hed be conspicuous because he would have to be wealthy he simply wouldnt be able to purchase the privacy he would need to work magic without being wealthy if this justiciarmage can detect the casting of spells in the palace why cant we have mages watching for the casting of magic out in the city tal wanted to know you can see the smoke from a fire in the forest quite clearly but can you pinpoint the smoke from an individual fire in the city ardis countered theres too much else going on out in a large population of humans with as much disruption as there is in kingsford a mage would have to be in the same city block as the caster in order to detect the casting of even a powerful spell have we enough mages in kingsford to try that kayne asked couldnt we station mages around to catch him in the act a reasonable idea but not very practical considering that the priestly mages of kingsford had more demands on their time than they had hours in the day i think we would have better luck trying to find where the knives themselves are coming from ardis said tactfully if hes using more than one someone has to be making them for him there just arent that many missing ecclesiastical knives tal went very quiet at that i didnt know that he said finally id just assumed that hed stolen or found ritual knivesmaybe in secondhand shops or something of the sort but if hes making themthat almost means there has to be more than one person involved ardis felt her stomach turn over again one murderer was bad enoughbuttwo ive had people looking for a maker in kingsford and i cant find any smith wholl admit to making triangularbladed knives oh i wouldnt worry about that too much kayne said with a wave of her hand they dont have to come from kingsford or this kingdom or even a human kingdom any little village smith would do and i bet there are plenty who would he happy to get a job in the winter when people dont need farm equipment mended all he needs to do would be to get a smith somewhere else to take a commission for the finished blades and he can put whatever hilt he wants to on them for that matter he could be rehilting the same knife over and over that would solve the question of why you saw one kind of knife tal and why visyr saw another tal shook his head i dont think so he said firmly i think ive figured out why theyre disappearing when all hed need to do would be to drop them into the river to destroy our ability to trace him from them what hes doing is taking them as his mementos his what kayne asked mementos tal offered an apologetic smile trophies killers like this like to have things to remember their victims by a lock of hair an item of clothing even jewelry it lets them experience the thrill of the murder all over again i know of one man who gave his wife a present of the jewelry hed taken from the woman he killed made a point of asking her to wear it and he said later it was so he could relive the murder i think thats why the knives are disappearing i think our man is collecting them cleaning them and keeping them as trophies he probably has them all mounted on a wall somewhere or done up in a little display case kayne looked a little green thats sick she said in disgust and murdering twenty or thirty women isnt ardis countered feeling certain that tal had uncovered another piece of the puzzle i think tals right i also think that the mage in question is smart enough to wipe not only every vestige of blood off the blade but cleanse it of every glimmer of magic so we cant trace it he may even have shielded the room the knives are in against a trace we could search till we die of old age and never find the daggers kayne gritted her teeth in frustration showing openly what ardis was keeping hidden beneath a veneer of calm you do realize what youre saying we have a murderer who knows as much about the way crimes are traced by way of magic as the constables and justiciarmages do how can we eventry to catch him tal reached out and patted her hand in a very fatherly fashionwhich relieved ardis shed been hoping those blushes werent on kaynes behalf not that tal and kayne would make a bad couple but she lost the thought and didnt care to pursue it we catch him the way constables have always caught clever criminals tal said his calm and even tones belying the tension ardis sensed beneath his stoic surface firstly there are more of us than there are of him secondly hewill make a mistake he may already have done so but we just didnt catch it at the time once he makes one mistake hell make more and the consequences will begin to pile up how can you be so sure of that kayne demanded he rubbed his forehead and shut his eyes while replying its the oddest thing you know he continued in a matteroffact voice as if he was talking about one of his fellow guardsmen rather than a multiple murderer but ive never seen it to fail a clever thief can and will continue to steal all his lifea clever sharpster continue to extract money from the unwary until hes in his grave but a murdererhe may show no signs of remorse at all may even claim that his victims deserved what came to thembut sooner or later he starts to make mistakes that get him caught remorse kayne suggested even if he doesnt realize it could his conscience be manipulating him so that hedoes get caught and pays for what he did tal shook his head i dont think so maybe its contemptwhen he keeps escaping the net he starts to think he doesnt need to work so hard to avoid it maybe its a feeling of invulnerability that we cant catch him however careless he gets after all every bit of evidence thathe gets shows him that we simply cant find him and maybe its god ardis put in quietly tal looked at her with a brief flash of startlement god doesnt often act directly in our lives but when he knows that we are doing all that we are able and are still out of our depth he may choose to give us a little help she felt that she truly did she only hoped that he would see that they were at the end of their resources and grant that help before any more women died i am not going to tell myself that he has reasons for letting those others die however god is not cruel he is not some eternal tormentor and tester they died because they were unlucky or careless and not because god had a purpose for their deaths her special inquisitor looked for a moment as if he was about to challenge her to a theological discussion then his lips twitched a little im not about to argue the point with you high bishop tal said finally he looked for just a moment as if he was going to say something more then just shook his head and remained silent i had better change the subjector rather get it back where it was supposed to bethe way this man treats the tools he takes over is interesting ardis pointed out once hes done with them he discards them immediatelywithin moments of the murder in fact he doesnt have much choice kayne replied oh but he does tal responded instantly at least he does in the cases where hes killed in private i assume he could walk around with that body for as long as he likes but he doesnthe kills his chosen victim then discards the man hes taken he suddenly looked startled i dont suppose we could be dealing with a ghost could we or something like a demon something that can come in and possess the killer ghosts cant place orders for knives ardis pointed out dryly and although im a priest i have to say i truly doubt the existence of demons that can move in and possess someones body she thought about the few cases of socalled possession that had been brought before heruntil people likely to claim possession realized that she was entirely unsympathetic to the idea ivenever seen an authentic possession nor do i know anyone who has sometimes its a simple case of someone being struck with an illness that affects the mind at other times it is all fakery all the accounts of what are supposed to be genuine possessions are at third or fourth handor else the symptoms of possession as described are such that they are clearly hysteria or the clever counterfeit of someone with an agenda of her own to pursue her tal asked wryly ardis shrugged most people claiming to be possessed are female and more often than not young you can read what you like into that kayne snorted with contempt ill read it as fools for pretending and idiots who believe them back to the knives youve said it before and ill repeat it i dont think the shape is an accident but we need to discuss that in depth for a moment there could be a number of reasons for picking that shape tal mused the most logical is that this fellow wants to give the church and its mages a powerful reason not to pursue him too closely there is no doubt that is why the authorities tried to prevent you from investigating back in your city tal ardis told him pleased that her investigation had proved his own suspicions were correct no one wanted to be the one to uncover a killer inside the robes of a priest he could be hoping that a faction of the brotherhood will take him for a vigilante kayne observed after all hes getting rid of people the church doesnt approve of truth to tell ardis ifyou werent the high bishop here i dont know if the justiciars would even consider trying to catch him she pinched the bridge of her nose a moment it makes me wonder if he might not be in the pay of someone who tal asked surprised i dont know the bardic guild maybe kayne hazarded a little wildly theyd just as soon be rid ofevery kind of entertainer that isnt a member of the guild ardis grimaced a madman acting on behalf of the bardic guild im afraid youre reaching a bit too far for that one or being too redundant kayne retorted we dont have sufficient evidence that the killer has a collaborator tal pointed out gently and i dont think ive ever heard of a murderer of this type who had someone working with them kayne made a disparaging face it was a thought thingswould be much easier for him if he had a partner in this these murderers tend to be loners tal replied what youdo hear from the neighbors when its all over is he kept to himself a lot and he was always very quiet my feeling is people like this man are too obsessed with their own desires needs and rituals to want to share them with anyone else frankly ardis said rubbing her thumb and fingers together restlessly i think he has several reasons for what he doeswe dont need to limit him to just one hes obviously intelligent enough to have complex motives as the other two acknowledged that she was probably right she continued i think hes trying to throw confusion into the ranks of church officials and he would get many benefits from doing so he certainly wants to delay pursuit and this is one good way to make sure that cooperation with priestmages will be somewhat less than perfect if he doesnt realize that using a ritual dagger as a murder weapon is likely to causesevere conflict within the church itself id be very surprised and as kayne pointed out there is a substantial minority among the brotherhood that would applaud what hes doingin private if not in public tal looked as if his stomach was giving him as much trouble as ardiss was giving her once word gets around that there are murders being done with a piece of priestly equipment tal said very slowly god help us people in the street will be only too willing to believe in some bizarre secret society sponsored by the church dedicated to murder there is no love lost between the church and gypsies the church and streetwomen or the church and free bards all three of those groups have good reason to think of themselves as persecuted by the church the very people we need to protect most will flee from us in fear and start more rumors kayne added and i cant argue with either of you ardis couldnt just sit anymore she got up and paced back and forth in front of the fireplace keeping a restraining hold on her temper i have worked and sacrificed to make the justiciarsrespected rather than feared and trusted to give absolutely impartial justice to those who were loyal churchmen and those who werent she said fiercely nowthis it feels like a personal attack it cant possibly be ardis kayne soothed swiveling her head to watch ardis pace how could anyone connect you with these murders perhaps they wouldnt directly connect mebut what if the justiciars cant find the murderer ardis asked wont people say that we just werent trying very hard because we knew that the murderer came from our own ranks everything ive built up with the people of kingsford is in jeopardy since neither of the other two could refute that they remained silent but ardis realized that she was being a bad example to both of them she stopped pacing and returned to her chair willing herself to the appearance of calm if not the actual state we considered the least pleasant possibility about the identity of the murderer now lets make it a priority she said grimly we have to do more than allow that this man could be a priest we have to actively pursue the idea tal there is nothing you can do to help us with this so simply continue your investigations as you have been perhaps you will come up with more information that will help us kayne the secretary waited alert as a grayhound waiting to be loosed i want you to undertake another search among church records she said with a tightening of her throat look for priestmages who have been disciplined in the last ten years i cant believe this man has just sprung up out of nowhere i feel certain that he must have been caught at least once kayne grimaced but made the note you are right she agreed a priest whos been disciplined is the one most likely to have a grudge against the churchor at least the church superiors the other thing you might look for is priests whove gone overboard in their chastisement assigning really dreadful penances or the like ardis put the tips of her fingers to both temples and massaged good idea a priest like that wont necessarily get discipline but hell show up in the right recordsand that might point us to someone likely to turn vigilante kayne looked preoccupied as if some of these suggestions were turning up uncomfortable thoughts ive got a third request ardis finished while youre at it you might ask for the records of those who had a history of sexual crimes or violence against womenbefore they entered the priesthood just because we think hes reformed that doesnt mean he has kayne nodded noting all of that down youre probably right in this ardis tal said slowly the signature traits of these crimesive been thinking about the things hehas to have the ones that always appear without exception death by stabbing he flushed so scarlet that ardis was distracted for a moment with amusement go on she told him this israther indelicate tal choked youre a im a priest dear man and ive taken my turn in the confessional with condemned criminals she reminded him there isnt much you can tell me that i havent already heard in one form or another you mentioned stabbingwhich is after all a form of penetration i assume you think this is his form of rapein absentia tal was so red she was afraid he would never be able to speak but he nodded i think so that makes these sexual crimes the knife is the primary part of his signature and the shape may be part of thatfantasy either he hates the church or he views himself as an arm of the churchs vengeance theres nothing in between and in either case a priest would be morefrustrated more likely to choose a knife as the instrument of death and for either we have to look at the brotherhood itself she sighed and felt a headache closing down over her scalp like a tootight cap the second signature element is the sex of the victim which if im right about this goes along with the sexual nature of the murders i have to think that the third element is that the victim preferentially is a musician tal continued his red face slowly fading i know ive said all this before but it was more in the light of speculation than certainty i would stake my life on the fact that no matterhow this man kills people he has to have those three signature elements to be satisfied i wish id seen more of the crime scenes myself or i would know more so look particularly for priests who have had problems with musicians ardis directed her secretary either while in orders or before taking them a thought struck her and she voiced it i wonder if hes a failed musician himself tal nodded now completely back to normal could be particularly if he was obsessed with the idea of being considered a master love and hateadd obsession and you have a nasty little soup if he tried getting into the bardic guild and failed he might be able to forgive men for making a living at music but never inferior females he could even consider that the female musicians were somehow polluting music itself kayne offered which drew an approving glance from both ardis and tal music being supposedly pure you wouldnt want an unclean female mucking about with it thats a good thing to add to the list of possibilities tal told her once againlove and hate love and worship of music hate for those who are desecrating it but that certainly doesnt preclude it being a priest far from it ardis admitted there are plenty who came into the priesthood after failing at their first choice of vocation he might even have discovered his ability at magic after he failed at music dont forget weare looking for mages he cant do this without magic but that seemed to exhaust their inventiveness for the moment and after they had thrashed the subject around a bit more they all went back to their respective tasks kayne went off to her office to draft more orders for records and tal wentwherever tal went when he wasnt specifically to meet with someone or go off on one of ardiss errands she suspected he had gone back into the city chasing down elusive leads when they were gone and the door to her office closed and locked the room felt strangely quiet and empty it was difficult to tell what time of day it was in here since the room had no windows the previous occupants had all been old and subject to rheumatism this office shared a wall with the huge kitchen ovens and as a consequence was nicely warm all winter even without a fire in the fireplace there might have been problems in the summer but as soon as the weather was warm enough all baking was done in ovens in the kitchen court usually the lack of windows didnt bother her but this afternoon it occurred to her that she was curiously isolated from the world outside because of that lack was this good or bad as a priest perhaps she should cultivate that isolation since it theoretically would enable her to get closer to god but as a justiciar she needed to remain within the secular world so that she could understand and dispense justice to its inhabitants as with so many things in her life it seemed this required striking a delicate balance too ardis removed a fat brown folder from the locked drawer of her desk the record of the priests and priestmages who had vanished from the kingsford abbey during the great fire coincidentally she had not had enough time to devote to unraveling the mysteries the stiff pasteboard contained before all this fell upon her and now the very records she would have requested from the archivist for her own abbey were already on her desk but these were only the records of those who had been severely disciplined by the order over the past ten years and it could be that this simply wasnt long enough should i go back twenty she wondered or perhaps just fifteen where should i place the cutoff ill have to look at more than severe penance that much i know the first clues to trouble may lie in seemingly minor infractions kayne was already planning on bringing the full record for the last ten years and that would be a fair pile to go through even if she eliminated all those who werent mages well perhaps if she looked at these records in the light of this new trouble something would spring out at her but nothing came immediately to mind as she skimmed over the records again those who were missing simply did not fit the pattern unless something had occurred to them between the fire and now that set them off mostly they were undergoing penance for the sins of lust and greedquite common expressions of both with no indication of the kind of cruelty exhibited by the murderer her headache worsened as she held the records concerning priest revaner thisthis is so frustrating the only obvious possibilities are dead or just as good as dead and hes at that top of that list the one thing working against revaneraside from the fact that he was probably dead and the fact that he was a giant birdwas that the murders began so far away from kingsford he would have had to travel an enormous distance to get there how would he travel as a bird he couldnt flyhe was too heavy i very much doubt that he could have walked the distance and he would have been incredibly conspicuous if he had even if he somehow found someone to take him that far away why would he bother to come back here there was nothing for him here even if i wanted to take the spell off since it was a backlash of his own magic im not sure that i could he probably ended up in kingsford and was burned to a crispor was killed by some farmer thinking he was after chickens or hes in a freakshow as one of the star attractions which would be nothing more than poetic justice no it couldnt be revaner but she wished she could find some sign that it might be one of the lesser priestmages whod escaped any of them had a perfectly good reason to return to a place they would find familiar any of them would be perfectly happy to take revenge on the free bards who had foiled the attempt to kill duke arden in his own theater the trouble was none ofthem were powerful enough to work this kind of magic but would it take power thats something i still dont know it might be a brilliant spell difficult to execute but actually requiring very little power this certainly didnt act like the variations on coercive magic she knew every one of those left the victim still able to fight for his freedom and the more heinous the act he was forced to do the more successful he was likely to be at breaking free perhaps the mage executing this magic was not powerful merely brilliant or it might be someone still in the brotherhoodshe couldnt evade that possibility there was no use in saying that an active priest couldnt possibly be doing such things when she knew very well that there were those who could and with a smiling face men with a profound hatred of women often went into the church because they knew that there would be fewer women there and that most if not all of them would be in subordinate positions to males the killings themselves demonstrated such hatred of women that even kayne had commented on it the garb of a priest only meant that a man had mastered the booklearning and study required to become a priestit didnt mean that the man had automatically acquired anything like compassion on the way to taking holy orders every person who took vows had a different reason for doing so and not all of those reasons were admirable she made a little face at that thought for it came very close to home even my reasons were not exactly pure they could be boiled down to the fact that i took vows because i didnt have a better offer her head throbbed she buried her face in her hands wondering if this was the punishment she had earned for her cavalier decision of years ago was this gods way of chastising her for not coming to him with a wholly devoted heart no no i cant believe that god does not punish the innocent in order to also punish the guilty but were those people who had already died so very innocent by the strict standards of the church they were all apostate and in a state of sin the gypsies were pagans and the free bards were hardly model citizens or good sons and daughters of the church was god punishing ardis for her pride and the victims for their sins at the same time she dropped her hands and shook her head stubbornly as if to rid it of those thoughtsno nothing i have ever seen can make me believe god is so arbitrary it makes no sense she could not would not believe in the pettyminded god so many of the brotherhood worshipedthe god who demanded obedience rather than asking for worship who punished like a petulant and autocratic patriarch besidesi may not have had a strong vocation when i entered the church but neither have hundreds of others i have served god and the church faithfully i have never swerved from that path never questioned why i was in the brotherhood until now perhaps a twinge of guilt assaulted her as she recalled how less than an hour ago she had been admiring the strong line of tal rufens jaw something was threatening to come between her and her service if there was ever something she would have named as a test of her fidelity it had come in the person of tal rufenintellectually her equal and willing to acknowledge it resourceful creative precisely the sort of person she would have been willing to spend a lifetime with unwedded and if im any judge of human nature attracted to me ardis had never been particularly impressed by rank not when so many of her own set were absolute idiots that tal was a commoner would not have bothered her before she entered the church and it certainly didnt now that shed spent years in the company of other commoners who were her equals or superiors in intelligenceand rank within the church she was pleased to have him as a subordinate would be even more pleased if the relationship became one of friendship but she would have been lying to herself if she denied that from time to time she didnt wonder how her life would have turned out if she had met someone like him before taking her final vows now with tal on the scene she was doing more than wonder about it give me the motivation and opportunity to break my vowsoh yes i can see thatthe godshe pictured had a finelyhoned sense of humor as well as curiosity and she could readily see him giving her great temptation just to see if she could resist it or see if she could find another solution to her problem like leaving the priesthood there was no great stigma attached to a priest who resigned her position left the church and took up a secular life there were always those who discovered that something inside them had changed and with that change had come the need to leave the church of course if she did leave the church she would no longer have any more status than any other commoner she had formally given up all secular bonds with her family when she took vows and if they took her back they would probably do so grudgingly since in her tenure as high bishop she had made as many enemies as friends those enemies would happily take advantage of the fact that the church no longer sheltered her and the friends were not always exactly in high places in short she would have nothing more to rely on than her own personal resources and abilities she would come back into the secular world with rather less than when she had left it and that is why priests break their vows rather than taking the step of renouncing them they want to have their pleasure and keep their position she was no more suited to the secular world of trade and business than kayne was and she had never really thought about earning her place in the world now she found herself making plans perhaps she could use her abilities as a mage to solve thefts find missing personsperhaps she could get permission from the church to act as a physician she would still sacrifice status and comfort but neither meantthat much to her given the right set of circumstancesit might be worth itphysical comfort wasnt everything status didnt mean a great deal except as protection from current enemies and to make the way a bit smoother the loss of status could be compensated for with cleverness and charm with myself using magic and the skills ive learned as an administrator and tal using his wits and experience we could do a great deal of good the mental image that accompanied the thought was attractive very attractive there were always crimes that the constables had difficulty solving there were also the occasions when a solution was found but it was difficult to bring a burden of proof before the justiciars justiciarmages were not necessarily supposed to solve crimes and more often than not ardis had been forced to sit back and grit her teeth while constables bumbled through a case or let the real criminal get away for lack of evidence but if she left the churchshe could take on anything she chose granted the people she would probably want to help most often wouldnt be able to pay her much but there would be so much satisfaction in seeing real justice done you know i imagine my cousin the duke could see clear to hiring us she shook her head suddenly what was she thinking of how could she even contemplate renouncing the church her stomach knotted and her hands clenched this was insanity what was tal rufen that she should throw out everything that had come to give her life meaning where were her senses dear and blessed godwhats putting this into my mind the stress am i under such pressure that my mind is conjuring these fantasies just to give me something else to think about surely surely that was the explanation now was not the time to even consider such things she did not want to continue this case with anything less than the full authority that her status as high bishop gave her that would be a betrayal of herself and all those victims as well as of the spirit of her vows if this murderer really was an active priest nothing less would serve to catch and convict him she fiercely recited one of her favorite meditations to drive all thoughts of tal rufen as anything other than a subordinate and a colleague out of her mindfor the moment anyway shemust concentrate her own feelings meant nothing in the face of this threat she returned her rebellious mind to the proper path but at least in its wanderings something else had occurred to her based on the fact that as a commoner she would be treated very differently from the deference her current status afforded her there was another characteristic of the murders that made her think the murderer was either a priest or a nobleor both the sheer contempt with which the man used and discarded his tools argued for someone who regarded the common man as completely disposable and not worth a second thought so many priests in her experience held commoners in scarcely concealed contempt a contempt she thought she saw operating now there didnt seem to be any point in pursuing another hareall the information they had fit the idea that this mage was or had been a priestmage if he was a former priest well he had earned himself double punishment both secular and sacred and neither the secular nor the sacred judges would be inclined to grant him any mercybut what do i do if it isan active priest how can i handle this to do the least amount of damage to the trust that people have in the churchthe disaster in gradford had shaken the trust of many to the core ardis and many others had barely averted a worse disaster involving the high king there were many nonhumans who feared the church and its representatives so much that they would probably do anything in their power to avoid even casual contact with it if this was an active priest i have to hope its an apostate someone who has been ejected from the church for previous crimes otherwiseno matter how well we handle it the situation is going to result in an enormous setback it will take decades to recover from it her hands and feet were cold her ankles ached her stomach was a mass of knots she left her chair behind her desk to take her place beside the fire for a moment she felt completely overwhelmed by the situation felt that it was more than she could handle she wanted desperately to give it all up put it in the hands of someone else and run away oh if only she could do that if only she could retreat somewhere to some place where she could concentrate on minutiae and forget this dreadful burden of responsibility the torment of a wayward heart she clenched her hands on the arms of her chair and forced back tears of exhaustion but when the sacrificed god faced the flames he didnt run away he entered them bravely without looking back and i dont care what the cynics say that the fact that he knew he was immortal made him fearless the flames werent any less agonizing as they burned away his mortal flesh and permitted his immortal soul to escape he had every reason to fear the flames yet to save the world he stepped into them if he could face his own death how can i not face my own life she wanted faith wanted to believe the problem was that she was at heart an intellectual creature not an emotional one belief didnt come easily for her she wanted empirical evidence she envied those whose belief simplywas who believed as matteroffactly as they breathed or dreamed and the only evidence i have is that evil has a freer hand in this world than good all her life she had waited in vain for that tiny whisper in the depths of her soul togive her an answer she didnt really care what question the answer addressedshe just wanted to hear the whisper once maybe she was unworthy if that was true then maybe she ought to renounce her vows and run off with tal rufen there would certainly be no loss to the world if she did she was no priest if she could not believe herself in what she preached if she was unworthy she should give over her place to someone whowas worthy of it but maybe the reason she had never heard that whisper was only because she hadalways had the capability to find her own answers if she just worked hard enough at it and if that was the case then running off with tal would be a terrible betrayal of everything she was everything she hoped to be and most importantly everything god had placed her here to do would a person with more faith and fewer wits be making a better job of this problem or a worse one she had to think that it would be the latter faith would only sustain a person through this situation only intelligence and reasoning would bring an end to it the murderer will make a mistake she told herself thats the pattern with crimes like these too hell get overconfident and make a mistake hell choose a target who has protectionor one of our people will get the knife before he does i have to believe that if we just work hard enough well find him she wasnt altogether sure shewanted to face the troubles that would erupt when they did find and catch him but failure was not an option here perhaps i can have the free bards in kingsford spreading the word to be wary among the women of the streets if i can keep them all within walls ill have an easier chance of finding him of course the only free bard likely to believe her was that disreputable rascal ravenand raven was off somewhere else this season with that saucy young bride of his but maybe hed returned by now i can certainly find out and just maybe the letters from talaysen will convince his friends that im trustworthy action doing somethingthat made her feel better less helpless more effective maybe a little more discreet pressure on the birdman i could remind him that some of the people dying are friends of his friends how important are kin and friends to one of his kind i should find that out if i can now that would be a coup if she could get visyr to cooperatehe might be able to get his talons on a knife before the killer stole it back if they just had a knife their job would be enormously easier ill concentrate our efforts on stopping the murders by getting women under cover she decided and once theyre under cover ill concentrate on getting hold of a knife she sighed and felt a little of the tension ease with clearly formed tasks of her own to concentrate on it would be easier to keep other more troubling thoughts at bay she got up and returned to her desk prepared now to open the complicated channels of communication between the church and the people of the streets there was after all only so much time before the murderer struck again and she was determined to give him as few opportunities as possible chapter ten tal was not altogether certain that ardis would be happy about the course he was pursuing today but he had decided to take advantage of his status as a special inquisitor to pry into a number of records he probably should not see under ordinary circumstances hed tell ardis when he made his report it was always easier to apologize for overstepping ones bounds than to get permission aforehand though careers and friendships would always suffer from that policys overuse hed had kayne get him copies of the abbey records of priests all of whom had been associated with the kingsford abbeys whod been dismissed or resigned from the church over the past twenty years he wasnt confining himself to priests who were also mages although he had never seen or heard of such a killer working with someone else it had occurred to him that the stakes were too high for him to ignore the possibility the murderercould be a priest in league with a mage and they didnt even have to have identical obsessions for the partnership to work if the priest in such a partnering for instance had been expelled from the church for misappropriation of funds well then there might certainly be substantial enough money to just hire a mage alternately a mage might be in conspiracy just for the side benefits it was easy enough to guess what the mage would get out of such an association everyone knew that there was power to be had from death and the more violent the death the more power could be obtained for someone with no morals and a great deal of ambition this would be a situation too tempting to refuse often magical prowess was directly linked to the power available to be used in much the way that a glassblower could only become adept at creating huge ceremonial bowls by having enough raw glass and fuel for his furnace to practice with so against the occasional grumblings of his old walkthestreetsandlisten constable reflexes he spent more time in papers and tablets there were six priestmages who fulfilled those qualifications and another nine priests written at the end of the records of four of the priestmages was the disappointing word deceased followed by a date but at the end of two were the more cryptic words missing presumed dead since the dates on these records were clearly the time of the great fire he could only assume that the two priestmages had somehow gotten misplaced in the confusion where they were missingfrom the records gave no clue although he suspected very strongly that there were other records associated with these that only ardis had access to the causes for dismissal were enlightening but not particularly surprising tal had been a streetconstable for too long not to know that priests could be as fallible as ordinary folk and as weak it often appeared to him that the real sin was in getting caught sinning rather than the act itself fraud embezzlement fornication abuse of privilegethose were the most common though there were one or two other references that might have puzzled someone with less experience than tal inappropriate behavior with children for instance followed by a very heavy punishment made him very glad that this was a file on a priest who was demonstrablydead or tal might have been tempted to pay an extralegal visit to the man in the end he had only five names out of the possible fifteen who might still be living in kingsford to track them down quickly he would need help it was time for a visit to captain fenris hed already made one visit as formal as one ever got with that energetic man presenting himself and his credentials to fenris during one of his instructional rounds for new constables fenris had been skeptical of tals abilitiesnot that hed been so illmannered as to show that he was but tal could read volumes into his little pauses and silences but as it happened an altercation over a game of chance had broken out not far from where he met up with the captain and tal had gotten caught up in quelling the small riot and sorting out the claims and counterclaims afterwards after that fenris treated him with the respect his own superiors never had leaving word with his own men that tal was to get full cooperation no questions asked tal tucked his list of names and descriptions into his beltpouch bundled himself against the cold and headed for the stable his old nag of a horse was patient and easy to handle it was a matter of a few moments to get him saddled and bridled and he was through the abbey gate and heading across the bridge into kingsford captain fenris worked out of a commonlooking threestoried building just outside the walls of the ducal palace though it had no stable of its own a servant took tals horse and led it through a posterngate to the dukes stables as tal dusted the snow from his shoulders and approached the front door he had to chuckle a little at the thought of his stocky commonasdirt gelding being housed sidebyside with the dukes matched carriagehorses and fine saddlebreds as soon as he entered the front door he was greeted by a desksergeant stationed just inside he presented his identification and the mans attitude changed from civil to positively submissive sir the man said all but rising to salute the captain is not in but i can send a runner after him or send a runner with you to guide you i dont precisely need to see captain fenris in person tal replied interrupting the man but as politely as he could what i need is access to city records i have the names of five men who were once associated with the abbey who might still be living in kingsford that i would like to track down if thats possible the sergeant nodded his lips thinning a little im sure i dont have to point out that these men might have changed their names he began tal didnt quite chuckle and im sure i dont have to point out that if theyve been up to any moremischiefthe constabulary records will have noted those name changes the desksergeant smirked third floor fourth door on the right show the guard your credentials the captain has already left standing orders about you as tal climbed the stairs he wondered just what those standing orders were since he had stressed that ardis did not want it known that he was a special inquisitor evidently the captain had his own way of establishing someones authorization without resorting to the actual titles a guard on a recordsroom thoughthats interesting i suspect theres a great deal of delicate information in there dear godfenris must trust me more than i thought or he trusts ardis to know that im trustworthy which amounts to the same thing with a sensation of unsettled emotion he wasnt quite sure how he should react to that revelation should he feel flattered perhaps a little but he suspected that situation was due more to ardiss competence than his own he was embarrassed certainly it was embarrassing to be accorded so much respect when he didnt really feel hed earned it still it was helping him get his job done and for that alone he was grateful when he presented his papers to the guard at the end of the corridor who was evidently guardingall of the rooms at that end not just the single recordsroom he got another smart salute and was able to return it with grave equanimity the room in question was small but lit quite adequately by means of a clearly oftenpatched skylight folios of papers filled all four walls and if it had ever boasted a window the window had long since been boarded up tal would have been at a complete loss as to where to start had there not been an indexingbook on the table in the center of the room it still took hours before he found three of his five men he resolved to take what he had and come back later as it was he would only be able to investigate one before he was due back at the abbey he picked the easiest of the lot a former priest who had resigned with no reason given that to his mind was the most mysterious of them all there had been no disciplinary actions taken no marks against him yet out of nowhere he resigned and left the church altogether there was nothing about him in the constabulary records either except his name and address tal saluted both the guard and the desksergeant on his way out both seemed gratified by his courtesy which reawoke that faint sense of embarrassment he could only chase it away by telling himself that it was nothimself they were reacting to but to the fact that he served ardis she was the one they really respected not him he was a walking title rather than a respected person and the humility of the realization was an odd but real comfort snow fell steadily now and it had accumulated to ankledepth since hed entered the building he waved away an offer to get his horse the address he was in search of was not in that far away and he would be less conspicuous on foot he pulled the hood of his cloak up over his head the church guards were assigned plain black wool cloaks to cover their resplendent uniforms wonderfully inconspicuous garments unless you happened to be going through a neighborhood in which garments without patches and holes were oddities the place he sought now was not that shabby an area although it could best be described as modest rather than prosperous this was a street of small shops and tradesmen many of whom were now lighting lanterns and candles against the sudden gloom of the late afternoon snowstorm as snowflakes fell thickly all about him tal paused to check his address against the shop to his left this is the placehe decided a little surprised to find that itwas a shop and not the address of a place that had rooms to let bertramchandler said the sign above the door with a picture of a lighted candle to make the meaning clear to the illiteratei hope this isnt just an address where letters are left to be picked up if that happened to be the case the shopkeeper could in all honesty claim that he didnt know dasel torney and had no notion where the letters left there in that name were going tal brushed snow from his shoulders shook it off his hood and opened the door a bell jingled cheerfully as he did so and he entered a shop that was no wider across than his outstretched arms but was a warm and cheerful place nonetheless brilliantly lit and softly fragrant on shelves to the right and left were displayed bottles of lampoil on the bottommost shelf were common pottery jugs that contained equally common rendered animal oil in the middle were large casks of distilled groundoil which the customer would use to fill his own container on the top delicate glass flagons of clear scented oils distilled with rare gums and berries a solid wooden counter stretched across the middle of the room on shelves behind it were barrels of tallowdips bundled in dozens and wrapped in paper cakes of raw waxes and candles there were hundreds of candles from simple tapers to elaborately colored carved and molded sculptural pieces the warm air was gently scented with barberry presumably from the candles burning in glassandbrass lanterns in the four corners of the room behind the counter stood a woman neither old nor younga woman with such a cheerful vital countenance that tal could not for the life of him put an age to her cheeks of a flushed pink no sign of wrinkles around the smiling lips or blue eyesher hair was hidden beneath a sensible scarf so he couldnt see if there was any gray in it she could not possibly be as youthful as he thought yet he had never before seen a middleaged woman who was so entirely happy her dress was modest blueandwhite linen impeccably clean but nothing like luxurious she was clearly not a wealthy person yet he had the impression that she was completely content with her life in every way can i help you sir she asked beaming at him her eyes sparkling in the candlelight i dont know he said hesitantly i reallyim looking for a man named torney her very cheer and confidence rattled him he would almost have preferred some surly old man to this charming woman and he dreaded seeing her face fall when he mentioned the name of his quarry but if anything she glowed at the mention of the name as if one of her own candles had suddenly come alight within her that would be my husband she said immediately her face softening at the final word if i had a wife like this oneis she why he left the church but the sign says bertram is my father she replied promptly dasel is my husband i never had a knack for the chandlery and he does oh most certainly does my father could never have made lovely things such as this she gestured at one of the carved candles and hell be the first to tell you that hes mostly retired but he comes in now and again to help me or dasel now she tilted her head to one side her eyes grew keener though no less friendly and a look of recognition came over her though she lost none of the glow youre with the church i take it he didnt start but he was surprised how did you know the cloak i saw a few of those before dasels troubles were over she did not lose a flicker of her cheer or her composure but her next words startled him all over again youve come about the girls havent you the poor things that were stabbed i dont know that dasel can help you but hell tell you anything he knows he didnt say anything but his face must have given him away for she raised her eyebrows and continued how do i know what youve come about oh the wife of aformer priestmage is going to know what it means that there are women dead and a threesided blade has done the deed we knew we both did and weve been expecting someone like you to come the high bishop ordered everything taken out of dasels record when he was allowed to leavewhich only makes it look the more suspicious when something out of the common happens i know now she picked up a section of the counter and let it fall then opened a door in the partition beneath it please come into the shop siryour name or shall i call you master church constable her cheerful smile was irresistible and he didnt try to evade her charm tal rufen dear lady would you care to be more specific about why you were expecting someone like me to call on you because she dimpled as he entered the area behind the counter and waited for her to open the door into the shop we knew that the recordsyou would be allowed to see wouldnt disclose the reason why dasel resigned as i said the high bishop is the only one who has those and she would keep them under her own lock and key with those girls done to death by ecclesiastical dagger the first suspecthas to be a priest or a priestmage and you would be trying to find every priest that had left the church that you couldyoud rather it was someone that wasnt in the brotherhood anymore and the church would too so thats the first place youd look weve already talked about it dasel and i dasel she called through the open door tal rufen from the justiciars for you she turned back to him still smiling i have to mind the shop so go on through he did so and she shut the door behind him he had never been in a chandlery before and looked about him with interest as a muffled voice said from the rear of the room just a moment im in the middle of a muddle ill be with you as soon as i get myself out of it dont fret theres no back entrance to this place it butts up against the rear wall of the building on the next street over the workroom was considerably wider than the shop tal guessed that it extended behind the shops on either side of this one to his left was an ingenious clockwork contraption that dipped rows of cheap tallow candles in a vat one after the other so that as soon as a layer had hardened enough that it could be dipped again it had reached the vat for another go there was another such contraption doing the same with more expensive colored beeswax and another with a scented wax there were rows of metal molds to his right filled with hardening candles an entire section full of things that he simply couldnt identify and a workbench in the middle of it all with several candles being carved that were in various stages of completion at the rear of the workshop was another door leading to a storeroom by the boxes he saw through the open door again the air was scented with barberry and tal surmised that this room was the source of the scent which was probably coming from the warm wax in the dipping area as he concluded that the man he had heard speaking from the rear emerged from the storeroom with a box in his hands he was considerably older than the woman in the front of the shop gray haired with a thick gray mustache and a face just beginning to wrinkle he was however a vigorous and healthy man and one who appeared to be just as content with his life as his wife was well there is one thing that a bit of magic is good for and that is as an aid to someone too scatterbrained to remember to label his boxes said dasel torney as he set the box down fortunately for one such as myself there is the law of identity which allows me to take a chip of kaerlyvale beeswax and locate and remove a box of identical wax unfortunately if that box happens to be in the middle of a stack i can find myself with an incipient avalanche on my hands dasel torney would not look to the ordinary layperson like a man who could kill dozens of women in cold bloodbut looks could be deceiving such men as tal knew could be very charming if they chose but they were seldomhappy not as completely innocently happy as dasel was once again except for the gray hair tal could not have put an accurate age on torney if he had not already known what it was from the records his sheer joy in living made him look twenty years less than his actual age which was sixtytwo well torney said dusting his hands off welcome tal rufen youll find a stool over there somewhere please take it and sit down looking around near the workbench tal did find a tall stool and took a seat while dasel torney did the same on his side of the bench your wife is a very remarkable woman sir he ventured for the first time since he entered the shop tal saw an expression that was not completely cheerful there was a faint shadow there followed by a softer emotion that tal could not identify my wife is the reason i was dismissed from the church sirra rufen torney told him candidly or ratheri was permitted to resign the permission did not come without a struggle tal felt very awkward but the questions still had to be asked i know that you may find this painful but your wife did say youd discussed the fact that someone like me would be coming to talk to you torney shrugged and i know it will be my job to convince you that i had nothing to do with the murderswhich by the wayi think were done with the help of magic speaking as a mage magespriestmages at leastare expected to study the darker uses of magic so that they will recognize such things and know how to counteract them i doubt i have to tell you that though i cant imagine that as learned and intelligent as high bishop ardis is she hasnt already come to that conclusion tal hesitated then said what hed been thinking there was only one murder in kingsford sir that you know of theres stories in the street of another two beggargirls with triangular stabwounds here and i know of a dozen or more down the river torney interrupted him im in trade sir rufen i deal with people who sell me scents oils and waxes from all over the human kingdoms and beyond the one thing that tradesmen do is talkand there hasnt been anything more sensational to talk about in the last six months than murderespecially the murder of that poor gypsy girl by the jeweler stabbed with a file indeed i knew then it was an ecclesiastical dagger and when another girl was killed in the same way here i knew it was only a matter of time before ardis sent a hound of god out on trail tal sighed and you of course never leave the city torney nodded i could bring witnesses to that obviously and it is just as obvious that they could be lying for me take it as given that i have the witnesses what can i do that will convince you i could not have anything to do with these horrible crimes tell me why you left the church tal replied instantly dasel torney nodded as if he had expected that very answer i will give you the shortest possible versioni was a priestmage trained by the justiciars but not of the order myself i was out of the teaching order of saint basyl and at forty years of age i was given the assignment of acting as tutor to the daughter of a wealthy and extremely influential merchant of kingsfordthe head of the chandlers guild in fact i had the bad judgment although the exquisite taste to fall in love with her and she had the poor taste to fall equally in love with me the inevitable occurred and we were discovered together at that point neither of us would give the other up not even after ten years of separations and penances nor under the threat of far worse punishments than we had already undergone worse tal asked curiously torney chuckled there were those who thought i ought to pay for my sin by having the organ in question removedand i dont mean my heart tal blanched he couldnt imagine how torney could joke about it fortunately dasel continued cooler heads prevailed and both my fellow teachers and the justiciars prevailed upon both the high bishop and my darlings father to soften their wrath in the case of the former they prevailed upon him to simply allow me to resign provided i never used magic directly to make a profitand in the case of the latter they prevailed upon the guildmaster to accept me as a soninlaw he quirked a smile it did help that i have a talent with wax and scent and that my ability as a mage was never better than minimal it was very uncomfortable for all of us however he acted to both of us as if we were strangers i thought he would never really forgive us we never spoke outside of the shop until the great fire tal could well imagine what the fire must have done to a candle and oil shop was there anything left torney shook his head not a thing nothing but ashes and by the time we got back to where the shop had been scavengers even had sifted those and carried away any bits of metal theyd found all this had the ring of truth about itfurthermore it would probably be very easy to verify all these facts what happened then tal asked well the great fire destroyed loren bertrams fortune and businessbut he smiled i suppose its my training as a priest that makes me value things of the spirit and heart more than of the material world my minimal ability in magic saved our lives and when bertram was deepest in despair i was ready to fight he gave up but i was just beginning and determined to prove that i could be his friend and restore what hed lost between loyse and myself we scraped together enough for a tiny slice of a shop the good will we had built among the traders got us raw goods on credit my considerable talent in the business has brought us back to where we are now we have a level of comfort if not luxury its been a difficult time but the results of our efforts have been well worth it but best of all bertram saw how i stood by him as well as loyse and now heis my friend not my enemy a very short version of what must have been a difficult twenty years but all of it was verifiable now that tal knew the facts behind the simple resignation and if torney had been trying to rebuild a business out of the ashes of the fire there was no way he could have been out of kingsford to commit the earlier murders and there must be a world of things that had been left out of that simple storytal could only wonder at a love that was powerful enough to defy church and parent and still emerge radiating joy i knew when i saw her that your wife was a remarkable woman tal said she must be far more than that i wish i were a poet or a musician torney replied softly turning a halfcarved candle in his hands i cannot begin to tell you what she means to me i would have given up everything simply to be in her presenceand if they had locked me away in a solitary cell for a lifetime of penance i would never have repented a moment of the time i spent with her and she feels exactly the same towards me he looked up i suppose thats remarkable to us though it is as natural as breathing and as necessary if a mans soul could be said to shine from his eyes tal saw torneys at that momentand felt a little in awe of all of the things that he could have uncovered in the course of this investigation this was the most unexpected haveyou any idea who this might be he asked after a moment is there anyone among the priests or the priestmages that you knew who could be doing these things thats what has me troubled and puzzled torney replied picking up a knife and gently carving petals of wax out of the side of the candle in his hands im older than ardisshe wasnt the high bishop at the time i was dismissed she was nothing more than the most promising of the young justiciarmages there is one man whocould very easily be doing these things but the last time i saw him he wasnt a man anymore wellthat certainly made tal sit up straight torney didnt chuckle but it was clear that he was amusedhed obviously intended that his statement would startle tal perhaps as a gentle sort of revenge without any prompting he told tal the tale of priestmage revaner guild bard beltren and the gypsy free bard called robin ive heard something like this before tal said uncertainly when torney was through likely enough the free bards made a ballad out of it though they changed the names to protect their own hides torney replied now the part that didnt make it into the ballad was that ardis doesnt know how to reverse that particular effect since it was all tangled up with revaners original dark sorcery the bards magics and her own as far as any priestmage i ever spoke to knew revaner was going to be a bird for the rest of his life and the part that no more than a handful of people know is that during the great fire the black bird disappeared could he have changed back somehow tal asked eagerly ive heard that there was a lot of magic going on during the firecould he have gotten caught in some of it and changed back torney spread his hands wide if youre asking could more tangled and confused magic undo what tangled and confused magic did to him in the first placewell i cant tell you i was never that good and the theory up at that level of things just goes clean over my head but if there was ever a man likely to want revenge on the church it was revaner and if there was ever a man convinced that the world should run to his pleasure it was revanercould he have escaped could he have survived on his own does that make him a man evil enough to do these horrible deeds he looked helpless i dont know i couldnt judge my own heart how can i presume to judge my fellow mans youre a charitable fellow dasel torney tal said at last but torney shook his head not as charitable as i should be its easy enough for me to say that i cant judge revaner or the man whos done these thingsbut i havent suffered harm from either one of them either if it had been loyse whod been seduced and left by revaneror slain like that poor girl he dropped his eyes and put the candle and the knife carefully down let me just say that i mightrepent what i did to the man but i wouldnt hesitate to do it if you had seen what i have tal said softly you wouldnt repent of it either torney looked up sharply their eyes met and the wordless exchange that followed left both of them with deep understanding and respect the fact remains though that the last time anyone saw revaner he wasnt capable of doing anything more than any other bird could dorather less as a matter of fact since he was too heavy to fly thats the problem withthat particular suspect torney shrugged how he could get from here to downriver without being seen i couldnt tell youunless someone netted him to use in a menagerie and he escaped his cage later well tal said tucking that thought away for consideration i have a little more to go on ill see about tracking down some of the others on my list youll find gebbast hardysty somewhere along the docks torney told him if hes not cadging drinks hes in one of the dosshouses sleeping off a drunk i doubt he could muster up enough moments of sobriety to work a simple spell but you had better be the judge of that ofram kellam has changed his name to oskar koob and hes set himself up as a fortunetellerthe constables probably have an address for him under that name though i doubt they know who he really is the only reasoni know is that i ran into him on the street and called him by his right nameand he blurted out that i was mistaken he was oskar koob not the other fellow i know what he could do when he was dismissedfor embezzling church funds if you dont already knowand i dont think he has the ability to work magic this powerful do you keep track of your fellow sinners tal asked lightly torney raised his eyebrow actually yes i do he admitted when i can a little selfprescribed penance but there are only three here in the city that i know of i heard that petor lambert was still in kingsford but i havent been able to find him so he may be on the far side of the city if he is i suspect hes up to some old tricks of using magic to create miracles to fleece the credulous if i find him first ill get word to you but you have more chance of tracking him down than i do and i will leave you to enjoy the evening with your charming wife as i hope you will tal told him rising i can promise you that there wont be any more calls like this one torney came around the bench to shake his hand i am just pleased that ardis has found worthy men to help her he said warmly as he opened the door for tal she is a fine priest a hard worker and an estimable woman not he added mischievously as estimable as my loyse but estimable nevertheless ohas if i ever had a hope of being as wise or as intelligent as high bishop ardis loyse said playfully as she held the counterdoor open for tal here she continued holding out a package wrapped in brown paper to him take these with you theyre something new in the way of strikers that dasel is trying they might come in useful and if you like them perhaps you can get captain fenris and the constables to try them torney looked proud but sheepish kindlingsticks with chemicals on the tip dipped in wax he explained watch he took out a small bit of wood with a blob of odd bluish stuff on the end and scraped it against the countertop tal started as a flame flared up on the end of the stick with an odd hissing sound people are afraid of them torney explained they either think its bad magic or they think the things might suddenly go off in their pockets but if the church guards and the constables started carrying and using them obviously ill give them a trythough i warn you if theydo suddenly go off in my pocket ill be very annoyed tal grinned a little torney chuckled no fear of thatunless youre being dragged by a horse and the pocket youve got them in gets ripped open it needs a hard rough surfacepreferably stoneand you have to scrape with some force to get through the wax coating but the wax makes them waterproof which is why i use it tal put the packet in his breechespocket and thanked them both then went out into the evening shadows and the thickly falling snow two of the three men that dasel torney had mentioned were the ones missing from his list and he decided to track down the easiest one first with the help of a fat purse of coppers to buy beer and the cheap strong liquor served in the dockside taverns tal went in search of gebbast hardysty he hoped he wouldnt have to drink any of the rotgut himself but he was resigned to the fact that he would probably pay for this excursion with a throbbing skull and a queasy stomach in the morning at first given that hardysty haunted the dockside area he thought he might have found his murderer after all a man who haunted the docks might be getting jobs as daylabor on barges and that could put him in any city up and down the river with relative ease as a casual laborer no one would pay much attention to him hardysty was another of the mages on the list altogether things seemed to add up properlybut after tracing him to a particularly noisome cellarhole of a sailors bar tal was having second thoughts by now it was fully dark and tal made sure of his long knife as he paused for a moment outside the tavern entranceif that wasnt too grand a name to put on a gap in the cellarwall of a warehouse framed by three roughhewn beams with the only door being a square of patched sail there wasnt even a sign outside the door just a board with a battered tankard nailed to it they couldnt even afford a lantern at the door the only illumination came from the streetlamp two doors down and a dim yellowish light that seeped around the curtain at the door tal had been in and out of many similar places in his career as a constable and he wasnt afraid merely cautious in the winter there wasnt as much traffic on the river which meant that sailors and rivermen had less money to spend it wasnt a festival night the weather wasnt very cooperative and most men would chose to stay where they bunked if they had a bed or a room on a night like tonight the men in this place wouldnt be looking for troublebut they wouldnt try to avoid it either as long as he watched his step he should be all right he trudged down the five steps made of uncut rock and pulled the curtain aside to enter the reek of unwashed bodies stale beer cheap tallowlights and other scents best left unnamed hit him in the face like a blow he almost turned around and walked back out but his sense of duty prevailed and he stalked across the dirt floor to the bar avoiding the tables chairs and a staggering drunk more by instinct than by sight what light there was didnt help much in navigating the room there were only four thick tallowdips to light the entire room and two of them were over the bar they gave off a murky smokeladen light that didnt cross much distance then again im probably better off not being able to see the closer he got to the bar the more his eyes stung from the smoke if i knew how much filth was caked on the tables and the floor id probably be sick behind the bar was a huge man running to fat with the last two fingers of his right hand missing and a scar across the top of his bald head the man grunted as tal approached which tal took as an inquiry beer he said shortly slapping down a couple of copper pieces on the unpolished slab of wood that passed for a bartop the bartender poured flat beer out of a pitcher into a cheap earthenware mug the stuff looked like horsepiss and probably tasted the same tal took it but didnt drink hardysty here he asked and without waiting for an answer shoved a handful of coppers across the bar thiss for him split on a bet said i could leave it here with that he turned and took his beer off to a corner table where he sat and pretended to drink in reality he poured the beer onto the floor where it soaked in without adding measurably to the stink or the filth his eyes were adjusting to the gloom now he could make out the rest of the room the scattering of tables made of scavenged lumber the few men who sat at them slumped over the table or drinking steadily with a stony disregard for the wretched quality of the stuff they were pouring down their throats the bartender scooped up the money pocketed part of it then poured another beer and took it over to a man halflying on another table nearby as if he had passed out he grabbed the mans shoulder and shook it until the fellow showed some signs of life batting his hand away and blinking at him blearily wha he slurred the bartender slapped both the beer and the remainder of the money down on the rough wooden table in front of him yours he grunted ya made a bet part paid off the tab thiss whats left hardysty stared at him a moment as tal pretended to nurse his beer ah he slurred bet yah clearly he didntexpect to remember the apocryphal bet that had been made on his behalf all he knew was that money had somehow appeared that supposedly belonged to him and he wasnt about to question the source he drank the beer down to the dregs in a single swallowtal winced inside at the mere idea of actuallydrinking the stuff he knew what it was the dregs out of the barrels of beer emptied at more prosperous taverns and the dregs of brewing mixed together and sold so cheaply that it often went as pigslop there was not a viler beverage on the face of the earth a man that drank the stuff on a regular basis cared only for the fact that it would get him drunk for pennies whatever hardysty had been the fact was that he was too far gone in drink to have had any connection to the murders if he remembered who he was and where he was supposed to go from one day to the next he would be doing well when torney said he was cadging drinks he meant it hes probably a streetbeggar for just long enough to get the money to drink whatever had gotten him dismissed from the church tal thought he remembered something about theft of church property had the disgrace broken him or had the drinking started first perhaps the thefts had gone to pay for drink this was one vice gone to excess that tal never could understand intellectually he could sympathize with a man who had lost his head over a woman and he could understand how the thrill of risk could make a man gamble away all he had in the heat of a momentbut he never could understand this rush to oblivion be it by drink or by a drug why do something that made you feelless alive rather than more why would anyone willfully seek to remove ability hardysty dropped the mug down onto the table stared at the pile of coppers for a moment then shoved them back across the table to the bartender more he saidwhich was probably what the bartender had expected him to say before tal could blink the coppers were gone tal pretended to drink two more mugs of the awful stuff before staggering out into the darkness at no time did the bartender ask him about his connection to hardysty at no time did hardysty make any attempt to find out where the money had come from that was typical behavior in a place like this one no one asked questions and information was seldom volunteered though it could be bought at this point it was too late to look for any of the other former priests but he felt he had made enough progress for one night he could definitely scratch torney and hardysty off his list the practice of magicespecially magic as powerful and tricky as this one must berequired a sharp mind even sober hardysty wouldnt be capable of that much concentration dregbeer came contaminated with all sorts of unpleasant things and the people who sold it often adulterated it further there was no telling how badly hardysty was poisoned the only thing that was certain was that he had no more than half the mind hed started out this slide to oblivion with he might just as well have taken two rocks and hammered his own head with them on a daily basis for the last few years tal was grateful for the heavy snowfall it kept footpads off the street this was not a neighborhood he wanted to have to visit again by night he was immeasurably glad when he got into a better area without an incident and even happier when he reached the constabulary headquarters and was able to get his horse from the ducal stables the ride across town and over the bridge to the abbey was quite some distance but in contrast to his walk away from the docks it seemed to take no time at all a person could draw quite a parable from those two torney and hardysty if he knew everything that brought them to where they are now torney was driven by love to give up everything in order to have it but what drove hardysty to oblivion greed fear that was the end of the puzzle for every really good constable that tal had ever met once you knew whod done the crime youd caught him and you had him safely disposed of you always wondered why hed done what hed done even things that seemed obvious were sometimes only obvious on the surface why did some people born into poverty go out and try to make their lives better honestly instead of turning to crime why did one child beaten and abused grow up to vow never to inflict that kind of treatment on his own children while others treated their offspring as theyd been treated tal didnt know and neither did anyone else but he sometimes had the feeling that the answerwas there if only he knew where to look for it and was brave enough to search the next day in absence of any other orders he crossed the bridge again to resume his hunt for former priests following torneys information that one of them had changed his name to oskar koob and had set himself up as a fortuneteller tal went to the office in charge of collecting taxes on small businesses koob would not call himself a fortuneteller of coursefortunetelling was illegal and possibly heretical no he would call himself a counselor or advisor and that was the listing where tal found his name and address he had come prepared this time dressed in civilian clothing with a pouch full of letters and a few business papers that referred to him as a trader in semiprecious gemstones there was nothing about him to reveal his true identity although the papers all called him by his real name there were so few people in kingsford who knew what tal rufen really was that he felt perfectly safe in using a name heknew he would respond automatically to in taking an assumed name there was always the chance that you would forget who you were supposed to be for a moment and give yourself away i just hope that this man hasnt got the ability to read thoughts yesterdays snow had been shoveled off the streets and packed in piles against the walls of the shops and houses today although the sky was overcast it didnt feel to him as if it was going to snow againso odd to think that a few weeks ago i was wishing i lived somewhere where it snowed in the winter instead of raining and now here i am i thinkthis is an improvementsomehow hed gotten the impression that snow just didnt bring the numbing cold that winter rains did because rain brought dampness that penetrated even the thickest clothing too badthat impression was wrong and the thought that his feet wouldnt get soaking wet was wrong too it just took snow a little longer to melt and soak into your boots but it happened all the same so much for theorybut then again he wasnt out walking a patrol anymore he was in and out of buildings most of the time not in the street it could be the contrast that made him feel the cold more as he walked he began mentally constructing the way he would think and react by the time he reached the right address in his persona as a small merchant it was natural for him to consult a fortuneteller anyone making a precarious livelihood could be forgiven for being superstitiousi operate on a very small margin and anything i can find out to help me is going to make a big difference i want to know the way that fashion is going to runlike that fashion for gemcut steel baubles a while back if i can anticipate a fashion i can make a fortune i want to know where i can buy stones cheaply and i want to know if someones going to make a strike so rich it will run the prices down and make my stock worthless i want to know if there are going to be bandits and which faires are going to prosper this year all these things would make a difference to a small merchant operating in a risky venture when tal had them all firmly in mind he cultivated just the right amount of nervousness mixed with eagerness when he arrived at the door of oskar koob he was ready there was nothing in the plain housefront to suggest what koob really was the man was clever enough to run a very discreet service too bad it isnt an honest one this was just one in a row of identical middleclass homes all thrown up shortly after the fire to accommodate people who still had money and the means to continue to make a living each was tall narrow with a set of stairs leading up to a front door a window on either side of the door and three windows in each of the remaining two stories the buildings ended in attics that had a single window just beneath the gabled roof and had identical tall wooden fences around the sides and back dividing the yard from the neighbors yards this one was painted beige and had a very modest little sign beside the door that read oskar koob counselor tal lifted the polished brass knocker and knocked at the door it was opened by an attractive young darkhaired woman dressed in a slightly exotic robe of brown embroidered with intricate geometric designs she regarded tal with a vacant gaze that suggested shed been hired for her looks and not her intelligence id like to see oskar koob please tal told her you got an appointment she asked without opening the door enough for him to see past her to the room inside no he replied doubtfully wringing his hands for emphasis do i need one my friend didnt tell me i needed an appointment the girl assessed him and his clothing for a moment ill see if the master is free she said and shut the door leaving him standing on the front step but not for longthe master had probably been lurking nearby perhaps at a window so that he could make his own assessment of the prospective client tal had made certain to dress as if he could afford koobs fees the girl opened the doorcompletely this time so that tal could enter the foyer was nothing impressive just four plain walls with doors in them the girl disappeared through the lefthand one and reappeared before he had time to have second thoughts and take his money elsewhere the masters powers have told him that his usual morning client is ill the girl announced grandly as soon as the master has sent a messenger with the medicines he will concoct the master will be with you the master never had a client to begin with tal mentally chuckled to himself as he followed the girl into the righthand room the master was wondering how long the current goose could be induced to lay magic eggs the master is thanking god or his own powers for bringing in a fresh goose to cultivate the room was precisely what he had expecteddark brown draperies concealed all four walls and covered the window light came from an oil lamp hanging over the table in the center of the room draperies were fairly standard for consultants like oskar koobit was easy to hide confederates and props behind draped fabric the floor was covered with a worn and faded carpetand again this was standard for it was easier to hide trapdoors under carpet than in a plain wooden floor there was a small table in the middle of the room with a globe of smoky crystal in the center of it there was a chair on the far side and a slightly shorter chair on tals side without prompting he took the smaller chair and waited after an interval calculated to impress the person waiting with the importance of the one he was waiting for oskar koob made his entrance sweeping aside the draperies which concealed a shabby door behind his chair oskar koob was illequipped for the part of a mysterious and powerful fortuneteller he looked like nothing so much as a peasant straight out of the farmcomplete with the innocent and boyish face that makes people want to trust such an individual well his face is his fortune i can see that as for the rest he was dressed in a sober black tunic and breeches with a most impressive gold medallion around his neck the fabric was excellent the tailoring superb evidently the consultation business was going well for oskar koob tal rose immediately and held out his hand sir im he began but koob hushed him with an imperiously raised hand silence he commanded take your seat again my brotheri will consult with the spirits and they will tell me who you are and what your business with me is tal did as he was told and koob seated himself behind the crystal sphere he made several elaborate handmovements above the sphere muttering things under his breath as he did so while tal simply watched and waited your name is tal rufen koob announced squinting into the ball you are a gemmerchant and you wish to consult me concerning the best investments in stock for you to make tal contrived to look and act astonishednever mind that the way koob had probably learned all this so far was by means of a scryingspell to read the papers in tals pocket koob continued to give him details about his supposed life all of them lifted from the letters and other articles he had with him it was an interesting variation on the same game tal had seen run elsewherethe difference being that there was no pickpocket accomplice to lift a pouch learn who the client was by opening it and examining it and replacing it without the client ever being aware that it was gone in the first place now koob said deepening his voice i must call upon other spirits in the matter of your business these are very powerful spirits powerful and sometimes dangerous the spirits who know the future are far more risky to call upon than those who know the past and the present the light in the lantern dimmed and an eerie glow came up from the crystal sphere in the middle of the table as the lanternlight dimmed to next to nothing strange sounds filled the room the sounds of people whispering the distant rattle of a tamborine a few notes on a flute a drumbeat echoing his heart then as tal looked away from the crystal globe he saw things floating in midairthe face of a young woman disembodied hands the very tamborine hed just heard so just what is it about the tamborine that makes itsoattractive to spiritstal had never been to one of these little consultations without the spirits floating a tamborine around the room and beating an occasional solo on it youd think that since theyre in the afterlife theyd have enough talent to play more than just a tamborine if theyre blessed spirits shouldnt they have at least the talent of a minstrel if theyve been dead a while wouldnt they have the time to practice oh a gittern at least or a floorharp if not a pipeorgan of the sort from a cathedral furthermore as a constable tal had trained himself to remember faces he was not particularly surprised to see that the young woman levitating above the floor was the same one whod met him at the door now she had unusual lighting and some fresh powder makeup and quicklypainted brows but it was the same woman the young woman proceeded to give him advice about his various plans and investmentsthe ones mentioned in the papers in his pouch that is when he asked for further adviceshould he undertake new projectsshe was curiously silent and when she spoke her lips didnt move this was the first time tal had gone to a fortuneteller who was also a real mage but he had a good idea which effect was produced by fakery and which by applied magicthe girls face and veil glowingthats foxfire ive seen that before the levitation is either magic or a platform lowered down from the room above us probably the platform its easier hes reading the documents i have with me by magic he probably sees them in that crystal ball of his then hes the one speaking in a female voice not the girl thats ordinary voicethrowing pitched high once in a while his lips twitch just as he came to those conclusions the master collapsed the spirit vanished and tal professing concern went to the masters side this of course gave the girl time to shed her veils foxfire and makeup he kept careful track and she appeared in about the time it should take for her to get rid of the costume wipe off powder and greasepaint and come down from the second floor she assisted the master out and returned a moment later the master must rest it has been a difficult morning she said stiffly as if making a rehearsed speech the usual fee is five ducal florins for each consultation five florins that was steep even by the standards of the best then again oskar koobs show was a bit more impressive so perhaps he was worth it tal paid without protesting and left after he made an appointment for a second consultationone which of course he would not attend of course by that time oskar koob would no longer be in residence here he would be taking up space in either the ducal gaol or the church gaol depending on which authority got to him first unless of coursetal thought with some amusement as he made his way back towards the bridgethe spirits warn him first chapter eleven despite diligent searching and enough bribes to equal his old wages as a constable tal was able to contact only a single one of the rest of the men on his list he got to find one and that was the extent of his luck one had actually set up his own chapel in one of the poor neighborhoods and was acting as a priest in spite of the fact that he had been specifically forbidden to do any such thing but by incredible but genuine coincidence before tal located him the people of the neighborhood discovered what he was doing with their daughters during his special religious instruction sessions and hed fled from an angry mob that chased him outside the city limits a quick interview with the fellow from horseback as he relentlessly stomped away from the city convinced tal that this one was in no way able to muster so much as the concentration or resourcefulness toplan a killing much less follow through on one tal felt no sympathy at all in seeing that sad excuse for a man shamble off in his tattered priestclothes with just one small pouch of moneyand a bynowshriveled manhoodto his name the other suspects had simply vanished shortly after theyd been dismissed from the church and no one knew or would admit to knowing where they were time was running out it would not be long before the killer struck again and tal was getting desperate he had yet to find even a tentative candidate for his killer so when his last lead ran out and he found that his path back to the bridge led him towards the ducal palace he acted on an impulse i need something more than the resources i havehe told himself gazing around at the darkening city streets and up into the overcast sky the sun had set a little while ago and dusk was descending swiftly surely that birdman visyr couldnt fly at night if there was any way to persuade the creature to help in watching for suspicious persons hed be worth more than twenty constables if as they thought the magician was directing his tools from some vantage point above the city streets visyr might be the only person able to spot him he had had an almost instant sense of trust for the haspur perhaps it was due to some earlychildhood fascination with the raptors that the haspur resembled or a mental echo of the hawks and eagles of command banners and insignia which called forth thoughts of loyalty and respect or perhaps it was the personal manner of this visyr but the constables instincts did not call for him to be suspicious beyond the norm that in itself was remarkable since he reflexively made himself even more thorough in his selfquestioning when dealing with any nonhuman since their expressions were so often harder to read but visyr was possessed of such an intense open presence and his mannerisms were so plain to read that tal believed that dealing with him as a colleague would not be difficult and his impression of visyrs ethics indicated he would likely want to help the side of right now if ever was the time to use his special privileges because it was going to take those privileges just to get into the palace without an invitation he went first to the constabulary headquarters and for a wonder captain fenris was actually there a constableintraining showed him to the captains office without any delay and once there he explained what it was that he wanted fenris a tall dark man with a full beard and mustache stroked that beard thoughtfully thats a good idea he said when tal was finished i suppose the question is whether or not acting as a lookout for us is going to interfere with visyrs duties for arden getting the duke to agree if it does interfere might be problematical oh its going to tal admitted theres no question of that if hes going to do us any good hes going to have to stay over the common sections of kingsford even after hes already mapped them and that means hes not going to be getting much of the dukes work done in a way he gets some of that work done by just being seen people look up and see him working for the duke theyre reminded of the duke the birdman is a reassurance these days to people who are afraid the duke might start to forget them but hes not going to be doing that scouting on a steady basis fenris replied when the killer strikes again youre going to have a week or more before he has to make another kill and during that time visyr can go back to his mapmaking if we point that out to him he might be more cooperative certainly the duke will tal winced inwardly at the casual way that fenris had said whenthe killer strikes not if but he knew that fenris was right only the most extraordinary luck would stop this monster before he had another victim luck amounting to a miracle and so far miracles were in short supply but fenris had already taken paper pen and seal out of his desk and was writing a pass to get tal past the first few guards who would not know what a special inquisitor was and into the palace once tal got as far as the dukes seneschal or majordomo those officials would bequite well aware of the power that he represented and would get him the interview he wanted without a lot of tedious protocol here fenris said handing him the folded paper and winked at him now you can walk into the palace and see whoever you damned well want to including arden himself if youre so inclined did it ever occur to you that youve come one hell of a long way from a simple constable when hasnt itevery waking moment tal told him soberly a year ago if anyone had told me i was going to walk into a palace on the strength of my own authority id have asked what he was drinking and ordered the same for myself he licked his lips and shook his head sometimes i think im having a particularly vivid dream and that ill wake up at any moment the rest of the time im sure its not a dream its a nightmare i dont mind telling you that this socalled power is making me nervous good fenris replied it should every morning i get out of bed and ask myself what the hell i think im doing and i hope youre doing the same as long as you never take it for granted youll do all right tal rufen fenris gave him a nonprotocol salute nodded and stalked out snapping orders at a trainee and thus the meeting was concluded with his papers in his hand tal left the building and crossed to the official entrance to the ducal palace presenting his pass from captain fenris to the guard at the gate from there he was taken to the guard at the palace door from there to the captain of the watch and from there to the majordomo the wizened little majordomo examined his papers turned white and sent a page to the duke while tal waited in the majordomos office they were both horribly uncomfortable the majordomo kept watching tal while his hands twitched nervously there were stacks of papers on his desk which were probably very important but the majordomo looked as if he was afraid to take his eyes off his visitor tal would have been happy to make small talk but the poor man acted as if tals every word might have the potential to send himself or his master to the church gaol and tal finally gave up finally the page arrived and tal thankfully left the majordomos office in the young boys wake the page was too young to be intimidated by a mere church official and tal was happy to listen to the child chatter as they passed along the hallways brightly lit with the best wax candles and oillamps in sconces on the wall but when the page brought him to the door of what were clearly the dukes private chambers tal was taken aback he didnt have time to act on his surprise though the boy walked past the guard at the door pushed the door itself open and announced tal rufen milord waving him through at that point tal could only go through into the dukes private suite as the boy closed the door behind him the first room something of a cross between a sittingroom and an audience chamber was empty and lit only by two of the wallmounted oillamps and a low fire in the fireplace in here rufen called a voice from beyond the next door come along through he ventured into the next room which was lit as brightly as the hallways and furnished with a few chairs several wardrobes which were standing open and a floorlength pierglass there he found the duke surrounded by three servants and a perfectly stunning woman the duke was a handsome man his hair thinning a little but otherwise showing no sign of his age still athletic and fit the formfitting blue velvet coat that his servants were helping him into only did him justice rather than making him look ridiculous as might have been the case with a man who was losing his figure the woman held a scarlet satin sash with a jeweled decoration or order of some sort on it and watched him with her lovely head to one side and a faintly critical look on her face when the coat was on the sash in place over it and every last wrinkle smoothed away from the coat the white silk shirt and the matching bluesatin breeches the critical frown vanished to be replaced by an approving smile i wasnt at all sure of that cut my love the woman said but you were right after all perhaps now youll admit that i know what im doing when it comes to clothing he admonished playfully turning and craning his neck so he could see his back in the mirror as the servants discreetly swept up the clothing that he had discarded i think this old thing of my grandfathers is likely to set a new fashion he turned to tal what do you think rufen caught offguard tal could only stammer incoherently uniforms are more my suit than fine clothing the beautiful woman laughed and pretended to cuff the duke that isnot fair nor is it kind she chided and turned to tal inquisitor rufen i hope you will forgive my duke he enjoys discomfiting people and one of these days the habit will get him in trouble the woman tal realized now was lady asher the dukes wife hed been told she was lovely he didnt realize that she was so beautiful that she could leave a man dazed just by speaking to him she had him so dazzled that he really couldnt have said what it was thatshe was wearing something claretcolored that left a flawless expanse of white shoulders and milky neck exposed he mustered what was left of his wits and answered as gallantly as he could for your sake my lady i would forgive anything short of tossing me in his personal dungeon well its a good thing i dont have a personal dungeon or i might see if that was true the duke laughed youve done it again my love youve charmed even an impervious church inquisitor do you care to stay and hear what he has to say or am i keeping you from other business you arent keeping me but i do have other business of yours to see tothat wretched little count lacey for one lady asher replied ill run along and charm him so that he forgets to pry she bestowed a kiss on his cheek he returned one to her hand and she floated out of the room with the servants in attendance the duke watched her go with a possessive and pleased expression on his face well he asked when the two of them were alone and what do you think of my lady wife shesamazing tal responded still feeling a little dazed he shook his head you ought to use her to interrogate people my lord duke theyd never be able to stand against her shes astonishing she is isnt she the duke chuckled well rufen what is it that you want since youre my cousins own special hound of god i know at least that it isnt to throwme in a gaol and since i believe youre in charge of finding the fellow whos slaughtering musicians i assume it has something to do with that youve got a birdman doing mapping for you tal began and as the dukes face darkened a little he continued hastily its not abouthim not directly anyway id like permission to ask him for some help but its going to be at the expense of his mapping duties the duke motioned to him to take a seat the duke himself remained standing though so tal did the same the duke did not pace or otherwise show any signs of impatience he remained standing with his arms crossed over his chest and his eyes fixed on tals face it was obvious from lady ashers comments that tal was keeping the duke from some official function so he hurried through what hed planned to say quickly he outlined what he had in mind for visyr the duke listened carefully nodding a little now and again you can see for yourself how hed be worth a dozen times more than a constable on the ground tal concluded and i know that you could order him to help usbut this is one of those cases where you cant order cooperation hmph the duke nodded again wise of you to realize that hes a haspur willful and principled and he is already taking less pay than he deserves just out of an ethical desire to help the people of kingsford tal made another mental note of that and the dukes nod showed him that it hadnt gone unnoticed there is another problem here ive promised not to hold him past a certain date and if he spends too much time helping you i may not get my maps done before that date arrives he held up his hand to forestall tals protests on the other hand ill be the first to tell you that no map is worth a human lifeim certainly eager for you to bring this monster to justice and if you can persuade visyr then by all means go ahead with this plan of yours he gestured to tal to follow him into the antechamber once there the duke went over to a small desk took out pen and paper and scrawled a brief note here he said handing it to tal if he tells you that hes willing ifi agree just hand him this so he doesnt think he has to wait for an audience with me in order to ask me but i thought he was working only for you directly tal began he is but haspur arepainfully polite or at least visyr is arden grimaced i detest all this protocol nonsense but visyr is so intent on not offending me that if i didnt cut through the etiquette hed be wasting far too much time going through channels for ridiculously simple requests now i have to go rescue my lady from that odious little count you just follow the page to visyrs quarters in that moment tal saw the resemblance between arden and his cousin the high bishop there was more than a mere family resemblance there was a resemblance in the way they thought the biggest difference showed only when arden was with the lady asher at that point there was a relaxation and a softening that never showed on high bishop ardiss face as tal followed the page to the upperlevel area where visyrs rooms lay he wondered what ardis might have been like if she had followed the dukes path would she have been happier unhappier or much the same he couldnt picture her dressed in an ornate gown like lady asher trailing about the seemingly endless corridors of this palace he couldnt imagine what shed do with her time whatdid women like lady asher do all day ardis would go mad with boredom in a fortnight and he recalled torney that former priest who had given up everything he had and was for the sake of his true love there were many who would call him a fool for the decision hed made would ardis say the same would ardis have made the same choice he had given the same set of circumstances tal just couldnt picture it ardis was so much a creature of intellect that he couldnt even imagine her making a decision that was so clearly an emotional one and yet if shehad made such a decision he couldnt picture her ever looking back on it with regret no matter what she decided she would stand by her decision just as dasel torney had and find a way to make the best of her situation but for a moment he envied dasel torney and his wife and not just because of their happiness but for the ease with which they had made their own choices he suspected that for them there had never really been a matter of choice it had all been a foregone conclusion that they would stand by each other therewere no questions only certainties perhaps that much certainty was a form of insanity he only wished that he could be that certain of anything it sometimes seemed that he spent all of his life secondguessing himself perhaps ifhe had spent less time in analyzing things he wouldnt be here hed be an ordinary constable with a wife and children certainly the duke was another one of these happilywedded fellows and he certainly would not have made any other choice but the one he had no man who saw lady asher would ever think he could have done otherwise but of course he was the duke of kingsford and he could do whatever he chose to and with whoever he wished if hed wanted to marry a common streetentertainer he could have and the cheers from his people would probably have been just as loud as she herself had told tal ardis had been blessed with fewer options than her cousin by simple virtue of her gender but nowwhat about now doesnt she have more options now than she did when she was subject to the will of her father now the page stopped beside another doorthis one with no guards outside itand tapped on it it was answered not by a servant but by the haspur himself he looked larger here than he had in the station or even in the abbey perhaps it was because of the way he was holding his wings arched above his body and held slightly away from it instead of closed tightly in along his back the page didnt seem the least intimidated by the birdman but then the boy probably saw him several times every day this gentleman wishes to speak with you sirra visyr the boy said in his high piping voice the birdman turned that huge sharp beak and looked down it at his visitor tal became the focus of a pair of enormous golden eyes that regarded him out of a face that had little in common at first impression with human features it bore no expression that tal could recognize and no real sign of recognition that however did not mean that the creature didnt remember him a haspur it seemed could project a flawless raptoral expression of indifference when he so desired this has nothing to do with the incident you were involved with sir tal said hastily trying not to appear uneasy beneath that direct raptoral gaze or rather it does but not directly i have the dukes permission to speak with you if you would be so kind visyr continued to examine him unwinking finally the beak opened perhaps you had better come in he said in his deeply resonant voice then as he held the door open for tal to enter he looked back down at the page you may go joffrey he said to the boy his voice a bit softer and kinder ill ring if i need someone thank you sirra the boy replied as tal entered visyrs suite and the birdman closed the door behind him well so the church has come to me in my own aerie interesting i wonder whyvisyr regarded his visitor with a somewhat skeptical air he felt much more at his ease here in the dukes palace than he had back in the city this washis ground his place and the duke had assured him personally that no one was going to be able to coerce visyr into anything while he was under the dukes protection visyr busied himself for the moment in lighting his deliambren lamps so he could see his visitor more clearly visyr was not particularly comfortable around open flame no haspur was feathers were terribly flammable he would put up with lamps and fires if he had to but he didnt have to the deliambrens had supplied him with his own lamps and his own heatingunit that sat inside the fireplace both were supplied with power from plates that sat on his balcony all day to collect sunlight the human sighed as he took a seat at visyrs direction the haspur wasnt all that wellversed in reading human expressions but he thought the man looked tired he finished lighting his lamps and turned around the slump of the mans shoulders told him that if the human wasnt tired he was certainly dispirited there was nothing of the interrogator about him in fact he hadnt asked a single question yet so it was fairly obvious that the human hadnt come here to make further inquiries so the next likeliest reason was that he had come as a supplicant i might as well come straight to the point i am tired and i need my sleepand what brings you here this cold night tal rufen he asked am i correct in assuming that you wish to ask my help the man did not look at all surprised that visyr had divined the reason he had come which at least showed that he respected visyrs intelligence he nodded i wish we had been able to find even a suspect by ordinary means sirra visyr he replied and there was no mistaking the weariness in his voice visyr read nuances of expression in the voice far more readily than he read them in the body and this man was frustrated tired beyond his strength and near his breakingpoint visyr wondered justhow near he was did he himself know or was he simply concentrating so intently on the moments in front of him that he was unaware of his own weaknesses this is more difficult than he or anyone else had anticipated i wonder just what is going on herevisyr felt sorry for himand ever since he had seen that dreadful murder he had spent much of every day thinking about the situation more than once he had been on the verge of going to the duke himself to ask permission to help that he had not was only because his own work was proving to be so allconsuming and after all it was his commanded task flying in the cold was grueling work especially the kind of flying and hovering he was doing in order to make his maps a haspur expended a great deal of energy in this kind of weather just keeping the body warm feathers were a good insulator but a haspur couldnt keep adding more layers of clothing the way a human could as the temperature dropped for one thing he wouldnt be able to fly with that kind of burden he spent most of the daylight hours in the air a good part of the evening hours bent over the drawingtable and the rest in eating and sleeping he seldom saw anyone but the duke and his own personal helpers and when he did it was never for more than a moment the time hed spent being interviewed by high bishop ardis and this man was very nearly the most hed spent unconnected with his work since hed arrived here so how could he in all good conscience volunteer his services to the lawpeople he had his own duty to attend to a duty he had promised before he ever met these other humans and how can you not whispered his conscience how can you not do all in your power to help them stop this murderer the duke he began the man coughed diffidently and handed a piece of paper to him the duke said that i was to tell you that he deems this of equal importance with his maps and that if the maps are not finished by the date that you must return then he will do without them oh sovisyr opened the folded paper and read it but had really had no doubt that it said just what tal rufen claimed for one thing it would have been very foolish of him to put false words in the dukes mouth when they were bound to be found out eventually for another tal rufen did not strike visyr as the sort of man who was given to telling falsehoods well that put the situation in another light altogether if the duke places this search of yours in equal importance with his maps then of course i am at your disposal he said evenly not yet disposed to make any display of how he felt in the matter but the case was that he was relieved deeply and profoundly relieved now his conscience would no longer trouble him when he flew over the city streets and heard the streetmusicians playing below him now he would no longer be troubled at night with dreams of that poor girl at last he would be doing something to prevent such a slaughter from happening again tal rufen was not so shy about showing his feelings in the matter his face displayed every bit of the relief that visyr felt but visyr was not expecting the depth and complication of the situation that tal rufen proceeded to reveal to him magic the possibility of a renegade priest the sheernumber of the dead so far quite took visyrs breath away i thank you sir for myself and for the high bishop tal rufen finished his voice telling visyr that he was grateful out of all proportion for what visyr had offered visyr waved a talon to prevent him from becoming effusive i cannot promise that i will be of any great help to you he warned i am only a single haspur not a legion of winged guardians i might not be in the right place next time and this city is not small inside he quailed at the idea that he was taking on the role of one of the guardiansthat select group of haspur who were warriors and worked sidebyside with the warrior humans of the land to patrol the borders and deal with troublemakersi am a mapmaker not a warrior he thought now that the words were out of his mouthwhat am i volunteering for we know that tal rufen replied and i didnt intend for you to think that i was asking you to stand guard in the air no what we would like you to do is to be a pair of eyes not a pair of talons ah visyr said feeling relieved and guilty for feeling relief what is it that you wish me to look for and when and where the heatingunit hummed to itself in the fireplace and blew warm air in a steady stream while the human thought the question over visyr spread his wings to absorb the heati have not been properly warm except in bed for months now i fear i shall not until spring arrives again and with it some of the better effects of springah syri i miss you the last is the easiestwe would like for you to spend the most time over the areas where streetmusicians are most likely to play tal rufen told him you would probably know where those places are better than i would whenwell obviously you cant fly at night so it would be during the daylight hours butwhat you are to look forthats the problem he shrugged we think that the murderer is controlling the people who are actually committing the murders as ithink i told you we believe that he is using magic to do this but what kind we dont know all that we do know is that in order to be able to see what his tools are doing and what is happening to them every kind of magic or spell that the justiciarmages know of dictates that he has to be somewhere that he can actually physically see them our best guess is that this means hes going to be up above the street somewhere as inon a rooftop visyr hazarded that would be easy enough to manage to spot there are not too many folk scrambling about on their roofs in the dead of winter possibly we just dont know anything for certain tal rufen admitted i wish we did fervently but we dont all i can say is we want you to look for anything unusual unusual on the rooftops visyr chuckled dryly well at least you ask this of me in the winter it will be much easier to determine what is unusual when there are not people coming out to frolic by twos where they think they will not be seen or to sit where they can see sun and sky and open air he chuckled again recalling some of the gyrations that humans had been up to during the milder months i have seen many things on the rooftops of the dukes city and a goodly share of them could be considered unusual tal rufen yes well i have seen more than you in the streets of cities sirra visyr tal rufen replied with a laugh as dry as visyrs i think i can guess he proved that with a rather mordantly and morbidly humorous anecdote that ended with the line lady i think your sign just fell down perhaps a gentler creature than visyr might not have found it amusing but he did and he felt a little more kinship with tal rufen in that moment haspur could be more bawdy in their way than any nonhaspur would suspect well and what if i dont find anything he asked if the worst should happen and this madman kills before either of us catch him i will send word to you if you have not already reported to me the human looked pained then you may go back to your maps for about a week or so before you need begin watching again hes obviously planning these killings carefully and while hes planning them he probably wont be doing anything where you can see it visyr nodded soberly i understand he thought for a moment and volunteered something else before you go let me tell you what i can that i have already observed he was pleased to see that the human had come prepared with a notebook and a scriber he spent the better part of an hour relating as many of the incidents that he had witnessed that could be considered unusual that he could recalland since he was a haspur and his memory was exceptional there were a great many of them most of them struck him as odd largely because he wasnt familiar with the humans of this landand some made tal rufen laugh out loud when he related them he was pleased enough to hear the human laugh for each time it occurred the man lost some of his tension and came a bit farther away from the edge of breaking and every time visyr did describe such an incident the human very courteously explainedwhy it had made him laugh which gave visyr a little more insight into the ways and habits of the odd people who dwelled here finally when he had come to the end of his tales something else occurred to him he sat for a moment clicking his beak as he thought about it wasthat unusual enough for the human on the surface it wasnt but i shall err on the side of too much information he decided there is one final thing church constable he said at last in the past few weeks i have seen a very strange new bird in this city it is as large as i am quite remarkably ugly and blackand i have never seen more than the one it is a bird of no species that i know and quite frankly it should not be able to fly neither should a bee or a blue parrot tal rufen observed but go on please visyr roused his feathers with a shake and yawned i have seen it watching what goes on below it for hours and even when there was noise and activity that frightened away every other bird it remained it seems to place itself where it cannot easily be seen from belowbut so do many birds idid see it watching the square where the murder occurred at the time of the murder but it didnt do anything and i didnt see it again that day or the next in fact i havent seen it for several days now he shrugged that is all i can tell you i have never seen it do anything other than watch but it could be watching for prey for opportunities to steal human food or just because it is curious there are strange species crossing borders all the time and for flyers it is doubly easy it could simply be migrating lazily well youve told me quite a bit rufen replied making a few more notes then closing the notebook and stowing it in a capacious pocket inside his cloak believe me it is appreciated and i am glad to help you tal rufen truly i am but he yawned again hugely feeling exhaustion of his own overtake him the human gazed at him apparently slightly astonished at the width and depth of a haspur gape but i had just finished eating and flying in the cold takes much out of one i was just going to sleep the human glanced over at the haspurs unusual bed and blushed a bit then i will not keep you awake a moment longer tal murmured and echoed visyrs yawn which set visyr off again with another hunting scraps of information is almost as tiring i promise you and i would like to see my own bed he extended his hand and visyr took it gingerly keeping his talons from scratching the delicate human skin thank you again would it be too much to ask you to send a report to the abbey once a day i shall do better than that i shall fly one there myself at days end visyr promised him tell your guard at the gate that i will drop it to him tied in ribbons of duke ardens colors unless i have something i believe you must hear in person will that do it will more thando and again i thank you now the human stood up and visyr did likewise towering over him i told captain fenris and the duke that you would be worth any twenty constables and i dont believe i was exaggerating i will be looking forward to seeing your reports and i will be pleased to make them visyr held open the door and the human went out into the hallway travel safely to the abbey tal rufen he finished by way of a pleasant farewell and you fly safely in the morning the other replied and gave a brief wave of his hand before turning and walking towards the staircase down visyr closed the door behind him and retired to his sleeping room and his comfortable couch it was going to be a cold night tonight and he was very glad for his down comforter to keep him warm he disliked having a fire in the same room with him as he slept and even his deliambren heater had the potential to be hazardous he extinguished his lights wrapped himself up in his coverings and settled himself over his bed for sleep he had not lied when he told the human that he was about to retire for the night the fact was that he had barely been able to keep his eyes open when the page knocked on his door but sleep was now a reluctant quarry for visyr had plenty of leisure to think about what the human had said and ponder the possible consequences of what he had agreed to if the killerwas using magic did it not follow that he could use that magic against visyr if he suspected he had been seen the haspur themselves used very little magic with but a few exceptions but the humans who shared their mountain kingdom with them often did make use of that power the idea that he might be struck out of the sky by a bolt of lightning was not one likely to summon sleep the remaining pieces of a lightningstruck haspur could be very small indeed on the other handno one had struck him down out of the sky yet and the killer had probably seen him a dozen times by now as long as he didnt change his own patterns he ought to be safe enough as if i havent already changed my patterns by chasing that first killeror tool rather since that is what tal rufen called him never mind in that he was no different from a dozen other witnesses who gave chase the mage could hardly target everyone and perhaps since he was so visible in the sky a secretive mage might prefernot to strike at him with that comforting realization sleep finally came and visyr drifted upwards on its dark wings tal rufen left the palace reclaiming his horse on the way out and allowed the horse to pick its own way back through the darkened and snowcovered city streets as always knowing that it would be going back to its own stall and a good meal the horse walked briskly along the shortest path for once he was glad of the time that the trip would take even by the shortest route something had occurred to him back at the palace and he wanted to face his realization down before he got inside the abbey walls again it filled his mind so thoroughly that he thought on it rather than reviewing his talk with the haspur as he normally would have he was no longer appropriately dispassionate about his position over the course of this investigation he had become increasingly attracted to the high bishop and not just intellectually either the fact that he had compared her to lady asher told him that he wasnt just interested in her mind or her friendship and that frankly was a dangerous situation it wasnt something that could have come up in the course of his former job there were no such things as female constables nor was there any possibility that a woman might assume the position of captain he was perfectly free to admire any female that came within his purview and perfectly free to do more than admire them if the situation was appropriate when hed sought an audience with the high bishop of kingsford it had never occurred to him that said official might be a woman then when hed discovered her sex it hadnt occurred to him that in working closely with an attractive lady of a similar age he might get himself into difficulties but then it obviously hadnt occurred to her either he didnt think he was misreading the occasional sidelong glances or the way her gaze lingered when she thought he wasnt aware of it just at the moment things were still at the stage of speculation at least on her part but if there hadnt been admiration there wouldnt be anything to speculate about he was troubled by this more troubled than he had been by any emotional situation in his life im not particularly devout but then few constables areit was difficult to be devout in the face of some of the blatant corruption within the church that constables uncovered from time to time the church might successfully engineer ways to hide such scandals from the eyes of the public but the constables always knew the truth still he had always considered himself to be an upright man a man of morals and integrity if nothing else so how could he even begin to permit himself to be attracted by a priest and at that a coworker a peer and his commander yet she was the ideal companion for him in so many ways we share common interests and goals she is intelligent and clever and our skills are perfect complementsnever once had he encountered a woman with even half the qualities he admired in ardis he frankly doubted that he ever would again but she is a priest vowed to both chastity and celibacy and there is no getting around that he tried not to squirm in his saddle but this entire train of thought was making him dreadfully uncomfortable as if he had swallowed something too large and it was stuck halfway down his throat this was a new thing for him he was anything but young and he had thought with some complacency that he was well seasoned and past the age when he might be enflamed by a momentary passion or infatuation so much for complacency i ought to know by now that its a dangerous feeling to harbor he certainly had never subscribed to the ridiculous notion that people are destined to find a soulmate soulmates what nonsense searching for the perfect soulmate is never going to get you anything but heartache at best at worst you find yourself all alone in your declining years having turned down people who loved you just because they werent perfect but what did dasel torney have in his wifebut a soulmate and just how many perfect matings are there likely to be in the world just because i have seen one that makes it all the less likely that im likely to find one myself but in seeing torney with his wife he had felt an envy he had never expected to experience he had never even considered marriage in the past his career simply wouldnt allow it and yet nowhe wondered if the career would have been worth sacrificing under the right circumstances so what exactly did he intend to do about the situation as complex as it already was adding inthis would only make it worse all the way around my first option is to do nothing of course he told himself as the horse picked his way gingerly across icy cobbles if i dont make any overtures she isnt going to know how i feel then if im misreading all this things will be fine certainly no one has ever died of an unrequited passionits usually the ones that are requited that get people in trouble it wouldnt be a comfortable situation for him but it was certainly better than having a superior officer who couldnt stand him ah but what if she makes overtures what then he already knew what happened to priests who became involved in an affair im not going to put a pretty name to it what wed be involved in would be a clandestine affair in violation of her vows the horse skidded and scrambled for a foothold in an odd counterpoint to his thoughts it would be bad if we were caught and almost as bad if we werent when the passion blew out we would be angry and bitter with each other it would cost both of us a great deal in the way of selfrespect if nothing else unless this was all something more than simple passion would he be willing to give up everything for the sake of love as dasel torney had would she but there was one factor overriding every other concern right now and that was the simple fact that none of them had any right to consideranything other than the case at hand it was too important literally a lifeanddeath situation if he were to waste time and resources in pursuing an emotional goal he would never be able to look at himself in the mirror again he came to that conclusion as the horse left the city and took to the road leading to the bridge at a brisk trot with the abbey looming up at the other end of the span he felt a certain comfort in that thought this job came first anything else would have to wait until it was concluded and in a way it was a relief to have to put off a decision although it was the last thing he wanted it was possible that they would not be able to bring a killer to justice for months or even years perhaps when this was over there would no longer be a decision to make there is nothing that rand hates worse than being told no orm thought cynically what is it about this man that he has never learned how to accept anything other than his way if you really want a musician of any kind this time its going to be difficult orm told his employer as they sat across the table from one another in orms apartment the map of the section orm thought most promising was spread out between them theyve gotten wary here in kingsford a great deal sooner than i would have thought none of them are going out at night at all and a great many of the lone women of the free bards have left the city altogether rand frowned and orm noticed that he was no longer as handsome as he had been his features had coarsened his forehead seemed lower and his resemblance to the black bird was more pronounced one would think that they had gotten word from some of the other places weve been he said his tone accusing interesting does he think i warned them if that is the case he may be losing intelligence along with his looks each time he transforms orm held back a smirk well i did point out to you that the duke has an interest in these free bards evidently hes given orders that his constables are to warn streetmusicians here they might not have believed the constables at first but they certainly do after your rather spectacular killing on the riverfront rand didnt snarl but orm got the impression that he would have liked to he glowered instead and it was clear that he would really have preferred to find someone to punish for these checks to his plan damn the duke cant the bardic guild hold him in check not after the great fire they cant orm replied feeling rather smug their credit is not very high with anyone in kingsford not when there are still persistent rumors that they had a part in trying to kill duke arden and in starting the fire hadnt you noticed that you never see a guild bard on the street when they have to travel they do so in closed carriages and not for warmth or ostentation if they show their faces insome parts of the city theyre likely to get pelted with refuse he warmed to his subject since it was so obviously annoying rand and meanwhile since the free bards were the ones who actually foiled the plot their credit is at an alltime high now if it was guild bards you wanted to murder id have no shortage of them for you and very few would mourn their passing perversely orm found that he enjoyed annoying rand perhaps it was the mans superior manner perhaps it was just that he tried so hard to establish control over everything he came into contact with orm had never cared for being under control and any attempt to put him there only ended in resentment so often in conferences like this one the more annoyed rand became the more orms own humor improved right now rand was frowning so fiercely that his eyebrows formed a solid bar across his forehead he looked curiously primitive as if he might slam a club or gnawed thighbone down on the table at any moment there are no women in the guild rand replied sullenly stating the obvious if you havent got any free bards whatdo you have for me oh the usual orm told him that made rand look blacker than before if possible for the usual was a mix of whores and streetentertainers and such victims rarely yielded the amount of energy that kept rand in his proper form for as long as he wished then again nothing ever kept rand in his proper form for as long as he wished so what was the difference instead of answering that frown orm ignored it bending over the map theres a good little prospect who lives here he said indicating a building with the featherend of his quillpen shes the closest thing to a musician that were likely to get for now makes her living as half of a pickpocket team she chants bawdy ballads to collect a crowd while he picks the pockets he juggles objects thrown to him by the crowd while she picks pockets it wouldnt be at all difficult to get your knife into his hands and it could be a fairly plain one hes often tossed knives to juggle and if no one claimed this one at the end of his turn he wouldnt go looking for the owner rand nodded still frowning but listening now what else he asked unlicensed whore living here he touched another spot calls herself a courtesan on the strength of reading poetry to her clients and the fact that she doesnt charge a set fee of course if you dont pay her what she thinks shes worth youll find your pockets lighter after youre home again shes trained her brat to lift purses while the clients busy weve done her type before he tapped another spot on the map now if you dont mind going for a target who works under a roof you might want this one girl here who thinks shes a musician ran away from home on the strength of it cant make a copper on the street so shes a tavernwench until somebody notices what a genius she is orm chuckled heartlessly for the girl was unattractive sullen and rebellious and was probably going to get herself fired before too long shed be all right if she just played other peoples songs but shes a genius so shes got to do her own problem is shes got two tunes no voice and a knack for lyrics that insult her audience shes as easy as the pickpocket now rands face cleared a little well look at her and the pickpocket and i suspect well take both of them probably the pickpocket first unless you find an opportunity to get the tavernwench i dont like working under a roof but orm shrugged suit yourself unless the constables get her the pickpocket is always there for the taking ill see if the other girl has a boyfriend or something if she does then we have a solid prospect for your knifeholder orm watched rands brows furrow as he thought the situation over does the girl lodge in the tavern he asked orm shook his head i dont think so the other girls have said something about her being too good to sleep on the floor with them when the tavern closes and once in a while shell try a streetcorner for that matter maybe theres a way to lure her somewhere of your choosing by making her think someones taken an interest in her as a singer and those should be obvious solutionsorm thought with disgusthe ought to be able to reason that out for himself orm had his own reasons for steering the selection towards shensi the tavernwenchhe would much rather study a potential target indoors all right rand said at last get me more on this taverngirl maybe it wouldnt be such a bad thing to try for her rand got up from the table without another word and stalked off to the front door a moment later orm heard his footsteps on the staircase well thank you for the audience your majesty he muttered resentfully rand must be about to turn bird again he was always unreasonable and rude but he got worse just before he was about to turn with nothing better to do orm rose shrugged on a coat and went out into the dusk other folk scurried by probably in a hurry to get home before full dark far down the street orm saw warm beads of light blossoming as if someone was lighting up a string of pearls the public lamplighters were out an advantage to living in this neighborhood where orm was going there were no public lamps which made the going occasionally hazardous and made easy work for footpads not that orm had to worry about footpads when he entered areas with no lanterns he moved as if he was one of the footpads himself in lean times it often amused him to fell one ofthem after they had taken a target and help himself to their illgotten gains it made him think of an old illustration he had once seen of a big fish about to swallow a small fish who was in turn about to be swallowed by a bigger fish it was snowing again which was going to keep some people home tonight thinning the crowd in a tavern wasnt a bad thing it would enable orm to see who the regulars were even if one of them had nothing whatsoever to do with the girl except order food and drink the fact that he was a regular would bring him into contact with her on a regular basis with the knife in his hands perhaps he could be forced to wait for her outside the tavern door then a note might lure her outside you never knew for once this wasnt the sort of tavern that orm avoided at all coststhe kind where you risked poisoning if you ate or drank anything one of his other prospectsone he hadnt bothered to mentionworked at one ofthose and orm would really rather not have had to go in there mostly drovers and butchers ate at the golden sheaf it was near enough to the stockyards to get a fairly steady stream of customers orm didnt look like either but he could pass for an animal broker and that would do he knew the right language and he kept rough track of what was coming into the stockyards depending on who he had to talk to he could either have already sold his beasts or be looking for a buyer the windows were alight but there didnt seem to be a lot of people coming and going orm pushed the doors open and let them fall closed behind him the place smelled of wet wool mutton stew and beer with a faint undertone of manure the men tried to clean their boots before they came in here but it just wasnt possible to get all of the smell out the ceiling here was unusually high for a place that did not have a set of rooms on an upper floor this might once have been a tavern of that sort with a staircase up to a balcony and six or eight rooms where the customer could take one of the serving girls that sort of establishment had been outlawed on the recommendation of the whores guild when arden began the rebuilding of the city the licensed whores didnt like such places there was no way to control who worked upstairs and who didnt a girl couldclaim she was only a serving wench and actually be taking on customers there was no sign of such a staircase or such rooms but they could have been closed off or given back to the building next door whichwas a licensed house now beneath the light of a half dozen lanterns hanging on chains from the ceiling the golden sheaf was a pretty ordinary place the floor walls and ceiling were all of dark wood aged to that color by a great deal of greasy smoke the tables had been polished only by years and use and the benches beneath them were of the same dark color as the walls and floor at the back of the room was a hatch where the wenches picked up food and drink pitchers of beer stood ready on a table beside the hatch for quick refills there were two fireplaces one on the wall to the right and one on the wall to the left after working all day in the stockyards drovers and butchers were always cold and a warm fire would keep them here and drinking even though there was no entertainment orm looked around at the tables and saw that the place was about half empty he chose a seat in a corner though not in his targets section and waited for one of the other wenches to serve him you didnt get any choice in a place like this mutton stew bread and beer was what was on the menu and that was what you got the girl brought him a bowl plate and mug without his asking and held out her hand for the fee of two coppers he dropped it in her hand and she went away there was a minimum of interaction with the customers here and that apparently was the way that shensi liked things shensi was the name of his target orm had already learned by listening to her and to the other wenches that she was the child of a pair of common shopkeepers who probably had no idea where she was now skeletally thin pale as a ghost with black hair the texture of straw a nose like a ships prow owllike eyes and a grating nasal voice she had run away from home when they refused to allow her to join the free bards winding up in kingsford she found that no one was going to give her food or lodging no one really wanted to hear her music and she had the choice of working or starving she chose the former but she was making as bad a business of it as she could if it had not been that labor was scarce in kingsfordespecially menial labor like tending tables in a tavernshensi would not have had this position for more than a week as it was the tavernkeeper put up with her sullen disposition and her acerbic comments to the customers because the customers themselves who were mostly brutes a bare step above the cattle and sheep they drove to market or slaughtered hadnt the least idea what she meant by the things that she said to them she wasnt pretty enough or friendly enough for any of them to want to bed her but as long as she kept their plates and mugs full they didnt particularly care what she said or did around them what orm hadnt bothered to tell rand was that shensi was one of a small band of malcontents intriguing to overthrow duke arden the constables knew all about them of course and left them alone because they were so totally ineffectual orm had taken the relatively bold step of reporting them to the constables just to see what they would say and the results had been laughable according to the constabulary records they spent all their time arguing about the structure of their group and not a great deal in anything else they had no fixed addresses because the members of the group disdaining such plebeian pursuits as employment usually squatted in the ruins of buildings until they were evicted lived with relatives or left their lodgings when the rent came due shensi wrote whatshe thought were stirring songs about ardens tyranny what she didnt know was that most people who heard them thought they were comicsongs and bad ones at that orm hadnt bothered to tell rand about this because he was afraid that rand would consider it too dangerous to target a member of a rebellious political group not that anyone was going to miss shensi or even consider her a martyr to the causeher death wouldnt even make the constables heave a sigh of relief except for those few who were musiclovers but it was a possibility that orm could find the knifewielder in that group and he was hoping to see some of them here tonight as he ate his tasteless stew and equally tasteless bread he looked over the occupants of shensis tables two were drovers who shoveled in their food with stolid obliviousness to their surroundings there was a butcher at a second table evidently he had been working past his normal quitting time for he hadnt even bothered to remove his leather apron before coming here to eat but at the third table was a group of four clearly some of shensis coconspirators there were three men and a woman all four wore shabby illfitting black clothing all four had identically sullen furtive expressions all four sported the pale complexions of people who seldom came out during daylight hours they huddled over their food and spoke in hushed voices casting suspicious glances at the drovers and the butcher the former ignored them with indifference the latter with amusement they might have resembled footpads except that they were armed with ostentatious knives instead of sensible saps and cudgels and they all wore great clumping boots instead of soft waterproof shoes from time to time shensi came over on the pretext of renewing their drinks but she spent longer than she needed to and she whispered to them while she filled mugs orm also noted that she didnt take any money from them evidently they were meeting here more for the free beer than because it was a good place to meet he watched them closely although they had no idea he was doing so any of them would make a good tool even the woman who watched shensi with the worshipful eyes of a puppy in fact that would be a very amusing combination now that orm came to think about it he wondered how rand would react to that idea probably poorly he decided he has to identify to some extent with his tool and the last thing he would want to identify with is a woman or maybe by now for him the term is sow when his plate was empty he signaled to his wench that he wanted a refill the portions here werent particularly generous and it wasnt difficult to find room for another round as he finished that second helping the conspirators at the table got ready to leave he left what remained and followed them out into the darkness the snowfall had eased to mere flurries but the snow still covering the street reflected all the available light and made it quite easy to follow the group they stood out against the white snow quite remarkably well he didnt stay close enough to them to hear what they were talking about what he wanted to know was where they lived not what they were saying they were completely oblivious to the fact that he was trailing them in spite of the fact that he was not being particularly subtle about it his presence actually protected them ironically enough he saw more than one footpad assess them and give them up as not being worth the trouble when he came into view interestingly enough they led him to a cheap storefront which displayed a few badlyprinted books in its window this was evidently their headquarters and their sole source of incomeunless more of them had finally stooped to take on jobs as shensi did this must be where she slept at night he wondered which of them she shared her bed withor was it with all of them in turn that would have suited the stated philosophy of the group as orm understood itshare and share alike in everything with everyone equal to everyone else and nothing held in private not even personal secrets well that was all the information he needed he turned and headed back to his own cozy dwelling with a rudimentary plan already in mind he could go into the store by day and buy one of their silly books he could leave the dagger behind dropping it on the floor in a corner where it probably wouldnt be noticed for a while when it was obviouslysomeone would pick it up and put it on hed watch them to see which it was then inform rand rand could do the rest forcing the tool to wait outside the storefront for shensi easy simple neat everyone would assume it was a lovers quarrel or had something to do with the powerstruggle within the group or both there would be nothing to connectthis killing to the others from here it was no great distance to the stockyards which stood beside the river the tool could go right down the bloodsluice into the river itself he might even get eaten by the fish that lived there which fed on minnows that fed on the tiny creatures that in turn fed on the blood it was as nearly perfect a plan as possible which was probably why rand wouldnt like it he hadnt thought of it himself so now came orms secondhardest job convincing rand that hehad thought of it but that could wait for tomorrow tonight he intended to enjoy himself with rands money in places that rand could never go and just possibly he would see if there was anyone out there who might be willing to pay for information about the mysterious killer of musicians who knew the price might be high enough to risk betrayal there was after all a price for anything and anyone if only you could find out what it was especially in cities chapter twelve shensi was going to be an ideal kill so far as orm was concerned as he had it laid out everything would be accomplished quietly with an absolute minimum of fuss the day of the kill orm went into the shabby little bookstore as he had planned and purchased a bookthe only title for sale which might account for the scarcity of customersexplaining the philosophy and goals of shensis group orm wondered where they got the things printed and how they managed to afford the printing costs but the poor quality of the work made him think that they might be printing the things up themselves in the back certainly the binding was incredibly crude reminiscent of the little chapbooks children made up to draw in or to use as journals the sullen boy who sold him the book sneered at him as he made incorrect change orm didnt challenge him on the sneer or on being shortchanged but dropped the dagger in a corner as he had intended he lurked about in a doorway waiting to see who would pick the blade up it pleased him no end to see that same darkhaired lanky boy leave the place wearing it not more than a quarter hour after orm had left the shop by now of course rand was in the form of the black bird and was lurking up among the chimneys except for orm and the boy there was no one else on the street when the boys back was turned orm gave rand the signal to tell him that the boy was wearing the dagger and began looking for a place to spend the dayand night if need be he found a place somewhat to his surprise directly across the street from the bookshop it was some indication of the poverty of this group that they were all crowded into a single room at the back of the shop when the building across from them had plenty of real livingspaces there were several sparselyfurnished rooms to let by the week he hired one for a week that had a window overlooking the street and moved in immediately the proprietor was incurious evidently this was a place where transients moved in before moving on then again there wasnt much that could be damaged in orms room and nothing that could be stolen so perhaps the proprietors indifference didnt matter the bed was a shelf bolted to the wall and furnished with a straw mattress the chair was too large to fit through the narrow doorway or the window the wardrobe was also bolted to the wall the tiny stove meant for heating and cooking was of castiron and burned coal provided in a pile beside it this was supposedly a weeks worth of fuel the stonefaced proprietor informed orm that if he burned it all hed have to provide more at his own expense probably the owner didnt care what happened here as long as the resulting stains could be scrubbed off or painted over the room was icy and orm started a fire as soon as the landlord left the fuel would barely last the night by his current standards but he could remember when it had been otherwise in his lifeand i can remember when this would have been a haven of luxury as soon as the sun set orm opened the window and the black bird flapped clumsily down to the sill ill be just above rand croaked then pushed off from the sill and flapped up to perch somewhere on the roof orm already knew the plan rand would have the boy waiting when shensi appeared just after midnight there probably wouldnt be any witnesses since the group couldnt afford candles or much in the way of fuel and generally went to bed right after returning from their free meal at the tavern it would be a long wait but orm was prepared for it he amused himself with a little pocketpuzzle hed purchased from a streetvendor that and keeping the stove stoked and the ashes shaken out kept him busy these tiny stoves needed a lot of tending but he managed to get the room tolerably warm night fell the group across the street went out by fours and returned the same way until everyone had been fed at the expense of shensis employers when the last one returned the dim light visible through the shop window went out the midnight bell struck in a nearby chapel and rands tool walked stiffly out of the front door of the shop a few moments later shensi appeared at the end of the street walking towards the shop with a careless swagger a few moments after that it was over in a way orm was disappointed he had thought that the girl after all her posturing would have at least sensed that she was in danger soon enough to put up a struggle but rand wasnt taking any chances he waited for the girl to pass his tool then with a single blow to the back dispatched her shensi lay facedown in the street with a spreading puddle of blood staining the snow the knifehilt protruding from the middle of her back the tool moved down the street in a jerky uncoordinated fashion that suggested that rand was having difficulty controlling him but he was headed in the direction of the nearest slaughterhouse orm trotted silently down the stairs and out the front door he plucked the knife out of shensis back and kept going in the opposite direction keeping the knife well away from him to avoid getting any blood on his clothing not that he intended to do anything other than burn this outfit as soon as he got home blood could be traced and orm never left anything to chance he stopped just long enough to clean the blade in a stream of water from the public pump at the corner and went on he took care to go by way of major streets so that his tracks were muddled in the midst of hundreds of others by the time he reached home again rand was already waiting for him in the foyer shared by their apartments in human form again the light from the entryway lamp cast a sickly yellow glow over his features the mage held out his hand wordlessly and just as silently orm dropped the dagger into it rand turned on his heel and climbed the stairs and orm knew by his silence and glower that the kill had not given him the power that he had hoped for his current tenure as a human would be shortlived well that was too bad and it was hardly orms fault at least they had another couple of easy prospects with the pickpockets long before rand transformed again theyd have the next kill set up but the next day when he went out to check on the pickpocket pair he got some bad news while he and rand had been setting up shensi the pickpockets had been caught in the act by a private bodyguard and taken off to gaol and on looking into the third prospect he learned that one of her clients had set her up as his private mistress which was evidently the goal shed had in mind all along she was no longer to be found in her old neighborhood and even if he could find her again she would no longer be accessible to strangers it would take longer to find her and her patron than it would to locate a new set of targetsand even if he did find them they were now dangerous to use if a man of wealth suddenly slew his mistress and killed himselfsomeone would investigate theyd gotten off lucky with the young fop they couldnt count on that kind of luck a second time he had hardly anticipatedthis is it rands luck thats gone bad he wondered as he returned home or mine whichever it was rand took the news badly and orm found himself the victim of a torrent of verbal abuse as well as physical intimidation that strained even his patience as rand heaped abuses on him and towered over him brandishing his fists and stopping just short of actually landing a blow orm seethedif this goes on much longer he thought his stomach a hot knot of resentment and suppressed angeri am walking out of here and going straight to the constables from there he could go to the room hed hired change his appearance collect the money he had hidden elsewhere and escape the city by the time they collected rand orm would be long gone and rand could implicate him as an accessory as much as he liked another kingdom another identity and it would be business as usual but rand stopped just short of that point and suddenly sat down in his chair youll have to find someone else he said stiffly your choices havent been good lately i think its time you started obeying my orders while i wasflyingi did some of my own scouting he stabbed a finger down stiffly at the map on his desk and an area circled in red you will go look there he ordered there must be a dozen prospects or more available there the quality is much higher orm moved warily towards the desk and looked down at the map he saw to his dismay that the area rand wanted him to investigate was not onehe would have chosen this was a quarter of the city that contained mostly middleclass shops and businesses along with a few genteel boardinghouses and inns and working there was going to be very difficult such places had a regular set of customers people knew each other by name there were few transients and people asked a lot of questions strangers there would be obvious but he also knew better than to argue with rand in this mood he simply nodded subserviently and started to leave but rand stopped him dont think you can go to the constables orm he said as silkily as his voice would let him youre as much a part of this as i am ive taken steps to ensure that theyll know this even if im dead and ive left them the means to find you even if you leave the city in disguise until i have the ability to stay human the only way you leave my employ is dead orm didnt answer although his heart froze he just continued his path towards the door as if he hadnt heard what rand had said there was no point in protesting that he hadnt even thought of going to the constables rand wouldnt believe a protest but that certainly put a damper on his notions of escape he walked down the stairs and out of the building altogether wondering just what it was that rand had done if it was something magical there wasnt a great deal thathe could do to counteract itbut if it was something merely physical such as a journal or letter or a set of notes he might be able to find such an object and destroy itif it wasnt guarded or protected that is but in the meanwhile he was as tied to rand as a slave was to a master the one thing that he was sure of was that he didnt dare abandon rand even if the item rand referred to was a physical one and he destroyed it the mage would have to be in church custody or dead before he would feel safe there were too many things that rand could do magically to find him no matter where he tried to hide with no definite destination in mind orm wandered until he found a small eatinghouse halfempty at this hour with tables in quiet corners he went in gave the servinggirl his order and took his place at a oneperson table in an odd little nook the owner was evidently a frugal soul for there wasnt a candle or a lantern lit in the entire place what daylight came in was filtered and dim which precisely suited orms current mood well now what do i dohe wondered this was not the first time hed been caught offguard since going to work for rand but from his point of view it was the most unpleasant the first time hed had plans go awry it had been when the wrong person had gotten one of the daggers a pickpocket had taken it from the intended target that hadnt worked out too badly thoughthe pickpocket had a woman whod been singing to herself at the time and rand had gotten a decent kill out of the situation the second time thoughhad been a disaster from start to finish the dagger had been intended for a pawnbroker but had been picked up by the pawnbrokers apprentice a scrawny undersized preadolescent who wasnt strong enough to threaten anything with or without a knife the magic that caused a tool to pick up the dagger had been a little too strong once the boy had it he wouldnt let the blade out of his possession in the end rand just gave up and forced the boy to jump into the river and drown himself that kill had been most unsatisfactory on all accounts but it had been early enough in their partnership that rand had not gone off on a tirade hed been human for less than a day and hed been so anxious to get a real kill in that he hadnt done anything but urge orm out to find a second target as quickly as possible every time he transforms hes a little more brutish and not just in looks he never was a personable fellow but he could be charming enough when he exerted himself he doesnt bother to try anymore is this what he really was all along it could be orms meat pie and tea arrived and he began to eat in an absentminded fashion no one bothered him here even the servinggirl left him alone which suited his mood perfectly i should have seen this coming he realized not just that rand was taking steps to make sure that i couldnt escape him but that he was going to make our work dangerous since arriving in kingsford rand had been steadily working his way up the social ladder in regard to his victims he had not been pleased with shensi and only the fact that she was a musician even if it was only in a small fashion had made him agree to settle for her he obviously hadnt liked the fact that orm continued to work the poorer districts hed wanted choicer prey in spite of the increased risk i have the feeling he is working his way up to something he has been planning for a very long time that would explain why he had insisted on coming back to kingsfordwhich should have been the very last place hed want to go he stood a better chance of being caught here than anywhere else in this kingdom and more to the point if he everwas caught the church justiciars would know exactly who and what he was secular constables would only kill rand the church could arrange for a much more prolonged punishment there were rumors about some of their penances for erring priests orm wondered how rand would enjoy being locked back in the body of the black bird then imprisoned in a cell with no door or window and fed seed and water for the rest of his life the higher up on the social scale our target is the more likely we are to get caughtthat was bad enough but what if the ultimate target that rand had in mind was someonereally important he had the sinking feeling that he knew just who that target might be he already knew that there were three women randcould have in mind all of whom were responsible in some way for him being the way he was now there are the two free bards one called robin and the other called lark lark is well out of the way in birnam another kingdom entirely as the wife of the laurel bard of birnam she is well protected but she might be accessible since she would not anticipate being a target nothing is impossible if you are really determined the question is could rand be that determined but if that was to be the case why stay in kingsford they should be traveling now not lingering in a city already warned against them that went entirely against logic and it wasnt likely that rand wanted to stay here to build up more targets there were just as many possibilities on the road if not more and if rand has this woman in mind hed better be prepared to pay me quite a tidy fortune both for having to leave my own kingdom and for targeting an important woman i know rand has money but i dont think rand has that much the woman called robin was the one responsible forrandgetting into trouble in the first place she vanished altogether some time ago shortly after that debacle in gradford involving high bishop padrik given the outcome of that particular incident it was not too surprising that she had disappearedits going to take a while to find her and if shes gone out of the human kingdoms we may never find her but the third woman in question was the one who had actually tried judged and punished rand setting the birdspell on himand given that she too was a priest that made her the likeliest target of rands anger she is quite well within reach at the momentprovided that you are obsessed and not particularly sane orm could not for the life of him imagine how rand thought he would be able to pull off killingher for she was better protected than lady lark justiciarmage ardis high bishop of kingsford not only had the protection of the church she was a powerful magician in her own right how couldrandexpect to get a dagger anywhere near her and whose hands did he think he was going to put it into i dont suppose he thinks to slip the knife into the priestly regalia and wait for the justiciars to excommunicate someone does he we might be here for years if thats his plan he finished his meal and told himself not to panic it could be that rand already knew where robin was he might be building up resources for a kingdom change it could be that hes working his way up to going after lark alone which would not displease me i would be quite happy to part company with him the only problem was that rand would probably part company with orm only if the latter was dead that was hardly in orms plans i will grant that part of this has been enjoyable i have found watching the kills to be quite pleasurable theres a distinct thrill to watching a death and knowing that you were the one who had the power to bring that particular death to that particular person nevertheless this is one set of thrills that i can manage without given the increasing risk he could get a great deal of excitement from other experiences just as easily including a little discreet hunting in the gutters on his own ive learned a lot from working with rand and the lessons havent been wasted unfortunately rand had not learned reciprocal lessons one lesson that orm never ever forgot was never pick someone important enough to warrant revenge if rand wants to change the hunts he can go do it by himself hes still dependent on me to pick the initial targets and if i cant find anything suitable that doesnt include risks i find acceptable well maybe he ought to try hunting on his own again he had to remember that the only real hold rand had over him was to implicate him in the murders rand could threaten and rage as much as he wanted but the moment that orm was outside his own door and into the street there was nothing that rand could do to control him rand might or might not realize that but in the long run it didnt matter words and threats meant nothing if rand wanted his victims he had to leave orm free to find them and set them up for he couldnt do it all himself with that resolution firmly in mind orm paid for his food and left the eatinghouse he would go ahead and scout the district that rand wanted him to work so that he could honestly say hed been there but if there was no good prospectand by that he meant asafe prospectwell hed just have to look elsewhere wouldnt he he passed a group of children playing in the snow and chanting rhymes one of them caught his attention for a moment four and twenty black birds well rand hasnt gotten fourandtwenty victims quite yet but its very nearly that and they arent exactly baked in a piebut they arent likely to sing anymore either orm kept one ear attuned to the music of a hammered dulcimer as he strolled up to the door of his chosen shop there wasnt much traffic on this side of the street most of the pedestrians were over across the way listening to the streetmusician who had set herself up next to a foodsellers stall and there wasnt anyone who looked interested in the shop orm was heading for with the sign of a rusty ax out front there was no doubt that the merchant within dealt in used weapons by going just outside the district that rand had specified orm had found a target that suited both of them by sheer luck a rather homely free bard wench named curlew had a regular stand right across from this particular shop either she hadnt heard the warnings or was disregarding them it really didnt matter the fact that she was a free bard made her irresistible to rand and that was what made it possible for orm to insist on a district that was a step lower than the one rand had wanted to work ashdon the merchant saw curlew at least once every day she went to him to sell him the pins she accumulated in her collection hat from those who couldnt afford to give her even the smallest of copper coins ashdon was terribly touchy about status and normally would never lower himself to so much as take notice of a guttersnipe free bard except that she had something marketable to sell him it was easy for him to clean and straighten pins and when women came into this shop accompanying their lovers or husbands they generally bought all the pins he had assuming from their shiny condition that they were new so he gave curlew just enough attention to exchange a couple of coppers for her handful of pins every day and otherwise ignored her orm strolled into ashdons shop and before the balding stringy fellow could break into his salesspeech he laid a flannel bundle on the counter and opened it inside was a lot of a dozen mixed knives including the allimportant one it had just enough ornamentation on it in the way of twisted gold wire on the hilt to make ashdons greed kick in ten silver orm demanded this was about six more than the collection was worth if you left out the important knife with it the collection was easily worth nine if he got seven he could pretend to be pleased and ashdon would be gleefully certain that hed gotten a bargain ashdon hawked and spit to the side for those he picked one upthe cheapest of the lot look at this he demanded holding the rusty blade up look at the state of these thingsif i can get them clean theyll never sell five silver take it or leave it nine or i walk out of here orm retorted i can take these anywhere and get nine so why arent you somewhere else ashdon replied with contempt youve already been elsewhere and you got told what i just told you six and im doing you a favor eight andim doingyou one orm said with spirit and picked up the special bladecarefully with luck ashdon wouldnt notice that he hadnt removed his gloves look at this thats real gold ive had a touchstone to it its probably goldwashed brass and youre probably a thief trying to sell me your gleanings seven thats my last offer the flat finality of his voice told orm that it was time to close the bargain orm whined and moaned but in the end he pocketed the seven silver pieces and left the bundle feeling quite cheerful rands spell and his own greed virtually ensured that ashdon would decide to put the dagger on his person or have it at hand rather than putting it away with the rest that left the first stage over and done with orm slipped back after dark at closing time to see what ashdon had done with the blade he watched as ashdon closed and doublelocked his shop door and walked off to his home nearby as orm had hoped the weaponsdealer had improvised a sheath and had the dagger on his own belt where it would stay until rand was ready once he touched it with bare flesh he wouldnt have been able to leave it anywhere orm walked off under the cover of the night feeling well pleased they would not strike tonight nor tomorrow nor even the following day despite rands impatience they would wait for two whole days to eliminate the chance that anyone would remember orm going into that shop with a load of weapons to sell that left orm free to scout another part of the city for the next target while they waited for memories to fade two days later orm lingered over a hot meat pie at the stall of a food vendor near curlews stand he would have to slip in and get the dagger quickly once the girl was dead since this was going to be another daylight kill he didnt like that he would have much preferred a nighttime kill like shensi but there wasnt much choice in the matter curlew respected the warnings enough that she packed up and left just before sunset every night and spent the hours of the night playing at the tavern where she slept they would have no chance of taking her after dark for she could not be persuaded to leave the company of others after nightfall for any amount of money while he waited he watched ashdon putter about in his shop making a concerted effort not to show his tension in order for rand to take the man over ashdon would have to put his hand right on the hilt of the dagger normally that happened several times in a day as ashdon made certain he still had the weapon with him but timing could be critical in this case they wanted alot of people in the street when the kill took placethe more people there were the more confusion there would be rand was up on the roof above orms head near a chimney no one would pay any attention to him he was only a bird on the roof granted he was a mansized bird but no one would believe that theyd sooner think that the chimney was unusually small or that there was something wrong with their eyes finally as orms meat pie cooled the watchedfor contact took place rand sensed the contact and took over now orms tension was for what was to come ashdon walked stiffly across the street and waited for a moment until a break came in the crowd then he made a sudden lunge through the gap and knifed the girl with one of those violent upward thrusts that rand seemed so fond of lifting her right off the ground for a moment on his closed fist it seemed incredible that the scrawny little man had that much strength but that was partly rands doing the girls mouth and eyes widened in shock and pain but nothing came out of her but a grunt as usual the crowd didnt realize what had just happened at first it was only when ashdon shoved the body away and it flopped down into the street with blood pouring out over the snow that they woke to what hed done it was a particularly nasty butcherjob the knifethrust had practically disemboweled the girl orm sensed that rand had just vented a great deal of frustration and anger in that single thrust of his blade this was convenient for both of them because the sight of the corpse had the effect of scattering most of the onlookers and sending the rest into useless hysterics now real chaos erupted as people ran screaming away afraid that they were going to be the next victims fainted or froze in place with terror this time there were no wouldbe heroes trying to catch and hold ashdon the crowd was composed mostly of women ordinary merchants or laborers and youngsters not of burly longshoremen or bargemen rand forced ashdon into the peculiar staggering run of his tools that looked so awkward and was actually so efficient orm felt sealed inside a strange little bubble of calm while all about him onlookers were screaming and running in every direction still no one did anythingbut try to escape even though merchants craftsmen and their customers were coming out of the shops to see what had happened no one tried to stop ashdon or even moved to block his escape the ones in the street were all trying too hard to put as much distance as they could between themselves and the knifewielding madman and the ones coming out of the buildings didnt know what had happened yet ashdon sprinted past orm dropping the dagger which was no longer needed for the spell by which he was being controlled now it was orms turn orm darted out into the street to pick it up thencame the unexpected something dove down out of the sky headed straight for him like a feathered bolt of lightning for one crazy moment he thought it was randbut the flash of color scarlet and blue told him he was wrong at the same time he was already reacting he had not been in this business for as along as he had without developing excellent reactions when things happened his body moved without his mind being involved he ducked and rolled snatching up the dagger at the same time and continued to roll onto his feet as his pursuer shot over his head he took advantage of the fact that his attacker had to get height for another dive and dashed into a narrow alley too narrow for the creature to fly or even land in his heart was in his throat what in heavens name was after him he looked back briefly over his shoulder and saw it hovering at the alley entrance the winged thing was a birdman and there was only one birdman in kingsford it could only be visyr the birdman who worked for the duke who had nearly caught another of rands tools during a kill buthow had he known to go after the dagger rather than the tool no matter hed worry about that later now he had to get away as quickly as possible the alley was protected from above by overhanging eaves as orm very well knew from his study of the area and of visyrs own maps the birdman couldnt track him from above or follow him into the alley without landing and coming in on foot losing his advantage evidently he came to that conclusion himself and disappeared for a moment but orm had already gone to ground in a shallow doorway from the birdmans vantage at the head of the alley it should look as if he vanished into the alley and got away and orm doubted that a bird would care to penetrate into a place barely large enough to allow his folded wings to pass cut off from the sky as it was this alley was a claustrophobes worst nightmare with a thunder of wings the birdman slammed into the snow at the entrance and peered into the alley his eyes could not possibly adjust to the darkness in here well enough to make orm out orm could see him as he peered carefully around the edge of the doorway but he couldnt possibly see orm could he orm waited with his heart pounding could the birdman hear that if he did would he know that it was his intended quarry for a moment that stretched into eternity orm waited but the birdman lost patience before orm did with a scream of frustration the birdman turned and launched himself back into the air on the trail of the controlled killer he would be too late of course ashdon was long dead by now rand had certainly forced him into an enormous vat of acid used to clean and etch metal orm waited just long enough to be certain that the birdman was gone then cleaned the dagger in the snow and slipped down the alley he followed it for several blocks crossing streets with care in case the birdman was watching for him from above from there he threaded his way through back streets stopping once to buy a coat of faded blue and exchange it for his brown one stopping again to get a cap and pull it down over his forehead by hunching himself up inside the oversized coat he managed to look much smaller than he actually was from above there was no way to tell he was the same man that visyr had seen taking the daggerhe hoped finally when he was absolutely certain that there was no one watching either on the ground or in the air he washed the dagger in the water from a pump in someones backyard only then did he head homewards shaking inside with reaction at his narrow escape something was going to have to be done if the birdman had gotten involved orm could not spend his time watching for attacks from above as well as trying to snatch the daggers he stopped once to buy a new meatpie to replace the one hed dropped and got himself a particularly strong beer to wash it down with as he ate he listened to the gossip around him for word of the latest kill there wasnt much people werent talking about it in this neighborhood yet that was encouraging at least since it indicated that people still werent paying a lot of attention to the kills of streetfolk like curlew ducal edict or not people simply didnt think such murders warranted much attention good excellent lets hope we can keep it that wayrand should be content for a while he had a female free bard in a daylight kill and that should keep him human for a good while orm hoped that this would be enough to make him very very content because somehow he was going to have to persuade rand to accept lesser creatures and work at night for a while if they did that there was always the possibility that the constables would think that the kills were over or that the cause was a disease or a poison that had run its course in the population with luck no one would look any further than that for a cause above all theyhad to get the birdman looking elsewhere orm still didnt know why hed gone after the person with the dagger and not the man whod done the kill and he didnt like it what if someone among the constables had figured out that thecause of the kills was the dagger that could be very bad if word began to spread among the people of kingsford that these peculiar daggers were dangerous anyone trying to pass one would be in serious trouble and rand was going to insist on that one shape orm just knew it it was part of rands obsession and nothing was going to make him give it up orm sighed pulled his hat farther down on his head and trudged homewards in a dispirited slouch this was all getting very difficult and very dangerous it was more than time to start exploring some options ardis was torn by feelings of mingled grief and elation a mix that made her so physically sick she doubted shed be eating anything for a while the priest in her grieved for the dead mourned over the useless senseless act of murder that had ended the lives of two more innocents but the side of her that was a justiciar was overjoyed by the break in the situation at long last they had a face to go with the knife patrolling in the air as tal had asked him to the birdman visyr had witnessed the murder of a free bard called curlew as he had the first time he reacted instantly and with speed that no human could have matched even though he was a quarter mile away at the time he was literally at the scene in an eyeblink but this time he had not followed the apparent murderer as the culprit ran off this time under tals orders he had kept his eye on the knife and dove for it to try and retrieve it then had come the moment when the break occurred only the haspurs superior peripheral vision had enabled him to catch what happened next as the murderer tossed the knife away visyr had seen a man drop a meatpie hed been holding and sprint across the street running towards the murderer and the knife it was obvious when the murderer ran off that this man intended to snatch up the knife and try to carry it off visyr had gotten an excellent look at the mans face as he turned his dive into an attack and barely missed catching him hed pursued the man but the culprit had gotten into a narrow covered alley and visyr had not been able to follow him in there once hed gotten into that protective cover visyr had lost him ardis felt very sorry for the haspur visyr sator rather was in a position between sitting mantled and perchedon a stool across from her now drooping frustration and depression shaded every word he spoke he felt terrible guilt over his inability to force himself to enter the alley despite the fact that it was a place where he would have been helpless against anyone who attacked him i am sorry high bishop he said again for the fourth time i am truly sorry itried to follow him but the alley it was so small like a rathole visyr youre a haspur your kind get claustrophobia even in small rooms outside your homes she said patiently as she had said before it would have been like asking a man who couldnt swim to pursue someone who went underwater i know that and i do believe you i promise you no one blames you for anything on the contrary you did very very well visyr shook his head still brooding over his failure i know where that alley goes and i tried to find him where it crossed into the open but somehow i missed him either he stayed in it longer than i thought he would or he escaped out of one of the buildings i should havei ought to have he stopped and sighed i dont know what i should have done i only know that it should have been something other than what i did it was tals turn to bolster visyrs sagging selfesteem and he did so you did just fine visyr he said emphatically if you hadnt flown straight back to the palace and hunted down master rudi we wouldnt have this he tapped the sketch on ardiss desk a copy of the one visyr had carried posthaste to the abbey the haspur had really made some incredibly creative and intelligent moves when he realized that the quarry had escaped he flew at top speed to the ducal palace and sent pages scurrying in every direction to bring him duke ardens best portraitartist within an hour master rudi had produced a pencil sketch that visyr approved and the haspur then repeated his speeding flight this time heading for the abbey with the best of the abbey artists working on it they now had a half dozen of the sketches to give to the constables patrolling the areas where streetentertainers performed i doubt that this is the mage ardis continued picking up the sketch and examining it critically it was not an ordinary face although it was not one that would stand out in a crowd either and not just because no one here in the abbey recognizes him you distracted the man pretty severely visyr if hed been trying to control the murdereror rather the tool as tal calls themhed have lost that control at that point and she frowned im not sure what would have happened at that point but the man certainly wouldnt have thrown himself into a vat of acid so you think this is an accomplice visyr asked both ardis and tal nodded we discussed this before the murderer might have an accomplice but we always thought that it might be a priest and a mage working together from the way you described this fellow acting though he seems to be an accomplished thief and that possibility hadnt occurred to us it does explain a lot though and we can speculate on who he is and why hes doing this when weve caught him ardis narrowed her eyes in a way this is going to simplify our task when we catch him i very much doubt that hes going to care to protect the real killer why wouldnt he claim to be a simple thief visyr asked and why wouldnt you believe him if he did it is unlikely that a real thief would try to steal a murderweapon with fresh blood still on it tal said rather sardonically he might try that particular ploy with us but it would take a great deal to convince me ardis sniffed a little creative application of magic as the justiciars practice it would certainly induce him to tell us the truth she said just as sardonically magic isso useful in these caseswere forbidden to torture to derive the truth but the definition of torture includes damage to the physical body and what i intend to use on him wouldnt harm a single hair no hed only think he was being torn limb from limb tal said sardonically oh no nothing so simple as pain ardis assured him no hell have a foretaste of the hell that awaits him there are very few men that have been able to withstand that experience and all of them arewerequite mad she studied the sketch again if you can imagine everything you most fear descending on you at onceand your terror multiplied far beyond anything you have ever felt beforethats a pale shadow of what hell feel and it wont stop until he tells us everything he knows that is why on the rare occasions that justiciars use this form of interrogation we always learn the truth harsh not that he doesnt deserve it tals face could have been carved from stone so far as i can see hes as directly responsible for the murders as if he held the knife there was a strangled very soft moan from visyr oh ardis you stupid woman you look at what you and tal have done to visyr the haspurs wingtips were shivering and hed drawn himself in it was obvious that his mind had still been on his fear of going into that confined space when she and tal had inconsiderately gone into detail about the terrorspells and punishments now visyr was probably experiencing not only the fear he had felt at the alley but the feelings he had suffered any number of other times in his life all the while speculating what it would be like under one of those interrogation spells but visyr ardis said gently trying to correct the situation you dont have anything to fear from us in fact we owe you our gratitude tal echoed the sentiment and added you have been as brave as any of us visyr none of this is your calling yet youve taken to dangerous pursuits twice now you are helping tremendously visyr sighed heavily do you really think this will help he asked ardis exchanged a look with tal and tal answered him i have no doubt of it he told the birdman you can probably go back to mapping for the next few days and with any luck before this monster can kill again well either have him or well have his accomplice and be on the way to catching him visyr gave the inquisitor a penetrating look and ardis wondered if hed heard anything in tals voice to make him doubt the humans sincerity tal looked straight back into his eyes and visyr finally shrugged and rose to his feet i do not fly well after dark he said by way of apology and i would rather not trust myself afoot then either i must go i cant begin to thank you enough visyr ardis told him as tal also rose to let him out you have gone far beyond anything we would dare to ask of you but when tal returned to his chair ardis gave him the same kind of penetrating look that visyr had graced him with well she asked just how useful is this sketch for nowquite useful tal replied but its usefulness is going to degrade very rapidly the moment that this fellow gets wordand he willthat theres a picture of him circulating with the constables hes going to change his appearance hair dye a wig a beard those are the easiest ways for him to look like another person and if hes really clever he knows the other tricks too he closed his eyes for a moment calculating id say the longest this will do us any good is a week the shortest two days she nodded accepting the situation maybe well be lucky tal snorted so far lucks all been with the killer think of it visyr actually had the accomplice cornered if only for a short while and the man got away because he went to ground like a rat down a hole she tried not to grind her teeth with frustration it only made her jaw ache if only she could get her hands on one of those daggers i wish visyr could have gotten the dagger or even a scrap of the mans clothing or a piece of his hair tal said sighing echoing her thoughts well he didnt well have to make the best use of what hedid get us hes getting bolder ardis said thinking aloud this is another daylight killing and in a crowd maybe someone in the crowd saw something the tool this time was the usedweapons dealer across the street so he probably got the dagger in a load of other things tal noted i dont suppose anything couldwellrub off from the dagger with the magic on it ardis pursed her lips and nodded contagion thats not a bad thought to pursue it certainly is going to give us as much as weve been getting off the bodies of the victims if we can at least identify what other weapons were in the lot maybe we can trace one ofthem back to where it came from they continued to trade thoughts on the subject but eventually they found themselves wandering the same wellworn paths of speculation as they had so many times before this ardis noticed this before taland she also noticed something else she was deliberately prolonging the session and he wasnt fighting to get away either were both tired she told herself knowing at the same time that it was only a half truth we both hate idleness and sleeping feels idle we need rest and sitting here and talking is the only way we get it aside from sleeping but there was something more going on and she wasnt going to face it until she was alone youd better go off and get some real rest she said with great reluctance i know this is something of a rest but it isnt sleep and thats what you need if you cant get to sleep ask the infirmarian for something i know i will he made a sour face but agreed to do so and with equal reluctance left the office that set off alarms in her conscience instead of going to bed she went to her private chapel to meditate on her knees with her hands clasped firmly in front of her she prepared to examine herself as ruthlessly as she would any criminal it wasnt difficult to see what her symptoms meant when she came to the task with a determination to be completely honest with herself and this was a road she had already gone down before the simple fact was that she was very attracted to this man tal rufen but the longer she knew him the more attracted she became she knew now that if she had met him before she went into the church she might not be sitting in the high bishops chair the bitter part is that the attraction is not merely or even mostly carnal its emotional and cerebral toothat was another inescapable conclusion he was her intellectual equal and what was more heknew that she was his he showed no disposition to resent the fact that she a woman was the person in charge his temporal superior and i had no real vocation when i entered the church i took vows as a novice in a state of pique and not for any noble reasonperhaps that was why she examined the novices herself when they came to take their final vows she wanted to be sure none of them had come here under similar circumstances and might one day come to regret their choice later she had surprised herself with the level of her devotion once she got past the rote of the liturgy and into the realms of pure faith but her original intent had been to find a place where she would be accepted judged and promoted on her merit she knew that shed admitted it in confession she had thought that she was happy nownow she wasnt sure anymore if the man id been promised to had been like tal i would have been perfectly happy as the honorable lady ardis probably with as many children as cousin talaysen i certainly do not seem to have lost the capacity for carnal desire and attraction drat this was disturbing troubling did this mean a lack of faith on her part had her entire life been based on a lie what am i supposed to do now she asked the flame on the altar what am i supposed to think but the flame had no answers and eventually her knees began to ache giving it up she went to bed but sleep eluded her finally she resorted to one of the infirmarians potions but even though it brought sleep it also brought confused dreams in which a winged tal pursued a murderous mage who had her former betrotheds face the next day brought more work of course just because she was pursuing a murderer that did not mean that other judgments could wait on the conclusion of this case all morning long she sat in sentencing on criminals who had already been caught and convicted and in judgment on other miscreants hearing evidence presented by junior justiciarmages in the afternoon she read the latest round of caserecords brought from other abbeys of the justiciars she hoped that a little time and work and the realization of the direction her emotions were taking would enable her to put some perspective on things tal did not appear to give his report until after dinner but she discovered to her concealed dismay that nothing had changed she listened to his litany of what had been done and the usual lack of progress and wondered what was going on in his mind shethought he had given some evidence of being attracted to her in turn which would have been another complication to an already complicated situation but she was so out of the habit of looking for such things that she could have been mistaken i feel like a foolish adolescent she thought with no little sense of irritation look at me watching him to see if he is looking at me a little too long trying to secondguess what some fragment of conversation means the next thing you know ill be giggling in the corner with kayne we need a more organized effort i think she said at last were going to need more than the tacit cooperation of the kingsford constables i think were going to need active effort on their part do you think fenris would object to that or resent it not really he replied after a moment of thought hes a professional and he doesnt like these killings in his streets i think the only reason hes held back from offering to put on more men to help is that hes afraidyou might resent his trying to get involved after all this is a justiciar case well it ought to be more than just a justiciar case she replied get us a meeting with him tomorrow if you can she broke off as he frowned he had been trying to take notes with a pen that kept sputtering and his efforts at trimming the nib only made it worse only scribes ever learn how to do that right she said after the third attempt to remedy the situation failed here take this keep it i can always get another but to be brutally frank it isnt something you would be able to find easily she handed him a refillable deliambren reservoir pen the only gift her fiance gave her that she ever kept he accepted it with a quizzical look took the cap off at her direction and tried it out his eyebrows rose as he recopied the set of notes hed ruined impressive he said quietly deliambren she nodded one of those things that you have to have connections for i can get another from arden and considering who gave me that i really ought to she smiled crookedly weare supposed to discard everything from our past when we take final vows i should have gotten rid of it long ago and was that reminder of what i am meant for him or for myself he finished his notes and went away intending to go across the river and try to catch fenris in his office to set up that conference for the next day she played with the quill pen that hed ruined for several minutes caught herself caressing the feather and threw it angrily into the wastebasket she was having a serious crisis of conscience there was no doubt of that but secondguessing her lifedecisions was not going to solve anything the cure for all of this is workshe decided and went back to that old file of defrocked priestmages there was something there sheknew it had to be there if only she could figure out what it was thanks to tals investigative work there were some she could remove from the file altogetheralthough she left the drunk in the drunkardact could have been just that an act intended for the benefit of tal alone no she would not dismiss him just yet but if im going to keep him perhaps i ought to reconsider some of the others id dismissed she came to the file of revaner byless she remembered him with extraordinary clarity and every time she reread his file she became more convinced that he fit the profile of their killer perfectly but although the black bird had escaped it was surely dead by now and how could he be doing all this as a bird anyway how could he possibly work magic butmaybe he wasnt a bird anymore a sudden thought struck her with the force of a blowthe recollection of an incidental comment that tal had made dear and blessed goddidnt tal say that visyr had seen some sort of odd bird around during the first murder she scrambled frantically through her notes but couldnt find any mention of it she drummed her fingers on the table wanting to leap up and take a horse across to ardens palace rouse the poor haspur from sleep and interrogate him then and there i cant do that it can wait until the morning i can talk to him in the morning the killer has already taken his victim and he isnt going to take another for a while it can wait until the poor creature is alert and able to actually remember things whats more there are other things i have to put into motion now if its him and those cant wait at all she wrote out a note to visyr and had kayne find her a messenger to take it over immediately if revaner is alive and this is his work then robin and talaysens wife are in danger terrible dangershed tried to send oblique warnings once but now shehad to be more direct she hastily wrote a letter to talaysen and another to the gypsy named raven in the dukes household who might know where robin was or how reach her to warn herthen wrote a third to arden asking him to send the first letter to talaysen by special courier as she finished her letters the messenger kayne had gotten out of the guardroom presented himself and she gave him all four missives her work wasnt over for the night and she knew it revaner this would certainly explain the pattern of victims when we caught the blackguard he was working with a guild bard named beltren i think we should have a little interview with beltren she decided and reached for pen and paper again she addressed the letter to the guildmaster and phrased it in such a way as to make them believe that she had a commission in mind for bard beltren and i do have a commission for him she thought sardonically as she signed and sealed it i do want to hear him sing as the thieves cant has it i want to hear every note he can sing about revaner now she had a last set of letters to write all of them brief and to the point it might be that revaner was already gone on his way after lark or robin and in that case she had to warn anyone who would listen about the danger he represented that meant any and every free bard and gypsy she had ever come into contact with for there was no telling what direction he might take or where he might go from the free bards resident in kingsford to the gypsy called nightingale who was the high kings own special musician all must have every scrap of informationshe possessed above all they must watch for the black bird she still did not knowhow he was doing the killings and there was no telling when or where he might strike this too she told them admitting that she and by extension the church was powerless in this situation was gallingbut better a little loss of pride than another life lost this took precedence over any personal matters she continued to work in a frenzy long into the night writing and dispatching letters to anyone she thought might be able to warn those at risk when it was all done and every letter written she sat for a moment with empty handsweary but still unable to sleep there has to be something more i can do just as she thought that a restless movement at her altar caught her eye and she turned to see the flame flaring and falling like a beating heart there is something that i can do she rose deliberately emptying her mind and heart of any personal feelings and retired to her private chapel to pray it was the one thing she could do for all those potential victims that no one else could with hands clasped before her and her jaw set stubbornly she stared at the flame on the altar laypeople often made promises to god in the mistaken supposition that one could bargain with him she knew better god did not make bargains he seldom moved to act directly in the world for he had given his creations free will and to act directly would take those glorious or inglorious choices from them but she did ask for one small thing let the killing end she begged and if there is a cost to ending it let me be the one to pay it as i am the servant of the sacrificed god let me be permitted to offer myself as a lesser sacrifice let no more innocents die let the deaths end if need be with mine chapter thirteen perhaps others might have stayed discouraged by the failure to either stop the murder or capture the murderers accomplice but visyr was now more determined than ever to help bad enough to have one poor creature slaughtered right under his beak but to have two it was notfair whoever was doing this was not only a murderer but a cheat who hid himself and did his evil work only through others other cultures had a right to their ways and theories of honor were different place to place but this was patently universallynot acceptable he spent a restless night not tossing and turning as a human would but staring into the darkness reviewing his memories trying to think of any other information to be gleaned from his brief encounter with the knifethief but he couldnt think of anything or to be more accurate hecould think of one thing but it made him very uneasy and was discouraging not encouraging if he had gotten a good look at the daggerthief the man in turn also got just as good a look at him there was only one haspur in kingsford and the fellow was probably quite aware of how much visyr could see in a limited amount of time or in other words he had to know that visyr could identify him in a moment now he has surely discovered that our vision is hundreds of times better than a humans and he must have deduced how accurate my memory is after all how else could i be making these maps for the duke even if he didnt know it already that fact is easy to find out it was possible that visyr was in danger himself now and it wasnt going to be all that difficult to find him as tfyrrs experience showed a haspur made a good target especially aloft he would be safe enough in the dukes palace but nowhere else this is not a good thing not at all a good thing the only way to make myself less of a targetbesides being totally absentis to somehow foster the idea that my interference has only been a matter of accident not intent would ardis and tal rufen agree to that i wonder well why shouldnt they they had nothing to lose by it the murderer might become more cautious if he thought that visyr was spying from above watching for him they needed him to become careless not more wary than he already was they needed him to start taking risks not go into hidingperhaps i ought to even stop flying altogether for a while if the killer assumed that visyr was only acting as any rightminded bystander would have he should take only minor precautions perhaps he would simply make certain that he was not acting in the same area where visyr was aloft wouldnt he visyr wasnt entirely certain how a mad human would think and the fellow must be mad to be doing this was it possible that a mad human would react to this situation by attempting to lure visyr into an ambush so as to be rid of him but if he made himself less of a target he not only would not be doing his job for the duke hed be avoiding his responsibilities to the justiciar he ground his beak this was a most uncomfortable position to be in not only that but it was one that went right against his nature hecould stick to safe and expensive areas of kingsford and just go on with his mapping until the murderer was caught but that wouldnt help find the killer and although he had been reluctant at first to involve himself now that he was in he didnt want to give up it feels too much like failure thats what it is it feels as if i personally have failed and i hate giving up besides im not sure they can continue without me maybe thats false pride but the only breakthrough theyve had was because i was able to see the murder in progress and act on it i have been involved in this mystery in a key way twice now so obviously the destiny winds wish to push me in this direction defying those winds can kill or worse leave me with the knowledge of my failure flying with those winds could raise me up and save the lives of innocents or kill me just as surely but at least it would be in doing something right he wrestled with his conscience and his concerns for half the night or so it seemed on the one hand he wasnt a warrior he never had been and all of his reactions and attempts at combat thus far had been purely instinctual instinct wasnt a good quality to keep counting on in this case on the other how could he abandon these people he finally decided that the responsibility was great enough that the risk to his hide was worth it well it seems to me that the place for me to start is in looking for that black bird it was at the first murder and it was at the second i dont know what it is but it has to be involved somehow the few people hed spoken to about it including tal had been mystified by his description and absolutely adamant in their assertion that there was no such bird native to these parts if it wasnt native then what was it doing here its presence at one murder might have been coincidence but not at two and it had behaved in a way that made him certain that it did not want to be seen he felt himself relaxing enough to sleep once hed made that decision satisfied that he was going to take the right course it would be easier to track another winged creature without exposing himself after all it couldnt fly as well as he and he knew from his own experience how difficult it was for something his size to hide and in the meantimehe had the probable advantage of much superior eyesight he could fly at a considerable height and see it where it likely wouldnt be able to see him even if it could it was difficult to judge distance in the sky it might assume he was a smaller bird rather than a large one farther away he wondered what on earth this bird could possibly be maybe it was some sort of messenger to the accomplice maybe it was the eyes that the mage used to view the scene whatever it was it would probably lead him to the accomplice if not to the mage himself the next morning as soon as he was publicly awake a message came for him from the high bishop it had evidently arrived in the middle of the night in an uncanny reflection of his own thoughts ardis asked most urgently if he had seen a large black bird lurking about the two murder sites and before he could form a reply right after the arrival of the message came the high bishop herself she didnt even return his greeting as she followed her escorting page into visyrs rooms the bird she said with intense urgency looking as if she would have liked to seize his arm and hold him while she spoke to him even though her hands stayed tensely clenched at her sides tal said you saw a strange black bird at the first murderdid you see it yesterday as well was it big human sized and incredibly ugly with ragged feathers and a thin slender beak his eyes widened with startlement and he stared at her with his beak gaping open it did it was he exclaimed how did you know did you see it did you know i was going to look for it today how did you know what it looks like i havent described it that closely to anyone i know what it looks like because it isnt just a bird she replied grimly he waved her to a seat and she took it sitting down abruptly and gripping the arm of the chair as a substitute for whatever else it was she wanted to catch hold of its a manor it was if the bird you saw and the one im thinking of are the same creature it was a humanand a mageand a priest before it ever was a bird quickly she outlined what seemed to visyr to be a most incredible story if it hadnt been ardis whod been telling it to him he would never have believed it not under any circumstances oh hedheard of all the things that magic was supposed to be able to do but it all seemed rather exaggerated to him the only magic he had any personal experience of was not the sort of thing that could turn a human being into a bird the kinds of magic he was used to could influence people and events sometimes predict the future or read the past or create impressive illusions hed heard of things that the elves could do of course but hed never seen anything of the sortperhaps he had been among the deliambrens too long but he had a difficult time believing in things hed never seen for himself or seen sufficient proof of still itwas ardis who was telling him this and she said thatshed been the one whod done it turned the man into the bird what was more shed done it more than once so it wasnt a fluke his beak gaped in surprise and he had to snap it shut before he looked like a stupid nestling i transformed another couple of excommunicates into donkeys she continued ones who were indirectly responsible for the great fire and were directly responsible for keeping those of us who could have quelled it from doing so as such as my fellow justiciars and i saw it they were accessories to hundreds of murders it seemed to us that turning them into beasts of burden was actually a very light punishmentand it gave them the opportunity for repentance visyr shook his head unable to understand why she should have been concerned that these people repent like most haspurs he was somewhat incredulous at the concept of omniscience and deities at all but allowed as how they might be possible and it was certainly impolite to say nay around anyone who believed in them believing that human criminals turned into donkeys would want to repent to an omniscient deity went far past the high clouds of logic to him and into very thin airwell that doesnt matter he thoughtshes a human who can understand a human completely not even other humans can and ardis is a church power atop that but you cant turn them back into humans he asked with timei might be able to she said cautiously it would be a bit more difficult than the first transformation because it would be layering one spell on top of another but i think i could the spell as i learned it was never intended to be reversed even by the death of the mage who cast it but i think i could work a reversal out but revanerno no i couldnt the circumstances that created him were so complicated and so unpredictable that i doubt i could reverse them it wasnt justour magic that was involved it was the snapping of the spell that he had cast and the involvement of bardic magic from two bards who were acting on sheer instinct and gypsy magic from revaners victim the chances of deducing just what happened are fairly low and you still arent certain that the bird ive seen and this revaner fellow are the same he ground his beak a little stillwhatever this creatureis i cant see how it could fail to have something to do with the killings you dont suppose that someone else entirely found out how to change himself into a bird do you ardis looked as if she would have ground her beak if shed had one i cant give you any reason why itshouldnt be the case she admitted my main reason for thinking that its revaner is that the pattern of the murdervictims matches the kind of women that revaner would be most likely to want to kill on the other hand on the other hand when you changed him into a bird he wasnt a murderer visyr couldnt help pointing that out no he wasnt he was unscrupulous immoral utterly selfcentered egotistical a liar a thief and ruthless but he wasnt a murderer she wrinkled her brow as if her head pained her on the other hand there is one way to overcome just about any magic and that is to overpower it and one sure way to obtain a great deal of power is to kill someone now when you combinethat fact with the motive of revenge she tilted her head in his direction and he nodded i can see that well i was already going to make a point of looking for that bird and now you have given me more reasons to do so he told her and you have also given me plenty of reasons to make certain that it doesnt see me now ardis rose full of dignity i will not ask you to place yourself in further jeopardy visyr she said solemnly if this is revaner he is very dangerous if it is notwell he may be even more dangerous please be careful in answer visyr flexed his talons a little surprised at how angry and aggressive he felt i am more than a little dangerous myself he said to her and i am also forewarned she looked him directly in the eyes for a long moment then nodded good was all she said but it made him feel better than he had since he lost the daggerthief she left him then and he took his mapping implements and went out to resume his dual duties only to discover that now he couldnt find the damned bird he spent several days crisscrossing the city on every possible excuse he thought perhaps that the black bird might have decided to lurk in places he had already mapped in order to avoid himthen he thought it might be in places hehadnt mapped yet but no matter where he looked for it there was not so much as an oversized black feather it was as if the creature knew he was trying to find it and had gone into hiding on the other hand if all of their suppositions were true and it was in league with the knifethief perhaps it had the suspicion that he was hunting it at the very least it now knew that there was danger in being spotted from above and might be taking steps to avoid that eventuality frustrated he spent all of one evening trying to reason the wayhe thought a crazed human in bird form might it made him a little less queasy to think of it as a hunter as he tried to ignore the type of quarry it was taking he came from a race of hunters himself and it wasnt all that difficult to put himself in that mindset when one hunts a prey that is clever particularly if one is hunting a specific individual one studies that individual of course hed done that himself actually the trophyringhorn that hed wanted to take to syri as a courtinggift had been a very canny creature wily and practiced in avoiding haspur hunters it knew all of the usual tricks of an airborne hunter and it would race into cover at the hint of a shadow on the ground hed had to spend time each day for months tracking it down in learning all of its usual haunts and patterns and in finding the times and places where it was most vulnerable now the black bird was probably not that clever a hunter itself this creature was hunting prey that was not aware it was being hunted nor were humans as versed as that ringhorn in avoiding a hunter but the black bird still needed to find the moment that its prey was most vulnerable it couldnt hunt inside buildings and if it was going to hunt again but didnt want to be seen it had to come out on the rooftops eventually there was no other possible hunting ground for it that was how a haspur would hunt in the same situation but unlike a haspur the black bird might well have decided that there was another hunter that might be stalkingit so it was torn between two courses of action dont hunt at all or find another way to hunt it still has to find prey it still has to find the preys most vulnerable moments but somehow it is managing to do so when i wont see it that would be very difficult to do unless unless it is hunting at night itwas black and perfectly well camouflaged by darkness and if the records were to be trusted there had been plenty of killings at night including at least one possible killing here in kingsford between the first one hed witnessed and the second that meant it had hunted by night before which meant it could probably see just fine at night which unfortunately i cannot but i am not limited to my own unaided eyes which is something that i doubt it has thought of hecould fly at night he just didnt like doing so because unlike tfyrr his own nightvision was rather inferior by haspur standards once night fell all of his advantage of superior vision vanished he couldnt even see as well as some humans he knew that was why he always got back to the palace before dusk and never went out at night if he could help it it was a weakness he had never liked about himself so when the opportunity had arisen for him to compensate for it he had he had something in his possession that he hadnt had occasion to use yet something that would render the best of camouflage irrelevant at night he chuckled to himself as he thought of it there hadnt been any need to use it in duke ardens service because it wasnt at all suited for his mapping duties no one here knew he had it and he rather doubted that anyone in all of this kingdom had ever evenseen this particular device he reached immediately for a bellpull and summoned one of his little attendant pages talons were not particularly well suited to unpacking but clever little human hands were at his direction the boy who answered his summons dug into the stack of packingboxes put away in a storage closet attached to his suite the boxes were neither large nor heavy the few that were beyond the boys strength visyr was able to help with in less than an hour the page emerged from the back of the closet with an oddlyshaped hard shiny black carryingcase the page looked at it quizzically as he turned it in his hands what is this he asked looking up into visyrs face what is it made of its not leather its not pottery its not stone or fabricwhat is it visyr didnt blame the boy for being puzzled the material of the case resembled nothing so much as the shiny carapace of a beetle and the case itself was not shaped like anything the boy would ever have seen in his life ill show you what it is he said to the youngster taking the case from him and inserting a talontip into the lockrelease or rather ill show you whats inside it the outside is a deliambren carrycase for delicate equipment what i wanted is inside but you have to promise that you wont laugh at me when i put it on it looks very silly i wont the boy pledged and watched with curiosity as visyr took out his prize indeed prize it was for arguing with the deliambrens for its design and manufacture had fallen upon visyr himself and it was with no small amount of pride that he knew these very same devices would be in use by guardians and rescuers thanks to him a pair of bulging lenses with horizontal lines made of something much like glass but very dark formed the front of the apparatus the device itself had been formed to fit the peculiar headshape of a haspur and the hard leathery helmetlike structure that held it in place had been added in place of the straps that deliambrens used so that no feathers would be broken or mussed when he wore it that helmet was based on a very old and successful design and the page recognized it immediately it looks like a falcons hood the boy exclaimed and so it did except that where the hood was eyeless this was not meant to restrict vision but rather the opposite with its special lenses in the front and the mechanism that made them work built in a strip across the top curve of the head rather like one of those centerstrip crestlike hairstyles some deliambrens wore it almost looked fashionable and certainly sleek that was so that visyr would be able to fly with the thing properly balanced in the deliambren version the mechanisms were all arranged around the front of the head which would have made him beakheavy it would be very hard to fly that way these are deliambren heatlenses visyr explained to the boy they let me see at night if youd like ill show you how the boy needed no second invitation visyr lowered the hood over his head and turned the device on then turned the lights of the suite off one by one the page held the hood steady with both hands as it was much too large for his head and looked around curiously everythings green he said dubiously then exclaimed when he turned the lenses in visyrs direction sir youre glowing no its just that you only see what is warm visyr told him it is a different way of seeing the warmer something is the brighter it seems to be through the lenses i am very warm and it looks as if i am glowing come to the balcony and look down the boy did so picking his way unerringly across the pitchdark room he passed through the second room came out on the balcony with visyr and spent some time exclaiming over what he saw through the lenses of the device even though it was broad daylight the lenses worked extremely well for things that were warm stood out beautifully against the cold and snowy background the boy chattered on as he picked out a sunwarmed stone courtiers strolling in the gardens birds in the trees near him and even a sly cat slinking along under the cover of evergreen bushes finally though the cold became too much for him they went back into the room and visyr took the hood from him and turned the lights back on he satisfied the pages curiosity then by donning the device himself the youngster looked at him quizzically for a moment as visyr adjusted the device for the sharpest images i wouldnt have laughed the page said finally you just look like a hooded falcon well fortunately i can seemuch better than a hooded falcon visyr said and now that ive found this you can go thank you the page was nothing if not discreet although he might be very curious why visyr wanted this particular device brought out he knew better than to ask just as he knew better than to tell anyone about it deliambren heatvision goggles visyr thought with satisfaction not even the cleverest of hunters can avoid being seen when i have these onnot even if he decides to take to the ground and walk the only way he can avoid me is to stay inside buildings and a mansized black bird strolling through the inns and taverns of kingsford even at night is going to be noticed the deliambrens had included this device in his equipment for the overflight mapping and he had simply brought all of his equipment with him when hed taken the dukes commission it was easier than trying to unpack and repack again or trust it to be sent from another location now he was glad that he had hauled it all with him the goggles were so good he could see things the size of a mouse on a summer day and on a winter day he could do better than that buti think perhaps i wont tell ardis and tal rufen about these he decided i think this will be my little secret if the black bird was out there at night now with these he was on an equal footing with it maybe better it might have the nightvision of an owl but with these he had nightvision that an owl would envy he could hardly wait for nightfall when night came he made sure that the powercels were fresh donned his hood and went out onto his balcony he perched on the rail of the balcony for a while getting used to the way he saw things through the lenses it wasnt quite the same as real daylight vision his depthperception seemed flattened and it was more difficult to tell distances accurately he actually had to judge how far something was from him by the size it was hed never actually flown with these things before and as he leapt off onto the wind he realized that he was going to have to allow for some practice time after all his peripheral vision was quite restricted which meant that he couldnt see as much of the ground below him at a time as he could unencumbered as clever as they were the deliambrens could not give him lenses that gave him the same field of vision that in turn meant that he had to take his timenot hovering but not using what he would call patrolling speed and although the hood and the lenses were relatively light any weight was considerable to a flying creature in a few short hours he was quite tired and ready to quit for the night he returned to the palace with a new respect for the nightpatrols who now quartered the borders of his homeland wearing these things every night of the year they were truly great athletes to be able to take dusktodawn patrols without any significant rest this is going to take time he thought a little dispiritedly as he fanned his wings for a cautious landing on his balconyrail not just one night but several and each patrol is going to take four times as long to fly at night as it does by day and i still have to sleep some time he took off the device as he entered the balcony door and removed the powercells putting them into the device that renewed them by day he set the hood on a peg meant to hold a humans hat and turned off the lights as he entered his sleeping chamber but as he readied himself for sleep another thought occurred to him perhaps this wasnt going to be as difficult as he had thought after all there are fewer places where humans are abroad after darkness falls he realized the black bird wont be in places where there arent any humans so my search can be much narrower he could avoid the docks entirely for one thing there were absolutely no women there at night residential districts were quiet after dark as well the black bird had to go where its prey was and that narrowed the area of search it wont be as easy as i first thought he concluded but it wont be as difficult as it seemed tonight and with that comforting thought sleep stooped on him and carried him away orm spent the next week or so in a state of blissful calm it was a wonderful time and he finally recalled what it was like to serve clients rather than employers he made a vow that he would never again put himself in this position from this moment on he would never have anything to do with people who wanted more than information he had not realized how rands mere presence grated on his nerves until that moment but during that pleasant interval rand gave him no special orders issued no edicts made no outrageous demands uttered no threats part of the reason for that might have been that a reasonably accurate copy of a sketch of orms face was circulating among the constables and even rand realized that if orm ventured out before his disguise was complete rand would lose his allimportant envoy to the outside world even rand would have difficulty in paying the rent or acquiring food in the shape of the black bird and he could not count on being able to find and kill prey to keep him human for very long on his own so orm grew facial hair and altered his appearance meanwhile taking advantage of his temporary human form rand spent most of his time away from their lodgings giving orm even more peace and quiet it was wonderful orm put on weight by cooking and eating luxurious meals secure in the knowledge that he could drop the weight as easily as he put it on the most he heard out of rand was the sound of footsteps through his ceiling or ascending and descending the staircase out of curiosity once his disguise had been perfected orm followed rand to see what he was doingwithout his knowledge of course and it was gratifying to see that the disguise worked so well that rand didnt recognize him at least at a moderate distance orm now had a jaunty little beard a mustache trained so that he always appeared to be smiling and darker much shorter hair he was also some twenty pounds heavier and hed darkened his skin to make it look as if hed been outdoors most of his life he walked with a slouch and a slight limp and wore clothing just slightly too big in this guise he followed rand out into the city staying about twenty feet behind him rand went only two places one a tavern and the other an alehouse that served only drink no food he seemed to be spending most of his time plying offduty constables with drink and talking to them at length now that was actually a very reasonable way to acquire information and one that orm had made liberal use of in the past but was no longer going to be able to pursue his disguise was a good one but there were constables with a sharp enough eye to see past the beard mustache and other alterations to the things that didnt change there wasnt much that someone could do about his eyecolor or bonestructure and although orm had done a few things to make himself look slightly more muscular anyone grabbing his arm would know that those muscles were made of wadding he couldnt change his height significantly and he couldnt do anything about his hairline receding as it was orm would no longer dare to get within conversational distance of any constables unless he was able to ascertain in advance that they were particularly dim ones and unfortunately captain fenris hadnt hired very many dim constables he valued intelligence in his men and rewarded it so while rand pursued whatever harehe had started orm took the opportunity of his absence to begin protecting himself from his employer he hadnt forgotten that threat of exposure not for a moment and if there was anything hecould do about it he would he still had no idea what it was that rand had arranged to implicate him in the murders most probably it was something as simple as a written confession he spent most of one day in rands apartment looking at everything he could without touching it and was unable to come to any conclusions he couldnt see anyplace where such a confession might be concealed and rand would want it to be found quickly after his death so he wouldnt conceal it all that well he would probably count on the fact that he had protected such a confession magically to keep orm from touching it perhaps orm thought as he looked for what to him were the obvious signs of secret drawers or other such devices then again once he was taken he could count on the constables to tear his apartment apart and render the furniture down to toothpicks in an effort to get as much evidence as possible so he could have decided not to waste precious magic and hidden the confession without magic rand might not be a thief or have ever fabricated places where small objects could be concealed but he had money enough to pay those whocould hide things so well that the only way to get them out was to know the trick or smash the offending object to pieces could a mage tell if something was hidden inside another object does it matter i think not it would be easier to smash things and see if there was anything hidden inside quicker too he had to chuckle a little ah the advantage of being on that side of the law he couldnt see any place where possible papers lay out in the open and he really didnt want to open any drawers and search them the message could be magical in nature but would rand waste magical energy that could keep him human in creating a message that could be created in an ordinary fashion that was a good questiononce againit is what iwould do but would randrand hoarded his energies like a miser with coins but would he spend them on safeguarding himself in this way it was difficult to tell but vengeance played a major part in his life so perhaps he would spend that power to make certain of his revenge if orm betrayed him but would he sacrifice a single day of being human hes crazed enough to decide that he wouldnt it might simply be that rand was counting on other factors to implicate orm though it was doubtful that he knew how much orm had learned about magic from him rand could not help talking boasting about his powers and his plans especially in the euphoria that followed his transformation back into a human orm had picked up quite a bit about the way that magic worked and he could be implicated simply by the fact that his magical scent would be all over this place and even though he tried to cleanse the murder weapons they would also carry his traces but what rand would not anticipate was that orm could solve that little problem easily enoughand possibly render any written or magical confession suspect as well he took hair from his own brush put it in a little silk bag and left it among dozens of identical little silk bags holding other bits of flotsam among rands magical implements he had not stolen anything so he took the chance that the guardspells rand surely had on his equipment would not betray him evidently they didnt rand never said anything and orm now had a piece of evidence that would bolster his own protestation of innocence why else after all would the mage have some of his hair except to implicate an otherwise blameless man the hair could be used to do almost anything including to create an illusion of orm at the scene of one of the crimesand that might take care of that incriminating sketch after all hed disappeared after he went into the alleyand that could have been the illusion vanishing and why would rand want to implicate an innocent man in his crimes orm had reasons if anyone asked they might not bother to ask rand was so clearly mad that they might assume this was another of his mad acts but orm intended to claim hed had conflicts with his fellow tenant and that rand had threatened to seek revenge after one of them the assumption then would probably be that rand intended to escape leaving orm to take all of the blame for the murders that was how constables tended to reason and that interpretation suited orm perfectly he also began establishing his own alibis and an unshakable persona as a solid citizen who couldnt possibly have anything to do with rand and his kills first he obtained the registration records from a respectable if common inn that was within a short walking distance of his current neighborhood it didnt take a great deal of work to alter the records so that they showed that he had arrived in kingsford and taken up residence there in early fall had stayed there until early winter then removed himself to the apartment he now lived in he slipped the recordsbook back into the inn the same night he obtained it no one would notice the alteration it was very likely that the people whose names he had removed were there under false identities in the first place this gave him an arrival date that was much earlier than his actual arrival in kingsford and this was a date that conflicted with some of the other murders rand had done outside of kingsford with the church involved there was every reason to expect that at least some of the killings in other cities would be tied to rand that done he began reaffirming his acquaintance with all of his neighbors he already knew them of course and they knew him but now he went out of his way to cultivate them by dint of careful conversations he was able to establish himself in their minds as having been in the general vicinity since that early autumn date listed in the inn records all he had to do was to mention events in the neighborhood that had taken place during that time period as if hed witnessed them and agree with the version the person he was talking to related and how did he learn of those events by asking leading questions of a different neighbor of course it was an amusing game hed find out about event a from neighbor one hed then establish himself with neighbor two by relating event a then solicit event b from neighbor two he would take his tale of event b to neighbor three and so on until he came back to neighbor one with the story of event g and solicit the tale of event h to take on to neighbor two beginning the chain again within a few days at least a dozen people were not only convinced hed been in the neighborhood but that theyd actually seen him there at the times he spoke of it was amazingly easy to convince people of trivial things of that nature hed done it before when hed needed to establish an alternate identity as long as your version of what you wanted them to remember fitted with their real memories you could insert yourself into almost anyones recollections he also established himself in their minds as a very fine affable fellowand his fellow tenant as a rather odd duck surly unpleasant possibly something of a troublemaker that too was easy enough to do since rand didnt go out of his way to be polite when he was in his human form now orm needed a reason to be in kingsford which he established when his neighbors knew enough about him to want to know what he did for a living his profession oh he was a small spicetrader a very convenient profession that required no apprenticeship and not a great deal of capital merely a willingness to take personal risks and a taste for exotic places and danger it was also one that required a great deal of travel at least at first as a young man would build his contacts with spicegrowers or collectors in more exotic lands it was also a highly seasonal profession most trading took place in the spring and fall with summer being the time for a small trader to set up at faires and winter being the time to rest and get ready for spring which would account for his apparent idleness now that he was of middle years he presumably had his spicesources in hand and he should be ready to settle and operate from the secure venue of a shop he needed a city where there was a great deal of trade he told his neighbors and kingsford seemed like a fine choice of a home duke arden was a great leader the city was clearly thriving the people here honest and hardworkingwith the nearness of the faire and the river who could ask for more he was looking for a place for a shop trying to make sure he would have no rivals in the immediate neighborhood hoping to find a suitable place that was already built since he could only afford to lease the place at first this was a simple and understandable explanation for money with no obvious source of income and irregular hours it passed muster with all of his neighbors the only danger was that one or more of them might ask him if he could sell them some exotic spice or perfume oil fortunately none of them did so he didnt have to make an excursion out to obtain what heshould have had at hand and having had their curiosity satisfied abouthim that left rand open to inquiry the fellow upstairswell he really couldnt say what that man did never seemed to be at home very much but never seemed to do anything that you could count aswork either he added a touch of scorn to that last as would be expected from a hardworking fellow whod made his own way in the world without any help from anyone else and finally he managed to get himself an alibi for at least one of the murders the latest he began playing daily games of foxandhounds with an old man living three doors down by the time the week was over thanks to orms gentle persuasion the old fellow would honestly believe and claim that they had been playing foxandhounds every afternoon for the past month since a game of foxandhounds generally lasted all afternoon any questioners would discover that hed been with his neighbor at the time that rands accomplice was trying to make off with a murderweapon now he had his identity established as an honest small trader looking for a home to settle down in and any claims that rand made to the contrary would have witnesses with stories that directly contradicted the mages claims of course given a choice if rand were caught orm would much rather be far away from kingsford he had runningmoney in a belt he wore constantly and knew how to get out of the city quickly by means of routes that were not easily blocked but in case he couldnt run far or fast enough well he had a secondary line of protection he completed his precautions with no time to spare it wasnt long afterwards that rand transformed back into the black bird but even then in a pronounced change from his usual habits the mage didnt stop going outhe simply did so by night and for the first three days he didnt summon orm or attempt to give him any orders this was definitely odd and it was obvious that rand was up to something new by now orm had found another four possible targets so he had something to show for all the time that rand had left him to his own devices but this sudden interest in something besides the usual pattern made orm very nervous what was rand planning given his habits of the past ithad to be dangerous it had better not be revenge on the high bishop orm thought more than once if it isi dont care what his plan is i want no part of it thats not dangerous its suicidal and i am not ready to throw my life away maybe he was planning how to leave the city perhaps he had gotten information of his own on the whereabouts of the gypsy called robin if rand was going to pursue any of his three worst enemies robin would be the safest but if he is going outside this kingdom unless its to a place i already know he can do it without meorm had no intentions of trying to learn his way around a new city with new laws and new customsand coming into inevitable conflict with residents who were already in the same line of work that he was or perhaps he was planning to leave in pursuit of his vendetta with lady lark im having no part of that it would be as suicidal as going after the high bishop it would be worse at least here i am operating in my own cityif rand went off after lark wed be in a kingdom and a city i know nothing about go after someone whos in the kings household and is allied with elves no thank you finally the expected summons came and orm went up the stairs to rands apartment trying not to feel as if he was climbing the steps of a gallows he opened the door to find the black bird waiting for him perched on a stool and watching him with its cold black eye ive got some possible targets for you orm offered but the bird cut him off with a shake of its head i have an assignment for you the bird croaked i want you to follow a man called tal rufen hes probably a church guard since he lives at the abbey of the justiciars even though he very seldom wears the uniform i dont know what his rank is other than that of church guard and not guard captain but hes involved in trying to find us and you can thank him for that sketch of you thats being handed around to all the constables rand did not bother to tell him how he was to follow this tal rufen fellow rand at least gave him credit for expertise in his own area picking up a subject who came and went from a place as isolated as the justiciars abbey would be a challenge but it wasnt insurmountable i want you to learn all you can about him and every time he leaves the abbey i want you to watch his every move i want to know the slightest of details about him what he wears what he carries even what he eats and drinks the bird cocked its head to one side but it wasnt a gesture calculated to make orm feel amused no matter how trivial it is i want to know it i want to know this man better than his best friend do you understand all that orm shrugged and nodded not easy but not all that difficult he acknowledged how long do you want me to follow him do you want me to try and obtain something of his two days at least and no i dont want you to get that close the bird gave a croak of what was probably supposed to be amusement i have reason to believe that he is the high bishops personal guard and assistant and if he thought that something was missing ardis might try to trace it back to whoever took it why is rand so interested in this man and why follow him it didnt make a lot of sense unless no one really made any attempt to pursue us until we came here i wonder if this fellow has something to do with that if thats the case he may be the only reason why the high bishop is interested if rand can eliminate him pursuit may die for lack of interest especially if we can be rid of him by somehow discrediting him he nodded and waited for the bird to give him more orders but rand only yawned and said you may go come back up here when you have your first report for me orm stood up and left now very curious but the only way he was going to satisfy that curiosity would be to follow rands orders and trail this tal rufen fellow the more i learn the more ill knowor be able to deduce whatever pie rand has got his claw into this tal rufen fellow is somehow involved his first difficulty was to discover what his quarry looked like that was easily solved he made up a parcel of unused blank booksblank books being the most innocuous and inexpensive objects he could think ofand paid a boy from his neighborhood to take them to the abbey he didnt want to send real books on the chance that rufen might open the parcel and examine what was in itand if by some horrible chance orm managed to send books that interested him rufen might well try to find the rightful owner to buy them himself that would be a recipe for trouble these were inexpensive blank books of the kind that young girls used for journals and artists liked to sketch in they would hardly be of any use to someone from the abbey who could get better quality versions of the same things simply by presenting himself at the scriptorium where they made handlettered and illuminated copies of books to add to the abbey income someone left these at my table at lunch he told the boy but im not sure who it was it was crowded and there were a number of people i didnt know sharing my table a fellow called tal rufen from the abbey was one of the people there and i would think that someone from the abbey would be the likeliest to have a parcel of books go and see if it was him ill be here doing my inventory no boy would ever question an adult about a paid errand for one thing no boy ever turned down the opportunity to run an errand for pay and for another any boy would automatically assume that the business of an adult was too important to be interrupted for a simple errand he had paid the boy just enough to make it worth the trouble to go across the bridge in the cold and blowing snow he waited until the boy was gone then followed in his wake once the boy had started out on the bridge orm took up a position in a clump of bushes on the bank watching the gate with a distanceglass until the boy arrived when the boy reached the abbey he was made to wait outside rude treatment that was just what orm had hoped for after a bit of time a fellow in the uniform of the church guards came out and listened to the boys story he didnt even bother to look at the parcel he shook his head gave the boy another small coin and sent him back across the river orm got a very good look at the man and was satisfied that he would recognize him again before the boy reached the bridge orm was hurrying back to his apartment where the boy found him it wasnt that tal rufen fellow sir he said when orm answered his door the boy handed over the parcelwhich was remarkably still unopened he says he isnt missing anything orm made a noise of mingled vexation and worry well ill just take it back to the inn and leave it there with the proprietor he said at last waving his hands helplessly i really dont know what else to do what a pity im sure someone is missing these well you did your best and im sorry you had to go out in all that snow he gave the boy another small coin thus ensuring his gratitude and sent him off well now i have a face lets see what that face does he bundled himself up to his nose with a knitted hat pulled down to his eyes and took a fishingpole and bucket of bait out to the bridge there was reasonably good fishing in the clear water under the bridge and he wouldnt be the only citizen of kingsford who paid the toll to perch out on the span and attempt to add to his larder especially not in winter when a job at casual labor was hard to find and no one was building anything only doing interior work this would be the best place to intercept his target and even though his target might well know what orm looked like from the sketch circulating among the constables not even rand would be able to pick orm out from the rest of the hopeful fishermen out on the bridge in the cold nevertheless it was a miserable place to have to be the wind rushed right up the river and cut through his clothing he soon picked up the peculiar little dance of the other fishermen as he stamped his feet and swayed back and forth to try and increase his circulation by the time tal rufen finally appeared mounted on a sturdy old gelding orm was more than ready to leave the bridge he hauled in his line and followed in tals wake the bridge guard looked at his empty string gave him a grimace of sympathy and didnt charge him the toll orm gave him shivering teethchattering thanks and followed in tal rufens wake orms disguise was quite enough to permit him to follow tal unnoticed through the city but it wouldnt have gotten him into the ducal palace and as tal presented himself at the posterngate orm went on with his head down and his shoulders hunched now whatif hed had several weeks to follow tal rufen he might have been able to get himself into the palace by obtaining or creating a suit of livery and slipping over a wall or in the servants gate but with no notice no idea that the man was allowed inside the gates and no time to obtain livery without riskit wasnt going to be possible his best bet at this point was to abandon the pole and bucket somewhere and come back to watch the gate there were plenty of places where he could loiter without attracting attention to himself the palace was surrounded by the homes of the wealthy and powerful like hens clustered around a rooster but unlike the ducal palace they did not have extensive grounds and gardens only little patches of garden behind sheltering wallswhich meant that the area around the palace was a maze of streets and alleys in the summer and at night those would be patrolled by guards to discourage neerdowells and wouldbe thieves but in the middle of winter no one would bother to patrol by day the hard part would be to find a place where he could leave a fishing pole and a bucket without someone noticing and wondering where they had come from in the end he had to wait for a rubbishcollector to come by collecting rags and bones from the refuse of the mighty and throw the items onto his cart when he wasnt looking the ragandbone man would not question his good luck when he found those items the poor never questioned windfalls lest those windfalls be taken from them now freed of his burdens he hurried back to the palace and watched the gate eventually tal rufen emerged but without the horseand no longer wearing his church guard livery that probably meant that the man was planning on going about within the city i just hope he isnt planning on visiting any other places where i cant goorm thought glumly anticipating more hanging about on freezingly cold street corners while the constable did whatever he was doing out of orms sight but luck was with him for tal rufen headed straight into neighborhoods where orm felt most at home and then to orms great pleasure he went into a tavern orm followed him in got a seat at a table near him and warmed his hands on a mug of hot ale while the constable began interviewing people who arrived punctually one with each half hour as if by previous appointment it wasnt too difficult to overhear what he was talking about orm wasnt overly surprised to learn that tal rufen was looking for information about randor rather about the person or persons who had killed the girl called curlew through some miracle of organization he had managed to find many of the witnesses to the kill by a further miracle hed arranged consecutive appointments with all of them why he was interviewing them here instead of in a constabulary though orm couldnt hazard a guess unless of course there were constablesalso interviewing witnesses and there was no room to put all of the interviewers and interviewees that idea rather amused orm the thought of the chaos such a situation would cause why they might not have the room to actually interview criminals it indicated to him at least that the authorities were grasping at straws which was a comforting thought given the inconvenience and worry that the sketch of his face had given him needless to say no one had much to tell rufen other than their obvious eyewitness accounts many of which conflicted with each other one witness swore that the killer had been snarling and swearing at the girl before he killed her for instance another claimed that the killer had slipped through the crowd unnoticed dressed in the black costume of a professional assassin what rufen made of those accounts was questionable though if he was a trained constable he would already know that eyewitness accounts were seldom as accurate as their tellers thought people would change their memories to suit what they thoughtshould have happenedso for twenty people who saw something happen there would be at least three who would make things up that fell in line with their own pet conspiracy theories orm had already taken advantage of that in manipulating the memories of his neighbors to suit his own purposes orm had to admire rufens persistence though he gave no indication that any of what he was told bored or disappointed him he merely listened and took notes with a rather ingenious little pen that never needed dipping in an inkwell deliambren orm guessed most clever mechanisms were deliambren that gave orm another idea he went out and purchased a change of outer clothingthis time something less threadbare but all in black like one of shensis artistic friendsa graphitestick and one of those inexpensive blank books he returned to the inn got another table near tal rufen and ordered a hot drink when the drink arrived he took turns sipping it staring into space and scribbling frantically in the book after one amused look the servingwench left him alone it would have been obvious to any dolt that orm wassupposedlycomposing something probably poetry and probablybad poetry in actuality he was writing down everything tal rufen wore ate drank used and said in something that looked very like blank verse orm knew from experience that between his abbreviations and his tiny crabbed slantwise letters no one could read his handwriting except himself so he had no fears that one of the servinggirls might get curious and read something she shouldnt hed used this particular ruse more than once in his career but never had it been more useful than now so long as a place wasnt jammed with people and so long as he kept paying for frequent refills of his cup no one minded a mad poet taking up a little tablespace he was clean moderately attractive and he gave the servingwenches something to giggle about none of them would make overtures towards him of courseas a class servinggirls were sturdily practical little things and had no time in their lives for aprobably impoverishedpoet any flirting they did would be saved for someone with a steady job and enough money in his pocket to buy more than an endless round of tea he continued the pretense of being a writer for as long as tal rufen interviewed people who had been present at the kill pretended fits of thought gave him the opportunity to stare at the church constable or anyone else for as long as he liked without anyone taking offense because itlooked as if he was staring blankly into space and not actually at anyone the servinggirls found it amusing or touching according to their natures tal rufen noticed then ignored him precisely as orm had hoped the last thing that a constable of any kind would expect would be that a man he was trying to track down would come followinghim so rufen paid no further attention to the poet at the corner table orm was neither impressed nor amused by rufen he was adequate certainly and thorough but hardly brilliant in his opinion there was nothing really to fear from this man except his persistence orm took care to leave first when he sensed that tal was about to wind up his interviews he thanked his latest servinggirl shyly picked up the bag that held his other clothing and stuffed his writing paraphernalia into it and left he ducked into the shelter of an alley and changed his coat back to that of the fisherman pulled a different wool cap down over his head and waited bent over and tying a bootlace for tal to emerge from the tavern when the constable appeared orm gave him a little bit of a lead then followed him from the inn tal went back to the palace got his horse and returned to the abbey without making a single stop along the way by this time it was late in the afternoon and orm doubted that tal would be doing anything more until the morrow it would however be an early day for him most of the people associated with the abbey rose before dawn and he suspected that tal rufen would be no exception orm took his time getting himself a fine dinner and only returning to his apartment after dark coming in through the back he listened for sounds of rand but complete silence ruled the place rand could not walk up there in his current form without making scratching noises on the floor either he was asleep or out and in neither case would he be aware that orm was back orm grinned let him assume that his employee was out keeping an eye on tal rufen all night it would avoid an argument besides the heavy meal made him sleepy as he had hoped it wouldhe was going to have to get up with the dawn if he expected to catch rufen on his way out tomorrow and that meant he really ought to go to bed now if he expected to get a decent nights sleep the following day at dawn orm was back on the bridge with a new fishingline and bucket and while he was waiting for rufen to put in an appearance he actually caught two fish both were riversalmon large and fat and he gave one to the tollguard whod passed him through the day before let the man think that it was out of gratitude orm wanted to have a reason for the man to think well of him and let him out on the bridge without question if he had to come back here anymore he and the guard exchanged a few wordsorm sighed over the difficulties of finding work in the winter complained about showing up where there was supposed to be some work this morning only to find a dozen men there before him the guard made sympathetic noises and promised that orm could fish without toll whenever he was out of work this pleased orm twice overonce that the guard would not be surprised if he didnt show up for a while or indeed ever again and twice because he wasnt going to have to pay out tollfees for the privilege of spying on that damned tal rufen this time when rufen appeared it was at the side of a woman that orm assumed was high bishop ardis he recognized rufen at a distance just by recognizing the old gelding and there was someone else there with himsomeone obviously of very high position within the justiciars it was a woman dressed in a fine cloak and robes of justiciar red and although she was not wearing the miter of the bishopric she was wearing a scarlet skullcap edged with gold under the hood of her scarlet cloak she was also mounted on a fine white mule and most of the justiciars rode very ordinarylooking beasts when they left the abbey given all of those factors it would have been more surprising if the womanhadnt been ardis orm followed them discreetly but they went straight to the headquarters of the kingsford constables and from there to the ducal palace again both were places he couldnt go so he loitered in the freezing cold until they came out again they went straight back to the abbey and did not emerge again that day uneventfulexcept that by seeing them together orm had actually established that tal rufen was acting for the high bishop and as her assistant as well as her personal guard if shed had any other assistant there would have been three or four people going across the bridge to kingsford that was useful information and rand would be pleased to have it the black bird was waiting for him this time and from the look of him was a bit impatient orm heard him scrabbling about upstairs as he paced and went straight to his room as soon as he changed with his notebook tucked under one arm rands eyes grew alert at the sight of it with talons instead of hands of course the black bird was unable to read these things for himself so orm read to him from his own notes the birds eyes grew very bright and when orm was done he gave a cawing laugh good he said very good excellent in fact you dont need to follow tal rufen for the present orm i might ask you to resume later but for now the next couple of days we can concentrate on other things for one thing there are some odd articles id like for you to get for me one or two of those deliambren pens for instance im aware that theyll be difficult to obtain so make a concerted effort to get them baffled orm nodded i suppose that rand is trying to find a way to take rufen out of this equation that makes sense by now it certainly seems that ardis is the main force behind investigating the kills without her pursuit of the case it wont get very far without rufen ardis will be effectively without hands and feet the bishop cant move around the streets unobtrusively and she certainly cant interview the kinds of people i saw rufen talking to today he wondered about the pens thoughunless a lot of spells have written componentswith one of those pens even the bird might be able to manage writing or perhaps he wanted to try writing letters its rand hes crazed he might just want a pen because rufen has one that made about as much sense as anything the important thing was that it looked as if rand was concentrating on getting rufen disposed of and for once orm was in agreement with the madmans ideas if rand decided to take the direct approach perhaps even by eliminating the constable forever well rufen wasnt going to be guarding his own back he was going to be watching out for ardis and if he decided to take the indirect approach there were any number of ways that orm could think of that would tie tal rufen up in complications and even scandal until he was unable to do anything about the murders and meanwhile he isnt going after anyone dangerous and he isnt ranting at me that in itself was enough to keep orm contented for now anyway it might be a warm day in kingsford before he felt completely content again chapter fourteen obtaining the deliambren pen was not as difficult as rand apparently assumed it would be orm had information about who might have such items within a day hed been quite confident that he would have word within a week at the latest although rand obviously was under the impression that such an exotic item would have to be imported at tremendous expense but a small deliambren contrivance while a luxury was also usefuland it was something that a wealthy person would want to be able to show off that meant that the wealthy would not leave such an object safely at home they would take their pens with them when they removed their little prizes from the secure area of their home eventually the pens would be lostor stolen it was the latter that orm was most interested in such things turned up now and again in the goods that pickpockets disposed of to fences there was one minor problem at least as orm foresaw because they were the expensive toys of the very rich they should be relatively rare but orms information led him to believe that there were more of them here in kingsford than in many cities orm had been in this might have been because a good many of them were gifts from duke arden to people he particularly wanted to reward and arden had strong deliambren alliances this was especially evidenced in the presence of the crimsonwinged mapmaker who was word had it in some circles helping arden and kingsford as a token of deliambren concern pens however were more tangible and likely cheaper than even a days work from the haspur the fence that orm was sent to had three of the things all three of them identical to rufens the case was of black enameled metal with a closefitting cap and a lever on the side that somehow enabled the contrivance to drink up the ink it was dipped into the fence demonstrated one of the devices for orm with considerable casualness that suggested he must have had these three for some time how much orm asked the fence laughed what would you say to fifteen silver for the lot orm was extremely surprised at the low price for a deliambren rarity and allowed his surprise to show i would tell you i would buy the lot he said certain that the fence could not be serious and you of course would laugh at me and tell me that of course you meant to say gold and not silver the fence acknowledged his surprise and grimaced i havent had anyone that wanted one of these for a year i would gladly sell you all three for fifteen silver and think myself pleased with the bargain fifteen silver orm thought why thats a fraction of their real value now dont think to go making a profit the fence admonished dont think to take em out on the street and peddle em fact is a constable that notices youve got one of em had better know youre a high muckety muck yourself or youll get clapped in gaol fastern you can think thats the trouble theyre easy tlift but hard tget rid of lots o people look at em and want em bad but whats the point if youre gonna get arrested if you show one then why did you take them if you know you cant be rid of them orm asked i got them in a lot of other stuff the fence told him if id known they were in there i might not have bought it maybe you could take em out of the city and sell em but not hereand youd have to get a good piece away just to be safe the things just are not like jewelry are they orm observed and the fence nodded his round head vigorously preecisely his head bobbed like a childs toy as he waxed enthusiastic you get a bito jewelry thats hard to dispose of you can break it downnot these you even try to open one to see how its put together you got a big mess and a loto little useless bits he speaks as if he had experience with that situation orm thought with amusement i wonder if he meant to try and have the things duplicated he could make a lively business of them if he couldbut i suppose he didnt know that the deliambrens have a habit of making sure no one can actually take any of their devices apart for precisely that reason and if i dont show them in public he asked again the fence shook his head if you figger on keeping these in the house like youll be all right but dont forget and carry one out with you i wont be responsible if you do orm chuckled and promised hed be careful then bought all three pens for half the price he thought hed have to pay for one he tucked them into a hidden pocket inside his coat making sure they were secure from pickpockets it would be supremely ironic to have bought them from a fence only to have a pickpocket steal them back he decided to keep one for himself and give the other two to rand he rather liked the look of the things himself and was already thinking of ways to disguise his so that he could use it in public he always had enjoyed a challenge and this was one worth pursuing as an exercise for his cleverness rand was so pleased that orm had gotten not just one but two pens and quickly that he actually produced a monetary bonus for his employee the bonus was a sizable one large enough that orm was taken aback by it rand hadnt given him a bonus since the earliest days of their association and never one this big rand also gave him the evening offofficiallyand leave to go spend it however he cared to go on the bird croaked enjoy yourself however best pleases you do not return until dawn if that is your wish thank you he said flatly such permission was as galling as the bonus was pleasurable although rand probably was not aware that it was there wasnt much else that the bird cared to say so orm stood up to leave the apartment with mixed feelingsarrogant bastard i can damned well take any night i please any time i please and without his leave orm was half tempted to stay at homebut then another thought occurred to him he might want me out of the house because hes planning on trying something magical and he doesnt want me around when he does so he thanked rand solemnly without showing his anger and went down to his own apartment to consider his actions for the evening curiosity ate at him if rand was going to try something while he was in the black bird form orm might very well want to watchit could be amusing to watch him trying to work magic with no hands orm didnt know much about how actual magic was worked but he had some vague notions culled from tales and common songs this could be quite hilarious if rand had to draw diagrams or mix potions how would he do it with his feet but another notion was not so amusing this might very well have something to do with that earlier threat rand had made if that was the case orm had a vested interest in keeping an eye on the proceedings on the other hand if things went badly did orm really want to be there if he is going to work magic and he makes a mistake because of his formit could be very dangerous i have heard of such things it would be better if i was far away at the time the mistake is made and if rand was doing something that involved orms future would he have been so blatant about wanting orm out of the way no hes mad but he isnt stupid andi have only silly tales to base my concerns on he is the last creature in the world to risk himself rand had been too cautious for too long no he probably wants me out of the way because whatever hes about to do is going to be noisy and he doesnt want me trying to burst in on him in the middle of it thinking hes gotten himself into trouble not that orm was likely to try to burst in to rescue rand from his own magical folly far from it but too much noise of an odd variety and even orm might be tempted to go knock a door down to stop it or too many stinks coming down from aboveorm actually grimaced a little at that thought rand had once perpetrated something that caused the worst odor orm had ever had the misfortune to encounter an effluvia so rank that it burned the eyes and made the nose water made him cough for two days and forced them to get rid of every scrap of food in the house he wasnt certain what had caused that particularly horrid stench it might have been rand trying magic or it might have been rand bringing home something his bizarre bird body craved if something that was going to cause a reek likethat was what rand was up to orm would very happily leave for the evening so he did and for the first time in months enjoyed an evening at one of the citys better houses why not he certainly had the money for it he chose thefragrant orchard a house which accommodated discriminating but not exotic tastesand which hadno entertainment other than good food and the ladies themselves he entered wearing a suit of clothing he had kept back to use for blending in at just such an establishment clearly expensive but in an understated fashion and somber colors even though he had not made an appointment he was ushered to a fine table and the madame herself came to ask him his preferences she sent over a server immediately and his evening commenced beginning with an excellent meal proceeding on to the services of a very talented and supple lady who believed in taking time to appreciate the finer things and ending with a steambath and a massage he even took a hired carriage home although he took the precaution of having it leave him on the corner and he walked the rest of the way it lacked a few hours until dawn there was a certain damp quality to the air that promised more snow though none was falling now could the black bird fly in snow probably most birds could there was no one on the street and not a light to be seen in the windows except for the streetlamps at each corner the only light came from the stars he sniffed the air gingerly as he entered and thought he detected something dubious he went back into his kitchen and made a similar trial of the food but couldnt taste anything wrong there well maybe rand had learned something the last time the hint of bitter aroma was stronger in the kitchen and bedroom than in the sittingroom but opening the windows cleared it out and once the fires were built up again the rooms warmed quickly orm thought once during the process about checking on rand but there was no sound from above and he decided not to bother rand had indicated that he didnt want to be bothered very well orm wouldnt bother him if he was awake and aware he certainly knew that orm was home for orm hadnt made any attempt to be quiet when neither sound nor summons came from above as the rooms warmed up to a reasonable temperature orm decided to complete his night of freedom with a good rest in the morning however the expected summons came in the form of three hard raps on the ceiling of his bedroom orm answered it with a calm he had not expected to feel no matter what rand came up with he was confident that he had everything he needed in place to deal with the consequences but rands new plan was a considerable surprise were going back to the old ways the black bird announced before orm could even say anything i dont need free bards i dont need gypsies i dont even need musicians just womenbut im going to need a lot of them frankly orm the kind of kills we were taking when we first started just dont supply nearly as much power so what we will lack in quality we must make up in quantity but theyre easier to get and you can get a lot of them orm pointed out feeling a little lightheaded from such a pleasant surprise for that matter you could do a few more of the long kills the indoor ones like the jewelerkillthat was how you got more power out of the poorer quality women back when we started the birds beak bobbed as rand nodded agreement youre right and we can do that theres just going to be a slight difficulty for you though orms shoulders tensed a slight difficulty now it comes now he tells me something outrageous what would that be he asked im going to want you to hide the bodies for a while rand told him not forever not even for more than a few weeks i want them found but i dont want them found immediatelyi want them found in a time and place of my choosing oho theres a complicated plan going on here and he has no intention of telling me what it is until its too late for me to do anything about it should i be pleased or alarmed pleased he decided at least the kills would be easier safer in certain cases you might not want to use a tool he said cautiously i could take care of the situation myself oh if the bird had possessed a brow rand would have arched it i thought you didnt do that sort of thing i can make an exception in the case of expediency if its too difficult to find a tool orm repliedand ill be wearing silk gloves so you cant take me over he added silentlyi have no intention of following in the footsteps of the tools but rand only gave a strange gurgling sound that was his equivalent of a chuckle that wont be necessary ive picked out the women already the first one is going to be another of that crowd that lives in the bookstorein fact id like to dispose of all three of the women living there now we could take all of them in a single night if we planned it right the women always come back to the shop long before the men do oh really orm laughed ordinarily he wouldnt have wanted the exposure that came from repeating a pattern but if the bodies were going to be hidden it wouldnt matter fine let me find a place to put them ill go looking now when i have a place ill come back and tell you he wanted to go out immediately because the idea that immediately occurred to him was to use one of the boathouses or small warehouses out on the riverbank pleasureboats were all in drydock at repair houses for the winter and wouldnt go into the boathouses until spring if he could find a sufficiently dilapidated place he might be able to rent it for a bit of next to nothing and if rand doesnt care how and where the bodies are found only when we could dump them all into the river unseen from the boathouse and let the current carry them away if nothing else the bodies could be left amid chunks of ice to preserve them as long as winter lasted there was no reason for customs officials or constables to search boathouses in the winter there was no smuggling in winter worth mentioning failing a boathouse a warehouse would certainly do if it was small enoughbut there would not be the option of a quick and invisible means of disposal of the bodies perhaps it wouldnt be a bad thing to take some initiative before he delivers ordersill go out and find astorage facility he said standing up unless you have something else in mind rand was still in a fine mood and perfectly ready to allow orm to make his own choice apparently good get something today if you can id like to begin immediately with this little project we dont have any time to spare we dont have any time to spare suddenly it seems we have a schedule to meet but orm was not loathe to take the hint and by nightfall orm the spicemerchant had acquired a strongly built but shabby little boathouseand a small warehouse a mere block away from it convenient to the districts in which orm proposed to find most of their kills after all it didnt hurt to bereally prepared five kills in one night and rand was human again in fact hed been human after the first kill a standard scenario for them one girl was alone in the shop the young man whod taken their blade entered the bookshop knifed the lone girl dropped the knife beside the body then threw himself into the river that left the shop empty as they waited for the arrival of the other two girls but it was rand who took up the blade and ambushed the other two as they came in first rendering them unconscious then disposing of them at his leisure he had not personally made a kill since the last woman hed taken as the black bird several months ago orm watched with utter fascination as rand made the second two kills the fierce cold pleasure the man took in the act the surgical precision with which he first disabled them then vivisected them very enlightening he hadnt known rand was capable of that much concentration but then again rand had a great deal to gain from these exercises and the women themselves were limited in use and power unless he drew out their experience as long as he could in the end they were interrupted by the unexpected arrival of one of the men the fellow entered the shop without either of them hearing him and blundered right into what must have seemed like a scene out of the churchs tales of hellfire he didnt have long to appreciate it however as he stood there mouth stupidly agape rand leapt for him both bloodsmeared hands outstretched and reaching for his throat a moment later the man was on his knees at rands feet making gurgling noises as rand throttled the life out of him the mages hands were locked about the fellows throat so tightly that although his victim clawed frantically at the fingers there wasnt a chance of budging him orm watched in detached fascination rand didnt let up until the mans face was black his tongue protruding from his mouth and his eyes bulging froglike out of their sockets then the mage released his grip knuckles crackling and the body dropped to the floor with an audiblethud orm coughed and rand turned he hardly recognized the mage his face was so distorted with a rage and hunger far beyond anything orm could even imagine for one moment orm was actually shocked he had never dreamed that there was this kind of emotion locked within the mage he is far more dangerous than i thought then rands expression changed all in a moment and it was so bland and smooth that orm wondered if what he had seen had been a trick of the light no i dont think so i saw it and thats my warning but id better pretend i didnt see it why didnt you use the knife on him orm asked mildly rand sneered he wasnt worth it the mage said now lets get these husks into hiding before any of the rest come back unexpectedly orm had already made provision for this nights work in the alley behind the shop was a handcart the kind the ragandbone men used to hold their gleanings he and rand wrapped the bodies in sheets of rags then carried the bodies out to the cart which easily held four with room for a pile of rags atop them the alley might have been in a city of the dead there was no sound other than their heavy breathing their grunts of effort thethuds as they heaved the bodies into the cart and the squeaking and rattling of the cart itself when they finished loading the cart they went back into the shop and spent a few moments throwing all the books paper and printing supplies to the floor then dumping out the cans of ink on top of it all when the rest of the group returned it would look as if some enemy had come in and ransacked the shop they might assume it was duke ardens people or the constables if they did they would probably flee without ever reporting anything to anyone no one would ever know what had gone on here which made orm perfectly happy by the time they were done the place not only looked as if it had been ransacked it looked as if several people had worked with great malice to destroy everything here they glanced around for a moment and rand nodded with satisfaction at the extent of the damage then throwing shabby patched cloaks over their own clothing they each took a handle of the cart and trundled it openly out into the street there they were completely ignored even by a passing constable for who would ever look at a refusecollector the cart was well balanced and light but it was still dreadfully difficult to pull when fully loaded as it rumbled and squeaked orm laid aside his concern with being stopped and just concentrated on getting the cart back to the boathouse orm was thoroughly fatigued by the time they reached the haven of the boathouse though rand seemed perfectly capable of hauling the cart halfway to birnam if need be orm wondered about that wondered if the last kill didnt have something to do with this unusual energy or perhaps it was simply because rand got so much exercise in the form of the black bird that he was far stronger than orm would have supposed with the cart inside the boathouse doors and the doors themselves closed orm took up the second stage of the nights work not too surprisingly rand now abdicated in the further work to be done leaving it all to orm orm suspected that the only reason he had helped in loading and pulling the cart was to get the bodies cleared out before anyone else came backhe was able to handle one intruder but a pack of them would have been too much even for a mage but now that they were safely in hidingwell it would all be on orms shoulders and if ormdidnt take certain precautions he could be tied to the kills as easily as rand the bodies needed to be immersed in running water for at least an hour to cleanse them of all of the magical traces of rands powerand incidentally of orms touch that was the easy part orm tied ropes around them and lowered them into a hole hed chopped in the ice there they would remain for the requisite time and in the meantime he and rand changed their clothing cleaned up and threw the clothing weighted by an old stone anchor into the hole when the hour was up they both hauled the bodies out of the water and stacked the nowrigid corpses in a corner throwing an aged tarpaulin over them just in case theyd be frozen stiff by morning and easier to handle by then falsedawn lightened the eastern horizon and orm was so weary he would have been perfectly prepared to share the boathouse with their four guests he and rand made their way back home together like a pair of latenight carousers orm was too tired to even think and too numbly cold to care he fell straight into bed and slept around the clock they made a kill every two nights for two weeks rand remained in human form the entire time and their kills were mostly by simple ambush out on the street there were two more that were under roofs but orm didnt see those instead of using a tool rand handled the kill personally rand was alone with the women and orm stood lookout for several hours afterwards the condition of the bodies suggested that rand had found leisure to be even more inventive than he had been with the bookshop girls and much more like the jewelerkill in grisly details other than those two however the kills were quick the longest part of the proceedings was bringing the bodies back to the boathouse and cleansing them rand picked out the kills rand made the kills usually with a tool and orm cleaned up afterwards with only one body to pick up in the handcart and take to the boathouse cleanup wasnt all that difficult and it didnt take a great deal of time orm became quite confident as he casually wheeled his ragcart past constables though the constabulary appeared more tense day by day during the days he continued to pursue his safeguards as rand spent most of the rest of the days and part of each night engaged in something in the room of his apartment that orm associated with magic orm could hear him walking about up there and wondered what he was doing it was more than idle curiosity after seeing the mages other faceand one that orm was more and more convinced was the true oneorm was very concerned about his own safety when rand went down he wouldnt go without taking orm with him if he could and if rand thought he could arrange for orm to take the whole blame he certainly would the streetkills were in some ways riskier than the ones rand performed through a tool and the powerpayoffs were nowhere near as high orm figured that rand must need the extra power to stay human in order to work on something special he was certainly keeping at his work with amazing diligence the like of which he had not demonstrated before finally after three days without a kill rand emerged from his apartment and came down the stairs to enter orms sanctum wearing that peculiar nervousness that warned orm he was about to change back into the black bird he had a small package wrapped in old silk probably cut from a secondhand garment in his hand and gave it to orm orm unwrapped it he expected another knife but it was one of the pens lying on the yellowed silk in his hand like a sleek slim black fish i want you to find a way to substitute this for the same object tal rufen carries rand said clasping his hands behind him a gesture that orm already knew was to hide the fact that they were trembling uncontrollably when youve done that it will be time to move the bodies pile them up in the deadend alley behind the bookshopno one ever comes there at night try to do it artistically if you can orm nodded what then he asked taking care not to show the slightest trace of dismay but he knewhe knew there was only one reason why rand would want him to plant an object on high bishop ardiss personal bodyguard and assistant i cant believe it hes going to do what i was most afraid of hes going after the high bishop hes beyond insane rand smiled the corner of his left eye twitching tal rufen and ardis will certainly go inspect the site and that is when he broke off never mind just go out now take care of it with that he turned on his heel and left moving very quickly though not at all steadily he was about to turn back into the black bird and he wasnt going to do it in front of orm meanwhile orm was holding himself to this room only by force of will hewanted to bolt now before he got caught up any further in this madnesssteady on orm told himselfi saw this coming im prepared for it the only question is when do i jump i have to pick the time and place when rand wont expect me to abandon him and when hell be the most vulnerable after due consideration he decided to wait until the last possible moment at this special kill itself ill get the pen into rufens pocket dump the bodies the way rand wants me to and wait around for rand to make his move when he does ill get out of here i wont wait around to watch and see what he does maybe all he plans is to get rufen to give the high bishop the pen and then take over her but im not counting on it even if he kills her hes never going to get away with it every church mage in the human kingdoms is going to descend on kingsford to catch the murderer and when they do i am not going to be here to see it the first order of business was to find tal rufen who could well have been anywhere and many of the places he might be were those where orm could not go the simplest course of actionsending him the pen as if hed left it somewherewould just not do it was likeliest that he would check discover that he still had his pen then try to send it back or find its rightful owner the knives had all had magic on them intended to make the person who touched themwant the knife and feel uncomfortable when it wasnt on their person but orm doubted that the same was true for the pen a spell of that nature wouldnt do for an object that was to enter a place that was the home to dozens of mages who would likely sense something wrong the magic on this pen would have to be invisible undetectable right up to the point when rand invoked it find rufenthat was his first order of business so with a hearty sigh he donned his fishermangear and plodded out into the freezing cold to wait on the bridge sooner or later tal rufen would have to pass him here no matter where he went in the city but as the day dragged on orm thought for certain that his luck had deserted him he had gone out onto the bridge before noon and never saw the least sight of tal rufen all day even his fishingluck left him his bait was stolen a dozen times without ever getting a solid bite orm suspected that there was a single clever fish down there that kept taking the bait and passing it out to his friends he could picture the miserable thing now thumbing its nose at himif fish had nosesand telling an admiring crowd just how poor a fisherman orm really was he was just about frozen all the way through his feet numb his fingers aching as the sun hovered redly just above the western horizonrand is just going to have to wait a day he told himself wanting to shout aloud with frustrationmaybe two maybe more after all its not as if i could somehow call rufen out into kingsfordits not my fault that he hasnt been stupid enough to leave a perfectly comfortable warm building and traipse across a bridge in a frigid wind he looked up to gauge the amount of time left until dark and for a change looked back at the city instead of the abbey that was the moment that he saw tal rufen being carried along in a knot of congestion towards the bridge heading for the abbey he didnt stop to think but he didnt move quickly either he already knew what he had to do but he had to make it look genuine im a discouraged fisherman after a day of catching nothing and when i go home i can look forward to no supper im numb with cold and im too wrapped up in my own troubles to pay attention to where im going he bent in a weary stiff stoop to pick up his baitbucket draped his pole over his hunched shoulders and began to make his way towards the kingsford side of the bridge nearing that tangled clot of pedestrians small carts and riders with every step rufen was afoot rather than on horseback and there would never be a better time than this to make the substitution i cant feel my fingers what if they wont work right what if he realizes ive gotten into his documentpouch what if as his mind ran over all the worst prognostications his body was acting as he had told it to act he limped towards rufen with the gait and posture of a man twice his age at just the right moment he stumbled and fell against the constable and even as rufen was apologizing asking if he was all right and handing him back his fishing rod orm was continuing to stumble against him accepting his support and using it to cover his real actions rufen had dropped his documentpouch orm picked it up dropped it picked it up again and dropped it a second time then allowing rufen to pick it up himself in the blink of an eye as orm picked the pouch up the first time the pen was gone lifted neatly out of the documentpouch in another blink as orm picked it up the second time rands pen was in the pouch with the rest of tal rufens papersand rufen never knew his pocket had been picked twice once to extract the first pen and once to replace the pen orm shyly accepted rufens apologies stumbled through a clumsy apology of his own then hurried on to the city as rufen headed back to the abbey orms job wasnt complete yet he still had a bakersdozen bodies to put out before daybreak captain fenris was an actual veteran of combat a survivor of one of the feuds that had erupted among the nobility until the high king came back to his senses and put a stop to them the captain was no stranger to mass slaughter but most of his constables were not ready to see bodies heaped up in a waisthigh pile the callousness of the scene unnerved them completely even the hardiest of his constables was unable to remain in the vicinity of the culdesac only fenris waited there as tal and ardis answered the earlymorning summons the rest of the constables guarded the scene from the safe distance of the entrances to the alleyway its not as bad as it could be fenris said quite calmly as he led the two church officials down the alley no blood and the bodies are all frozen if this had been high summer it would have been bad it was quite bad enough tal had learned after many hours spent in morgues how to detach himself from his surroundings but the number of dead in itself was enough to stun fenriss warning about what they would find made it possible for him to face the pile of about a dozen bodies with exterior calm at least the corpses were all fully clothed in straight positions as if they had already been laid out for burial that made the way they were neatly stacked all the more disturbing just like a pile of logs only the logs had been living human beings before they were so callously piled three of them had been severely mutilated with patterns carved into their flesh patterns resembling in a bizarre way ornamentation these three were on the top of the pile their garments open to the waist to best display their condition of all the many scenes where crimes had occurred that tal had seen over the years this was the most surreal the alley was deep in shadow the sky overcast the area so completely silent that the few sounds that passing traffic made never even got as far as this culdesac this could have been the hell of the lustful the damned frozen in eternal immobility denied even the comfort of their senses inside while part of him analyzed what was in front of him the rest of him was trying to cope with the idea of someone capable of such a slaughterand someone capable of making a display like this afterwards thats whats the most unnerving he strove to take himself out of the scene to view it as if it was a play on a stage but it was difficult not to imagine himself as one of those victims i sent a runner to tell ardens people what do you think fenris asked as he edged his way around the pile have them laid out would you tal asked instead of answering him the bodies were all coated in ice which was interesting for it suggested that they had all been in the water at one time even their garments were stiff with ice and that would make sense if hes using the water to remove magic we could tracethat would be why there was no blood and no obvious bloodstains they had been underwater long enough for the blood to wash out of their clothing and isnt that what all the advicegivers say rinse out blood with cold water to keep it from staining he fought a hysterical urge to laugh fenris nodded at the two silent figures waiting to one side robed and hooded these must be two of the priests who collected the dead in kingsford they said nothing but simply went to work handling their charges respectfully carefully and gently as if the corpses they moved were of the highlyborn or were sleeping not dead tal watching them with surprise and admiration found himself wishing that all those who cared for the dead were as compassionate as these two when they were finished tal walked along the row carefully examining each one interestingly one was male and strangled but the rest were all women and had been stabbed with a third of them the mutilated ones it was difficult to be certain but he thought that the final fatal wound was the knifeblow to the heart that was so characteristic of their killer in the case of the rest except for the man that was certainly so these victims were not musicians but there were enough similarities in how they had died that tal was certain that they tied in with their murderer and he told fenris so you think perhaps that one was someone who walked in at the wrong time fenris hazarded pointing to the lone male tal nodded and those the ones that were cut uphes done this before that gypsy i told you about that was at the hands of a jeweler fenris noted as it always has been at the hands of a tool tal agreed but this time it does look as if hes done the work with his own hands and i have to wonder why fenris leaned over one of the bodies to take a closer look interesting i think you may be right maybe he didnt want to expend the magic he needed to use tools but i can see something else herethese are allwell human flotsam theyre not musicians is he getting desperate could that be why he didnt take tools tal considered that for a moment he might be weve made a fairly good job of warning real musicians off the street but do rememberjust because we havent found tools that doesnt mean he didnt use themthey may simply be under the ice downstream and we wont find them until spring he may need power and a great deal of it that was ardis her face so white and still it could have been a marble likeness that would make him desperate enough to do the work himself and to murder so many in so short a period of time or hes taunting us tal suggested that was his private opinion hes piled up all these victims to saylook at me see what i can do and you cant stop me he knows were after him and he knows we havent got a single idea of who he is or where to find him this is his way of thumbing his nose at us ardis shook her head dubiously i dont know about that ive never heard of a murderer flaunting himself people like this are different tal reminded her they have something to prove they want to show that theyre better smarter than anyone else it enables them to think of the rest of us as inferior but at the same time they have to havesomeone to impress soyou get displays he gestured at the line of corpses though ill admit the displays arent usually this lavish ardis shuddered visibly with this many victimsone person couldnt have moved all of them here in a single night it would take at least two people that means that hehad to help his accomplice this may be the mistake we were looking for i think that there will be traces of both of them heremaybe a lesspracticed mage wouldnt be able to find those traces but if theyre therei will and once i have the scent ill be able to find the men fenris blinked at her at the fierce tone of her voice and stepped to one side your site high bishop he replied in the most respectful of voices tal stepped to the side as well and watched her as she knelt down by the side of the first in line he fingered the pen in his pocket as he wondered what she intended to do the penodd he didnt usually carry it there but this morning he felt as if he wanted it there like a luckpiece the smooth surface was oddly soothing beneath his fingers like the surface of the prayerbeads so many of the priests carried suddenly with no warning at all something seized complete control of him it felt as if his clothingor the air surrounding himhad hardened around him like a shell and the shell had a mind of its own his throat was paralyzed and the air over his face had hardened like a mask keeping his features from moving he watched his heart beating in a panic as his hand slowly came out of his pocket holding the pen exactly like a fightingknife his hand rose with the pen in it and held it in front of his eyes mocking him he knew with dreadful certainty just what this strange and powerful force meant him to do and that the pen had been the means by which it had taken him over how had the spell been put on the pen when and where never mindthe killer now hadhim as a puppet this entire scene had been a trap a way to puthim where the killer could get at him somewhere above them he was laughing and about to use tal just as he had used every other tool he had taken tal knew what his expression washed seen it before on other killers a blank dead mask with only his eyes giving a glimpse of the struggle going on within him only his mind was freeand that was meant to be a torture that he should know what he was doing and be unable to stop it nohe thought at it anger blazing up in himnot this time redhot rage flared inside him consuming him mind and soul he would not let the killer do this again he fiercely fought the magic that encased him and within a few moments he knew exactly why the tools all had strange compressionbruises on their limbs they too had struggled against this shell this second skin of force and their struggle had left bruises where the force crushed their flesh there was nothing for him that he could fight with hismind this was no mental compulsion it was a greater power than his forcing his limbs to do whatit willed as an adult would force a childs clumsy and unwilling limbs to walk he could as well try to force a river in flood to reverse its course nothing he could do would make it release him he wanted to shout to scream but he could not even move his lips his hands removed the cap of the pen and dropped it he advanced on the unsuspecting ardis who still knelt with her back to him the sharppointed pen in his hand held ready to stab her at the base of her skull killing her with a single blow fenris completely oblivious to what was going on had gone to the end of the alley to speak to his men tal heard his voice echoing along the brickwork in a murmur too soft to be properly understood ardis was wrapped up in her magics and wouldnt move until it was too late horror twisted his stomach and throat and sent chills of fear up his backbone anger reddened his vision and put a fire in his belly neither helped he was still a prisoner to the crazed killer and in another few steps ardis would be dead abruptly he gave up trying to fight in all areas but onehis voice hehad to shout to scream to get out something to warn her his body reduced the interval between them to six stepsfive rrdssshe managed to make a strangled noise and ardis looked up and saw him poised to strike hand upraised she was bewildered for a moment probably by his expression or lack of it it would never occur to her that he was a danger to her as he continued to lumber forward he labored to get something more out of his throat despair gave him another burst of strength she didnt understand hehad to make her understand rrrdissshe gurgled through clenched teethrrrnn then she blinked and bewilderment gave way to startlement then startlement gave way to astonishment he saw her tense and start to move she knew as he made his first lunge at her she managed to get out of the way but that put her into the culdesac out of sight of fenris and help and well within his reach as he pursued her chasing her in the filthy slippery alley he was astonished and appalled to realize that shewasnt trying to escape him instead she kept edging backwards as she frowned with concentration and focused her intent gaze on his face he saw her lips moving saw her fingers weaving odd patterns in the air then he knew what she was trying to do and if he could have screamed with anguish he would have my godmy godshes trying to break this thing to save meshell get herself killed trying to break this thing visyr had gone out at dawn brought by the summons of a messenger from the abbey sent by ardis an odd message he had not been entirely certain what to make of it we have victims it had read please meet us at this address but stay up above i want to see whoor whatis watching us that had him a little puzzled why would anything be watching them it wasduring the time of a murder that the black bird appeared not afterwards nevertheless he obeyed the summons launching himself out onto a damp chill wind into an ugly gray morning this was not a day he would have chosen to fly in the air was heavy and the dampness clung to his feathers im going to be latehe realized as he thought about how long it would have taken the messenger to come from the abbey then for one of the pages to bring the message to himit would be just my luck to get there after theyve all finished and gone away he pumped his wings a little harder wishing that the cloudcover wasnt so low he wouldnt be able to get any altitude to speak of in this muck as he neared the area ardis had directed him to he started to scan the rooftops for possible landingspots the address the messenger had specified was in an alley not in the street he couldnt hover there indefinitely sooner or later he would have to land and rest it was then with a startled jolt that he finally spotted the black bird hed been looking for all this time it was dancing around on a rooftop overlooking the alley it probably thought it was hidden from view by an elaborate arrangement of cornices chimneypots and other architectural outcroppings but it wasnt not from directly above and there was something about the way it was moving that was the very opposite of comical in fact the moment he saw it he had the same feeling that vipers adders spiders and poisonous insects gave hima sick shivery feeling in the pit of his stomach and the instinctive urge to smash the cause flat without a moment of hesitation he plunged down after it as he neared the halfway point of his dive it saw him letting out a harsh startled and unmusical set of squawks it fled half flying half scrambling along the roofs like no bird he had ever seen before the very sound of its voice made him feel sick he pumped his wings hard and pursued it with all of his strength whatever it was whatever it had been doingwell it waswrong evil there was nothing visyr wanted at that moment more than to feel his talons sinking into its skull suddenly tal froze in place as a strange series of squawking noises came from up above something flashed by overhead and a moment later tal felt the strangling hold on his throat and tongue easenot much but enough for him to speak at least he wasnt chasing ardis anymore ardis he croaked ardis somethings turned me loose for a moment she stopped what she was doing and held perfectly still im in the spell the magic each word came out as a harsh whisper but at least they were coming out now its like a shell around me forcing me to do whatever it wants i think its using the pennot the knife but my peni think thats how it got hold of me she noddedthen moved but not to run she closed the few steps between them faster than he had ever thought she could move and began taking things away from him virtually stripping him of anything that might be considered a weapon starting with his beltknife and the pen as her fingers touched the pen he felt something like a shock as she pulled it away he felt for a moment as if hed been dropped into boiling lead he screamed the focus of the worst pain he had ever experienced in his life visyr was a hunter more than that he was an angry focused hunter one who had pursued difficult game through the twisting caverns of the serstyll range and he was not going to let this particular piece of game get away from him again he narrowed the gap between them until he was close enough to snatch a feather from the tail of the black bird it wasnt squawking now as it tried desperately to shake him off its track it was saving its breath to fly but visyr the hunter was used to watching ahead of his prey as well as watching the prey itself and he saw what it did not yet notice it was about to run out of places to hide a moment later it burst out of a maze of gables into the open air above the river it realized its mistake too late before it could turn and duck back into cover visyr was on it two hard wingpumps so hard he felt his muscles cry out and he had his handtalons buried in its rump he executed a calculated tumble which swung it under then over him and brought its head within reach of his foottalons one seized its skull the other seized its chest he squeezed and a moment later he landed safely on the docks amid a crowd of shouting excited humans with his prey safely dead twitching beneath his talons of all of orms calculations these events had not entered into them he had been watching from the safety of the recessed doorway of his own rented warehouse figuring that orm the spicemerchant had a perfect right to be in his own property and a perfect right to investigate anyone rattling about in the alley from here he could not see the pile of bodies so he wouldnt know there was anything wrong this was a good place to watch for the moment when rand took over the church constable when rand was completely occupied orm would have a chance to flee but then everything went wrong the constable got taken over all rightbut before he could do anything but chase the high bishop around a bit there was a flash of black overhead followed closely by a flash of red blue black and gray orm had seenthat particular combination before it was the birdman and it was after rand rand who couldnot duck down alleys too narrow to fly in rand who was subject to exactly the same limitations as the creature who was chasing him and who did not have that creatures sets of fingerlong talons to defend himself with oh he had that long spearlike beak but the birdman had a better reach and besides rand wasnt used to defending himself physically the only things hed ever used that beak on were helpless human women not sixfoottall predators the two church officials were out of sight in the culdesac but orm knew what was happening tal rufen was no longer being controlled by rand the high bishop would free him in a momentand she would have the pen in her possession in another nothing he could do or say would take away the fact thathe still had rufens pen in his room and traces ofhis essence would be on the pen in rufens hand ardis was famed for being able to dig the true facts of a matter out of people who might not remember them none of orms alibis would hold up against her investigation once she began unraveling his web of deceptions it would fall completely to pieces rand might die by the talons of the birdman but orm would be taken by the church constables and and hed heard rumors about what they did to prisoners look what theyd done to rand nothing he had planned had included the high bishop surviving rands attack his luck had run completely out he could not run far or fast enough to escape the churchs justice with ardis in charge but for a little while longer at least rufen would not be able to move until rand was actuallydead rufen would be frozen in place there was only one hope for orm only one way he could buy himself enough time to flee kill them bothnow he had learned a lot from rand it would be easy first the woman then the manshe while she was held in frightened shock he while the spell still imprisoned him humans died so very easily a single moment of work and he would be safe lightly as a cat quickly as a rat he dashed from shelter his knives already in his hands just as the spell broke and freed him tal heard the sound of running footsteps behind him he did not wait to see what it was or who it was he could move that was all that counted freed from the force that held him he flung himself between ardis and whatever was coming his body answered his commands slowly clumsily but he got himself in front of her just barely in time and turned to face what was attacking them that was all he had time to do he wasnt even able to get his hands up to fend the attacker away he felt the knife more as a shock than painthe attacker plunged it into the upper part of his chest in a shallow but climbing uppercut through his chest muscles glancing off bone too high to do any mortal damage tal had been through too many knifefights to let that stop him he thought he heard shouting he ignored it as everything slowed for him and his focus narrowed to just the man in front of him the attackera thin supple ferretlike manstill had another knife ardis was still in danger he had to deal with the attacker he was the only one who could cold calm as chill as an icefloe descended over him the wound began to hurt the pain spread outwards through his body like an expanding circle of fire hot blood trickled down his arm and side none of that mattered what mattered was the other man he pushed the pain away pushed everything away except his opponent as time slowed further tal watched the attackers eyes flick this way that way then focus over tals shoulder ardis he was going after ardis his shoulder twitched his upper arm twitched he flipped the knife in his hand so that he held the point he was going to throw that second knife there was more shouting tal ignored it tal distracted him for a crucial second by making a feint with his good hand then lunged for the attacker knocking him to the ground and landing on top of him tal grappled him while he was still stunned keeping him from using the knife then used the advantage of his greater weight to keep his attacker pinned then tal shoved a knee into his chest seized him by the chin with his good hand and began pounding his head into the ground nowanger took over and the red rage completely overcame him he continued pounding the mans head into the dirty ice over and over until he stopped struggling until the body beneath his grew limp there was a growing red smear on the frozen ground of the alley when he realized that there was no more resistanceor movement from the body beneath him it was over there was more shouting but suddenly tal was too tired to pay any attention to it time resumed its normal course tal fell off their attackers chest and rolled over onto his back and stared up into the gray slit of sky above the alley he was tired so very tired his shoulder and chest hurt along with most of his body and he rather thought that he ought to close his eyes now ardis fenris shouted pounding into the culdesac ahead of his men high bishop im all right she managed getting to her feet and stumbling in the direction shed last seen tal theres been some trouble by that time she had seen where tal and the assassin had ended up their battle oh no she ran the last few paces and knelt quickly at tals side feeling the cold and wet of the melting ice seeping through the thick wool of her robe where her knees met the pavement he was unconscious but nowhere nearly as hurt as shed first thought she made a quick assessment of his only obvious injury his shoulder and chesthes still bleeding but hell be all right she judged he remained unconscious but it was because of shock not from any significant damage or bloodloss but as her hands touched him she braced herself expecting a shock to the heart there should have been such a shock there was the sick sensation she always had when she encountered a wound created by human handsthere was concern and relief that the injury wasnt lifethreatening but no shock no heartshattering moment that screamedthe man i love is wounded at my feet just the same feelings she would have had if it had been talaysen who lay there or kayne and that was as much a shock in its way she rose wet robes clinging to her ankles as fenris reached her side someone take care of rufen hes hurt she ordered and striding through the mud turned her attention to their attacker once again she knelt beside an injured man but this time it was with a feeling of grim satisfaction that she should probably do penance for when she returned to the abbey it was obvious without much examination thathe wasnt going to be doing anything more tal had managed to cave in the back of his skull he was still breathing but ardis didnt think hed live for much longer fenris had already gotten four of his men to rig an improvised litter out of two spears and two coats they were lifting tal into it as ardis straightened take him to the abbey she said her mind already calculating where and what to look for to trace the foul magics back to their caster keep a compress on that wound and keep him warm stop at the inn at the corner and requisition a warmingpan full of coals fenris elaborated get one of their cots for a litter and borrow the deadcart to carry him the four men carried tal off and as soon as they were out of sight tal was out of her thoughts as well as out of her hands ardis turned her attention and her concentration back to the scene of the attack fenris didnt ask what had happened but ardis wasnt going to leave him in suspense any longer help me gather up some evidence before it disappears she said in a low voice he took the hint and followed her to the back of the culdesac where she had been tossing items shed taken off of tal when he froze in place something back here was carrying that same spell we talked about she said quietly as he picked up items using a silk glove she supplied and dropped them into a silk bag she held out for him it took over tal and he started after me thenfor some reason he got out a warning then froze i dont know whether he managed to fight the magic successfully or whether something else happened but he got control of his voice enough to tell me what was going on and i started stripping him of anything that could have carried the magic he said and i think she said fishing the pen out of a pile of refuse and holding it up that this is it fenris frowned at it visyr came tearing overhead chasing something black he told her as she dropped the pen into a separate bag i sent men off after him she nodded right after i pulled these things off talthat man came out of the alley with knives youll want to ask visyr but it looks to me as if he bears a pretty strong resemblance to the fellowhe saw she smiled humorlessly its a good thing that tal was pounding theback of his head into the ground or we wouldnt be able to make that identification anyway tal got between me and him and he wounded tal then tal fought him off and got him down and took care of him she didnt have to add anything fenris saw the results for himself more footsteps out in the alley heralded the arrival of one of fenriss men sir he shouted as he came the birdman wants you quick the high bishop too hes killed something fenris gave her a quick glance that asked without words if she was fit to go she smiled crookedly lets go captain theres work to be done she told him firmly this case isnt over yet although i think the killings are tal had been hurt before and it wasnt the first time hed come to in an infirmary he knew the sounds and more importantly the smells pretty well he stirred a little trying to assess the extent of the damagethis time and apparently gave himself away well the sleeper awakes the voice was amused and quite familiar he opened his eyes expecting a headache to commence as soon as light struck the back of his eyeballs and was pleasantly surprised when one didnt hello ardis he croaked sorry but i seem to have rendered myself unfit for duty for a while it happens to the best of us she replied and reached over to pat his hand the touch sent a shock through his body despite weakness dizziness and the fog of painkillers but no sooner had the shock passed then a chill followed that hadnot been the gesture of a woman to the man she loved a caring sister a mother evenbut not a lover and when he looked into her eyes he saw only the serenity of the high bishop and the concern of a friend nothing more nothingless but nothing more had he imagined that there had ever been anything else there if there had been it was gone now ardis went on oblivious to the tumult in his heart we got the mageand there wont be any more murders if it hadnt been for you i would probably be dead and the murders would still be going on because i rather doubt that revaner would have stopped with me a low voice tal couldnt quite hear interrupted her she looked up listened for a moment and nodded he tried to turn his head to see who it was that had spoken to her but it was too much of an effort the infirmarian tells me she said with a quirk of her mouth that if i dont leave you alone to rest hell bar me from the infirmary he told me that youll be well enough in a day or so to make your report and that until then im not to bother you itsno bother he began thickly she reached out again and laid her hand on his rest she commanded you saved my life tal rufen the least i can do is let you have a little peace once again he looked deeply into her eyesbut what he hoped to see was not there if it ever had been then she was gone and it was too much effort to keep his eyes open anymore and that more or less is when i fell over tal concluded ardis nodded it was very good to be sitting in her chair knowing that there would be no more dead women to deal with across from her sat kayne and tal both of them much the better for an uninterrupted nights sleep tal bandaged and a little pale but in good spirits ardis wrote down the final word of tals statement in her casebook and leaned back with a sigh so she said closing it thats the last that well ever know i wish we knew more kayne said fretfully tal said at the same time thats more than enough she smiled wryly at both of them from now on between the two of you i ought to have a completely balanced set of opinions on everything kayne made a face all we know is that revanerdidnt die he escaped we dont know how we dont know how he got where he was when he started killing people we dont knowwhy he was killing people we only guess that he needed the energies for magic we dont know how he met that other fellow or evenwho that other fellow is really we dont know how he persuaded the man to help him but we do know that he was the one behind the killings tal pointed out quietly and wedo know why he was doing them and why he chose the targets he did we know he was building up to take revenge on the people he felt had gotten him into the situation he was in nothing else explains behavior that was completely irrational the fellow he chose for his accomplice was probably a criminal and there was plenty of money on him the easiest way to persuade a criminal is to offer him a great deal of money he turned to ardis i also think that if hed had access to female priests hed have murdered them the way he murdered female musicians in my opinion gathering magical energy was secondary to him and what he really wanted was revenge i suspect youre right ardis agreed as kayne shuddered im just glad i never leave the abbey the novice said i could have been one of his victims ardis put her hand on top of the book glad to have it all over and done with tal is right she said we know enough we know who how and why we might even know enough now to catch someone else who follows the same path we mustnt let this knowledge be lost though may god protect us from another one such as revaner may god help us toprevent another one such as revaner tal rubbed his shoulder and nodded ardis wondered if it was hurting him or if the gesture was only habitwell if it is hes bright enough to take himself to the infirmarian and have it dealt with she thought dismissively and that was not the reaction of a woman in love her peace of mind and heart was back as surely as if it had never deserted her after she had gotten back to the abbey with the body of the black bird and all of the evidence in hand she had not thought of anything else until she had the bones of her solution in place after that she had assigned the rest of the investigation to other justiciarmages so that all of the loose ends could be neatly packaged up with the appropriate evidence she looked in on tal long enough to assure him that the long quest for the killer was over then she sent word to the other orders in kingsford to begin ministering to the souls of the murdered dead and the bereaved living and had gone to bed to sleep deeply nearly twice her normal hours when she awoke again she worked like a fiend to catch up on some of the work shed neglected all these months and only when she had done a full days work did she look in again on tal it was at that moment that she had realized her work her vocation and her duty were more important to her than tal wasand that what she had felt for him might well have been attraction but it wasnt a passionate love one could be attracted to a colleague or a friend but that didnt mean one had to go and make a lover out of him i am as i thought i was and what we have been through has not changed that i am still ardis high bishop of kingsford and true daughter of the church and that is good there will be no more sleepless nights if he felt any different from thatwell she could feel sympathy even pity for him but that was nothing she had any control over he would not die of an unrequited passion and if it went unrequited long enough it would surely fade meanwhile the surest relief for it would be work i hope that the end of this hasnt made you reconsider and that you plan to stay on as my special inquisitor tal rufen she continued i wont hesitate to tell you that im counting on your help from here on there will still be more than enough work for youas kayne can tell you work kayne rolled her eyes theres work enough here for ten special inquisitors and its only going to get worse as kingsford grows ardis spread her hands wide there you have it tal looked at ardis solemnly and searchingly and evidently was satisfied by what he saw in her eyes thank you he said simply i would like to stay since his shoulder was still bothering him tal rufen returned to his bed in the infirmary at the infirmarians orders and drank the potion he was given as obediently as even that worthy could have asked well infirmarian nord hathon asked is everything tied up to everyones satisfaction everyone but kayne tal told him as he lay back down into the soft embrace of the bed with a sigh revaner is rightly tied into all the murders and the names of his tools are cleared of any wrongdoing shes arranged for special services to be held for their souls and the souls of the more obvious victims so now we can all go back to normal routine you arent satisfied the priest asked shrewdly its somewhat bitter justice but ardis claims that the families get some comfort out of it that was true so far as it went tal did not intend to confess the rest of his mixed feelings to this particular friend of ardiss i must have been mistaken when i thought i saw some sign of attraction nono i couldnt have after all shes a priest her first and deepest love is for her service to the church it is the way things are and should be i was deluding myself or it was the stress of the case that made me see things that werent there were my eyes tired or my mind distracted making me see expressions and glances that werent what i thought they were no this is for the best i think when hed looked into ardiss eyes he hadnt seen anything there except confidence in him and simple regard when hed come to himself for the second time in the infirmary she hadnt been there and hadnt made any inquiries about him for a whole day granted shed known he wasnt that badly hurtbut a woman in love would have been out of her mind with anxiety until she saw for herself that he was all right a woman in love would have held a vigil at his bedside she wouldnt have busied herself with work and only dropped by long enough to wish him a cheerful good night the high bishop wants me to take the position with her permanently he continued she says theres plenty for me to do will you take the offer he nodded his eyes closed while infirmarian hathon laid his hands on the wounded shoulder and a soothing warmth spread from them into the shoulderjoint this was another good reason to stay on no secular constable ever got the benefit of magical healing ive got no reason to want to go back to being an ordinary constable again even though fenris offered me a place with his force in kingsford he said this will be interesting im going to learn a lot about magic and at least ardis will believe in my hunches well ardis has seen enough to know that what you call a hunch is merely the result of adding together many many bits of information based on years of experience the infirmarian murmured i believe youll be happy among us and when you finally do retire you will certainly never need to worry about your pension the dukes certainly going to see to that tal laughed maybe the duke was a little too enthusiastic when he wanted to reward all of us he chuckled however im personally glad that ardis persuaded him to give the special medals and ceremony only to the haspur the old bird deserved every bit of being made out a heroand as for me i will be a lot happier if every miscreant in kingsford is not personally aware of whati look like the priest chuckled as well and removed his hands now the duke will have to make sure he has a haspur in residence at the palace from now on or the people will never be happy there he finished now youll sleep tal yawned youre rightaboutthat he fell into slumber only to be awakened by someone shaking himcarefully wha he muttered peering up at a lantern held in one of kaynes hands the other hand was shaking him i hate to do this to you rufen but ardis needs you kayne said apologetically theres been a murdernot in kingsford but outside it this one is going to require more than fenris can supply one of ardens sires was found in his locked study with a knife in his back and the duke has especially asked for you and ardis to come look into it another murder under mysterious circumstances so soon and the duke asked for us now he knew what an old warhorse felt like when he heard the trumpets calling the troops to battle energy surged into him and excitement galvanized him he was wide awake and even if his shoulder had still been in poor shape nothing would have kept him from ardiss side at that moment he swung his legs out of bed and pulled on his tunic the excitement and anticipation he felt at that moment told him something he had not really known consciously maybe it isnt ardis that attracted me it was the job and the challenge and the chance to share both with a clever swiftthinking colleague i thinkthis situation isnt something id ever considered and maybe thats what made me read things into it that werent there ardis is a law unto herself but i have a friend in her a real friend the first one ive ever had maybe its love of a kind but it might not be the romantic kind and not the sort that needs anything physical to seal it and anyway thats clearly how she feels thats hardly bad he was old enough and wise enough to take what he was given and be pleased with it he wasnt going to pine away and die because ardis wasnt in love with him and she wasnt going to run off with him like some daft young idiot in a play he would always envy people who had romantic love the kind the bards made songs about but that kind of love was not for the high bishop of kingsford and especially not with her special inquisitor partners thats all i can be to her and that is not bad at all two hounds in doubleharness thats us sniffing out the scent even if thats all it is its the best thing ive ever had he had a place where he was needed the job he was best suited to and people who valued him and right now his harnesspartner was howling for him and what would the high bishop of kingsford have said if she knew he was comparing her to a dog shed probably laugh and say that more than one man has compared her to a prize bitch then shed point out that justiciars are always called the hounds of god and ask when i was planning on taking orders thats what shed do kayne would have been shocked if he laughed given the gravity of the situationbut he whistled all the way to ardiss study there was work to do the work hed been born to do and in the end that work was more important to him than anything else the game was afoot and his life was better now than he ever would have believed possible he was ready a wrong had been done the hounds had been called and once again the hunt was on
