michael palmer natural causes swampscott massachusetts prologue connie hidalgos contractions had been little more than twinges for the first two hours of the drive but as she and her fiance passed the new london exits on i the tightening within her began to intensify billy i think somethings happening she said gimme a break you been sayin that for a goddamn month and you still got a month to go i should have stayed home you should have done exactly what youre doin which is to make this trip to new york and help me make this buy well at least you couldda taken the mercedes this seat is killing me connie knew that taking the slick sl had been out of the question the last thing billy molinaro wanted was to attract attentionor car thieves besides he never was one to change his routine especially when things were going well the battered ford wagon had always been their way into and out of manhattan there wasnt a chance in the world he would have agreed to doing anything differently this night he hadnt told her how much money they were carrying in the two gym bags stuffed in the tire well but she knew it was plentymore than ever before she squirmed as another contraction built and stared out the window trying to lose herself in the lights and signs as they flashed past she was a slight womanall belly billy kept sayingwith wide dark eyes and a fine smooth face that she had learned made most men want her at fourteen she had delivered a baby girl and had given it away without so much as looking at it now ten years later god had blessed her with a second chance and nothing was going to go wrong nothing billy i love you she said softly in that case light this for me he slipped a fat joint from beneath his seat licked it expertly and leaned toward her billy no its bad for the baby crack is bad for the baby he corrected thats why i havent let you do any since we found out you were pregnant but no one has ever shown nothing wrong with weed trust me on that one well at least open the window connie lit the joint and in spite of herself breathed in deeply as he exhaled as always billy was right she had smoked daily during her first pregnancycigarettes and marijuanaand the baby had been born plump and perfect now listen billy said manny diaz is a slime but after all the deals him and meve done together i pretty much trust himespecially with you around to translate when he wont talk english but this is bigger than any of those other deals so we gotta take extra precautions im gonna have you stay out in front with the motor running you keep the doors locked until i come out and tell you its okay if anything doesnt seem rightanything at alljust get the hell away and call my cousin richie in newark got that i got it i got it another contraction hit connie clenched her teeth and pressed her slender fingers against her womb she had had two bouts of false labor in the past two weeks and felt more certain than not that this was the same deal she checked billys watch if the contractions continued to be this bad she would begin to time them but as she worked at convincing herself that there was nothing happening for her to worry about connie began to experience another kind of painthis one in the tips of her fingers at first she couldnt really call it a pain it was more of a numbnessan unpleasant lack of feeling by stamford the numbness had given way to a persistent electric discomfortworse when she pressed down but not completely gone when she didnt huddled in the darkness she tested her fingertips one by one all of them ached it was nerves just nerves she thought billy had relit the joint one toke wouldnt hurt and it would probably help a great deal connie pulled his hand over pressed her lips to the moist paper and breathed in until she couldnt hold any more it had been nearly six months since she had been even a little bit stoned surely one toke wasnt going to hurt the baby in fact she reasoned with what it had in store the little thing probably needed a buzz even more than she did by new rochelle connie had smoked all of one joint herself the pain in her fingers was no less and the contractions were still coming every five minutes or so but neither bothered her as much billy i feel better she said i knew you would sugar within just a few miles though she sensed the buzzing pain beginning in her toes frightened she tried another joint hey back off that stuff billy said i think the babys coming well i hope he knows enough to stay put until we get this deal done i need you behind this wheel to do it right besides if we blow it the kidd be better off not coming out at all billy im serious and what do you think i amthe good humor man he glanced nervously at his watch right on schedule we pull this buy off sugar and were in the big leagues believe me this is the test dominic has been waiting to give me and nothings gonna fuck it up connie heard the intensity in her lovers voice and clenched her teeth against the throbbing in her hands and feet billy was right it wasnt just their money at stake it was their future when she was younger and fat and unattractive the only thing men ever wanted from her was sex when she changed and became beautiful the men who hit on her had more going for themtook her nicer places but what they wanted was still the same only billy had been different he had made her his girl and from the very beginning he had treated her with respect now they were about to have a child and as soon as this deal was done he had promised they would be married whatever she had to do to help billy molinaro tonight she would do if only the aching would let up just a little with a discomfort that nearly brought tears she reached up and flicked on the overhead light hey whatre you doing billy asked just just looking for a tape to play she glanced at her hands and then quickly switched off the light and pulled them from his line of sight her fingers and thumbs from the first knuckle to the tip had turned almost black the rest of her hands was a dusky gray well well what well what tape did you pick oh ii decided id rather rest please god she thought just let me get through one more hour just one it was after midnight when they rolled down the harlem river drive and turned off onto th street the fierce contractions in connies womb no longer concerned her as much as the fear that when they reached the meeting place she would be unable to grasp the wheel much less drive her left hand now fixed in a semiclaw was nearly useless and although she could work her right hand and fingers even slight movements of them sent intense pain shooting up her arm please god well this is it sugar billy said stopping beneath a streetlight in front of a dilapidated tenement these guys are scared shitless of dominic so i dont expect any problems it never hurts to cut the cards though especially with this size deal so you stay here doors locked motor running ill go up and check their shit if its okay well make the exchange right here on the street okay connie i said okay connie hidalgo her hands and feet throbbing bit at the inside of her lip while the pain from a particularly fierce contraction lanced through her as the tightening subsided she felt warmth begin to pool between her legs her water was breaking pplease hurry she managed the babys going to come soon ii think we need to go to a hospital billy snatched up his test kit and adjusted the holster beneath his left arm you just goddamn keep it together until were done he snapped understand he noticed the pain in her face and his expression softened connie honey everything will be all right i promise ill finish this business with diaz as quick as i can and then if you want ill get you the best damn doctor in new york but remember now keep your door locked and keep your eye out for trouble i love you i love you too connie said but he was already gone with great effort she slid behind the wheel and locked the drivers side door having your water break was no great cause for alarm she thought desperately the birthing class nurse had stressed that over and over again five minutes passed then five more the contractions were hell anxious to distract herself to check her fingers connie again turned on the interior light the gray cold hands with their blackened fingertips looked like some sort of halloween prop she glanced at herself in the rearview mirror something was wrong with her face it took several seconds for her mind to understand the dark ribbons of blood that had begun winding down from her nostrils across the top of her lip and alongside the corners of her mouth please billy please hurry she whimpered she was clumsily searching her purse for a tissue when she noticed the deep crimson stain expanding over the groin and legs of her beige maternity slacks this wasnt the clear or slightly tinged fluid the nurse had spoken of it was blood connie felt dizzy confused she tried to dab at the flow from her nose which now was entering her mouth and spattering down onto her blouse her left arm felt leaden please please someone help me she cried then she realized that the words were in her mind but she could not speak them her vision seemed blurred the left side of her body paralyzed terror beyond any she had ever known took hold at that moment the windshield of the ford exploded inward showering her with glass instantly from across her brow blood cascaded into her eyes she pawed at it with the back of her right hand managing to clear her vision briefly billys body was stretched across the hood of the car his shattered head and one arm dangling lifelessly over the passenger seat beside her soundlessly connie screamed and screamed again through the shattered windshield she could see several men approaching with no conscious purpose other than to get away she dropped her hand onto the gear shift knocking it from park to drive the ford shot forward striking at least one of the men and glancing off several parked cars as the wagon careened onto third avenue billys body fell away connie now more dead than alive looked to her left in time to see the headlights and grillwork of a bus for one brief instant there was a horrible grinding noise accompanied by pain unlike any connie had ever known then just as suddenly there was blackness and peace chapter july changeover day it was exactly seven point two miles from sarah baldwins north end apartment to the medical center of boston todaya mondaythe roads were dry the humidity low and at six am the traffic virtually nonexistent sarah squinted up at the earlymorning glare getting a sense of the day nineteen minutes fortyfive seconds she predicted she straddled her fuji twelvespeedy adjusted her safety helmet and set her stopwatch to zero just fifteen seconds either way had become the allowable margin in the contest more often than not she won over the two years she had been commuting by bike to mcb she had honed her accuracy by factoring into her average time as many arcane variables as she could remember on any given day tuesday or thursday add thirty seconds regular coffee at breakfast instead of decaf deduct fortyfive two nights in a row off call a full minute or more to the good today she also factored in the need to pedal hard enough to feel she had exercised but not so hard as to break much of a sweat she glanced along the quaint row houses lining her narrow street keyed her stopwatch and shoved off once a near fanatic about fitness she had now all but given up on formal workouts instead she would push herself to the limit on the ride to work shower at the hospital and then change into her scrubs for rounds but today nothing would be usual at the medical center of boston as at most of the teaching hospitals around the country this was july changeover day for every physician in training in every specialty changeover day marked a major rite of passage brandnew mds stepping into hospitals as firstyear residents firstyear residents one minute becoming secondyear residents the next for sarah the changeover would be from secondyear resident in obstetrics and gynecology to third year suddenly more responsibility literally overnight less supervision especially in the operating room it helped put some perspective on the tension she was feeling to reflect on the fears she had dealt with on changeover day a year ago or worse the year before that now all things being equal in another year changeover day would usher in sarahs tenure as the chief resident of her department on that day in most situations her decisions her clinical judgment would become the final word it was a sobering thought and although being a chief at a modest facility like mcb was hardly like being one at white memorial or the other huge university hospitals it was still impressiveespecially considering that less than seven years ago becoming a physician had been the farthest thing from her mind she dropped into third gear for the ride over beacon hill and then cruised into the back bay just a few blocks away was the huge corner brownstone that had once housed the ettinger institute of holistic healing as usual when she passed near that building she wondered about peter ettingerwhy had he never answered any of her calls or letters was he married was he happy and what of annalee the west african girl he had adopted as an infant she had been fifteen when sarah left sarah had felt very close to her it was still a source of sadness that their relationship had not survived three years before when she returned from italy with her md degree sarah had stopped by the institute the place that had once been her home and the focus of her life was now six luxury condominiums peters name was not among the residents months later she had learned of xanadu peters holistic community set in the rolling hills west of the city she would drive out there sometime she thought perhaps facetoface they could set some things straight but she never did distracted sarah cruised through a yellow light drawing an obscene gesture from a cabby who was preparing to jump the green be careful she warned herself be very careful the last place anyone should end up was in an emergency room on changeover day as she turned off veterans highway onto the mcb access road sarah checked the time more than twenty minutes already she dismounted and decided to walk the final few hundred yards her little contest had no predictive significance that she had ever discerned nevertheless she did make a passing mental note that this changeover day had begun with a loss up ahead of her picketers lined both sides of the drive jeering those entering to work and occasionally joining in a ragged chant mcb had gone a week or more without a demonstrationthe longest span sarah could remember now some group or other was on the warpath again sarah tried to guess which one nursesrns and lpnsmaintenance transportation security dietary clerical physical therapy nurses aides even house staffat one time or another each had run some sort of job action at the beleaguered institution today it was maintenance down with glenn paris mcb more cock and bull better management not better promises mcb nay hmo yea the placards were in the main professionally done the messages on them ranged from snide to malicious is paris burning well why not pay us or fix it yourself you trust this place with your life whatever their beef with mcb sarah noted the maintenance workers had some money behind them nice day for a demonstration eh andrew truscott a senior resident in vascular surgery as of today fell into step beside her originally from australia truscott had an acerbic wit made even deadlier by an outback accent he could finetune from trace to dense now thirtysix he was the only other resident sarahs age he was a difficult person to warm up torigidly traditional opinionated and too often facetious but he was also a damn fine surgeon the two of them had met the day she arrived at mcb and had quickly connected at first sarah expected that rapportthat sense of comradesinarmsto grow into a true friendship but comradeinarms turned out to be as close as andrew ever allowed anyone at mcb to get still sarah enjoyed her contacts with the man and had certainly benefited from his teaching she also acknowledged to herself that had andrew truscott not been married she would gladly have dusted off her feminine wiles to try and break down his reserve as things stood she was still without the solution to the nagging problem of how she was to become a competent surgeon herself without totally suppressing the need for love companionship sex and whatever else of merit went with life beyond the hospital what would changeover day at mcb be like without a few pickets andrew she said ah yes changeover day at the medical center of boston at the east wing we have a lineup of professional drugseekers duping the new residents with textbook performances of the passing of a kidney stone or the slipping of a lumbar disk at the west wing we have a lineup of disgruntled maintenance workers looking to squeeze a few more bucks from this stone of a hospital aint medicine grand mcb nay hmo yea sarah said since when are the maintenance workers into hospital politics probably since someone told them they might actually get those bucks if everwell took the place over its not going to happen truscott smiled try telling them for several years the ambitioussome said avariciouseverwell health maintenance organization had been waiting and watching like a predatory cat as mcb staggered beneath a crippling weight of fiscal problems labor unrest and the controversy surrounding its emphasis on blending nontraditional healing with traditional medicine and surgery by charter a vote of the hospital trustees if approved by the state public health commission would turn the hospital over to the definitely forprofit operation and each job action each piece of negative publicity brought the unique institution closer to its knees its not going to happen andrew sarah said again things have gotten better every year since paris took over you know that as well as i do mcb has become one of a kind people from all over the world come here for care because of the way we do things we cant let everwell or anyone else ruin that look mate truscott said his accent deepening if youre going to become impassioned about anything youve got to turn in your surgeons merit badge thats the rule you get just as impassioned about things as i do sarah said youre just too macho to let it show she glanced past the demonstrators at the bicycle rack which was empty save two rusted threespeeds whose tires appeared to have been slashed i think the nurses aides were a bit less physical during their strike she observed it looks like my bike gets chained to the bed in the oncall room andrew dont you have the feeling that someone other than the maintenance men has helped organize all this you mean everwell sarah shrugged possibly but theyre not the only candidate thanks to axel devlin there are more than a few people who have the wrong impression about the way we do things here devlin a herald columnist with an unabashedly conservative slant had dubbed mcb crunchy granola general he made it a frequent target of axels axe in his popular take it or leave it column as an md with extensive training and expertise in acupuncture and herbal therapy sarah herself had been mentioned in the column on two occasions not at all flatteringly she never had figured out how devlin learned of her who knows andrew responded with no great interest he nodded toward the dozen or so picketers they are a gnarly group ill say that for them not a tattooless deltoid in the bunch he paused at the door marked staff only and turned to her well dr baldwin are you ready to pop up a level sarah stroked her chin thoughtfully then took truscotts arm what options exist for me are either unacceptable or illegal dr truscott she said lets do it fifty feet above the pristine mountain pool lisa summer poised on the cliffs edge but for the garlands of white lilies around her neck and her head she was naked the sun glinted off her long perfect body and sparkled in her strawgold hair all around her wildflowers billowed blanketing the cliffs and cascading down the rocks beside the shimmering falls high overhead a solitary hawk glided effortlessly against the cloudless azure sky lisa tilted her head back and let the sun warm her face she closed her eyes and listened to the churning water below then arms spread she tightened her toes over the edge took a final deep breath and pushed off wind and spray caressed her face as she floated more than fell past the falls twisting and tumbling through the crystal air downward downward downward hang in there lisa beautiful hang in there the contractions almost over a minute ten a minute twenty thats it thats it oh you did great you did just great slowly lisa opened her eyes she was propped on the futon in her cluttered room bathed in the rays of the earlymorning sun heidi glassman her housemate friend and birthing coach sat beside her stroking her hand across from her waiting were the crib and changing table she had found at goodwill and meticulously refinished the weeks of practice in class and at home were paying off lisa was now in her third hour of active labor but thanks to the series of sensual images she had developed the pain of every contraction so far had been easily subverted dr baldwin called the process internal and external visualization it was she had told lisa a modest form of selfhypnosisa technique that if practiced diligently would enable lisa to make it through even difficult labor and delivery without any anesthesia or other drugs for some contractions lisa used external visualization to send herself soaring off her mountain cliff or for a wondrous undersea ride on the back of a dolphin for others she used internal visualization to see the actual muscles of her womb and the baby boy within and to mentally buffer them both with thick cotton batting howre you doing heidi asked fine just fine lisa said dreamily you look very peaceful i feel wonderful unaware she was doing so lisa slowly opened and closed her hands five minutes apart for nearly an hour i think it may be time to call theres time lisa said she closed her eyes for a few seconds i dont think ive even started to dilate yet her minds eye saw her cervix clearly it was just beginning to open want me to check heidi asked heidi was a nurse who had spent several years on an ob floor now she was poised to assist dr baldwin with the home birth i dont think theres any need lisa said rubbing her fingers now something the matter no my hands feel a little stiff thats all might be retained water let me check your blood pressure heidi slipped a blood pressure cuff around lisas arm and set her stethoscope over lisas brachial artery the pressure ninety over sixtyfive was a bit lower than it had been although still in the normal range for early labor heidi mulled over the change then decided it was of no significance she wrote the pressure down in her notebook and made a mental note to check it again in ten or fifteen minutes whos going to win the pool lisa asked assuming its today oh its going to be today you can count on it in that case kevin will be thirty dollars richer kevin dow a painter was another of the residents of knowlton street there were ten of them in all most were artists or writers and none of them made much money they called their living arrangement a commune and in that light shared almost everything lisa who sold her pottery and occasionally refinished old furniture had lived in the massive gabled house for almost three years and although she had twice slept with one of the men in the commune she felt certain the child within her was not his and had made that clear to him from the outset much to his relief in fact who the father was or was not did not matter to lisa one bit the baby would be raised by her and her alone he would be raised in simplicity with love and patience and understanding and without the pressure of expectations with heidis assistance she stood and walked over to the window her right arm felt tired and heavy can i get you anything heidi asked lisa absently rubbed at her shoulder as she stared out at a squirrel that was leaping deftly along a series of branches that seemed far too pliant to hold it maybe some cocoa she said coming up lisa are you okay iim fine i think another ones about to hit how long has it been five minutes three seconds i think ill do this one standing lisa leaned forward and braced herself against the sill then she breathed deeply closed her eyes and tried to send her mind inside her body but nothing happenedno images no sense of peace nothingnothing except pain she was trying too hard she thought she had to be centeredthats what dr baldwin had taught hercentered and prepared for each contraction for the first time she felt a nugget of fear maybe she didnt know how bad it was going to get maybe she didnt have what it takes she gritted her teeth and stretched her arms and legs tightly how long she asked forty seconds fifty a minute a minute ten the intensity of the contraction began to lessen a minute twenty you okay i am now lisa said backing away from the window and settling down on the futon her forehead was dotted with sweat that one was a bear i wasnt ready lisa swallowed and tasted blood she probed with her tongue and found the small rent she had made by accidentally biting down on the inside of her cheek the pain of the contraction was now completely gone but the weird ache in her arm and shoulder persisted heidi left the room and returned just in time for the next contraction with heidis help and better preparation lisa found this contraction was much more manageable heidi slipped on the blood pressure cuff and once again took a reading eightyeight over fifty and even harder to hear than before i think we should call she said is everything okay everything is fine your pressures fine i just think its time i want this to be perfect it will be lisa it will be heidi stroked lisas forehead and then went to the phone in the hall the drop in pressure was minimal but if it was the start of a trend she wanted dr baldwin on hand across the street in front of knowlton richard pulasky crouched behind his car as he disengaged the highpowered telephoto lens from his nikon he had gotten at least two good face shots of the girl he felt certain maybe more he pulled the frayed photo of lisa grayson from his pocket the girl in the picture didnt look exactly like the woman in the window but close enough it was her and that was that six months of work had just paid off bigtime half the private dicks in town had taken a crack at finding the girl but dickie pulasky had actually pulled it off grinning to himself pulasky slid into his car through the passengerside door with any luck he would be pocketing a fifteengrand payoff within the week chapter sarah secured her bike to the metalframe bed in the obstetrics oncall room over her first two years of residency she had spent nearly as many nights in the narrow cubicle as she had in her own apartmentand none of them very restfully after changing from her spandex into the maroon scrubs favored by her department she paused by the chipped bureau mirror she rarely wore makeup of any kind but in honor of changeover day she smoothed on a bit of palepink lipstick then as she often did just before starting her workday she studied herself for a few quiet moments using sun block religiously during her years in thailand had been worth the effort her skin still had good tone and just a few freckles at the tops of her cheeks there were some faint creases at the corners of her eyes but nothing drastic her dark hairmidback length for most of her lifewas short now and sprinkled ever so lightly with gray on balance she decidedespecially considering two years of lowpaying hundredhour work weeks with no financial or emotional support from the outside worldthe woman in the mirror was holding up pretty damn well as in past years the kickoff for changeover day at mcb was a continental breakfast and a presentation to the staff and residents by hospital president glenn paris several department heads and a member or two from the board of trustees what made this years kickoff different were the security guards checking photo ids at each entrance to the auditorium sarah caught up with andrew truscott just as he was being cleared planning to watch the show from the last row she asked for years truscott had staked himself a seat there at most conferences having seen ol pariss slides from that vantage for four years running i thought i might try something a bit closer fine by me she said as they made their way down the steeply banked aisle of the amphitheater to the second row at our age we might as well begin learning how to deal with presbyopia and otosclerosis anyhow do you happen to know why the security check truscott thought for a moment ill bet theyre searching for lunatics he said lunatics anyone who would come to this affair who didnt absolutely have to very funny thank you i have no doubt our fearless leader will address the heightened securityeither before or after his yearly recounting of the history of our august institution he thrust his jaw out in a caricature of glenn paris in at age fifty medical center of boston moved from the midcity to the outskirts in order to occupy the nine buildings which once comprised the suffolk state hospital better known as the nut house and although that transition was completed decades ago it is still rumored that late at night the ghost of freddy krueger scrubs up and stalks our operating rooms andrew what is with you today is it the chief residency are you just angry at not getting it hardly truscotts sardonic laugh was unconvincing im angry about having my alltoomeager paycheck signed by a man who raffles off elective plastic surgical procedures sends his residents on wellpublicized house calls and has closedcircuit tv put in delivery rooms hes raised thousands of dollars with those raffles and contestsprobably hundreds of thousands and most families love the chance to be part of a birth weve become the second busiest ob service in the city before truscott could respond glenn paris stepped forward and tapped on the microphone immediately staff physicians residents nurses and trustees fell silent glenn mcd paris the president of medical center of boston exuded confidence and success he was only five feet eight but many described him as tall his jaw was as square as any boston brahmins and the intensity in his gaze was arresting he had been described by one supporter as a mix of equal parts vince lombardi albert schweitzer and pt barnum with a dash of donald trump thrown in axel devlin on the other hand had once called him the most distasteful and dangerous affliction to descend on boston since the british six years before a desperate board of trustees had lured paris away from a major hospital in san diego that he had turned around in a remarkably short time the deal they struck with him included the promise of a free hand in fundraising and all hospital affairs generous financial incentives bonuses tied to any hospital profit and the rentfree use of a back bay penthouse donated to the institution some years before by a grateful patient paris had responded with a vigorous campaign to give the hospital a positive easily definable image and to turn its red ink to black at all costs in some ways the man had succeeded the hospitals staggering debt had leveled off if not lessened at the same time its increasing emphasis on wholebody medicine and personalized treatment had led to a growing reputation as a caring medical center but there was still a lack of respect for the institution in many quarters both public and academic and the feeling among some trustees that before long the hospital would simply have to move in other directions good morning troops paris began i want to welcome you to the official beginning of mcbs ninetieth year the purpose of this annual kickoff is to introduce our new house staff and to help them feel at home he motioned for the new residents to stand and led a round of applause you should know he said to them that your group represents the best mcb has ever been matched up with in the national resident matching program again applause several of the residents shifted uncomfortably obviously wishing they could sit down paris beaming as if he were showing off his children kept them standing the news of the high matchhospitals make their preferential list prospective residents make theirs and a computer does the resthad been well publicized but he was not one to miss the chance to milk such a success for all it was worth truscott leaned over toward sarah note how carefully fearless leader neglects to add that although the match is the highest in mcb history it still ranks below any of the other boston teaching hospitals for true blankenship let that one slip out at lunch last week dr eli blankenship the chief of staff was also the head of the mcb resident training program it was his impressive knowledge of alternative healing and his enlightened attitude toward sarahs desire to blend her techniques that had convinced her to rank mcb number one on her match list at the time largely because of her unique background and high scores on the national medical boards several more prestigious hospitals had already expressed interest in her please sit down paris said finally in at age fifty truscott murmured before going any further the ceo continued i want to address the heightened security to which you were all subjected this morning over the past year too much of this hospitals business has been finding its way to certain reporters and other special interests who have gone out of their way to paint an unfavorable and damaging picture of the medical center of boston some of these leaks involve the minor daytoday errorsno most are too trivial to be called errorsi should say problems in patient care which plague any hospital and which are never shared with the public others involve exchanges at our staff meetings and conferences sarahs beeper went off the readout summoning her to an outside call wishing she could have crawled to the end of the row rather than stand up directly in front of paris she made her way to the nearest auditorium phone all hospitals paris continued are in competition to maintain their allotment of beds and to keep a reasonable percentage of those beds filled and as you know that competition is often intense hospitals as large and prestigious as white memorial now advertise in the yellow pages negative publicity for mcb especially groundless negative publicity hurts every one of us from now on no unauthorized personnel will be allowed in our medical rounds or staff meetings further anyone other than our public relations office who speaks about hospital business with the press will be asked to leave our employ sarah listened for a minute to her call gave some instructions and returned to her seat one of my home birth patients is in active labor she whispered shes still got a ways to go but her bps a little low i hope this program doesnt run over youre doing home births yourself truscott looked at her incredulously no andrew i assure you i only look dumb dr snyder will be coming out with me this will be our second one randall snyder the obgyn chief was one of those seated on the stage behind glenn paris as sarah nodded up toward him she realized that paris had stopped speaking and was glowering down at her sorry she mouthed color rushing to her cheeks thank you paris mouthed in return he cleared his throat and took a sip of water the silence in the hall was dramatic believe me he went on finally this subversion from within is serious serious business as you know outside interests and some more financially secure institutions have been just waiting for us to go under ours is an attractive facility with a wonderful location but those folks are in for a rude awakening my friends a rude awakening for some time now i have been negotiating with a very wellendowed philanthropic group whose primary aim is the improvement of health care we are currently on the home stretch of an extensive grant application if that grant comes throughand at present all the signs are rightmcb will have financial stability and a vast capability to grow that was the goal i set with you six years ago and today i am pleased to state that it is a goal well within our reach there was a smattering of applause which gradually spread until all in the auditoriumincluding andrewhad joined in thats the spirit sarah said to him my hands were getting cold truscott replied behind the podium glenn paris again was beaming please dont stop on my account he said as the response died down hes a crafty one truscott whispered beneath the laughter that followed pariss comment ill say that for him hes working a miracle hes hyping himself before i introduce those seated behind me paris went on and while we are on the subject of outside interference in hospital business i want to say just a few words about the gauntlet of demonstrators some of you were forced to traverse to get here this morning some on our maintenance staff are currently conducting an illegal job action which we have good reason to believe has been instigated and is being abetted by one of those operations committed to our demise mark me well we shall not allow them to interfere one iota with patient care or any other business of this institution he pounded his fist on the podium for emphasis and that you can take to the bank the word bank was still reverberating throughout the amphitheater when a set of power lines was crossed causing the main electrical generator at mcb to short out the backup system supplying electricity to the operating rooms icus and part of the emergency ward kicked in immediately but the amphitheater which was windowless was thrown into instant stygian darkness the kickoff program for changeover day was over chapter if sarah had a role model in her practice of obstetrics and gynecology it was her chief dr randall snyder from his softspoken manner to his gray volvo sedan everything about the man was fatherly and reassuring now in his midfifties he still approached his solo practice with exuberance and compassion when a new technique or treatment in his field was announced he would be one of the first in line to learn it if an uninsured clinic patient had a problem pregnancy he would accept her as his private patient without a word about payment today randall snyder was taking time from his busy schedule to drive sarah to the jamaica plains section of the city there he would assist her in performing a home delivery on a twentythreeyearold unwed woman with no health insurance and an inordinate fear of doctors and hospitals how do you do it sarah asked as they drove do what snyder turned down the volume on the bach cantata he was playing on the tape deck keep on doing medicine the way you do without letting it get to you snyder stifled most of a smile do you want to define it oh you knowthe peer reviews and the lawyers and the insurance companies and government telling you what you can and cant charge for your work the mountains of paperwork and the constant threat that youll offend some vindictive or imbalanced patient wholl lodge a complaint about you or sue you oh that it snyder said sarah as far as im concerned youre not even talking about the real stress on this job the cases that dont come out right the people with untreatable illness the people who die in spite of everything we do but thats medicine the other stuff is is is medicine too its part of the package believe me im not the serene machine a lot of people make me out to be but neither do i go home after a days work and beat my wife because i havent hit the lottery or written the bestseller that will enable me to get out of the profession i can handle the things youre talking about because by and large i still love what i do and feel damn lucky to have been given the chance to do it why are you asking about all this are you having trouble not trouble exactly oh turn right at the next corner got it knowlton street you said right yes i know the way now go on you know that before i went to med school i worked in a holistic healing center of course ive been to some of your presentations interesting stuff very interesting my training was in herbal medicine and acupuncture but some things happened that made me feel i needed to broaden the skills i had some things happened the understatement of the week sarah thought she debated going into the details of her final clash with peter ettinger but quickly realized that this was hardly the time or place to unearth that worm well our techniques in the holistic center had their limitations she went on i dont question that but there was a certain i dont know call it innocence about our goals and the way we did thingsmost of us anyway each day we went to work and were able to concentrate almost exclusively on doing what we could for our patients and well as far as i can tell medicine as im being trained to practice it now is often as much about money and liability as it is about patients we order millions and millions of dollars in marginal or unnecessary tests so that our backsides will be covered if we end up in court meanwhile government agencies thinking theyre saving money are telling us how long were allowed to keep patients with a given illness in the hospital so what if an elderly lady here or there gets sent home too soon after a hysterectomy and falls and breaks her hip were talking statistics hereactuarial tables and percentages not flesh and blood sarah you are too young to be so jaded dr snyder i wish there was something i was still too young to beanything at all and you know im not jaded i feel ive made the right decision in becoming an md and i love being a doctor sometimes i just wish it all was a little more i dont know pure randall snyder chuckled ivory soap is ninetynine and fortyfour onehundredths percent pure he said turning onto knowlton nothing involving human beings even comes close to thatespecially not in our racket but listen i do understand whats troubling you and i promise well continue this discussion sometime soon perhaps over dinner at our place for now you should know that youre on your way to being a heck of a doctorexactly the sort of person i would like to have as a partner in my practice why thank you sarah could not mask her surpriseor pleasure it was the first time she had heard randall snyder even intimate he might be considering bringing in an associate let alone her file that one away for the time being snyder said sometime later this year if you want well sit down and talk business its okay to take a hard look at the less appealing sides of our profession as long as you dont get paralyzed by what you see and for gods sake dont go putting anyone on a pedestalespecially me he pulled to the curb in front of number now before we go in how about giving me a thumbnail on our patient the concise highly stylized presentation of a medical case was emphasized more perhaps than any other skill during sarahs training as a student she would often lie in the bathtub oblivious to the progressively cooling water as she used a stopwatch and a dozen or more repetitions to perfect her next mornings case presentation now the technique was second nature lisa summer is a twentythreeyearold unmarried artist gravida two para zero spontaneous ab three years ago lmp tentwo second pregnancy no deliveries prior to this one a miscarriage last menstrual period nine months before randall snyder nodded for sarah to proceed this pregnancy has been unremarkable in every respect there has been a thirtypound weight gain from a base weight of one oh six at exam one week ago fetus was in vertex positionhead was engaged probably left occiput anterior except for the usual childhood diseases lisa has a negative medical history she is a nonsmoker and drinks occasionally no other meds except for the natural prenatal supplement i prescribe ah yes snyder said the mysterious baldwin mix i was at the departmental conference last year when you spoke of it sometime soon i would like to learn more please continue family history is scant no relationship with her parents at present no relationship with the father of the child oh my her coach is a woman friend whos a nurse apparently as a child lisa had a bad experience of some sort in a hospital now shes terrified of them ergo the home birth thats one of the reasons lisas sort ofi dont knowshes very secretive about herself and very mistrustful of people even you not as much as at first but yes even me well then supposing we go on in and try to turn that around sarah gathered up the covered tray of equipment and obstetrical instruments one more thing she said heidi the birth coach said that lisas pressure has been dropping slightly and that its become harder to hear in her right arm than her left the last systolic i know of was eightyfive just as glenn was starting his talk the highest a few hours before that was one ten and what do you make of that snyder asked lownormal for this stage of labor i would say when she called me heidi reported that lisa looked fine so its probably nothing sarah saw concern in snyders eyes and immediately sensed that she had not taken the report seriously enough the actual number may be lownormal he said but in my experience not many labor patients have that sort of pressure drop at this stage ii should have told you sooner i guess sarah responded nonsense im just a naturalborn alarmist i would suspect that youre rightthe low pressure will probably turn out to be due to a little dehydration you bring the ob tray ill bring the pedi one as they stepped from the car they heard a siren probably a block or so away they were still on the tree belt when a police cruiser strobes flashing screeched around the corner and skidded to a halt behind the volvo a uniformed officer jumped out and ignoring them sprinted up toward the front door excuse me snyder called out as they hurried after the policeman im dr randall snyder from the medical center of boston whats going on i dont know doc the officer said panting but im glad youre here we got a nineoneone call that a woman was in serious trouble here and needed an ambulance one should be arriving any minute the womans name sarah asked aware of a sudden knot in her chest the policeman rang the bell several times and then began rapping on the glass panel of the front door summer he said lisa summer the real stress on this job the cases that dont come out right the people with untreatable illness the people who die in spite of everything we do randall snyders words echoed in her thoughts as sarah followed the policeman and heidi glassman up the broad staircase from above she could hear lisas sputtering cough and cries of pain and even before she entered the bedroom she could smell the blood lisa sitting splaylegged on her futon was hemorrhaging from her nostrils and mouth fresh and drying blood covered the front of her nightgown and was spattered on the futon floor and wall but even more disturbing to sarah was the glazed fear in the girls eyes it was a look she had seen only a few times before in her medical career most recently in a fiftyyearold postoperative woman who was about to have a massive coronary within minutes that woman was in full irreversible cardiac arrest it started shortly after i called you heidi said as sarah and randall snyder gloved then knelt beside lisa to begin their evaluation i would have called you back but i was sure you were on your way everything was going fineexcept for that blood pressure thing i told you about then all of a sudden lisa began complaining of severe pain in her right arm and hand during one of her contractions she had bitten the inside of her cheek at first there was just a little bleeding from the cut then suddenly there was a lot just before you arrived she threw up and it was all brightred blood i think what she threw up may have come from the back of her nose but how do you tell her pressure holding sarah asked as she locked lisas left arm in hers and adjusted the cuff to take another reading its down a little more about eighty systolic i cant hear it in her right arm at all sarah glanced at lisas right arm and immediately knew the reason why she could tell that snyder who was feeling for a pulse over the radial artery at the wrist and the brachial artery in the crook of the elbow knew as well the arm from at least the elbow to the hand was dusky and mottled the fingers were a deeper gray the fingertips almost black for whatever reason the arteries and smaller arterioles supplying blood to that limb had become blocked to a lesser extent the blood flow to lisas left arm and both legs seemed compromised as well still eighty sarah said lisa i know this is scary for you but please just do your best to stay as calm as you can while we figure things out this is the man i told you about dr snyder hes my chief from a distance they could hear the whoop of the approaching ambulance whwhats happening to me lisa asked as bewildered as she was frightened sarah and her chief exchanged glances though the diagnosis needed laboratory confirmation she knew he suspected as did she that they were witnessing the rapid evolution of dicdisseminated intravascular coagulopathythe most dramatic and horrifying of all bloodclotting emergencies sarah asked for a washcloth and handed it to lisa here lisa blow your nose in this as hard as you can once we get the big clots out the pressure you put on your nose will be more effective in stopping the bleeding lisa still spitting crimson into a bucket did as she was asked immediately the center of the washcloth was soaked with blood but there were no clots none at all the diagnosis of dic was now even more likely for whatever reason large numbers of tiny clots had begun forming within lisas bloodstream those circulating microdots were beginning to join together and obstruct the arteries supplying blood to her arms and legs placing the limbs in great jeopardy even more frightening than the circulatory blockage was the speed with which the abnormal clots were using up the factors necessary for normal blood coagulation with those factors badly depleted bleeding from any source was now lifethreatening and a fatal stroke caused by a cerebral hemorrhage was a terrifying possibility lisa ill explain what we think is going on in just a second sarah said has your water broken lisa shook her head im very frightened she managed my hand is killing me i understand just give us a moment sarah looked over at her chief we need that ambulance to get here we need an iv and we need a hematologist or an internistpreferably bothwaiting for us at mcb snyder said there was still the typical calmness in his voice but his expression was grim this would be the second case of dic in a medical center of boston active labor patient in less than three months the previous casenot one of snyders or sarahshad died on the operating table as her physicians desperately tried to deliver her child by cesarean section with hemorrhaging into the placenta the infant was severely brain damaged by the time it could be extracted and was pronounced dead before its first week of life was through the cause of the dic had never been determined lisa please listen snyder went on and please try not to be too frightened we believe that something has caused your bloodclotting system to stop working properly we need to get you to mcb for diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible what something what caused this she asked will my baby be all right well know better about your baby as soon as we get a monitor on snyder said at this moment i can hear its heartbeat clearly his lisa said hoarsely pardon his dr baldwin sent me for an ultrasound his names going to be brian they heard the ambulance siren cut off as it pulled up in front of the house lisa snyder said i know its not easy but the more relaxed you can be the slower your blood will flow and the better chance well have of stopping the bleeding is there someone you want us to call your parents a brother or sister lisa thought for a moment and then resolutely shook her head heidis my family she said okay sarah do you want to go and call mcb sarah eyes closed sarah had placed her second third and fourth fingertips over lisas left radial artery trying to assess the six pulses located there which were used only by acupuncturists and practitioners of traditional chinese medicine the left pulses reflected the condition of the heart liver kidney small intestine gallbladder and bladder many times especially in patients with vague nonspecific complaints careful palpation of the three superficial and three deep pulses at each wrist gave a clue as to the source of the symptom and helped direct placement of the acupuncture needles oh sorry she said her exam influenced by lisas agitated state and the profound disturbance in blood flow was not revealing and with no circulation at all on the right there was little point in checking that side ill call dr blankenship and have him waiting for us with someone from heme thank you the rescue squad raced into the crowded room after a brief explanation from randall snyder they hoisted lisa onto their litter and set about establishing an iv in her left arm sarah started for the hallway phone dr baldwin dont leave me lisa begged ill be right back then please just tell me am i going to die sarah hoped there would be more conviction in her voice than she was feeling at that moment lisa this is not the time for you to be thinking like that at all she said its very important that you stay centered and focused youve got to be able to use that internal visualization stuff weve been working on do you think you can do that ii was doing it before all this started once i actually saw my cervix i really did i believe you thats great well now youve got to start doing it again concentrate on seeing your bloodstream and the structures within your hands its very important ill help you once we reach mcb dr blankenship the internist who will be treating you is a wonderful doctor im going to call him now he and a hematologist will be waiting for us together well get on top of this thing promise sarah swept some errant wisps of hair from lisas damp forehead i promise she said ivs in one of the rescue squad announced ringers lactate at twofifty you want her sitting up like this doc snyder nodded sarah why dont you let me make that call and you ride to mcb in the ambulance with lisa ill bring heidi with me as she accompanied the rescue squad out of the house doing what she could to stem the flow of blood from lisa summers nose and mouth sarah tried to remember what she could of the other woman who had developed dic normal pregnancy normal labor right up to the final stage then a sudden catastrophic alteration of her bodys coagulation system just the way it was happening today and as she helped load lisa into the ambulance the question that had confounded that womans doctors burned in sarahs mind why chapter six of the nine suffolk state hospital buildings originally purchased by the medical center of boston were still in use two of the others had been razed and replaced with parking facilities the third a crumbling sixstory brick structure with the name chilton etched in concrete over its entrance had been abandoned and boarded up when sarah began her training and remained soa mute reminder of the hospitals ongoing financial difficulties the chilton building and garages were separated from the rest of the hospital by a broad circular drive enclosed within the loop was an expansive grassy courtyard dotted by some shrubbery and half a dozen molded plastic picnic tables vehicle access to the campus as glenn paris had named the area was restricted to those administrators and department heads with parking slots and to emergency room traffic the ride from knowlton street to mcb spearheaded by the sirens of the police cruiser and rescue squad took fifteen minutes seated beside lisa summer in the back of the lurching ambulance sarah heard the driver radio ahead that a priority one patient was on the way she pictured the guard suddenly puffed with importance scurrying to open the security gate and move all traffic aside lisas contractions now occurring every four minutes or so were forceful and prolonged however sarahs gentle exam had disclosed a cervix that was still only four centimeters dilatedfar from being ready for delivery the bleeding from her nose and mouth was if anything more brisk and although her left hand and both feet still had some warmth and capillary blood flow her right arm was now pallid and lifeless from the elbow down hang on lisa sarah urged were almost there as they turned onto the mcb access road sarah reviewed her knowledge of dic having never encountered a severe case of it during her training her understanding was essentially what she had gleaned from a lecture or two in med school some reading and an occasional conference rather than being a single specific disease the condition was an uncommon complication of many different sorts of injuries or illnesses surgery shock overwhelming infection massive trauma drug overdose toxins abrupt separation of the placentaany of a number of insults to the human body could result in dic and in part because of the severity of the predisposing condition fullblown dic was more often than not fatal but lisa summer was neither injured nor ill she was a healthy young woman at the end of a totally uncomplicated pregnancy perhaps this wasnt dic after all sarah thought the siren cut off as they neared the hospital sarah did a quick blood pressure check and exam and began mentally preparing the presentation she would give to dr eli blankenship it was her job to present the facts in a totally unbiased manner carefully avoiding her own diagnostic impression or any other leading statements until a diagnosis was proven assuming one to the exclusion of others was foolish and potentially very dangerous assume makes an ass of u and me was the way one professor had stressed that principle eli blankenship perhaps the sharpest medical mind in the hospital would combine her information with his observations he would then come up with an approach to diagnosis and treatment meanwhile if therapy could not be held off until a definite diagnosis could be made they would simply have to say a quiet prayer and forge ahead with what measures seemed likeliest to help in this case with two lives already hanging by a thread it was unlikely they could wait for any laboratory results before instituting treatment and the treatment for dic was itself lifethreatening all in all sarah knew it was going to be one hellish day for lisa summer and the dozens of physicians nurses and technologists who would be battling to save her and her baby and all the while swirling about that struggle would be the persistent gnawing question of why as they backed up to the emergency rooms receiving platform sarah could see eli blankenship waiting by the er door as always she was struck by the mans appearance had she without knowing been challenged to name his vocation her first guesses might well have included tavern bouncer stevedore or heavy machine operator mcbs chief of staff was a bull of a man less than six feet tall but with a massive chest and head that were separated by a token neck he was bald save for a dark monks fringe but beneath his expansive forehead his eyebrows were thickets and his muscular arms were like esaus even clean shaven at the outset of a day he seemed to have a persistent five oclock shadow of the mans physical attributes only his eyesa pale penetrating bluegave hint to his genius he was board certified in infectious disease and critical care as well as internal medicine but he was also respected as a humanist expert at chess and contract bridge and well versed in the arts as a teacher no one at mcb was more open and respectful of the views and approaches of students and residents and no one taught them more effectively blankenship already gowned and gloved met the stretcher as the rescue squad pulled it from the ambulance and immediately took lisas hand and introduced himself to her from the other side of the litter where she was keeping pressure on lisas nose sarah could see that with that first touch the medical chief had already begun his examination and assessment by the time they reached room a one of three major medicaltrauma rooms sarah had nearly completed her case presentation blankenship had the phlebotomist from the laboratory waiting to draw blood for them as well as an ob nurse with a fetal monitor with a nod he motioned them both into action at that moment blood began to ooze through the gauze wrap protecting lisas intravenous line blankenship noted the development with no change in his expression now lisa he said evenly im going to ask you to be patient with us and to forgive us if it seems were not keeping you abreast of whats going on youve got several different things going on here at once involving several different systems of your body in a few more seconds you arent going to be able to tell all the doctors working on you without a scorecard the main ones besides me will be dr helen stoddard whos a blood specialist and dr andrew truscott whos a surgeon her job will be to help us stop this bleeding and his will be to get in another intravenous line and tend to your arm which right now is not getting enough blood and of course well have dr baldwin and dr snyder standing by to deliver your baby as soon as we can get you stabilized is the baby all right lisa asked blankenship looked over at the ob nurse who nodded toward the fetal monitor the fetal heart rate was higher than optimum often an early sign of trouble the babys under some stress he said were watching that very closely at that moment the hematologist swept into the room helen stoddard also a full professor was a department chief at another hospital and a sometime consultant at mcb unabashedly from the old school as she liked to say she had been openly critical of mcbs coddling up to fringe playersher term for practitioners of alternative medicine during one hospitalsponsored seminar she had been one of the panelists arguing against incorporating any techniques unproven by scientific methods blankenship and sarah were part of the opposition advocating the use of certain empirically proven treatments such as acupuncture and chiropractic and careful scientific evaluation of those and others where do we stand eli stoddard asked without so much as a glance at sarah studies are off ten units ordered platelets and plasma as well as many of each as we can get helen stoddard completed a rapid exam of lisas skin mouth and nail beds the gauze surrounding the iv was now saturated blood dripped from it onto the stretcher sheet and floor the venapuncture site from which blood had been drawn was also oozing no prior history of bleeding problems she asked blankenship absolutely none stoddard thought for a few seconds we cant wait for the lab i think we hang up what platelets blood and plasma we can and heparinize her randall snyder and heidi glassman entered the room both a bit breathless moments later andrew truscott arrived as well heidi took sarahs place at the bedside while truscott sarah and snyder stepped back to the doorway shes in real trouble sarah said snyder glanced at the fetal monitor sos the baby he said have you started pitocin in the ambulance shes still only five centimeters dilated jesus truscott took a minute to examine lisas arms hands and feet then with impressive skill and speed he injected some anesthetic into the skin at the side of her neck located two bony landmarks with his fingertips and slid a largebore needle through the numbed spot directly into her internal jugular vein next he threaded a catheter through the needle and sutured it in place a critical second iv route had been established one way or the other i think were going to have to take her to the or for that arm he said after returning to the doorway i still cant tell about the left or her feet can you csection her snyder crossed to helen stoddard held a brief whispered conversation and then came back shaking his head we may already be down to a mother versus fetus situation he whispered helen and eli have decided they cant wait for laboratory confirmation of dic theyve gone ahead with heparin as things stand they feel the girl has no chance of surviving a csection heparin for dic to sarah whose practice as a surgeon was built on a bedrock of meticulous attention to the control of hemorrhage the treatment was a terrifying paradox the intravenous injection of a powerful anticoagulant to a patient who was already in danger of bleeding to death the theory was to administer the drug to break up the pathological clots and restore blood flow to the compromised extremities and vital organs at the same time continuous transfusions would be used to chase lost blood volume and replace clotting factors it was a therapeutic balancing act of circus proportions and one that too often was doomed to fail sarah looked at the woman she had cared for over the past seven months now barely visible within the clutch of nurses physicians and technologists in just minutes andrew had contributed greatly to everyones efforts she had yet to contribute anything true she acknowledged he and the other medical players in this drama were all senior to her but lisa summer was still her patient and there were things the two of them had worked on things they could try that might help as wellprovided of course that helen stoddard and eli blankenship allowed them the chance she excused herself and raced down to the subbasement where a series of rather dimly lit tunnels connected all of the mcb buildings her locker was on the fourth floor of the thayer building which housed the administration offices on the first three floors and the house staff sleeping quarters on the top two sarah took the elevator up minutes later she bounded down the six flights and sprinted back through the tunnels toward the er cradled in her arm was the mahogany box containing her acupuncture needles the box had been a gift from dr louis han she had first encountered han a chineseborn christian missionary while teaching with the peace corps in the meo villages north of chiang mai thailand until his death nearly three years later he was her mentor in the healing arts the inscription on the box elegantly carved in chinese by han himself read the healing power of god is within us all the moment sarah stepped back into room a she sensed things had changed for the worse a tube inserted into lisas stomach through her nose was carrying a steady stream of blood into the suction bottle on the wall her urinary catheter was also draining crimson randall snyder his face ashen stood by the fetal monitor where the heartbeat of lisas unborn child had dropped below the rate necessary to sustain life whats happening sarah asked moving beside him i think weve lost him snyder whispered we could go for a section right here and now and maybe wed still be in time for the baby but lisa would never survive is she going to anyhow i dont know it looks bad sarah hesitated for a moment and then worked her way to where helen stoddard and eli blankenship were standing can i please speak with you both she asked for an instant she thought stoddard was going to dismiss her then perhaps remembering sarah was one of blankenships handpicked residents the hematologist moved to one side of the room blankenship followed id like to try to stop lisas bleeding sarah said and exactly what do you think were trying to do stoddard asked sarah felt the muscles in her jaw tighten she had never forced her abilities and techniques on any resident or faculty member who didnt request them but lisa was her patient and conventional therapy did not seem to be working dr stoddard i know you dont have a great deal of regard for alternative healing she said struggling to keep her voice steady but i only want the same thing you do i want lisa to make it for the last four or five months while we were getting ready for her home birth lisa and i have been working on some selfhypnosis and internal visualization i think shes really gotten quite good at both and stoddards expression was ice well combined with acupuncture we might be able to use lisas own power to slow her bleeding down provided that is you are willing to give her enough protamine to neutralize the heparin what if we succeed in slowing her bleeding enough to be able to csection her you can start the heparin again to work on dissolving her clots this is ridiculous sarah took a calming breath over four years of medical school and two years of training she had never had a clash of this sort with a professor but there could be no backing down dr stoddard lisas pressure is dropping her bleeding is getting worse and it may already be too late for the baby why you arrogant ignorant just a minute helen blankenship cut in you can say anything you want when this is over but right now we have a girl who is going down the tubes and weve got to focus on her dr baldwin is right the heparins not doing anything for the clots yet and its sped the bleeding up to the point where were falling behind in our transfusions do this and im off this case stoddard said helen youre one of the best hematologists ive ever known and one of the most dedicated doctors i cant imagine you ever allowing anything to get in the way of whats best for a patient but and deep down you know that the few minutes it will take sarah here to try what she knows will make little difference to the outcome but all right dammit but after this is over regardless of what happens this hospital had better clarify its policy on medical quackery or i am off the staff well do that helen i promise well do that sarah how can we help well first give lisa the protamine helen damn you eli okay okay this is ridiculous she muttered as she headed back to administer the heparin antidote absolutely ridiculous now sarah continued sensing her pulse beginning to race please just leave heidi with me pull as many people away from the bedside as possible and keep all noise to a minimum done anything else just one please turn off the overhead lights lisa cried out as another contraction took hold sarah stroked her forehead then knelt beside her lisa close your eyes and listen to me she said softly weve got work to do this is the moment we practiced for in all those sessions do you understand good lets just start with the easy things the scenes okay use them during your contractions ill help you and heidi is here to help you too in between contractions i want you to concentrate on my voice and start trying to visualize what is happening in your bloodstream and your heart everythings moving too fast too fast there may be blood clots forming there too clogging your arteries try to relax and see them too just relax just relax heidi continued whispering in lisas ear as sarah briefly consulted a thin frayed booklet having assured herself of the acupuncture points she wanted to stimulate she set her first needle by twisting it in just below lisas left collarbone then one at a time she set five more of the steel needles in various points trying to compensate for the limitations placed on the technique by lisas bandages and supine position an eerie silence had taken over the room broken only by the muted churning of the suction apparatus and the soft beep of the cardiac monitor look sarah heard someone whisper i think the bleedings letting up already sarah glanced at the suction bottle in fact the drainage did seem to have significantly lessened lisa relax sarah said again pleasantly but firmly slow your heart slow your blood and just relax you have the power one minute passed then another lisa lay motionless now her eyes closed a contraction hit visibly knotting her abdomen she remained motionless and serene her heart rates down from ninety to fifty sarah blankenship said the oozing from her iv and venapuncture sites may have stopped altogether randall do you want to get ready everythings set snyder said anesthesias standing by upstairs just say the word the nasogastric tube was now draining only small amounts all oozing had stopped carefully sarah twisted out the six acupuncture needles for ten seconds fifteen all was quiet go for it she said chapter july sarah ordered the operating table up two inches and screwed sterile handles into the parabolic overhead lights her eyes burned a bit shed been up and running for twentyfour hours without so much as a catnap but her concentration as always when she was in the or was as sharp as her scalpel after centering the focused beams she cradled the blade in her right hand minutely adjusting its position until it felt a part of her with her left she tensed the skin along what had been the upper margin of the pubic hair escutcheon then with a single steady stroke she opened the abdominal wall and separated the thin saffron layer of subcutaneous fat she next handled what few bleeders there were by snapping each with a hemostat and touching the steel instrument with an electrocauterizer finally she cut the peritoneal membrane exposing the bulging gravid uterus everything all right she asked the anesthesiologist stable okay here we go sarah scored the surface of the uterus with her scalpel then made a small opening in it inserting her index fingers she pulled the beefy muscle fibers apart then with the touch of her blade she opened the amniotic membrane were in she said at the first gush of amniotic fluid suction please time now was critical the powerful uterus could clamp down at any moment making the delivery of the baby within it anything but routine for ten seconds sarahs breathing and it seemed her heart as well stopped as she felt deep in the pelvis for the babys legs trying at the same time to assess the position of the umbilical cord gently her fingers closed about the spindly legs and drew them up through the incision next the torso and gently ever so gently the shoulders and arms finally she cradled the eggshell skull in her palm and guided it up through the incision and just like that the infant was born quickly sarah cleared its nose and mouth with a suction bulb moments later the expectant hush of the delivery room was pierced by the newborns bleating cry and instantly the tension in the room evaporated its a girl kathy sarah said too flatly a beautiful girl congratulations dad if youll step around over here you can cut the cord the father just out of high school sidled over nervously did as she instructed and then hurried back to the head of the bed where his young wife was alternately crying and laughing for joy swallowing at the sudden unpleasant fullness in her throat sarah handed the perfect newborn over to the pediatrician she hoped no one in the room could tell how close she was to tears herselftears not of joy but of sorrow for the stillborn death of brian summer some seventeen hours before it was six oclock in the morning following an incredibly stressful rollercoaster day and night during which sarah had presided at two normal vaginal births and now this breechpresentation cesarean but shortly after one oclock the previous afternoon the exhilaration of playing a major role in slowing lisa summers bleeding had given way to the inestimable sadness of assisting in the extraction of her babydead before they had even reached the delivery room like the infant of the previous dic patient brian summer had succumbed to massive bleeding within the placenta and premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall had he been delivered even half an hour earlier he might have survived the agonizing choice though had been to channel all efforts toward saving lisa who almost certainly would have bled to death had the procedure not been delayed with an unfamiliar sense of distraction and detachment sarah watched her hands deliver the young womans placenta then begin closing the incisions she had made the decision to try to save lisas life had been the correct one nevertheless acceptance of the outcome was not coming at all easily sarah was preparing to place the skin clips when the circulating nurse from surgery came up behind her sarah dr truscott wanted me to tell you that theyve taken lisa summer back into the or he whispered oh no she thought do you know whats going on well apparently the anticoagulation and the heparin flush havent cleared the blockages in her arm im not sure what dr truscott plans to do now thank you win ill be over as soon as i can kathy were almost done the pediatrician just signaled to me that your babys perfect her apgar score is nine ten is tops but we only give that to babies who come out playing a violin hell bring her over to you in just a moment thank you doctor oh thank you so much sarah taped a bandage over the incision and stripped her gloves off as she backed away from the table were all very happy for you she said she left the delivery floor and headed toward the surgical building twice during the short walk she was stoppedfirst by a nurse then by a medical residentand congratulated for the job she had done on lisa the whole hospitals talking about it the resident said you really opened a lot of eyes to the potential of alternative healing my medical degrees a do from the school of osteopathy in philly all of a sudden for the first time really the other medical residents are asking me about my educationabout what sorts of things we study that the people in traditional medical schools dont people who only paid lip service to nontraditional methods are suddenly very interested in them the mans words should have been a tonic but today they did little to alleviate sarahs sense of impotence all of her training plus hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment and personnel had been unable to save lisa summers baby this was not the first time she had agonized through the loss of patients pregnancies and newborns that people die was the most basic tenet of medicine and on a purely intellectual level it was a truth she understood but for whatever reason her emotional response to this loss seemed impervious to knowledge or logic she pictured her old officetreatment room on the second floor of the ettinger institute she had been no less involved in caring for people in those days than she was now but that worldthat serene uncomplicated highly personal interaction with patientsseemed lightyears away the difference purely and simply was the degree to which technology and sciencewhatever that really wasdominated western medicine at times and this was certainly one of them it felt as if she had traded in flying on a hang glider for piloting a jet her reason for leaving the ettinger institute was the inflexibility and eventually the intolerable behavior of peter ettinger but her decision to obtain an md degree went far deeper than that she had felt that when she became a physician many of the limitations and resulting frustrations of her professional life would disappear instead despite all the equipment and her newly acquired technical skill her limitations seemed just as frustrating and those frustrations just as limiting there were four women now on the hospitals surgical staff and three female surgical residents still there was only one surgeons locker room and it remained for men only sarah discarded her maroon ob scrubs in the nurses locker room slipped on a sea green pair and replaced her shoe covers hair guard and mask twelve hours had passed since she had watched andrew truscott probe and irrigate the main arteries supplying lisas right arm their goal was to remove as much clot as possible and to hope that anticoagulant irrigation took care of the rest now apparently they needed to do moreperhaps a major dissection of the blocked vessels sarah entered the or through the scrub room lisa now in an operating room for the third time in less than twentyfour hours was already anesthetized and intubated her face was deceptively peaceful a low drape across her neck separated her head and the anesthesiologist from the surgical team on the other side of the drape andrew and another surgeon both on the same side of the table were focused on lisas arm for a moment sarah thought the second surgeon was the same vascular man who had assisted andrew on the earlier procedure but as she pulled the small metal footstool over and stood on it to get a better view she realized that the other doctor was not a vascular surgeon at all he was ken browne the chief of orthopedics it was only then that sarah saw the severed forearm and clawed hand resting on the metal tray beside the scrub nurse and realized that browne and andrew were not doing any delicate vascular procedure at all they were aggressively paring down what remained of lisas radius and ulnathe bones of her forearmin preparation for the completion of a belowtheelbow amputation sarah felt her muscles go limp and for just a moment thought that for the first time in her life she was going to faint oh jesus no first the baby now this was all she could think andrew glanced up and saw her you okay he asked andrew she was an artist a potter her hands were hey listen im sorry its just that i thought she was going to be all right she probably will be now andrew responded somewhat wearily im sorry about having to do this too but impending gangrene is impending gangrene there was really no choice i understand but even as she said the words sarah knew that there was precious little of what had happened to lisa summer that she understood at all chapter the surgical intensive care unit was a twelvebed ward with onetoone or onetotwo nurse coverage throughout the day and night rarely was there an entire unit shift without at least one patient in crisis and although except in times of the most extreme urgency the atmosphere in the sicu was subdued and quiet it was never silent every minute of every day the monitoring equipment suction and infusion systems and respirators droned white noise like the surge of ocean waves it was here even more than in the operating rooms that the true lifeanddeath battles were waged sarah much preferred the or to the daytoday grind of caring for critically ill patients in the unit but she did enjoy the camaraderie she had with the sicu staff at seventhirty the morning of july six of the sicu bays were occupied all twelve would be filled by the time the morning or schedule was completed her eyes now gritty from lack of sleep sarah sat on the edge of the bed in bay eight waiting for lisa summer to be brought up from the recovery room the news from there except for the obvious was excellent lisa had sailed through her surgery with no excessive bleeding in fact her dic was rapidly resolving and circulation to her kidneys and legs as well as to her remaining arm now seemed unimpeded it was as if in some strange way the performance of the cesarean section had relieved her hematologic crisis lisas life had been saved her womb her senses and her nervous system were intact and she could walk in time she would learn to use her left hand better and to control whatever prosthesis was placed on her right she might even find a way to continue expressing herself as an artist she would begin to deal with her grief and someday perhaps she would once again bear a child in a purely clinical way sarah knew all these things were true still she could not shake the reality that lisa was her patient and that not twentyfour hours before she had excitedly been preparing to give birth you all right sarah was sifting through a printout of the already substantial number of lab tests run on lisa searching for a clueany clueas to what might have caused the catastrophe startled she looked up to see alma young a seasoned sicu nurse standing at the foot of the bed oh yeah im okay thanks just a little tired is all thats understandable well your girlll be up in a few minutes recovery just called apparently shes doing reasonably well all things considered thats great sarah said with little enthusiasm i keep staring at these numbers hoping that something i missed will suddenly leap off the page and explain whats going on maybe you should just close your eyes and nap for a few minutes im afraid that if i do that my body will figure out it doesnt have to feel the way it does right now and ill be finished for the day you know the whole hospitals talking about what you did yesterday the er nurses are saying that girl would have died for sure if you hadnt stepped in and then held your ground against that hematologist then why dont i feel better than i do about all that alma the older woman sat down on the end of the bed because youre a good doctor she said thats why youre sensitive you care about peoples suffering and paini mean really care thank you but may i say something sure sometimes i think you care too much you take it all too personally sitting here poring through those lab reports when you could be resting is a perfect example thats taking sensitivity one step too far ive seen all kinds of residentsand nurses toocome through here one thing ive noticed that the really good ones all have in common is this little switch they can throw that lets them become totally objective when they need to be that way you have everything it takes to be one of the really good ones but i think sometimes you let all this get you down too much you see that in me i do so do some of the other nurses our favorite sport is dissecting the residents you know we all really like you sarah and we love working with you but we worry about you too its as if you always think theres something more you should be doing instead of just accepting that you can only do what you can do the nurses observations triggered a rush of images and emotions most of them unpleasant and all of them centering on peter ettinger alma sarah said ive never been much good at accepting my limitations in fact if i didnt always think there was more i could do for a patient theres a good chance id never have ended up as an md what do you mean sarah laughed uncomfortably do you have a few hours there was concern in alma youngs eyes actually she said im completely caught up until our friend lisa arrives sarah thought for a time before responding she had always been a private person and the compartmentalization of her lifehigh school in upstate new york college in a boston suburb the peace corps in thailand peter and the ettinger institute medical school in italy and now this residencyhad made it easy for her to stay private in each place she had begun to develop friendships but none of those relationships except with her mentor dr louis han was strong enough to survive the next move and gradually she began to find that when asked to talk about herselfeven when she felt inclined to do soshe simply didnt or couldnt now a woman with whom she had worked for more than two years seemed genuinely interested in who she was and how she was reacting to this most difficult case perhaps it was time to open up a bit a number of years ago she said finally ten actuallyi was living in the mountains in northern thailand building a clinic while i was teaching and studying acupuncture and herbal medicine an older man became my friend and my mentor it wasyou knowthe fatherineverhad sort of thing well he died rather suddenly and soon after a man quite like him although much younger passed through our village he was brilliant and dashing and interested in the same things i was at the time he was already world renowned in many areas of alternative healing well within a month i was back in the states living with him and his daughter and working at his institute sarah debated sharing peters name but decided there was no reason to do so for almost three years i lived with him and the teenage daughter he had brought back from africa when she was a baby and adopted for those three years i was the closest thing she had to a mother although as i said this man and i worked together at his institute as far as he was concerned i always worked for him not with him when the event ill tell you about happened he had actually asked me to marry him but this dark side of himan enormous insatiable ego and an inflexibility that frightened mehad begun to surface more and more in our life go on please alma said he had a patient a sculptor whom he had quite literally cured of a case of rheumatoid arthritis that the mans doctors had labeled incurable how did he do it oh dietary changes and herbs plus some of the same sort of techniques i used yesterday with lisa the man went from being a cripple to playing racquetball every day amazing not to us it wasnt alternative healing cures many many patients that western physicians have given up on we mds still dont have much of a handle on the mechanism of disease you know our microscopes get bigger and bigger and the things we can look at get smaller and smaller we prescribe penicillin without giving it much thought but we still dont know why person a got the strep throat were treating or why person b didnt anyhow my friend went away for a month and left me in charge of his patients he was treating the sculptor for headaches with herbs acupuncture and chiropractic adjustments i saw the man several times and felt more concerned about him each time he said his headaches were better or at least no worse but he seemed to me to be walking funny and believe it or not his smile seemed off center as well that sounds like trouble thats what i thought i called white memorial and spoke to a neurologist who wanted to see him at eleven the next morning my friend was due home from nepal that night but i decided his patient needed to be seen no matter what so i made the arrangements that may sound like an easy decision alma but it wasnt there was still the matter of explaining why i would go against everything my friend believed in sarah could not remember the last time she had shared with anyone that final horrid day with peter but alma young was such a wonderful listener that the story came with surprising ease and although sarah told it rather quickly the pieces she actually voiced were only snippets of what she was remembering the night that resulted in so much torment had actually felt magical peter listened quietly and attentively to her account of the referral of the sculptor henry mcallister peters responsethe response she had so dreadedwas in essence hey listen i left you responsible for the institute because you are a responsible person you saw what you saw made a decision and went with it what could possibly be wrong with doing that later that evening they made loveconsuming passionate love the way it had been in the beginning peter had come throughfor her and their sputtering relationship she knew it wasnt easy for him he honestly believed that on balance traditional western medicine had become so lost in science competitive pharmacology and dehumanizing technology that it now did more harm than good in fact above his desk was a placard engraved iatrogenic illness or injury caused by the words or actions of a physician now the chance was right there for him to belittle her judgmentto once again force his famous views on mds and their methods down her throat but he hadnt taken it like peter she understood the miraculous potential in the relationship between healer and patient she had great faith in the power of holistic methods to diagnose and treat but unlike him she had never viewed traditional medicine as a court of lastor noresort after all she had once survived a nearly fatal ruptured appendix by getting airlifted to a us military hospital and having emergency surgery peter was fortya dozen years older than she that age difference along with his imposing sizehe was six feet fourhis immense drive and material successes made holding her own in their relationship a challenge and asserting herself in it almost a pipe dream but at last peter had chosen to listen rather than to react to understand that his way of doing things might not be the only way they took the following morning off from work and spent a good deal of it making love by the time sarah arrived at the institute to begin seeing a full afternoon of appointments she was feeling more centered and positive about her life than she had in some time by three oclock though she began wondering why she hadnt heard from the neurologist at white memorial at least some of his evaluation of henry mcallister should have been completed by then if her observations of the artists motor problems were correct an emergency ct scan and several other tests were in order the physician had promised to call sarah at her office as soon as he had anything to report threethirty four fourthirty she checked the time again and again as she worked her way through her clients finally after the last of them had left she called white memorial miss baldwin i assumed you knew the neurologist said knew what she felt a sudden unpleasant tightness in her throat when i arrived at the office this morning there was a message waiting with my answering service from your mr mcallister he called at oh ten oclock last night to say that he had spoken with his own medical advisor and would not be keeping his appointment with me i thought that by medical advisor he meant you no she said no im afraid he meant someone else thank you doctor well im sorry i couldnt have been of more she was already lowering the receiver to its cradle she stalked down the hall to peters office he was leaning back in his chair his feet up on the corner of his desk peter why didnt you tell me last night that you called henry mcallister i didnt think it was that important important i probably gave myself an ulcer agonizing over the decision to refer him well now you dont have to worry about it anymore he lowered his feet to the floor but you said i did the right thing and you did the right thing for you but not necessarily the right thing for henry but how do you know how could you tell him to cancel that appointment without even seeing him first of all i dont believe theres much an md can do that our people cant do as well or better you know that and second i didnt tell him to cancel his appointment i told him that he should use his judgment and that no matter what he decided i would be available to see him all day today he need only call and set up a time to come in and did he call she felt her pulse begin pounding in her temples her cheeks were burning she wanted to leap over the mans desk and pummel the selfassuredness off his face well did he peters expression tightened ii guess in all the excitement going on here today i forgot to check he glanced at his message spindle and then called the receptionist it seems he didnt feel the need to call he said as he hung up peter you are really a son of a bitch do you know that she whirled and hurried back into her office hey easy does it babe he called after her easy does it henry mcallisters clinic record was on her desk she dialed his number and let the phone ring a dozen or more times then she dialed if she was wrong shed look like a fool but there was no way she could let matters drop for the first time in three years she felt as if she were reacting to a challenging situation like sarah baldwin and not like peter ettingers flunky peter was just coming out of his office as she raced past him down the stairs and out of the institute he called to her but she never even looked back mcallister lived in a south end loft about ten blocks away she thought briefly about looking for a cab then she just gritted her teeth clenched her fists and sprinted off so alma young asked pardon so what happened to the sculptor you cant leave me hanging like that oh sorry sarah said uncertain of precisely how much of her thoughts she had actually shared well in that particular situation if i had accepted that what i had already done was everything i could do the man would probably have died the police ended up breaking into his apartment we found him unconscious on the floor two hours later he was in the operating room at white memorial he had a slowly growing malignancya meningioma actuallyon the right side of his brain and as sometimes happens he had begun bleeding into the tumor pressure was building inside his skull thank god you reached him in time alma gasped genuinely relieved at the fate of a man whose crisis had occurred seven years before sarah smiled at the nurses reaction i was allowed into the operating room to watch them take the tumor out it was really incredible thats when i decided i wanted to be a surgeon of some sort eventually i settled on obgyn and the other man your um friend sarah shrugged i moved out the next day and we havent spoken since thats quite a story and part of the reason that im never comfortable accepting that ive done all i can for a patient maybe but i still say youll be better off when you admit youre only human doctors today have remarkable capabilities but they still arent god never were never will be if you cant come to grips with the fact that in spite of your best efforts some of your patients are going to lose their baby or lose their arm or both or worse then sooner or later this rackets going to eat you alive i understand do you yes yes i do alma young reached over and gave sarah a reassuring hug in that case dr baldwin i dont want to see you beating up on yourself because a horrible condition you had nothing to do with took that girls baby and arm i want to hear you bragging from the rooftops about what you did yesterday to help save her life it was big big stuff for this hospital and everyone who cares about mcb will be crowing right alongside of you got that sarah managed a smile cockadoodle doo she said the doors to the sicu glided open and lisa was wheeled in by a transportation worker and a nurse andrew truscott followed moments later the night he had just spent in the or showed in the faint shadows enveloping his eyes but no one would have guessed that he was into his second straight day without sleep it was a phenomenon sarah had noticed in herself as well with each passing year of surgical training sleep deprivation had fewer biologic effectsas far as she could tell hows she doing she asked not the most elegant of surgeries those amputations sorry we couldnt pull off the alternative you and me both but ill bet shes going to do all right from here on out well what do you expect you cured her with those spiffy little pins of yours nonsense as often happened sarah was uncertain whether andrews sarcastic tone reflected his real opinion sarah dr truscott alma young called out could one of you m deities please come help us transfer this girl ill be right there sarah responded thats grand old shoe truscott said because ive got a consult i must do on med five why dont we plan to meet for coffee in the caf in say an hour i have some questions to ask you about yesterdays magic show alma the postop orders for our young charge are tucked under the mattress dr muscles here is coming to assist you straightaway with sarahs help lisa was transferred from the recovery room stretcher to bed then sarah stepped aside as alma and another nurse quickly hooked up lisas iv infusion pumps cardiac monitor and urinary catheter shes all yours alma said moving out of earshot its going to be a long haul for herespecially with no money and no family support ill get social services on her case as soon as possible you might consider a psych consult too she hasnt spoken a word to anyone since she heard about the baby i know thanks alma thats an excellent suggestion she moved over to the bedside lisa lay motionless staring up at the ceiling her lips still dotted by a few obstinate flecks of dried blood were cracked and puffy her bandaged shortened right arm protruded from beneath the starched sheet as she talked sarah examined the site of the cesarean not once did lisa respond hi lisa welcome to the icu are you having much pain well just be sure to tell the nurses if you do you dont have to talk to me or anyone else until youre ready ill just say a few things for now then ill leave the bleeding and clotting problems seem to be gone that means no more transfusions sarah looked for some spark of understanding in the womans eyes but saw none lisa she went on finally you know we all feel terrible about whats happened to you and she took a calming breath and to brian were going to do everything in the world to help you deal with all this and to find out why it happened please try to be strong sarah waited half a minute for a response then she brushed lisas cheek with the back of her hand ill be back to check on you a little later she turned away thinking that somewhere there had to be an explanation for all of this two such similar cases in one hospital in just a few months somewhere there was an answer and she promised herself whatever she had to do to find that answer she would do she glanced back at the young artist lying in bay eight and tried with little success to fathom what it must be like to endure such sudden inexplicable tragedy then she headed out of the sicu there were fortyfive minutes remaining before she was to meet andrew and she had a dozen patients to see on morning rounds where are you going just out just out has never been an acceptable answer to that question and it is not an acceptable answer tonight daddy im eighteen years old the other kids dont you are not like the other kids you are not supposed to be like the other kids but you are an eighteenyearold who plays polo vacations in europe and will be attending harvard in the fall and most of all who has a twentymilliondollar trust fund waiting for her when she turns twentyfive that is not like the other kids and it never will be now who were you going to see tonight daddy please who that that greaseball lowlife chuck you think likes you for your spirit and your soul he was voted bestlooking boy in his high school class he expects to make it as a model and isnt even planning on going to college did you ever stop to wonder why such a boy would suddenly become attracted to a stanhope academy girl who not only has absolutely nothing in common with him but is forty pounds overweight to boot daddy stop please stop i will not these are things youve got to hear things youve got to know your wonderful chuckie is dirt he spends almost every night when youre not sneaking off to be with him shacked up with a cheerleader named marcie kunkle the pictures my man took of the happy couple are right upstairs in my desk would you like to see them you had someone follow him of course i did im your father its my job to protect you until you have enough sense and experience in the world to be able to protect yourself how could you honey listen you know that i love you that man is interested in one thing and one thing only money thats the name of the game and the sooner you learn that the better you are who you are and the only way youre ever going to be sure a man really cares for you is when he has more money than you do you bastard dont you dare speak to me like that you bastard you fucking bastard you ruin everything for me everything dont touch me you touch me and i swear youll never see me again go to your room go to hell come back here right now go to hell let me go i told you not to touch me dammit let me go i hate you i hate you lisa wake up its the nurse lisa youre all right youve got to stop screaming thats it thats better now much better lisa summers eyes fluttered open everything was blurred gradually the concerned face of the nurse came into focus you were having a nightmare alma young said anesthesia does that to some people lisa averted her eyes and once again stared at the ceiling can i get you anything some ice chips something for pain okay ill be here if you need me alma young partially closed the curtains on each side of the bed and returned to the nurses station behind her softly lisa began to cry daddy she said oh daddy chapter sarah bought a sticky bun and coffee and took them to the corner of the expansive cafeteria reserved for physicians two staff internists were chatting at one formicatopped table but the other four tables were unoccupiedno surprise given that this was the busiest time of day in the hospital andrew was already five minutes late but sarah had long ago learned that most surgeons showed up late for everything assuming they showed up at all she had been able to make rounds on three of her patients one of whom had already heard about her performance the previous day and as alma young had predicted her dramatic and successful use of nontraditional therapy did seem to be the talk of the hospital in the few minutes shed spent on the obgyn floor she had gotten calls from the director of medical education asking her to present grand rounds and from glenn pariss secretary requesting that she stop by his office later in the afternoon nurses shook her hand or pumped their fists as she came by and the chief resident on the obgyn service asked her to lunch so that he might hear the details of the save firsthand just as sarah was wondering whether it would be gauche to sit somewhere other than with the two internists they gathered their things and stood up one of them a scholarly endocrinologist named wittenberg came over and shook her hand george wittenberg he said i know we met at glenn pariss reception last year calcium metabolism and parathyroid disease yes you have an excellent memory i read some of your papers for a research project when i was in medical school they were very interesting why thank you i came over to congratulate you but ill take the compliment just the same from what i hear you pulled off a miracle yesterday lisa had a number of people working on her what i did was only one of the reasons she made it sarah felt relieved that she sensed only a passing urge to point out the negative aspects of the miracle well put wittenberg said but if what the hospital drums are pounding out is true you were a most significant reason the story made both the globe and the herald and whoever has been leaking all those negative mcb stories to axel devlin really blew it this time devlin happened to have written another of his down with mcb columns for today so page three has this glowing article about east meets west to save a life at the medical center of boston and devlin sounds like a fool for not at least acknowledging the event have you seen the paper no no i havent here wittenberg said handing over his copy im done reading this and i just changed my parakeets cage so i have no further use for it thanks no problem you know im not exactly on devlins wavelength but i am one of those whos been skeptical of being associated with a place that tenures an indian ayurvedic physician and has a chiropractor working in the orthopedic clinic but after what you accomplished yesterday ive resolved to keep a more open mind and to learn more about alternative medicine he shook her hand warmly and headed off sarah spread the paper on her table and skimmed the sensationalized but reasonably factual account on page three a promcb article in the heraldmaybe there had been a miracle after all then she folded the paper open to axel devlins column take it or leave it by axel devlin july and finally i give you axels axe absent from this column for a few days but always poised to take a good chop at the tires of those who would try to take us all for a ride today the ol blade swishes through the air and once again thwacks into your favorite hospital and mine crunchy granola general otherwise known as the medical center of boston hospital president glenn paris aka california glenn presented his stateofthehospital message yesterday at the annual residents change day assembly thats when the new residents start their training and the old ones move up a notch and although the hospital shogun didnt come up with any innovations as spectacular or embarrassing as his breast implant raffle or his free crystallography clinic he did pledge that nothing was going to stop the resurgence of his hospital back to the topmost ranks of academia and he blustered you can take that to the bank well at that moment at that very moment the powerand all the lightswent out in the entire hospital get the message glenn your approach might have worked in san diego but here in boston we like our doctors to do it by the book not by the alignment of the planets i dont believe it dont believe what andrew truscott slid a plate of watery scrambled eggs and suspect hash browns onto the table and took a seat cattycornered from sarah thisthis vicious unprincipled crap i gather thats a copy of the herald there before you whys devlin got it in for this place so badly you dont know i guess not five years agoi know because it was right after i started herehis wife needed gallbladder surgery devlin wanted her to go to white memorial but she liked bill gardner and the newly ordained touchyfeely atmosphere here two days after gardner did the operation she had a massive pulmonary embolism and croaked on the spot thats terrible but it could happen to anyone at any hospital apparently thats what the malpractice lawyers told devlin so he set about getting retribution his own way how sad maybe not for some people vendettas of one kind or another are therapeutic dont get madget even lashing out at mcb like he does probably helps to keep him going and how do you think he gets his information this article sounds almost as if he was sitting in that amphitheater when the lights went out sarah i hope this doesnt come as too much of a shock but not everybody is as gung ho about this place as you are but enough about devlin i thirst for knowledge knowledge about what dont be coy now you are currently the doc of the hour around here and i want to know exactly what you did in there yesterday sarah smiled just what you saw she said the only way i could think of to stop her bleeding was to slow lisas heart rate and circulatory speed while she was mentally doing what she could to seal off the bleeding points in her body excuse me for saying so but lisa summer mentally stopping an arterial pumper is a bit hard for this swagman to swallow except that you saw her do it andrew listen a good hypnotist can tell a hypnotized subject that he is going to be touched on the arm by a hot poker when the subject is touched with a pencil eraser instead he raises a welt then a blister on that spot how do you explain that you know the real problem is that western physicians are taught about the autonomic nervous system by physiologists and anatomists if we were taught by yogis or acupuncturists as well our concepts of what humans can and cannot control in their bodies would be quite different believe in your limitations and they are yours huh well i for one am certainly impressed maybe you can ask young miss summer to look inside her body and tell us exactly what in the hell happenedhow she got into this pickle to begin with does she know shes not the first i dont think so well she ought to maybe if she knew how lucky she was to survive this at all shed perk up a bit theres plenty of time for her to perk up she just lost her baby and her arm andrew do you have any idea what might be going on did you ever see that other girl as a patient no et tu i havent a clue as to whats going on and i was on vacation when the other woman came in and died but i did see her in the clinic and and she was a healthy young woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy just like lisa i put her on the herbal supplement i like to use and wished her well with her delivery that was the only time i saw her herbal supplement yes almost all pregnant women are given some kind of prenatal vitamins by their doctors in our ob clinic its standard fare well in the mountain villages where i worked in thailand the women all took prenatal supplements as wella combination of roots and herbs crushed and taken as a tea twice a week the only study done of these women showed higher birthweights and better infant survival than in women who delivered in the teaching hospital in chiang mai and believe me the nutrition in the meo villages was not very good and the hygiene even worse i helped conduct that study with an md from the public health service and the herbalist who taught me most of what i know remarkable it was actually sarah was excited to have the chance to talk about the thai study and her work with the meo and akha tribes it had been a wondrously happy and peaceful time in her life she might still be working and studying there had it not been for the sudden death of louis han and the subsequent entry into her life of peter ettinger so you use this herbal mix instead of prenatal vitamins ever since i found a herbalist in town who could put it together i have i give every woman i see in the ob clinic the choice of taking whatever vitamin samples we happen to have on hand or the tea some pick one some pick the other ive been keeping some notes on birthweights and infant health but the numbers are still too small to see any difference fascinating what sort of herbs and roots are we talking about here do you know about herbal medicine not unless you consider having an assortment of celestial seasonings teas as being knowledgeable i am interested in being enlightened though in that case heres the handout i give to all the women i see in the clinic it lists the nine ingredients in the supplement and what each does angelica dong quai comfrey andrew said scanning the list this is exoticsounding stuff not really if we were in beijing folic acid betacarotene cupric oxide and many of the other components of our standard prenatal vitamins would be considered just as far out point taken this hospital is certainly tailormade for you isnt it i know you have some misgivings but i think we deliver the best patient care of any hospital in the city maybe so were certainly becoming the leading hospital for treating active labor complicated by dic ill say that much for us sarahs beeper sounded ordering her to call extension thats the birthing room she said ive got to go dont worry about your trash ill take care of it thanks andrew do you think we should form some sort of committee to begin investigating these cases i think thats a splendid idea if theres one thing this hospital could use more of its committees im serious i mean its not like an epidemic or anything but two such similar and unusual cases it certainly makes you wonder well as they say in the postal service ive got a delivery to make well talk about all this more later wont we you bet andrew said he watched until sarah had left the cafeteria then he took an envelope from his lab coat pocket and tapped it thoughtfully against his palm not two cases mdear he muttered make that three chapter the surgical senior residents office was an eightfoot square windowless box that had once served the suffolk state hospital as a storage closet to andrew truscott occupying the office at all let alone sharing it with two others was an indignity quite in keeping with those he already had to endure for being associated with the medical center of boston this should have been his year he should have been chief resident and after that a staff surgeon on a tenure track there was no justification for the flake who had been chosen over him at any normal hospital it just wouldnt have happened after a year of postgraduate medical training in western australia he had met and married an american tourist and elected to move to the states he expected the research and practice opportunities for a surgeonand the incomewould be much greater there the medical center of boston was not his first choice for a residency but he was not disappointed to accept eli blankenships offer of a position after all he reasoned it was still a boston teaching hospital three months into his first year of surgical training at mcb truscott began discreetly searching for vacancies in the residency programs at other hospitals but the only available slots were at borderline facilities with even less prestige than mcb so he stayed he detested glenn paris and the carnivallike atmosphere that surrounded the place he disliked working at a hospital that so deemphasized clinical research that it was considered by many academicians to be something of a joke and most of all after investing five years of his life he resented being passed over because he was in the words of his department head too inflexible and intolerant he was then informed that there was neither the money nor the researchoffice space to keep him on staff when his residency was over cut loose by crunchy granola general the final ignominy now andrew truscott sat in the tiny office sipping orange juice from a styrofoam cup and rereading a letter that had been routed to him by the head of the surgical service dated june the letter was from the medical examiners office in new york city it was the department heads request that andrew as chairman of the surgical morbiditymortality committee look into the matter and recommend what departmental action if any was indicated dear doctor first let me apologize for the delay in getting this letter off to you budget cutbacks have hit our agency and greatly slowed the laboratory cytologic and clerical work necessary to complete a case and unfortunately our caseload continues to grow the case i write you about is a twentyfouryearold woman constanza hidalgo who was killed when the car she was driving was struck by a bus in november of last year the details surrounding this case and the findings of my department are presented in the enclosed documents as you will note the woman appears to have been in active labor at the time of her death our laboratory and microscopic studies also indicate that she was suffering from an acute hemorrhagic disorder most likely disseminated intravascular coagulopathy a couple of months ago one of my staff pathologists was attending a national meeting at which he heard another pathologist mention a case of fatal dic complicating active labor quite incidentally he returned to work and mentioned the case to me the hospital at which that woman died was yours i have been able to learn from contacting her family that miss hidalgo was also from boston and was being followed in your outpatient department whether this is coincidence or not i do not know please use the enclosed information in any way you wish and do keep me posted of any developments certainly dic occurs in some pregnancies but in my experience not without a very obvious cause best regards marvin silverman md associate medical examiner andrew opened the copy of constanza hidalgos mcb chart the record dated back to the womans childhood but contained no medical history of particular interest her prenatal appointments were kept without exception and nothing in the clinic notes gave a hint as to the disaster awaiting her and her fetus truscott had already reviewed the chart several times since receiving silvermans letter now though he read even more carefully running his finger down each page until he found a brief outpatient note dated august the note read patient doing well and continuing parttime work as a waitress some complaints of fatigue but no ankle edema abdominal pain urinary frequency headaches blurred vision or unusual bleeding penormal vital signs unremarkable cardiac exam no edema wk uterine fundus fetal heart heard easily at min impression week intrauterine pregnancy plan ptnt elects to switch from prenatal multivits to herbal supplements three month supply and instructions given return to clinic wks the note was signed s baldwin md truscott opened his briefcase and withdrew copies of the outpatient records of lisa summer and alethea worthington the twentytwoyearold woman who had gone into labor on the morning of april had developed horrible dic and had essentially bled to death in the delivery room like constanza hidalgo alethea worthington had been seen once in the obstetrics clinic by sarah and like both lisa and constanza hidalgo she had elected to take sarahs herbal prenatal supplements setting his feet on the corner of his desk truscott mulled over the situation no doubt the fact that each of the three dic victims had taken sarahs herbal supplement was coincidence she had seen dozens of patientspossibly hundredsin the clinic during her two years at mcb and most of them had gone on to perfectly normal deliveries still he thought until the actual cause of the dic could be determined the possibility of using the coincidence to further undermine the public confidence in mcb was most intriguingespecially in the hands of jeremy mallon truscott had almost not even bothered telling mallon about the lights going out on glenn paris but he had and through mallon the attorney who represented the everwell hmo the information had found its way to axel devlin the acidpenned reporter had done the rest truscott opened the herald he did not know how much mallon would be paying him for the changeover day story but the equivalent of two weeks salary was a decent guess the money was certainly welcome but more important was the matter of a letter from everwell guaranteeing andrew a surgical staff position should the hmo acquire the medical center of boston mallon had been generous enough with his payments but he had yet to deliver on that promise perhaps this dic business was just the lever andrew needed to pry that letter loose truscott slid a gaulois from the sterling cigarette case a former lover had given him lit up and then dialed jeremy mallons private line greetings mallon truscott here he said im glad to see you made such quick use of the changeover day tape listen though i have something more for you something quite good actually no i dont want to discuss it over the phone that will be fine just fine oh one more thing a letter that was promised me yes precisely that letter have it with you when we meet will you thats splendid just splendid truscott hung up gathered the xeroxed records together and locked them in his briefcase of all the payoffs from mallon this promised to be the sweetest that his disclosures might cause problems for sarah baldwin troubled him very little as a surgeon she was as capable and selfassured as any woman he had known in medicine but she also represented everything he found distasteful about the medical center of boston and now with this lisa summer thing there would be no living with her or the rest of the oddball element at the hospital she and her cronies were basking in the sunlight of her success like a herd of overfed sheep the timing was perfect to seed the clouds for a little rain besides sarahs ego had survived the other tidbits about her he had fed to mallon it would survive this batch as well the real prizes at stake were glenn paris and his hospital sideshow already wounded and weakened their survival was not nearly so certain as he headed out to check on his service andrew truscott was singing softly to himself oh mcb is falling down my fair lady chapter july sarah had never much liked getting dressed up as far as she could tell that displeasure dated back to sunday mornings in ryerton the rural new york town where she was raised her mother perhaps responding to the stigma of having had a daughter out of wedlock spent at least an hour each sunday getting her ready for church sarahs dresses were pressed and perfect her shoes spotless her hair was often braided half a dozen times before every strand was deemed in place and alwaysat least until the early symptoms of her mothers alzheimers disease began to appearthe outfit was topped with a large white bow now sarah twisted and turned before her bedroom mirror trying to assess the thirdor fourthin the series of outfits she had tried on it was eight oclock in the morning in fifteen minutes her cab to the hospital was due two days before instigated no doubt by glenn paris and his pr department the story had broken in both boston papers about how eastern and western medicine had joined forces at the medical center of boston to save the life of a young woman however the positive publicity for mcb was shortlived a day later a small article under no byline had appeared in the herald unnamed but reliable sources had reported that the unusual and cataclysmic obstetrical bleeding complication was not the first but the third such to occur in an mcb patient within the past eight months and unlike lisa summer the source further related both of the previous cases had died glenn pariss rapid response to the story had been to schedule a press conference for nine oclock on the morning of july with independence day being relatively slow for news his carefully prepared statement was carried by every boston radio and television station presenting at the session he announced would be drs randall snyder and eli blankenship chiefs of the departments of obstetrics and internal medicine at mcb and dr sarah baldwin the resident who had contributed so uniquely to saving the life of lisa summer at eightfifteen when the doorbell rang sarah was wearing leather flats a gathered madras skirt a beige cotton blouse and a handembroidered burmese belt topped by a loosefitting turquoise blazer her major concession to the formality of the occasion was wearing panty hosenot comfortable in any month but even less so in july coming she shouted into the intercom she snatched up the ornate brass earrings fashioned for her by an akha craftsman and slipped them in place as she hurried down the stairs though she admired glenn paris being a performer in one of his extravaganzas was not sarahs style but the report of a third dic case in an mcb patient did demand a quick reassuringbutinformative response from the hospital and paris felt she could help accomplish that what had been a curiosity with the first patient then a serious concern with the second had suddenly become a terrifying priority the cabbie let her off on the street side of the thayer building glenn paris met her in his outer office and greeted her warmly as always he was noticeably well dressed today his tan suit skyblue shirt and red power tie seemed tailormade for television he appeared somewhat tense but there was a confident dedicated energy about him that sarah found disarming and attractive it was the same sort of aura that had initially drawn her to peter ettinger sarah do you have any idea who might have leaked this information to the herald paris asked no sir neither does anyone else ive talked to a letter about the hidalgo case comes in from the new york city medical examiner to our chief of surgery he sends copies to pathology obstetrics hematology internal medicine the morbidity and mortality committee and then almost as an afterthought to me no sooner do i read about the case in my copy of the letter than i read it in the damn paper now isnt that just something each of the people i have spoken with gave a xerox of the letter to one or more others at last count any of twentyfive or thirty people could have leaked it they all say they had no idea it was that important not important well im going to get him sarah this time whoever it is has gone too far mark my words im going to get him im sure you will sarah said softly although she understood his anger she was not comfortable with it she came close to reminding him that regardless of the source of the news leak regardless of the negative publicity something very serious and frightening was going on and the medical center of boston did seem to be right in the middle of it when they left the building on the campus side they saw a fairly large number of peoplehospital staff reporters and one television camera crewstreaming across toward the auditorium looks like were going to have quite a turnout paris said thats good weve got to let the public know were on top of this thing our foundation grant is looking very good but its not a lock negative publicity can still hurt us have you met with any members of the medical staff yet she asked hoping to bring him back to the real issue at hand dr blankenship and i have been huddled almost continually since this article broke i have an old friend whos an administrator at the centers for disease control in atlanta i put eli in touch with him and he tells me theyre trying to get someone up here in time for paris stopped short his hand raised to keep her silent he motioned her into the shadow of the outpatient building ahead of them just at the corner of the building a welldressed man with a briefcase in one hand was engrossed in intimate conversation with one of the hospitals maintenance workers two days before the maintenance staffs wildcat job action had crumbled before pariss threat to fire everyone involved fliers damning his action were subsequently posted throughout the hospital and although they were all back at work none of the maintenance staff had moved to take them down you know that guy in the suit paris whispered sarah shook her head the man perhaps in his early forties had a slight build blowdried hair and a distinctively aquiline profile the diamond in the ring on the small finger of his left hand was easily noticeable from where they were standing some fifty feet away i would say hes either a car salesman or a lawyer sarah said what he is is scum paris responded but he is a lawyer and as a matter of fact hes also an md im impressed dont be his names mallon jeremy mallon ever heard of him no good hes a bigtime ambulance chaser who is also on retainer for everwell i think he even owns a piece of their action for months now ive suspected hes been behind some if not all of the trouble weve been having this little teteatete were watching goes a long way toward proving me right suddenly mallon caught sight of them a word from him sent the maintenance worker scurrying off in the other direction paris moved in quickly with sarah a few feet behind you son of a bitch paris snapped i knew it was you i have no idea what youre talking about mallon said unctuously and i would caution you to watch what you call anyone in public even if paris had not prejudiced her sarah knew she would have instantly disliked the man that power failure was no damn accident paris raged neither was that bogus strike i thought it now i know it i hope you paid that worm well shyster because as of now hes out of a job paris had raised his voice enough so that several of those headed toward the auditorium stopped to watch two mcb administrators one of whom sarah recognized as colin smith the hospitals chief financial officer hurried toward them paris youre way out of line mallon said i dont need to make any trouble for you you do a perfectly good job of that all by yourself get out of here right now nonsense theres a publicly announced press conference that i want to attend it will be fascinating to see how you plan to tiptoe around the fact that this place is becoming a death house why you filthy the two administrators stepped in front of paris before he could lunge at the man easy glenn colin smith said hes not worth it i want you away from my hospital paris shouted youre looking and sounding more and more like a drowning man paris said mallon who suddenly appeared to sarah as some sort of serpent and as for its being your hospital enjoy it while you can because i dont believe that will be the case for much longer get out of here this time colin smith had to physically restrain his boss i do actually have more important things to do than to watch you gun yourself in the foot again paris i can catch the highlights of that on the evening news mallon turned without waiting for a response and left through the outpatient building scum paris muttered easy does it smith urged theyre not going to get us colin the day everwell and that creep take over mcb will be the day they have to bury me itll never happen glenn smith said weve got the ace up our sleeve you know that and i know that his words had a remarkably calming effect on paris sarah could see the muscles in his face relax his fists unclenched and finally he smiled right you are colin he said right you are youre a good man he apologized to sarah for his loss of composure and introduced her to smith and the other man whose title had something to do with overseeing the hospitals physical plant then he sent them on ahead sarah in case you hadnt guessed he said the ace colin was talking about is our grant its coming from the mcgrath foundation and weve been courting them for almost three years now but please not a word to anyone as i said before this is not yet signed sealed and delivered and i have no doubt that if he knew the magnitude of the grant and who it was coming from that sleaze mallon would do whatever he could to keep it from happening itll happen sarah said well its down to the wire now we get the money we win we dont mallon and everwell win its about as simple as that as they reached the building that housed the auditorium they heard then spotted a sleek helicopter which swooped over the campus and then made a neat landing on the helipad paris had insisted be built atop the surgical building the person from the cdc sarah asked doubtful i dont even know if theyre sending anyone yet more likely its some network vip coming to the press conference or else one of our patients has some welloff family or friends doubtful again i have every admission checked over by our pr staff if somebody worth knowing about was a patient here i promise you id be aware of it now then lets go in and give them a show ill do what i can sarah said belted in the copilots seat of his sikorsky s jet helicopter willis grayson watched the medical center of boston expand below what excitement he felt at the prospect of seeing his only child for the first time in five years was virtually consumed by his rage at those who had led her to such a place and such a condition upon his return from restructuring a silicon valley company he had found a detective named pulasky camped outside the gate to his long island estate the detective had the first new photos grayson had seen of his daughter since well before she disappeared the man also had with him copies of both boston papers and although the stories in them contained no pictures of lisa summer pulasky assured him the patient in the medical center of boston and his daughter were one and the same person a visit by some of graysons boston people to lisas jamaica plains address confirmed pulaskys claim after paying the man off grayson had made two calls the first was to summon his pilot the second was to order ben harris his personal physician to cancel his office patients and clear his schedule for an immediate flight within two hours they had touched down on the rooftop heliport of the medical center of boston keep her warm tim grayson said stepping out onto the tarmac if lisas in any condition to travel were getting her the hell out of here and down to our hospital he helped his internist out onto the roof now dont hold anything back from me ben he ordered remember your allegiance is to me not to that inbred medical fraternity i keep reading about if someones fucked up with lisas care i want to know for nearly all of his fiftyfour years the driving force in willis graysons life had been anger as a child he had drawn strength from the helpless rage of being strapped down on hospital beds while doctors wrestled with his lifethreatening attacks of asthma in his teens fury at the prolonged absences of his industrialist father and the emotional unavailability of his socialite mother became manifest in repeated aggressive acts leading to his expulsion from several private schools and years later when he was finally admitted to the inner sanctum of his fathers company it was his desperate unbridled need for retribution that drove him to maneuver the man out of power and to rechart the course of the business from manufacturing to corporate raiding in just over two decades his personal worth had grown to nearly half a billion dollars but within him little had changed lisas room was on the fifth floor of the building on which the chopper had landed while the helipad was state of the art the fifth floor was in need of refurbishing in less than a minute grayson had made mental notes of an unemptied wastebasket walls in need of paint an unattended elderly patient strapped to his chair in the hall and a pervasive smell that he suspected was a mix of grime sweat and excrement this place is a pit ben he said i just dont understand it she could buy her own goddamn hospital and she ends up in a place like this graysons people had reported lisas room as with his physician several paces behind grayson hurried past the nurses station oblivious to the woman who was seated there writing notes the stocky young nurse whose name tag identified her as janine curtis rn mscn called out to them excuse me may i help you no grayson growled over his shoulder were going to room five fifteen please stop she demanded grayson stiffened then his fists slowly opening and closing at his sides he did as she requested behind him dr ben harris breathed an audible sigh of relief lisa summers real name is lisa grayson grayson said with exaggerated patience im her father willis grayson and this is her private physician dr benjamin harris now may we proceed confusion darkened the nurses face and then just as quickly vanished our visitors hours dont begin until two she said but if lisa approves ill make an exception just this once graysons fists again clenched but this time they remained so do you know who i am he asked i know who you say you are look mr grayson i dont want to be ben i just dont have time for this grayson snapped you stay here and explain to this woman who i am and why were here if she gives you any problem call the goddamn director of this excuse for a hospital and get him up here im going to see lisa he stalked off without waiting for a reply one of the slidein labels on the door of room read l summer the other was blank willis grayson hesitated had he done the right thing by not sending flowers or calling first if as he suspected others had poisoned her against him there was no telling what she was thinking no he decided it was better to make this visit unannounced after she had been coerced into leaving home by charlie or chuck or whatever the hell his name was grayson had spent tens of thousands of dollars trying to find her the trail went cold in miami then suddenly the boy showed up at home without her and with no idea where she had gone for months afterward grayson had him followed and his mail screened but nothing came of it eventually the boy had just drifted away with no clue as to how close he had come to having both his legs brokenor worse no grayson thought angrily it will take more than a few flowers he tapped lightly on the door waited and then tapped again finally he eased it open the olio of powder and lotion starch and antiseptic was familiar and unpleasant he had not been in a hospital room since the evening nearly eight years ago when he and lisa sat together holding his wifes hand as she surrendered to the malignancy she had battled for over a year now his daughter sat motionless in a padded highbacked chair staring out the window the sight of the bandages covering what remained of her right arm brought bile to graysons throat he stepped around and sat down on the marble sill lisa glanced at him momentarily then closed her eyes and looked away hi honey he said im so glad i found you ive missed you so much he waited for a response but knew from her expression and the set of her shoulders that there would be none damn them he thought lumping her friends roommates lovers and doctorsreal and imaginedinto an illdefined object of molten hate damn them all to hell for bringing you to this im sorry for what youve been through he tried again please lisa please talk to me i want to get you out of here dr harris flew up with me you remember him hes right outside his staff is waiting for you at the medical center back home hell check you over and if he says its safe well have you there in ninety minutes tims on the roof with the helicopter hes missed you too hon everybodys missed you lisa lisa continued looking away grayson stood and paced about the room searching for the words that would begin to open her heart to him if only you had listened to me in the first place he wanted to scream if only you had listened to me none of this would have happened i know youre angry with me he said instead but everything can be all right now youre all i have and ill do anything to have you with me again please lisa i know youre hurting i want to help you fight back i want to help you find out why this horrible thing happened to you and and to my grandson and if anyone is responsible i want more than anything to be the hammer that helps you strike them down all right all right he took a calming breath and moved back to the window i understand that it might not be easy for you after all this time listen ill be staying at the bostonian the number will be right by your phone im going to arrange for a private nurse to take care of you and im going to have ben harris get in touch with your doctors please baby ii love you please let me back in your life he hesitated and then turned and headed for the door come back later daddy she said suddenly grayson stopped were the words only in his mind this afternoon she said three oclock i promise to talk with you then her soft monotone held neither anger nor forgiveness willis grayson turned back and stared at her lisa was again sitting motionless gazing out the window okay he said finally three oclock he gently kissed his daughter on the top of her head she reacted not at all ill be here at three he whispered thank you baby thank you he paused by the door and looked back once again at the stump that had been her hand and arm someone was going to pay chapter sarah followed glenn paris through the front entrance to the amphitheater and up onto the stage only the last few rows of the hall were empty and people were still trickling in the three boston television stations representing the big three networks each had a pod of lights a video man and a reporter set between the low stage and first row of seats although sarah rarely watched television she recognized two of the newspeople clearly the possibility of the outbreak of some rare disease held more than a little public allure the podium covered with winecolor velvet was festooned with microphones a dozen or more behind it were five folding chairs three to one side and two to the other eli blankenship and randall snyder were already seated with one empty chair between them paris motioned sarah to that seat if paris was nervous about the event or the absence of a representative from the centers for disease control it did not show in his face or manner he measured the hall for a time then buttoned his jacket and crossed over to the three physicians well we certainly cant cry apathy about this one he said softly this whole show would have been a bit tighter if the cdc could have gotten someone up here but well just have to make do ill make a few introductory remarks then you eli you randall and finally you sarah i would suggest keeping your statements brief and filling in as questions are asked the only advice i would give you is to remember that the less you say the harder it will be for them to misquote you im going to limit each of you to ten minutes including questions if it seems appropriate at the end ill allow a few more and dont worry youll all do fine sarah knew the all was aimed directly at her he really loves this stuff doesnt he she said as paris approached the podium he should blankenship responded hes very good at it you on the other hand look a little peaked are you going to make it i thought id be fine until i got up here look at that mob blankenship reached over a meaty hand and gave her a fatherly pat on the shoulder just remember the old medical adage he said all bleeding eventually stops thats very reassuring thank you pariss introductory remarks made without notes and delivered without a hitch painted the picture of an institution devoted to the health and welfare of the citizens of boston and fearless about stepping forward to confront problems of public concern we have been in close contact with the epidemiology division of the centers for disease control in atlanta he said and they have promised to send us one of their top people to augment our own intensive investigation i had hoped he would be here in time to participate in this news conference he gestured to the empty chair beside his but unfortunately that wasnt possible the three cases of dic he stressed might add up to nothing more than coincidence however the approach decided upon by the medical center of boston was to take the bull by the horns and begin an immediate investigation while keeping the public aware in an ongoing manner sarah was disturbed that paris would tout the imminent arrival of a cdc epidemiologist when he had just told her he did not know if one was even coming at all but she reasoned that the exaggeration was harmless enough and given the circumstances understandable he was simply trying to diffuse as many issues as possible and in fact by the time he introduced eli blankenship it was as if the herald item had not forced his hand at all buoyed by the ceos performance sarah felt some of her tension abate still it was not until blankenship was finishing his formal remarks that she felt comfortable enough to look out at the audience if as she remembered once hearing the amphitheater held at least were there many of those attending were residents and medical school faculty including andrew who was back in his traditional lastrow center seat but a significant number judging from their appearance and dress seemed simply to be from the community among them sarah recognized one woman with whom she was training to do home birth just as she had with lisa it wasnt difficult to imagine her thoughts and concerns but it was another woman seated not far from andrew whom sarah found the most interesting she was african in her skin color hairstyle dress and jewelry and even through the lights and distance her uncommon beauty was obvious sarah was scanning the audience when she realized the striking young woman was looking straight at her smiling i know you from someplace dont i sarah thought but from where blankenship lumbered back to his seat to a smattering of applause sarah whispered congratulations even though she realized that she had been preoccupied with the woman in the last row and had missed his final answer as sarah expected randall snyder was downtoearth and reassuring in his presentation and responses to questions the three dic cases were certainly a cause for concern he said but without a careful review especially of the way the diagnoses were made it was still too soon even to link them meanwhile he concluded the public should rest assured that his department would be carefully screening all obstetrical patients for any abnormality suggesting an increased susceptibility the applause for snyder was measurably louder than it had been for eli even though his presentation had not been nearly as substantive the power of the fatherly image sarah acknowledged recalling at the same time that she had voted for substance over fatherly image in almost every presidential election since she turned eighteen and had only once backed the winner finally it was her turn in an effort to keep reasonably organized she had printed the points she wanted to make on a set of threebyfive file cards by the time her fiveminute presentation was over she had covered most of what was on them throughout her remarks though she felt a gulf separating her from the audience she knew that in spite of herself she was sounding stilted and far more proselytizing and pompous than she had intended hey everyone this isnt me she wanted to scream out these are issues i really care about i would love to talk about thembut with you not at you how about we all go to the arnold arboretum throw some blankets on the grass and really get into why people become ill what it means to be sick and what it takes to get well concluding her formal remarks she thanked everyone for their concern and involvement and invited questions in an instant the audience which had seemed indifferent and half asleep became a kelp forest of waving arms and hands sarah glanced over at paris to see if he wanted to step up beside her and choose but the ceo just smiled and winked she shrugged turned back to the forest and pointed do you honestly think your acupuncture and lisa summers imaging of her blood cells stopped her bleeding of course i do you idiot i believe strongly that they were two of the factors as i said there were other efforts going on at the same time have you ever stopped someones bleeding with your techniques before perhaps if you tried your very hardest maam you could sound even more patronizing not specifically but i have assisted on several operations in which only acupuncture anesthesia was used each time the amount of bleeding was impressively minimal tell us more about your background you mentioned working in a holistic healing center where was that glenn is it time yet right here in boston it was called the ettinger institute annalee in disbelief sarah stared across the audience at the woman in the last row annalee ettinger smiled and waved it had been seven years since sarah had seen the girl peter had brought home from mali as a child and subsequently adopted but time was hardly the reason that recognition had come so slowly when sarah moved out of their back bay condominium annalee had been a dear and interesting fifteenyearold but she was also painfully shy and markedly overweight her transformation was miraculous her face with its wonderfully high cheekbones seemed almost sculpted sarahs gaze shifted to her long enough to confirm that the connection had been made annalee smiled and nodded ettinger the questioner went on is that the same ettinger who does those programs on tv for that diet powder ii really dont know sarah said outside of catching jeopardy once in a while in the on call room i almost never have time to watch television and i havent been in touch with mr ettinger in many years it is a woman called out it is the same man im taking that stuff of his and ive already dropped thirty pounds its fantastic the audience laughed roundly and sarah knew that she had lost control of the session glenn paris quickly stepped to the podium dr baldwin thank you very much he said he motioned her to her seat and led the audience in applause perhaps it was the somewhat controversial nature of her presentation perhaps the lack of a crisp definitive closing whatever the reason sarah felt that the audience reaction to her was polite but hardly enthusiastic if snyder got the tens of thousands of dollars in prize money and the chance to return tomorrow to defend his championship and blankenship got the home entertainment center she had just won best wishes and a jeopardy board game oblivious to the supportive whispers from blankenship and snyder sarah focused on a spot of floor next to glenn pariss shoes waiting for the words that would send everyone home her performance had been far from stunning but not a disaster best of all it was over now there were questionsseven years worthoccupying her thoughts and the answers to them all were as close as annalee ettinger glenn paris ended the session with the promise to keep the public informed of any developments immediately a number of reporters rushed onto the stage rudely jostling one another as they jockeyed for position around the speakers concerned about the delay sarah made eye contact with annalee who assured her with a dismissive gesture that she was in no hurry finally the gaggle of questioners began to disperse sarah accepted a pat on the back from paris and was about to leave him when an older woman approached a leather portfolio tucked beneath one arm sarah had noticed her standing at the back of the auditorium throughout the conference she was quite unimposingfive feet four or soconservatively dressed in a straight dark skirt and blazer her short carefully permed hair was an equal mix of brown and gray and although her face had a pleasant peaceful quality her features were nearly lost behind round oversized tortoiseshell spectacles in her survey of the crowd sarah had cast the woman as a grandmother from the community too selfconscious to work her way past people and into a seat dr baldwin mr paris she said my name is rosa suarez her pronunciation of her name was distinctly latin yes mrs suarez paris said unable to cull the hint of impatience from his voice what can we do for you the woman smiled patiently that man from the centers for disease control about whom you spokethe topnotch epidemiologist you were promised yes paris said yes what about him well i am he chapter the park a sandy oasis with a few slatted benches and some wellworn playground equipment was located several blocks from the mcb sarah signed out to one of the other residents and walked there with the woman who had once very nearly become her stepdaughter but this annalee ettingerslender selfassured and surprisingly worldlybore little resemblance to the shy rotund girl sarah had once tried so hard to befriend from the first tentative minutes of their conversation sarah felt a stronger connection between them than at any time when peter was part of the equation i wrote you from med school sarah said as they settled on one of the benches two or three times you never answered annalee nodded i know she said about a year or so after you left i was looking for something in my fathers desk and i found one of your letters it didnt have an envelope or a return address i made a copy of it and kept that but i never confronted my father about it i was a selfcentered little tub back then and pretty wrapped up in myself and my problems perhaps i should have pushed things and tried to get back to you but whatever your reasons you had left us i guess it really didnt matter enough to me at that time to pursue it her voice was deep and melodic her nails perfectly manicured and polished a highgloss crimson if as a teen she was often silly selfabsorbed and immature she now projected a maturity well beyond her years im sorry for leaving the way i did sarah said i was so angry still i cant imagine peter doing something like keeping my letters from you he was very hurt and angry when you walked out on us so was i for that matterat least until i found that letter she slid a pack of virginia slims from her purse her gold and silver bangleseight or ten on each wristjangled as she tapped one out i dont suppose you smoke not for years good good for you she lit up and inhaled deeply through her nose and mouth i tried to explain the reasons i left in one of my letters to you sarah said god i shudder to think what version of the story you must have gotten my fathers a marvelous man but he does have his faults holding grudges is one of them did you know that he got married a year or so after you left a revenge marriage if ever there was one she was quite a looker in a waspy kind of way and from a bigbucks family that probably came over on the mayflower im surprised he didnt send you an invitation very funny listen annalee things happen the way theyre supposed to happen i really believe that ninetyfive percent of what your father was i loved but the other five percent involved bigleague stuff that i just couldnt see having to live with for the rest of my life and i didnt believe there was much chance that those particular things would change i think its terrific that he got married well i dont believe he shares your opinion doc the marriage only lasted a year oh i see did you get along with her considering that i was probably the first black woman carole had ever been near who didnt work for her i guess we did okay i didnt see her much really a short time after you left peter shipped me off to boarding school that was another reason i never got around to trying to find you i was so messed up sending me off to school may have been the right idea but his timing was lousy i think when he brought me home with him from mali he expected id become someone other than what i was turning out to bea college professor or concert musician or something anyhow being away at miss whatzernames the way i was it seemed to me like one minute ol carole was there the next poof and when did he close the institute not too long after all that we lived in boston for a while longer then his xanadu thing actually began to happen ah peters dream sarah said i knew hed pull it off someday xanaduthe first of what would eventually be a chain of upscale residential communities centered about the principles of living a long and healthy life through diet exercise seasonal routines stress management and holistic medicine peter had spoken about his ambitious concept the day they first met and they had spent countless hours discussing and dissecting it during their years together at the time of their breakup he had begun looking for available land and investors and even had a glassenclosed architects model of the prototype complex prominently displayed in the institutes conference hall the design of the homes he insisted would be strictly controlled all construction would be in accordance with the ancient laws of health and harmony subscribed to by the indian ayurvedic healers its beginning to happen in a pretty big way now annalee said but the whole thing was touch and go for a while at one point peter was even talking bankruptcy well what happened that powder happened thats what powder the powder they were talking about at your conference from what i can tell it really saved his behind she laughed exuberantly hey thats great now that i think about it that powder saves peters ass and gets rid of mine what a product i dont understand the xanadu ayurvedic herbal weight loss system she said why woman surely you have heard of it not until today i havent i was very confused when they started talking about it at the press conference and everyone in the place seemed to know what was going on except me thats because everyone in the place except you did know what was going on most folks in the country for that matter why peters been on tv so much lately pushing that ol system of his its a wonder he hasnt been nominated for an emmy you dont watch tv i dont have time annalee stubbed out her cigarette and seconds later lit up another well she said he does these things called infomercials theyre set up to look like real programs half an hour long with guest stars and film clips and allbut what they really are is commercials they run mostly in the offhoursyou know late nights and sunday mornings and damn are they beginning to bring in some bucks peters got charts all over the wall in his office showing the constant rise in sales since he started this campaign just a few months ago its been phenomenal and all of a sudden the big bad wolf has backed away from the xanadu door does the powder actually work sarah asked id be fascinated to know what herbs are in it hell yes it works annalee said peter didnt invent the mixture though this indian doctor dr singh did hes not an md hes an ayurvedic doctor i guess you know what thats all about ayurvedic medicine was being taught in india centuries before hippocrates or galen were born there are some pretty solid reasons why its survived over all this time well dr singh brought his powder to peter a few years ago and offered him some sort of a partnership i think im not sure of the details but im sure they included peters acting as the spokesperson for the company dr singh seems very bright but he isnt exactly the most dynamic photogenic critter ive ever seen have you heard of him no no i havent i dont know much about him either anyhow seeing as i had only tried one or two hundred different diets without much success peter asked me if i wanted to be his guinea pig and try the stuff out before he invested in it the result she rose and spun around to give sarah a look bravo and you dont have trouble staying on your diet what diet why those of us who are into infomercials know that the xanadu ayurvedic herbal weight loss system preaches no dieting only moderation and avoidance of a few forbidden foods lets hear it for moderation sarah cheered delighting more every minute in the oncesullen girl heres the best part annalee went on in the beginning when i first started the powder i tried moderation and i lost weight after a month or two just because i am who i am i tried eating like a piglet and i still lost weight thats what really sold peter now isnt that something sarah rose and hugged her lovingly it is that she said she held annalee by the shoulders and moved her back enough to focus on her face annalee i always thought you were pretty special and that problems or no problems you had tremendous potential i want you to know that i underestimated you you have really become a wonderful beautiful person hey thanks youre pretty special yourself but you left a word out when you were describing me lets see wonderful beautiful and pregnant annalee read the shadow that crossed sarahs face and happy she added quickly very happy this babys being born come hell or high water and if i have my way youre gonna deliver it hey thats great thanks for asking me ill have the chief of the department be our backup annalee im really really excited for you are you sure about the pregnancy planned parenthood did the test goodness but those people are some of the best on earth they guessed maybe four or five months more but they couldnt be certain without more tests my periods have always been screwed up thats why i waited so long before even considering i might be pregnant well congratulations ill check you over and maybe even get an ultrasound annalee this is going to be fun i know it will i was in the middle of deciding who to go and see when i read about you in the papers then i heard about the press conference on tv and i said to my boyfriend taylor the first hands to touch this baby are going to be sarah baldwins taylor huh i like the name so give me the lowdown what does he look like what does he do lets see hes got a face like denzel washington an ass like wesley snipes and he moves like michael jordan lord and hes a musiciana damn good one bass guitar horns even rock and roll hell no jazz i sang with his group for a while thats how we met you see dr singhs powder kind of backfired on peteron me too i think i was in college at u mass doing reasonably well as a psych major but not enjoying it or my miserable social life very much then all of a sudden the woman beneath the flab emerged and i guess i sort of got well out of control you might say thats understandable i ended up on the west coast running with a fast crowd singing with this group and that and trying to make it in films i had some nibbles from a few producers but more often than not they were nibbles on my earlobes and breasts finally i met taylor his last names west right then and there i began to mend my ways hes on the road a lot and we arent exactly rolling in dough so a few months ago i took peters offer to come home and help him at xanadu and what does he think about becoming a grandpa he um he doesnt know hes only now getting to know taylor and he still believes im going to start school again in january sarah took time to ponder that news i certainly hope you will get your degree at some point she said finally but you know im thinking that you ought to tell him give him the benefit of the doubt ill consider it well speaking from a purely biological standpoint annalee pretty soon hes going to start wondering why his fabulous xanadu ayurvedic powder has failed in such a specific lowbelly way you do have a point there thanks its good to know ive mastered some of the basics over my years in obstetrics and you know as long as youre giving him the benefit of the doubt i think id feel more comfortable if youd tell him about your seeing me as well seven years is long enough for most wounds to healeven peters besides just like your belly sooner or later thats going to come out too if you wish it it shall be done i wish it but you should certainly do what feels right to you it just seems as though if youre living with him and hes helping to support you i understand on the other hand i dont think anything would be served by getting on his case about the vanishing letters from me ancient history exactly god im blabbering on and on do you think i could be nervous about dealing with your father after all this time lets just say that you better be a damn sight more relaxed when youre delivering our baby annalee laughed again her smile made her remarkable face even more appealing ill work on it sarah said one last thing though name it if im going to be your obstetrician and you want to give that kid of yours the best chance to be healthy those cigarettes have got to go the younger womans almond eyes narrowed couldnt i find something else to give up instead she asked sarah shook her head im afraid its a big deal all right okay the smokes are history excellent sarah checked the time listen she said im due back at the hospital but if youll walk me back id like to tell you at least a little bit of my version of what happenedwhy i left you dont need to sarah slipped her arm inside annalees i know she said by the time they arrived at the gate to the mcb campus annalee shaking her head sadly had her arm draped around sarahs shoulders nothing youve told me comes as much of a surprise she said hes really not a bad guy just difficult sometimes and speaking of surprises it probably wont surprise you much to know that henry mcallister is as devoted to peter as ever hes been to xanadu for dinner and hes designing a big fountain for the front lawn youre right sarah said im not surprised her voice trailed away although she had visited mcallister once in the hospital after his operation he never indicated that he knew the role she had played in saving his life and she had chosen not to be the one to tell him she knew and that was all that matteredor at least so she had thought at the time well now annalee said quite obviously changing the subject i for one and this baby in here for two are gonna have the time of our lives over these next few months im gonna stop smoking and stop drinking and stop staying up to all hours and stop eating twinkies andsay do i have to stop no sarah said no you can keep doing that right up to almost the end in that case what you see before you is the start of the perfect pregnancy a textbook case listen as long as youre here ill tell you what why dont you come by the clinic right now you can register as an outpatient afterward and have the routine blood and urine tests done before you go home i have enough time to do a quick exam just to make sure everythings okay after that well stop by my locker i have a supply of the natural prenatal supplement that many of my patients take you ought to get started on it now that is assuming you prefer the organic to the stuff from the drug houses im still my fathers daughter annalee said besides if you recommend something im doing it after all youre the doctor rosa suarez placed the last of her clothes into the maple highboy and then set framed photographs of her husband alberto three daughters and four grandchildren on the doilycovered bedside table the bed and breakfast she had chosen from the list supplied by her department was hardly elegant but it was comfortable enough and within easy walking distance of the medical center of boston after nearly twentyfive years on the job and dozens of extended field investigations the routine of unpacking was as familiar as her robe but there was something special about this assignment long term or short significant findings or not this investigation would be her last she had left her letter of resignation on the section chiefs desk and had promised alberto that this time she meant it now everybody would be happy her husband at seventy nearly a decade older than she would have some reasonably healthy years to enjoy retirement with her her department would be able to bring in some new blood and more important they would be able to wash their hands of a colleague who had become something of an embarrassment to themthe old lady who many of them believed had botched a major investigation mrs suarez theres two packages here for you heavy ones her landlady called out from just outside her door just sign for them mrs frumanian but dont try to lift them theyre books ill be down for them in a minute following her assignment to the boston case rosa had spent hours in the library she set her portfolio on the bed and took out the notes she had made diligent preparation and obsessive attention to details those had always been her trademarkthe keys to what had once been an unbroken string of successes they had never failed her not even in san francisco and she vowed they would not fail her now she knew there was nothing her section chief wanted less than to turn this investigation over to her the bart fiasco had probably cost him a promotion and since then he had gone out of his way to keep her shuffling papers making out bibliographies and sorting through miles of computer printouts but at the moment of the call from boston she was the only field epidemiologist available and people were dying she changed into the gray champion sweatsuit her daughters had given her for christmas and padded down the narrow stairway mrs frumanian was standing guard over the two boxes waiting it was clear to check on their contents she was a pleasant ample woman with a deeply etched face that rosa found interesting i can manage all right mrs frumanian thank you she said nonsense i am twice your size and you are my guest if you have books to carry i have books to carry her dense accent was eastern european but rosa could pinpoint it no closer than that frumanian sliced open the boxes with a paring knife she conveniently produced from her apron pocket hematology advanced computer programming differential calculus coagulation the older woman read the titles off as she stacked each volume on her arm her pronunciation was surprisingly good two of my boys finished college she said they brought home books like this on their vacations all the time but they never read them well i expect to spend a good deal of time reading these mrs frumanian rosa ushered the woman out the door as gently as she could limits had to be set if she was to get work done she had been given this one chancethis one last chanceto go out a winner this time she would trust nobody nobody at all chapter willis grayson cradling a bundle of exotic flowers trotted up the stairs to the fifth floor of the surgical building a slight cold had kept him out of his pool since his return from the coast and even this bit of exercise was welcome he had left the hospital that morning ecstatic over lisas decision to talk with him later he and ben harris had spent an hour with dr randall snyder the obstetrician seemed a decent enough sort though certainly no intellectual giant still ben was impressed with him and that was sufficient to soften much of williss kneejerk anger toward the physicians who had cared for his daughter it also alleviated some of his misgivings about the medical center of boston the care lisa had received seemed to have been adequate especially considering that snyder and the hospital had believed all along that she was without any means to pay for it it was disappointing to learn that snyder and the others on the medical team had no clue as to what might have caused lisas blood problem still it did appear that an effort was being made to get to the bottom of things grayson charged ben harris with obtaining the names of the leading experts in the field so that they could be put on the case next on graysons agenda would be a visit later that afternoon to the head of physical therapy and rehabilitation he would tactfully inform her that while he appreciated the efforts of her department the people at the rusk rehabilitation institute in new york would be overseeing the selection and implementation of lisas prosthesis and then finally perhaps in the morning he would try to meet with the obstetrics resident who was said to have done more than anyone else to save lisas life if in fact sarah baldwin had played such a role his people would be instructed to learn about the woman and her needs and to come up with an appropriate reward energized at regaining the control that had eluded him for nearly five years grayson strode down the corridor to room both of the slideins on the door were empty he knocked once and then eased the door open both beds were newly made and the room unoccupied what in the hell battling anxiety confusion and anger grayson checked the two metal armoires and then the bathroom all were clean and empty after leaving lisa that morning he had tried to get her transferred to a single room when informed that every room on the floor was a double he had left strict instructions with the head nurse on the floor to notify admissions that he would pay whatever was necessary to keep the other bed in room empty what in the hell could have happened he threw the flowers onto one of the beds and raced to the nurses station janine curtis the nurse to whom he had spoken earlier appeared prepared for a confrontation miss curtis he demanded whats become of my daughter she held his gaze evenly nothings become of her sir she said with exaggerated patience shes doing fine shes been moved to another room but we agreed this morning she would stay where she was and that no one would be moved in i know what you requested sir but lisa asked to be moved to another room and we obliged her well then where is she now he snapped im afraid i cant tell you that sir the nurse said miss curtis im not in the mood for games its mrs curtis and this is no game your daughter told us quite emphatically that she does not wish to see you what she said that if you want to speak with her you might try coming back tomorrow morning shell see how she feels then dammit she told me just a few hours ago to come back at three this afternoon now where is she mr grayson please keep your voice down our patient has given us a clear and specific order and we fully intend to honor it i would suggest you do as she asks and return tomorrow and i would suggest you be very careful whom you talk to like that mr grayson you made it perfectly clear who you were this morning in all honesty it makes no difference to me lisa is an adult with control over the decisions involving her life she is also my patient shes been through a great deal and i intend to do whatever i can to honor any wishes she might have she smiled at him coolly and then returned to her work glowering at her grayson gave brief thought to searching every room on the floor then he stormed off the initial meeting between andrew truscott and attorney jeremy mallon some two and a half years before had actually taken place at a red soxyankees game before glenn paris canceled the everwell hmos contract with mcb the organization had used the hospital for a modest percentage of its inpatient cases each year as a thank you to the residents the hmo would rent a bus load it with beer and take the entire house staff to a clambake and then to fenway park having heard rumors of andrew truscotts profound disenchantment with mcb mallon had carefully arranged the seating so that he was next to truscott by the end of the third inning they had evolved makeshift code words for the hospital and key personnel and had established their mutual distaste for glenn paris and his offbeat antics by the bottom of the fifth truscott had made it clear that he was not unwilling to provide inside information on hospital goingson in exchange for certain considerations and by the seventhinning stretch they had exchanged numbers and agreed to meet again in the near future now some later andrew scribbled a fictitious name in the log book of the office building at one hundred federal plaza and rode the elevator to the twentyninthfloor law offices of wasserman and mallon his relationship with the attorney was a shaky one andrew neither trusted nor liked the man and although mallon was too slick to get a decent handle on andrew suspected those feelings were reciprocated however there was no denying that each had profited from the other and with the information he had tucked in his briefcase tonight their collaboration seemed destined to continue the brass plaques on the mahogany doors to the firms suite listed four partners and about twenty associates jeremy mallon was the only one with an md in addition to his law degree the spacious interior with its glassenclosed library and multiple secretarys desks had an array of original oils on the walls that included a sargent an okeeffe and a small wyeth truscott wondered in passing how many physicians malpractice victories and settlements it had taken to develop such a collection as soon as he entered the reception area andrew caught the aroma of chinese food and after brief stops before the sargent and a striking piece by the contemporary realist scott pryor he followed the scent down the hall to mallons office although the number of white cartons spread across the teak table suggested a small banquet only mallon was there come in andy come in mallon motioned andrew to a seat with his chopsticks i didnt know what you liked so i ordered a little of everything andrew winced at the use of his nickname which he had never liked andy despite the hefty payments he felt wary around mallon a gladhander who always seemed to have a hidden agenda if it served his purposes andrew suspected the attorney would devour him with the same dispassionate enthusiasm he exhibited toward the peking duck theres beer wine or whatever else you want in the fridge beneath the wet bar mallon said forgive me if i seem to be rushing but axels holding up writing his column until he hears from me and theres a reception at my club that my wife has made mandatory no problem my club although andrew was uncomfortable with the man personally he did admire his power and style more than once in their dealings thoughts of what a law career would be like crossed his mind somewhere down the road a brass plaque might read wasserman truscott and mallon did you watch the news tonight mallon asked no i just got out of work goddamn paris made it onto all three stations im really sick of seeing that bozos face on tv what goes around comes around andrew said tapping his briefcase well i hope whatever it is you have is good because we are running out of time what do you mean just that competition in the managed health care business is getting more intense every day its already big fish eats little fish no one is safe and everyone is justifiably paranoid right now everwells in a pretty decent position but theyre so strapped for beds and office space that theyve decided they cant wait much longer for mcb to go up on the block theyre looking at other options the best of which will cost millions more than it would to make a firesale buy of mcb millions and ultimately anything else they acquire will deliver much less in terms of space and equipment we need that hospital ive heard rumors of massive layoffs pending at mcb doesnt that suggest the financial problems are getting worse theres a big difference between rumors and done deeds andy people may be talking about layoffs but my sources say that mcb has actually begun some hiring and theres more for several years now ive had a pipeline into some of the really big creditors of the hospital including the bank that holds one of its mortgages they tell me that recently paris and his financial advisor colin smith have stopped scrambling for money theyve even started paying off some bills i think its got to be that foundation paris talked about in the speech you recorded that was the first time i ever heard him mention it truscott said and youre sure he never gave the name you heard the tape i want that name andy and quickly if we know what were up against chances are we can come up with some sort of countermeasure if paris and smith manage to get that place out of the hole well probably never get another shot at it remember how much i said is at stake for us assuming i get you the name andrew heard himself say i expect a small portion of those millions will find its way in my direction mallons eyes flashed do yourself a favor andy he said with chilling calm and dont try and put the screws to me okay just come up with that name let me choose the reward we both know you have no future at crunchy granola general zip and need i remind you that except for a few hospitals way out in the boonies the market is already glutted with general surgeons its a safe bet that those few who are getting hired for decent jobs were chief residents in their training programs thats something youre never going to be putting on your resume your future is with us andy you know it and we know it so just help us out where you can and get me that name truscott reddened clearly he was out of his league mallon was a pro at manipulation and control all andrew could do was hang in there and learn from the man his own day would come point made he said excellent now what have you got for me in that briefcase andrew handed over the sheet sarah had given him along with xeroxes of the three hospital records and also some notes he had made this involves sarah baldwin he said ah yes another major thorn in our side the woman has certainly become a media darling andrew remembered sarah the next chief resident in obstetrics seated across from him in the cafeteria smugly lecturing him on the power of alternative healing well your friend devlin may be in a position to change that he said mallon scanned sarahs prenatal information sheet bloodroot moondragon leaves elephant sleeper these are all herbs of some sort they are theyre boiled and drunk as some sort of tea as you can see each item has several names baldwin recommends them over the standard supplements pregnant women are required to take she claims a study done in the jungle somewhere proved the herbs are superior to what she calls processed vitamins fascinating go on andy well most everyone at mcb thought the summer girl was the second dic case at our hospital she wasnt she was the third he slid across the letter from the new york medical examiner as you will see from studying the hospital records ive copied all three women who got dicthe two who died and the one who is still in the hospitalhave one definite thing in common besides the fact that they all were mcb patients all three opted to take baldwins herbal porridge it was clear from mallons expression that no further explanation was necessary does any other obstetrician prescribe these he asked no where does she get them from some herbalist in chinatown do you want me to find out who absolutely theres no time tonight though as soon as were done im going to fax these over to devlin and dont worry no one else will lay hands on those records tell me do you think taking these herbs could have caused that blood problem not by themselves i dont but there are examplesmany examples actuallyof an allergy to one substance sensitizing patients to the action of something else give me an example mallon said scratching notes on a pad well lets see a number of antibioticstetracycline is probably the best knowncause extreme sensitivity to sunlight in certain patients the reaction is not completely understood and can be very very severe we have no idea which tetracycline users are going to get it many dont so we just tell everyone who gets put on the drug to stay covered up yes i remember that now have you had a chance to study this list ive looked it over none of it makes much sense to me i tried looking up some of the herbs and its going to take someone with more time than i have and access to a better library the various namesscientific western asianmake the whole thing pretty complicated the more complicated the better mallon said there are potential problems of miscommunication all over the place language problems fouledup shipping orders lack of consistent dosage control andrew added contamination with other herbs or pesticides scary stuffespecially if any of these herbs has potential effects on blood clotting mallon spent half a minute absently tapping his eraser on the table well the whole thing would pack more punch if we knew more of the biology he said finally but until we do i suspect devlin will be able to get a few miles out of what we have here this material has potential andy big potential i agree tell me whats your relationship with this sarah baldwin truscott thought a bit then said simply i dont have one well then do what you can to dig up anything else on her andy anything at all mallon took two envelopes from his desk a reward for your loyalty and for this information he said passing one of them over and heres the letter you requested from the medical director at everwell the position it promises assumes that everwell will be taking over mcb no takeover no position clear clear good i like clear youre doing fine andy just fine mallon slipped the material into his briefcase and snapped it shut rather than try to fax all this to devlin im going to drop it off myself sorry to seem as though im rushing you out but my wife is waiting for me no problem truscott said as they headed out im about a week behind in sleep and i ought to try to get at least a little caught upespecially seeing as how im scheduled to meet with willis grayson tomorrow morning the willis grayson yes didnt i mention that god that was dumb of me i meant to tell you about that when i got here and i got so involved with tell me about what mallon had stopped walking the girl who survived the dic the one whos still in the hospital yes she turns out to be graysons daughter what i dont know the whole story but apparently shes been living this hippie existence for years as lisa summer grayson showed up by helicopter this morning hes made appointments with every doc who had anything to do with her case why i dont really know i guess he wants to find out exactly what happened im scheduled to meet with him at eleven mallon rubbed at his chin do you know where hes staying he asked grayson nope no idea it doesnt matter i can find that out what kind of shape is his daughter in shes depressed as hell but medically shes doing pretty well her armwhats left of itis healing nicely and she lost her baby thats right willis graysons grandchild pardon nothing nothing suddenly oblivious to andrew mallon snatched up the phone from a nearby desk called axel devlin and alerted him that a messenger would be by shortly with a special package for him then he dialed another number whos this brigitte oh luanne howre you doing this is jeremy mallon speaking fine im just fine thank you listen you know the reception yes well mrs mallon is there right now and shes expecting me would you find her please and tell her im going to be late in fact tell her that if im not there by ten i wont be there at all do you have that thank you luanne thanks very much ill catch up with you later in the week he set the receiver down i dont think mary ellen would trash seventeen years of marriage over one missed reception he said as much to himself as to truscott listen andy im going to stay here and make some calls you know the way out yes sure are you going to try to contact grayson the mans got a ton of lawyers im sure but i doubt any of them are mds men like grayson want the best ive just got to find a way of educating him as to who in this type of legal business the best is you take care now without waiting for truscott to leave he hurried back into his office take it or leave it by axel devlin july dateline crunchy granola general aka the medical center of boston mcb at a news conference attended by just about everybody in the city with a microphone glenn paris aka california dreamin let the public in on the latest tribulation to befall his onceaugust institution of healing it seems mcb obstetrics patients three of them that we know of have developed a horrible bleeding disorder called dic one of those poor souls lost her arm the other two lost their lives and all three of their unborn children died before they could be birthed five dead one maimed this is serious stuff my friends serious and terrifying as hell always image conscious paris yesterday staged a smooth and appealing show the purpose of which was to assuage public concern over this sudden lethal epidemic mds gave medical explanations paris promised an immediate investigation by the epidemiology section of the centers for disease control in atlanta and last but far from least herbalist acupuncturist and obstetrician sarah baldwin md explained how she had leapt into the breech with her trusty acupuncture needles to save the life of the latest dic victim well it turns out that there was one fact that neither dr baldwin nor mr paris chose to share with the publicone potentially crucial thing that all three afflicted women had in common they had all taken a special herbal prenatal supplement concocted by dr baldwin herself its made up of nine different herbs and roots with names like elephant sleeper and moondragon the good doctor recommends it to all her clinic patients in place of tried and true and fda controlled prenatal vitamins now two of those herbal prenatal supplement patients are dead and a third is maimed coincidence well i ran all this past a pharmacist friend of mine we are still trying to wipe the astonished look off his face he now has the list of the roots and herbs in dr baldwins potion and has promised to do some research for us all meanwhile even he will not be able to answer such questions as where do these herbs and roots come from who checks them for contamination who checks them for composition incredible isnt it what can happen when a health institution is allowed to slip farther and farther out of the mainstream of accepted medical care well stay tuned and dont say the old axeman didnt warn you chapter july sarah stood in the operating room beneath an icy bluewhite light she was delivering an infant by cesarean section before a gallery of observers that included it seemed every person with whom she had had any contact over the eventful week just past too bad your babys dead she said to the patient whose face was covered with a sheet she turned to the gallery and bowed too bad everyone her babys dead too bad glenn paris smiled down at her approvingly as did randall snyder and annalee ettinger alma young in uniform applauded and blew her kisses several reporters from the press conference gave her aokay signs others photographed her then with a flourish she whisked the sheet aside only to see herself her eyes were bloody hollows her mouth was agape in a silent scream of death sarah awoke shrieking bathed in a chilling sweat it was fourthirty in the morning trembling she pushed herself out of bed and pulled on her robe then she put on some tea and drew a hot bath she was terrified she knew not only by the disturbing content of her dream but by the fact that she had experienced it at all for much of her early life she had been a slave to all manner of nightmares the most consistent scenario often recurring as many as two or three times a week revolved around her being bound gagged and totally helpless from there on any given night she would be stabbed repeatedly beaten smothered thrown from a great height or hurled into the sea never in the horrible dreams did she actually see the face of her assailant on rare occasions the manshe never doubted it was a manwould burn her with cigarettes at times the vivid nightmares so haunted her so dominated her life that she would simply refuse to go to sleep in her midteens at the suggestion of a concerned teacher she began seeing a psychologist it seemed obvious to the woman that some event in sarahs pastisolated or recurrentwas at the core of her terror the therapist did what she could to get at that source but sarahs mother already drifting deeper and deeper into her dementia could supply little useful information the psychologist then sent sarah for a number of sessions of hypnosis and once even took a day off to drive her to syracuse for a consultation at the university medical center nothing helped sarah simply could not connect with any event in her childhood that could have sparked such bizarre and debilitating fantasies during college the disturbing dreams seemed to come less frequently but they were no less terrifying she tried another course of psychotherapy and hypnosis and even consented to take some sort of pill designed her physician said to alter the neurologic pattern of her sleep what the drug altered instead was her grade point average which dropped that semester from a to a eventually peace did come for her the answer lay in the simple mountain people whom she had traveled halfway around the world to help in a village in the foothills of luang chiang dao just a few miles from the burmese border dr louis han placed her in the hands of a healera wizened stoopshouldered man who was han said over years old the healer speaking a dialect of mandarin that sarah could not understand communicated with her through han whether her nightmares were grounded in a past event or perhaps even a future event was of no consequence he said what mattered was that at the time of sleep she was not at ease the spirit that guided her throughout each day remained locked within her the devastating dreams were nothing more than that day spirit expressing anger at being detained and demanding a clean separation from her so that it too might rest and renew all sarah need do to end the nightmares the old man promised was to spend some quiet contemplative time at the end of each day first embracing her guiding spirit and then releasing it not even louis han knew the exact nature of the tea the healer brewed for her that night but sarah drank it willingly and soon drifted off to sleep when she awoke two days later she knew the day spirit within her an elegant pure white swan each night from then on she meditated before going to bed often actually seeing her swan take flight her days even the most trying ones began ending peacefully and the vivid nightmares that had defied her and so many physicians had never recurrednot until tonight the hot water supply in sarahs building which later in the morning would be inadequate even for a decent shower was plentiful at such an early hour sarah kept the tub filled with a slow hot stream until she trusted her shivering was gone for good things happen for a reason she reminded herself the belief was one of the pillars on which she had built her life things happen to teach us or to send us off in other more important directions by the time she toweled off and slipped into her robe the message in her nightmaretwo of them actuallyseemed quite clear understandably but quite unacceptably she had begun allowing the demands of work to override her life her periods of meditation and reflection had grown brief and generally ineffectual the connection with her spiritual self was all but gone she was paying less and less attention to sarah trusting more and more that her work on behalf of others was enough to provide her with the strength to deal with each day the nightmare was telling her otherwise it was telling her something else as well she had made more than enough appearances on center stage lecturing to educate medical students and other residents was one thing providing news footage was quite another from this morning on she resolved it would be back to basics and back to business no more cameras no more interviews she padded over to the window the first streaks of dawn glowed against a dull slate sky and shimmered off a misty rain one other positive thing her nightmare had given her was some extra time before work time to get centered to regain perspective beginning tomorrow she resolved when she wasnt at the hospital she would set her alarm to awaken her twenty minutes earlier she put on a tape of ocean sounds set a large pillow on the floor and eased down into a lotus position please let me do the right thing today she thought settling herself with a few deep breaths for my patients and myself let me do the right thing her breathing slowed and grew shallow the tightness in her muscles began to disappear her thoughts grew more diffuse and less distracting then the telephone rang the fifth ring told her that her answering machine was not turned on the tenth that the caller was determinedor in trouble betting a hundred to one that it would be a wrong number or worse a crank sarah crawled over to the phone by her couch hello she said clearing some residual sleep from her throat dr baldwin yes dr baldwin this is rick hochkiss im a stringer with the associated press and i was at the news conference you gave yesterday you are extremely thoughtless and rude to be calling at this hour she debated simply hanging up what do you want she asked finally well for starters id like your comments on the accusations made about you in axel devlins column this morning lisa grayson sat before the popup mirror in her tray table trying as best she could to do something with her hair in minutes her father would be making his third visit to the hospital this time she was ready to see him she had made the decision the night before but not an hour ago a messenger had delivered a gold necklace bearing her name in elegant script with a diamond chip dotting the i had that been allhad her father continued to show no insight into who she was or what was important to hershe might well have decided to send him away once again but with the gift was a note it was written on stationery her mother had commissioned years before featuring an etching of stony hill their home lisa set her brush aside and studied the picture wondering if her room had been changed at all then she reread her fathers words dear lisa i know that you are angry with me for things i did that hurt you im sorry very sorry that i did not take the time to understand you better i need you please forgive me and come back into my life i promise this time it will be on your terms i love you daddy im sorry five years

she needed him as well perhaps she always had the telephone interrupted her thoughts hello lisa its janine at the nurses station your fathers here again good its time could you please send him back when willis grayson knocked and entered her room lisa was on her feet facing him he held a rose in one hand and a newspaper in the other he stood in the doorway for a time getting a sense of her then he tossed the paper and flower on the bed and rushed to embrace her you have no idea how much ive suffered without you he said daddy you wrote you were sorry for the way you treated mefor driving me

want me to i do grayson stepped to the doorway and motioned moments later two men entered carrying briefcases one was overweight the other was thin and sharpfeatured with hard gray eyes miss lisa grayson her father said proudly motioning to the heavier of the men this is gabe priest his firm handles much of our business on long island the lawyer stepped forward about to offer lisa his right hand at the last moment he realized what he was doing stepped back and nodded and this man will be handling matters for us in boston grayson went on motioning the other one forward lisa id like you to meet jeremy mallon chapter at onefifteen in the afternoon for the first time in her professional life sarah asked to be replaced in the operating room the case a tubal ligation by laparoscope was straightforward enough and one she had looked forward to doing but the morning had been a blur of conferences explanations phone calls and more phone calls and no matter how she tried she simply could not get focused enough to feel at ease in the operating room for a physician with distracting problemspersonal or professionalthere is no more difficult or dangerous place to be than in a hospital sarah had heard that statement more than once in required courses on risk management and liability but she had never experienced it personally under the best of circumstances one lecturer had warned the possibility of committing a serious error was like a raven perched constantly on the shoulder of every doctor feeding on fatigue time constraints routine and loss of concentration a collapsing marriage financial strain alcohol drugs or accusations of any sort of impropriety only heightened already disconcerting odds a momentary distraction the omission of a decimal point in a medication order the failure to notice a change in one of dozens of laboratory test resultsthe possibilities for disaster in an acute care facility were endless and frequently well camouflaged make the physician in question a surgeon sarah thought now and add the pressure of having her problems become public knowledge and the lecturers spectral raven turns into a vulture she took a cup of tea to an empty room in the residents sleeping quarters and lay down trying to will her dull headache into submission the am call from the ap stringer had been quickly followed by three others all reporters all wanting her thoughts on axel devlins column after her tenth no comment and her fourth please dont call me again she unplugged her phone a brief try at returning to her meditation was fruitless finally she pulled her yellow slicker over her spandex and walked her bike through the soft rain to the small market at the end of her street there were three other people in the store sarah felt conspicuous and ill at ease as she paid for a coffee and muffin and then as casually as she could a copy of the herald huddled in a deserted shop doorway down the street from the market she first scanned then carefully picked through axel devlins prose the column did disturb her greatly but more for its baldfaced bias and obvious intent to harm than for its content what devlin had written was in essence factual all three of the dic victims had seen sarah in the outpatient department and all three had opted to take the herbal supplement over the synthetic but whatever had caused their bleeding problem had nothing to do with that choice the herbs she prescribed were the precise mix that a scientifically designed study had proven superior to synthetics she had reprints of the article published in english in one of the most prestigious medical journals in asia and would have provided a copy had she only been asked the content and purity of her herbal mix was the province of kwong tianwen one of the oldest most experienced and most respected herbalists in the northeast the purity of his products she could easily argue rivaled or exceeded that of most pharmaceuticals especially the generics time and again since government regulations had begun requiring the use of generic substitution wherever possible one or another of the many flybynight manufacturing companies had been cited for peddling substandard medicine and many times the drugs involved had lifeordeath potential still the punishment meted out to the companies was more often than not an admonition and a slaponthewrist fine it would have been a pleasure sarah felt to air such issues if only devlin had done his job fairly if only he had asked for her side now she was faced with the prospect of having to hold a press conference of her own just to be certain her responses to his allegations were laid out clearly and completely throughout the morning just past the atmosphere surrounding her had been a striking contrast to the cheers and backslapping that had followed her treatment of lisa summer by the time she arrived on the obgyn floor for rounds copies of the herald were everywhereat the nurses station on the bedstands in patients rooms even in the bathroom of the staff lounge there was an almost palpable coolness from many of the nurses along with whispers behind her back and gestures she caught out of the corner of her eye but virtually no one mentioned the column to herno one except her department chief the chief of staff the ceo of the hospital and the head of public relations at noon she managed to break away from the madness to visit lisa if anyone deserved a personal rebuttal of devlins implications it was she the empty room scrubbed and waiting for its next patient was unsettling but no more so than the news that lisa had left the hospital with her father not fifteen minutes before with no attempt made to call sarah no message left just a discharge order from randall snyder and she was gone an hour later sarah had asked someone to take over for her in her laparoscopy case by twothirty a brief nap and three aspirins had eased the pressure in sarahs head she set her copy of the herald on the small metal desk and pulled a pad of lined progress note sheets from the drawer she had always been a fighter but twice in the past she had decided not to dignify axel devlins jibes at her with a response this time there was no way she was going to turn her back on his bullying she would state and restate her position and qualifications and she would not stop until his destructive irresponsible reporting techniques were exposed at wellesley her anthropology honors thesis had been highly praised both for its content and for her writing style there was no reason she could not draft a press release that would put devlin in his place and make strong points for certain herbal therapies as well carefully she read through the column again this time underlining key words and phrases although it was not essential it would help to know the source of devlins information glenn paris had spoken of the constant damaging leaks of hospital goingson and had even threatened termination for anyone found responsible was this particular column the result of just another in that series of leaks or was someone specifically trying to bring her down herbal prenatal supplement nine different roots and herbs elephant sleeper moondragon was there any chance a patient of hers had gone to devlin with the clinic handout that made no sense she had never kept secret the supplement or its contents and no onenot even devlinhad shown any particular interest in it not until now now two of those patients are dead and a third is maimed sarah scratched her pen absently along one edge of the pad who knew that she had at one time or another seen all three victims in the clinic who would have had access to their records would devlin have trusted a source other than a doctor where do these herbs and roots come from who checks them for contamination for composition even the tone of devlins questions sounded professional someone had fed him the words furthermore that someone almost certainly had to have been a physician for a few suspended minutes sarah closed her eyes searching her memory sorting through the facts and possibilities no she whispered suddenly oh no she hurled her pen against the wall then she snatched up her clinic coat and stormed from the room why andrew she cried as she raced down the stairs for gods sake why money of course truscott said simply sarah slammed her fist down on the herald landing dead center on axel devlins sketched likeness andrew i know you dont like glenn and you dont like this place but weve been friends for over two years you would do this to me for money not for money luv for lots of money and as for our being friendsthe last friend i remember having stole my bike in the fourth grade and gave it to a girl he liked oh andrew you can handle it kid you are possibly the most competent woman i know and just remember theres no such thing as bad publicity there is only publicity the article will raise public awareness of your cause thats bullshit and you know it who paid you devlin everwell sarah glared across the desk at the surgeon its really none of your business who paid me truscott said you know sarah i didnt make up any liesabout this place or about you you did see all three of those women and you did give them your little potion andrew before turning bits and pieces of information over to a person like devlin you could at least have taken the time to speak with me or to read the studies on the supplement you know what you didthe way you did itwas wrong cant you at least admit that ill tell you what truscott said with sudden vehemence ill admit that what i did was wrong as soon as you admit that ever since you arrived at this place youve annoyed people with your holierthanthou attitude regarding the inadequacies and callousness of the way we poor limited mds do things you walk around with this smug ifonlyyouallknewthegreatsecretsiknow ifonlyyouallwereascompleteadoctorasiam attitude that just about everyone in this place finds threatening but let me finish you may think youre helping to make all of us more complete doctors but even in this place even in crunchy granola general where almost anything goes youre looked on as a kook the women on the staff think youre not professional enough and the men are so intimidated by you that they avoid you like sea captains avoid icebergs so before you start attacking me you might take a look at yourself sarah felt perilously close to tears she had been wronged clearly wronged by this man yet here he was putting her on the defensive over her years at mcb she had felt almost universal respect and acceptance from the staff male and female many like alma young had gone out of their way to tell her so her performance evaluations were consistently among the highest of the residents after two decades of solo practice randall snyder was considering her for a partnership why was she letting this this clone of peter ettinger get to her so she bit at the inside of her lip until she felt certain her tears were contained then she snatched up the herald and turned toward the door where are you going truscott demanded im going back to work what are you going to do about all this if you mean am i going to glenn the answer is i dont know yet they wont fire me not without hard proof andrew she said without turning back right now thanks to what youve done i have more important things to worry about than whether or not they fire you chapter july the exercise room an expansive solarium at the rear of the great house was as well equipped as most health clubs annalee ettinger while not nearly as fanatical about exercise as her father did work out most days there was a universal free weights a stairmaster treadmill and nordictrack as well as a continuouscurrent lap pool ballet bar tumbling mats and a sauna today peter had just finished a session with his trainer and was putting in some extra time with the weights annalee was feigning a workout on the universal waiting for the right moment for conversation although she was no longer in as much awe and fear of the man as she had been for so many years neither was she particularly comfortable around him and although she understood him well enough to predict his reaction to most situations she was completely in the dark as to how he would respond to what she was about to disclose she glanced over at him and couldnt help but be impressed at fortyeight he had the body of a thirtyyearold he worked obsessively on his strength and flexibility and did forty minutes of tai chi a day for balance and centering in his professional and personal life he was unaccustomed to weakness or failure how would he view the decisions his daughter had made annalee was not yet two when he brought her home from mali in his accounts of the adoption peter left no doubt that he had saved her life her mother had died from dysentery and the chances for her own survival were poor i wanted to bring every orphaned child in the village home with me he had told her more than once but that wasnt possible so i carefully evaluated dozens of factors in dozens of children and i finally picked you because you wouldnt let go of my leg from the beginning the standards of achievement and success he set for himself were those he set for her it might not have been fair but it was the only way he knew throughout her school years her persistent weight problems and ennui were a source of constant concern for him still though she always felt judged and often inadequate she never doubted that he cared over their twenty years together he had dated many women lived with two and married one but he had never made her feel secondary to any of them and now despite her years of rebellion and insensitivity toward him he had welcomed her home provided for her and made her a part of xanadua part of his dream the xanadu holistic health community was being constructed on acres of mixed farmland and forest crisscrossed by centuriesold fieldstone walls the great house a rambling thirteenroom structure had been built in at the time peter purchased the property the house had decayed to the point that several architects felt there was no possibility of restoring it he had proven them wrong and now the house complete with ninefoot ceilings and reconstruction that was true to the original was a showplacethe centerpiece of xanadu peter had given annalee a small office on the ground floor and made her the assistant director of marketing and public relations it was their decisionhis reallythat she would switch her major to business when she resumed fulltime studies in january eighteen months later she would be ready to go for an mba meanwhile summers and vacations she would continue to expand her role at xanadu now one way or the other those carefully designed plans were about to change hey dad lookin good lookin good she said peter was doing situps with a fivepound dumbbell in each hand his forehead and razorcut silver hair glistened with what seemed to annalee to be just the right amount of sweat perfect perspiration she thought thats it thats peter ettinger in a nutshell enjoy your youth while you have it he responded without slowing this gets harder and harder you quitting yeah iim not feeling so hot today the comment put an abrupt end to peters workout now that you mention it ive been noticing that you havent looked well the last couple of days he said toweling off nonsense she thought it was doubtful that they had seen each other for five minutes over the preceding week you dont have to impress me peter believe me im already impressed a little peaked huh she said yes yes exactly he glanced over at her fine ebony face oh very funny annalee reminded herself that her fathers sense of humor was far less developed than most of his other attributes she would do well during this session to keep hers in check she stretched her long slender body to the maximum and wondered if he noticed the smooth low mound beneath her leotard ive been feeling a little sick to my stomach she said perhaps some ginseng tea he stared out at a backhoe rumbling down the hill toward the lakeside amphitheater construction site and a little bloated in that case perhaps we should brew it with a bit of apple bark and saffron andand i havent had a period in five months peter tensed visibly and turned to her slowly how long five months his eyes narrowed am i to assume then that you are pregnant annalee managed a thin smile that would be a safe assumption she said west the musician yes his first names taylor dad in case you forgot youre certain about it being taylor no about the pregnancy annalee searched her fathers face and voice for clues as to what he was thinking and feeling at first reading the signs werent encouraging im certain i had the test and peter before you ask the next obvious question i want you to know that im very happy and excited about the whole thing thats nice please dont be flippant peter pulled on a loose terrycloth tshirt annalee could see him processing the implications of her news his displeasure was clear but that was no surprise little pleased him that he did not initiate or control and taylor he asked hell still be on the road a lot with the band but sooner or later well be getting married peter snatched up a tenpound dumbbell and absently did half a dozen curls first with one arm then the other you love him he asked suddenly the question startled annaleeespecially coming as it had before any inquiries about taylors income or earning potential yes yes i love him very much and hes serious about his music he is very serious annalee could barely believe what she was hearing this was a side of her father that for years she had thought was reserved for paying customers only i have a frienda patient actuallywhos a vice president at blue note records do you know that company only the best jazz production people in the business i can get taylors band a recording audition peter that would be wonderful after the marriage thats sort of up to and if my friend says theyre good enough i will back the production of their album i see provided the two of you and the child choose to make your home here at xanaduat least until you are on your feet financially thats a very generous offer annalee you are my only child i want you to have a good life i understand she said still surprised and a bit bewildered by his reaction i cant say for sure that taylor will go along with your conditions but i think he will so do i peter said and of course i would like the child to be delivered here at xanadu well get the finest midwives in the world to attend you peter ii had kind of decided that i wanted to have the baby born in a hospital and delivered by an obstetrician oh annalee strongly sensed that her father already knew what was to come next ive already been to see one shes agreed to take me on as a patient she annalee sighed sarah sarah baldwin i went to see her at her hospital the explosion she expected did not happen i know peter said simply what i saw you in the audience on the evening news to say you stood out in the crowd would not be doing you justice why didnt you say something i am saying something now that i know what your visit there was all about im saying a great deal i will not have my grandchild brought into this world in some germinfested antisepticreeking mistakeprone hospital and especially not by sarah baldwin but annalee theres a copy of yesterdays herald and this mornings globe on the bench over there both of them contain stories about sarah i assume you havent read them or heard the news last night otherwise you would surely have mentioned it he waited patiently as she scanned the papers did she put you on those herbs he asked yes ii thought that was something you would approve of there is nothing sarah baldwin could ever do that i would approve of except maybe to abandon altogether her destructive efforts to combine medicine and healing but annalee there are some men coming to see me at two oclock this afternoon i think you should be present at that meeting who are they two oclock my office and please not a word to sarah baldwinat least not until you hear what these men have to say agreed annalee studied the pain and anger in her fathers face she knew sarah had hurt him by leaving but until now she really hadnt appreciated how much agreed she said finally chapter july lydia pendergast bent at the waist and slowly ever so slowly stretched her hands downward toward the floor to one side of the small examining room sarah chiropractor zachary rimmer and one of the pain unit nurses watched expectantly down and down she goes lydia said and where she stops nobody knows she was a sprightly woman in her early seventies who had become virtually bedridden by low back pain and stiffness a number of orthopedists and neurosurgeons had pegged degenerative arthritic spurs as the cause of her disability they cited the uncertainty of the corrective surgical procedure as well as her age and the advanced condition of the spurs as reasons why they could not operate finally one of them had referred her to the mcb pain unit a multidisciplinary clinic that was rapidly becoming known and respected throughout the northeast shortly after arriving at the hospital sarah had begun volunteering her acupuncture skills at the clinic she usually managed half a day a week lydias fingertips touched the tile ta da she sang without straightening out okay now dr baldwin this ones for you she shifted her feet slightly continued down until her palms were flat on the floor and waited until sarah snapped a picture with the clinics ancient polaroid then to the applause of her small gallery she straightened up and curtsied god bless you god bless you all lydia pendergasts words were echoing in her mind as sarah carried her box of acupuncture needles up the stairs to the lockers on thayer four a treatment success a grateful patient work to do the day seemed almost normalespecially when measured against the two that had preceded it there was still a coolness from many on the hospital staff that sarah found unpleasant but certainly not unbearable and several times just as she sensed she might be breaking down someone would say something kind or encouraging the annoying persistent and unconscionably rude press was another problem altogether she had stopped answering her phone at home and had gotten the hospital operator to screen calls to her carefully it wasnt fun but she knew that like all things it would pass sarah had opened her locker and so was partially screened when the elevator doors glided open and andrew truscott stepped out he hurried down the corridor and into one of the sleeping rooms that sarah frequently used it was odd that andrew would be taking a break at this hour she mused although it was close enough to lunchtime perhaps he was hoping to sleep off a headache or something she smiled at the thought one headache he would not be needing to sleep off was sarahs reporting him to glenn paris she had opted not to do so a few hours after their confrontation in andrews office and had told him of her decision the following day she had not expected him to thank her and in that regard she was not disappointed you do whatever you want he had said testily without proof and with your current status in this hospital i doubt paris or anyone else would pay much attention to what you have to say truscott was absolutely right she knew she had enough problems without getting into a hiswordagainsthers battle with the impeccably proper senior surgical resident even so she would have gone ahead and reported him if shed thought it would help if the leaks continued she would no longer have a choice sarah was about to close her locker when the elevator doors opened again this time margie yates a pediatric resident stepped out yates the mother of two was married to a sweet guy who ran the hospitals social service office she was bright and attractive but she was also insecure and a terrible flirt from behind her locker door sarah could not help but watch as margie straightened her white clinic skirt checked herself in a compact mirror knocked softly on the door to room and slipped inside andrew and margie yates not really that much of a surprise sarah decided as she gently closed her locker door and headed down the nearby stairs andrew seldom spoke of his wife or child and margie from time to time had been linked by rumor to other physicians at mcb both had huge egos and massive need for approval their tryst unpleasant as it was to observe made perfect sense sarah picked up a tuna sandwich chips and pineapple juice in the cafeteria and carried the lunch outside to one of the campus tables first the admission of betraying his hospital and now margie yates over the past few days andrews stock had plummeted she ate quickly and reentered the hospital through the surgical building andrews name was being called out via the overhead page he was wanted in room stat a firstyear surgical resident named bruce lonegan raced past her and up the stairs toward the second floor hey bruce whats going on she called dont know he yelled back excitedly a ruptured triple a maybe triple aan abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture of one was perhaps the ultimate surgical emergency even if she had pressing obligations on her service which she did not for at least another hour sarah would have responded to any such call for help besides she thought cattily at this moment andrew truscott might not be in the greatest shape to perform emergency vascular surgery room was in the early stages of the organized chaos that accompanied crisis in a teaching hospital bruce lonegan and another surgical resident were scurrying about an elderly gentleman who was in obvious severe distress he was unconscious or barely conscious twitching about and moaning get ten units crossmatched stat and be sure the or is ready lonegan called out art get an arterial line in him somebody try and get a pressure dammit where the hell is andrew how can i help sarah asked as the overhead page again urged andrew to the room this guys andrews patient lonegan said he came in about three or four days ago for an elective aneurysm repair he was in some heart failure so the medical people had us delay his surgery while they got that under control he was scheduled for the or tomorrow a nurse just walked in and found him like this his pressures way down hes out of it his belly seems tense its got to be the triple a leaking dammit are they beeping andrew as well as voice paging him at that moment sarah remembered that there was no overhead page on the thayer sleeping floors andrew obviously hadnt given the room number to the operator if his beeper was turned off no one would know how to reach him no one except me she picked up the bedside phone and suggested the operator try ringing thayer if dr truscott doesnt answer please call me back immediately she instructed lonegan and the other resident had been joined by someone from internal medicine it was clear the patient was losing ground lonegan had been a practicing md for exactly one week without the senior vascular surgery resident he was lost and he looked it andrews pager may not be working sarah said realizing that she had to take over until someone more senior or surgically specialized arrived ive given the operator some instructions on reaching him meanwhile be sure of your lines get some fluids into him use a doppler stethoscope to check what pulses you can catheterize him and have everything ready in the or why is he twitching like that his blood pressures only about sixty the medical resident said thats why although she admitted to herself that the internist might be right sarah did not feel comfortable with that explanation she had seen many patients in shock some of them in fullblown seizure because of it but something here was different from those cases without making any show of it she carefully checked the old mans acupuncture pulses several of them felt weak and thready she was not experienced enough to know the exact significance of her findings but she sensed that whatever was happening was more generalized than a leaking arteryperhaps some sort of metabolic derangement the phlebotomist had just finished drawing the mans blood sarah pulled the woman aside have them run a complete chem screen please she said as absolutely fast as they can especially electrolytes sugar calcium phosphorus and magnesium the bedside phone rang sarah snatched it up listened for a moment and then set the receiver back down dr truscott will be here in just a minute she said it was almost five minutes before andrew charged into the room by that time the anesthesiologist was at the bedside some incompletely crossmatched blood was being pumped in and transportation was standing by outside the room awaiting the dash to the or the patients family had also been called and told about his turn for the worse emergency as opposed to elective repair of the aneurysm lowered his chances of survival considerably sorry everyone truscott said immediately taking control my damn beeper went belly up ignoring sarah completely he rapidly assessed the old mans physical status and then ordered transportation into the room next he turned to his intern who gave a nervous somewhat garbled account of what had transpired i have the or on standby lonegan concluded blood is off for chemistries and crossmatch thats good old boy truscott snapped listening once again to the mans abdomen with his stethoscope because were going to be cutting skin before you can say tie me kangaroo down transportation rushed into the room and began transferring the patient to a litter only then did truscott turn to sarah so what brings you down here doctor he asked is this man having some gynecological problems on top of everything else one nurse laughed out loud sarah kept her cool by reminding herself that she cared too little for the man to allow him to upset her in any way i thought you might be a little tired and in need of a little extra help she said i knew you were um resting in room i was at my locker when you went in thats how the page operator knew where to find you truscotts face paled the corners of his mouth twitched thank you for that he managed you certainly have been kind to me lately think nothing of it sarah responded her eyes fixed steadily on his the team had finished loading the old man onto the litter truscott motioned them to the or with a flick of one hand in seconds the room was empty save for sarah and one nurse the floor littered with bloody pads and gauze wrap needle guards rubber gloves iv tubing boxes and the like looked like a war zone sarah gloved and began picking up some of the litter ill take care of this the nurse said why are you more trained for this job than i am the nurse smiled thanks she said at that moment the phlebotomist raced into the room carrying a computer printout where is everyone she asked breathlessly gone to the or why the technician handed over the printout his magnesium level is zero point four she said the supervisor said to tell you theyve run it twice and sarah was no longer paying attention she glanced at the phone thought better of it and then raced from the room a magnesium level of far below normal would explain the clinical picture entirely it was lifethreatening in any circumstance but would be fatal if not corrected before surgery the cause she guessed might be the old mans intolerance to the vigorous diuretic treatment that was being used to correct his heart failure iatrogenic illness or injury caused by the words or actions of a physician sarah flashed on the sign that once hung over peter ettingers desk there was every reason to believe that the patients striking turn for the worse was due to his treatment not his diseaseto the diuretics not the aneurysm she reached the operating suite doors just as the litter was being wheeled into one of the ors andrew wait she cried out it took less than half an hour for the old man to respond to his magnesium infusion and wake up until his retirement a year before terence cooper had been a boatbuilder of some note he had a cackling laugh and a wonderful toothless smile and upon meeting sarah he immediately asked her out on a date assuring her that his wife wouldnt mind all that much mrs cooper keeps telling me to try out new things he said sarah let him squeeze her hand and then turned to leave until that moment andrew had said very little to her now he stepped between her and the door i can explain about room four twentyone he said softly i couldnt care less she responded except that you should have been more alert after you got down here if you hadnt been sleeping i suspect you would have checked those chems before you took him to the or i suspect youre right good sarah said easing past him and into the hallway i love being right thanks for saving my bacon he called out after her youre a hell of a doctor sarah considered some sort of response then just shook her head and continued on her pager sounded just as she reached the obgyn floor she responded expecting to hear andrew anxious to continue mending fences instead the voice on the line was annalee ettingers sarah sat on the edge of the bed in the small residents call room listening sadly to annalees account of what had transpired with her father i couldnt tell what upset him more annalee said my going to see any md at all or my going to see you in particular im the least important factor in this equation i know an obstetrician in worcester who would be happy to do a home birth for you peters insisting on no mds midwives only hes even talking about flying some in from mali how do you feel about all this i feel sorry for you for whats being written in the papers but that stuff hasnt influenced me one way or the other good and even the things peter promisedthe money and the recording chance for taylor and all but no matter how hard i try i cant get past all the things peters done for mefrom the very beginning i understand i know hes not perfect but annalee you dont have to explain i understand besides youre a healthy young woman in great shape i have no reason to think therell be any problems ill send you the name of the obstetrician in worcester just in case you want his help in any way thanks for not making this any harder for me sarah nonsense there was a prolonged uncomfortable silence sarah theres something else annalee said finally peter insisted i sit in on part of a meeting in his office go on four men and peter they want to hire him to check into the composition of that herbal supplement of yours and to check up on someone named kwang or kwok or something do you know who that is sarah was beginning to feel queasy yes i know who that is she said who were the men two were suits from new yorklawyers they were there with this guy willis grayson the father of the girl you saved the dude must be big stuff because peter was like a puppy around him he acted as if i was supposed to know who he was too but i didnt who was the other man sarah asked her hands felt like ice around the receiver another lawyer oilier than the others if you know what i mean his names mallon unfortunately i know him too sarah peter said some pretty unkind things about you i think thats what he wanted me to hear he said you were never as good an herbalist or acupuncturist as you liked to believe i was on the edge of telling him to stop or just walking out but i just couldnt do either one imim sorry annalee dont be sorry sarah said just do what feels right and dont lose touch with me i appreciate your calling me like this im sorry annalee said again sarah hung up without another reply she felt there was a chance that if she tried to speak she would begin to cry and annalee did not deserve that sort of additional stress how crazy when they were togetherat work and as loverspeter had told her and anyone else who would listen that she was one of the finest american herbal therapists and acupuncturists he had ever known now suddenly she was an inept fraud sarah bunched the pillow beneath her head and stared wearily at the ceiling the truth was that in becoming an md in trying to blend the best of eastern and western medicine she had become a threat to practitioners on both sides that andrew and peter the two practitioners attacking her now both happened to be male may or may not have had significance but she suspected it did for a time blanketed by a pall of loneliness and isolation she wept soon though she felt her spirit begin to regroup within a nidus of anger beyond tweaking two bulbous egos she had done nothing wrong if it was a fight they wanted it was a fight they would get she picked up the phone and paged eli blankenship within a minute he returned her call dr blankenship she said i dont know exactly who im supposed to talk to or what im supposed to do but id like to meet with you as soon as possible i think im about to be sued chapter july sarah was certain that at times in her life she must have felt as conspicuous and illatease as she did tonight but she could not remember when the milsap board room at mcb was long and fairly narrow with a plush oriental carpet floortoceiling windows that overlooked the city and a massive walnut table surrounded by twenty highbacked oxblood leather chairs although sarah had never actually seen the room before she had heard about it mostly through doctors litanies of the medical equipment that glenn paris elected not to purchase so that it might be built five menparis drs snyder and blankenship chief financial officer colin smith and a prissy attorney named arnold haydensat at one end of the table sipping drinks from a mirrored wet bar and chatting amicably sarah paced at the other end alternately gazing out at the sheets of windblown rain and checking her watch several days before a letter from attorney jeremy mallon to sarahs insurance carrier the mutual medical protective organization had made it official sarah was being sued for malpractice by lisa grayson two days after that the claims adjuster at the mmpo assigned an attorney named matthew daniels to her case the meeting tonight had been requested by him sarah had spoken with her new attorney by phone for almost an hour but had come away from that conversation with little sense of the man other than that he was southern and most economical with his words the hazy image she had formed of him sprang more she suspected from the balding potbellied perspiring hollywood stereotype than from anything daniels actually said sarah paris called out come on down here and have a glass of this chablis were all getting nervous just watching you stalk around over there sarah hesitated then took the path of least resistance and accepted the offer paris like the two department heads had been cordial enough toward her since the news of her suit but she could tell that each of them had doubts i wonder why this daniels wanted us to get together here at the hospital and not at his office arnold hayden blustered irregular highly irregular arnold have you ever heard of him smith asked no i started doing some checking but i havent gotten too far hes an essex law grad not exactly harvard not exactly law school hayden corrected snidely his firm is daniels hannigan and goldstein ive never heard of them but i have someone making inquiries im certain the insurance company wouldnt assign someone to my case who wasnt good sarah said its their money besides i dont think it will take any clarence darrow to prove that im not guilty of malpractice all mallon has to base his case on is that the three women happened to have taken my supplement we can produce many others who also took it and had perfectly normal deliveries true blankenship said what we really need to close the circle though is a case of dic like the others but in a woman who never took anything other than standard prenatal vitamins of rather be found guilty than have another woman go through that sarah said of course of course it goes without saying that we all feel that way but if such a case does occuror has occurred somewhereit would certainly take you and your mixture right out of the loop as it were sarah checked the time and began pacing again matthew daniels was already five minutes late his arrival would bring the group to two attorneys two medical professors two hospital executives and her being the only woman in the group was more or less neutralized by her status as an md but nothing offset her dismay at being the accused in truth she couldnt have been more out of place had she accidentally crashed an exclusive fraternity induction ceremony the whole evening would have been significantly easier to handle had rosa suarez agreed to come but the epidemiologist had begged off stating that it would be best for her to stay removed from hospital politics and personalities since her arrival on the scene suarez seemed to have been living at mcb sarah had seen her at all hours measuring off corridors with blueprints in her hand lost behind a wall of tomes in the library making notes in the record room or talking to staff she had interviewed sarah at length early in her investigation and briefly a number of times since although suarez was reluctant to speak of anything not germane to her mission she did share that she had a husband alberto back in georgia and that she had no family or friends in boston sarah had responded with an invitation to dinner but the woman politely declined her manner was softspoken and certainly not aggressive but sarah had no difficulty discerning her intelligence and determination sarah paris said did you put together this list of the ingredients in your vitamins the list yes the explanation of each component no rosa suarez did that she plans to expand on the information when she has a chance to do the research does she now what a little beaver that woman is i only wish she would keep me better informed about whats going on i have the feeling she doesnt like me very much although ill be damned if i know why i gave her essentially free run of the hospital do we know if shes gotten anywhere shes borrowed one of my technicians and is setting up a spare lab of mine to do some cultures blankenship said sarah i agree with glenn mrs suarez is exceedingly capable but shes also very secretive i do suspect though that somehow or other she is going to get to the bottom of all this which would make both this meeting and your tardy attorney moot paris added late to his own meeting arnold hayden clucked irregular highly irreg as if on cue the door to the milsap room opened and matt daniels backed in shaking off his umbrella and his trench coat in the hallway the moment he turned around sarah was pleased to acknowledge that her projection of him could not have been much farther off target he was tall and well built with a rugged weathered face he was also soaked daniels matt daniels he said pawing at his forehead and dark hair with a handkerchief even more sodden than he was sorry im late i had a flat my own damn fault too i did enough dumb things today to bring a curse on the pope his drawl was unmistakable though not nearly as pronounced as sarah remembered the initial vibrations she was receiving were all positive especially those that were telling her he was ingenuous enough to be almost as out of place in this gathering as she was he moved to shake hands with the man closest to him who happened to be randall snyder but then when it was apparent that the ob chief preferred to stay dry he backed off and simply nodded irregular sarah thought pleased highly irregular daniels circled to an empty seat slid his briefcase onto the table and wiped it dry with the sleeve of his sport coat if he was aware of the expressions of amusement and disbelief on the faces of the other five men he certainly did not show it mr daniels im sarah baldwin she said extending her hand which felt lost in his matt he said mattll do fine she introduced the five to him but blanked out on arnold haydens name well id like to apologize again and thank you all for coming out on such a night daniels began after hayden had somewhat irritably filled in sarahs blank our adversary in this case is a lawyer named jeremy mallon i decided to set up this meeting after i spoke with him earlier today as youll hear he certainly seems intent on moving things along no comment at all on his opponent sarah noted the mcb men exchanging glances and had no trouble reading their thoughts in malpractice circles according to what she had been told by glenn paris mallon was something of a legend mr daniels do you know who jeremy mallon is asked arnold hayden uhoh sarah thought here we go well actually sir i dont well mr daniels the attorney went on clearing his throat iumi think before we begin it might help us some if we knew a little of your background in the area of medical malpractice the hospital hasnt been sued yet but theres every reason to believe we will be if it looks like sarahs going to loseand not just by the graysons but by the families of those other women as well even worse we stand to take a pounding in the press so i hope you wont think it presumptuous of me to ask not at all mr hayden daniels said evenly why you hardly seem like the presumptuous type lets see the answer to your question is ive only defended one doctor for malpractice he was a dentist actually a woman claimed her headaches were caused by his pulling out an extra molar and messing up her bite for what its worth we did go to trial and i did win the case thats very reassuring hayden said not kindly do you have any idea how the mmpo came to choose you for this case to tell you the truth ive kind of wondered some about that myself although im very pleased they did ive been on their roll of available attorneys for a couple of years now and this is the first time theyve sent me a case well thats great just great paris erupted mr daniels i dont mean to sound rude but you must understand that there is a great deal at stake here your adversary as you call jeremy mallon is totally dedicated to bringing this hospital to its knees and he is damn good at what he does which in the main is to sue doctors dont you think we ought to call the mmpo and have them assign some other firm to the case sarah studied daniels as he thought over the question if he was disturbed by the twopronged attack from hayden and now paris it did not show in his face which at that moment reminded her of fess parker as davy crockett debating whether or not to stay on and defend the alamo his expression was severe enough but there was a spark in his azure eyesa defiancethat sarah felt certain only she was appreciating well he said finally for any number of reasons id sure hate to see that happen but since youve brought it up i guess we ought to consider it good paris said however matt went on there are a couple of points id like to make for one dr baldwin here is my client whether i stay or go is really up to her for another since speaking with her the other day ive done some reading and some talking to people mallon or no mallon i think i can do a good job representing her how can you say that with almost no experience in this area hayden demanded because the laws the law mr hayden and im still just naive enough to equate the legal process with getting at the truth and getting at the truth is something i always liked doing glenn paris turned to sarah sarah it is our opinion that you can get better counsel and a better defense from someone more how should i say experienced than mr daniels here but he is right you are his client and it is for you to decide sarah looked over at daniels who held her gaze coolly bring on santa ana mr travis i aint plannin on goin nowhere well mr paris she said provided my job isnt on the line over this i guess i feel that if mr daniels handles himself in court the way he has here im in pretty good hands mr danielsmattim sure that if you needed to involve mr hayden or any of the other mcb lawyers youd do it wouldnt you anytime in that case mr paris sarah said im comfortable being represented by this man good lord eli blankenship suddenly exclaimed i think i just figured out who our mr daniels is lets see if i get this right matt bottom of the ninth no outs bases loaded three and nothing on the toronto batter yes yes matt said a bit impatiently that was me thank you for remembering but thats ancient history now remembering what sarah asked nine pitches nine strikes three outs ball game over blankenship went on one of the greatest short relief performances ever i thought the name sounded familiar when i first heard it im sure the matt part threw you off daniels said more kindly not many remember that i actually had a real first name hey do i get clued in here i am the defendant im afraid im in the dark too paris chimed in black cat daniels blankenship explained ten years as a relief pitcher for the red sox actually twelve daniels said now if you all wouldnt mind getting back to the business at why black cat paris asked daniels sighed dr baldwinsarahim really sorry about this he said i would imagine that what youre going through is not pleasant and is probably more than a little scary for you having to sit there while my qualifications get called into question and now all this baseball talk certainly cant be helping im fine actually sarah said besides i want to know too okay mr paris my nickname came from my having a fair number of superstitions back when i played the game always stepped on first base coming into a game blankenship said never sat down in the bullpen never pitched without a piece of red ribbon tied around his belt blue matt corrected you know your baseball yes of course it was blue are you still like that superstitious i mean iumstill have an interest in ritual and luck if thats what youre asking but trust me dr blankenship it doesnt get in the way when im in the courtroom i keep that ribbon tied on my belt in the back where my suit coat hides it now i think maybe we ought to get down to business as mr paris so eloquently put it we have a lot at stake here and unfortunately it seems that our esteemed adversary has gotten a bit of a jump on us what do you mean paris asked daniels took some notes from his briefcase sarah the man who provides you with your herbs and roots his name is mr kwong thats right kwong tianwen well this afternoon mr mallon obtained an ex parte discovery order to seal off mr kwongs shop at eight tomorrow morning hell be there with a chemist someone from the sheriffs office and god only knows who else he plans to get samples from the place and follow chainofevidence procedures to have those samples analyzed cant you do something about that paris asked ill defer to mr hayden to answer that question sir not at this point glenn hayden said its just a case of being outmaneuvered dr baldwin do you have any idea how mallon could have gotten the name of this man so quickly a couple of possibilities come to mind she said and paris asked i think i ought to do some checking before throwing out any names besides i have implicit faith in mr kwong he is one of the very best at what he does the sooner mallon gets this thing done the sooner hell learn that he doesnt have a case i think someone from the hospital should be there daniels said well be meeting tomorrow morning at this address he slid the court order over to hayden cant do it the lawyer said ill be in court eli how about you paris asked youd be a perfect representative i think i can be there blankenship said perfect extra dessert for you eli we must hope sarah is right about all this daniels but do you see what we mean about mallon he has handled dozensprobably hundredsof malpractice cases hes got a huge staff and he wont leave any stone unturned he doesnt seem like someone you can just hook and reel in daniels acknowledged ill give you that perhaps hayden offered you can involve your partners in this case do either mr hannigan or mr goldstein have any expertise in this arena damn sarah thought are they ever going to let up actually daniels said im glad you mentioned that then they do have some malpractice experience hayden said thats excellent collaboration is the key in this business well sir not exactly you see billy hannigan never did like being a lawyer but his wife wouldnt let him quit then last year after she ran away with another attorney he just took off last i heard he was working as a disc jockey on a radio station in lake placid and goldstein daniels rubbed at his chin and then sighed well he said the truth is goldstein was someone billy made up before i joined him he was in solo practice but he called his firm hannigan and goldstein something about billys wanting to attract jewish clients i just got around to having new stationery printed up with only my name but i keep forgetting to have our little yellow pages ad changed this is highly irregular hayden blustered highly irregular sarah paris said i think this deception allows you to reconsider your decision mr paris deception seems a bit strong a word she countered clearly theres been no attempt to hide the truth i think well do just fine with mr daniels even without mr goldstein much appreciated matt daniels said now if were all in the same corner i think we ought to start putting together our case tomorrow morning at eight round one begins so lets have at it highly irregular sarah heard someone mutter chapter except for the night clerk rosa suarez was alone in the medical record room it was nearing tenthirty and she had not eaten since noon her back and neck ached from hunching over her work table but in some ways the discomfort was pleasurable it had been over two years since she had put in these kinds of hours on a project two years since she felt challenged the initial phase of her investigation would be done tonight and both alberto and her department head were anxiously awaiting her return to atlanta neither stood to be very pleased with what she had to tell them as yet she had no explanation for the bizarre dic cases however two things were clear from a purely statistical standpoint there was virtually no possibility that the three cases were coincidental and almost as certainly unless the underlying cause of the tragedies was determined and dealt with there would be more there were several integrations and many combinations she needed to run through the data banks at the cdc and some preliminary culture results to be checked then in all likelihood it would be back to boston to date she had unearthed dozens of demographic and physical commonalities among the three stricken womensome quite possibly significant some too obscure to take seriously their blood types were all a positive and their primary residences within three miles of the hospital all had been associated as patients with the medical center of boston for at least four years and each had been pregnant once before on the more obscure side of the ledger all were born in april although in different years all were firstborn and none had been educated past high school in addition all were righthanded and browneyed there were still more data to be gathered but by far the most persistently troublesome aspect of her research to this point was the prenatal supplements given each woman by sarah baldwin a botanist at the smithsonian and a friend on the faculty of emory university had provided some preliminary data on the nine components but much more detailed biochemical information was needed rosas instincts were telling her that although the components of the mix might serve as some sort of cofactor in a lethal biological reaction they were in and of themselves harmless but the tools of her trade were numbers and probabilities not instincts excuse me ramona she called out to the night clerk whose desk was on the other side of a broad bank of files i just want to be sure there are no more records in the group were working on seven years of women who delivered here and required transfusions during or after their deliveriesyouve gotten them all mrs suarez do you know that since you came to mcb youve spent more time down here than the whole medical staff combined ill bet i have well this will be my last night for a while tomorrow im heading back to rosa stopped in midsentence and stared down at the chart in front of her it belonged to alethea worthington the second of the dic cases she had dissected the record word by word just as she had the records of constanza hidalgo and lisa summer what caught her eye at this moment though wasnt something on the page but between it and the previous one she picked up the chart and stared at it from several angles mrs suarez is everything all right the clerk called out oh yes everythings fine dear ramona would you happen to have a pocket knife or a nail file i have a swiss army knife in my bag so i guess that means i have both perfect and could you please bring me back those two charts of summer and hidalgo i know i know thank you dear using the lenses of her bifocals as magnifiers rosa peered along the cleft where the pages of the chart were held together by a flexible metal binder at the spot where the arms of the binder passed through the pages small jagged edges of paper protruded rosa marked the pages on either side of the fragments and then carefully loosened the binder just a bit next she slid the largest blade of the swiss army knife along the space beside one of the arms two minute scraps of paper dropped out onto the table rosa gently brushed the fragments into an envelope and then convinced herself that similar pieces were tucked behind the other arm she left those in place and tightened the binder back as it had been pagesprobably two of themhad almost definitely been torn out of the record it took most of ten minutes to find identical fragments in constanza hidalgos chart the tiny bits of progress notepaper represented at least two and possibly three missing pages lisa summers chart was by far the thickest of the three by the time rosa convinced herself that there was no physical evidence of missing pages it was nearly eleven she piled the record on the others and for the first time in two hours stood and stretched the meaning of her discovery was not at all clear but even though the summer chart seemed untouched the finding that at least two of the three dic records had been tampered with was significant of that she had little doubt outside the rainstorm had ended a few faint stars were visible in the black velvet sky rosa felt energized by the sudden new twist part of her wanted to stay up all night as she had so often done studying and working through puzzles until the answers came but she was sixty now and the cost of that sort of exuberance was just too unpredictable facing a busy day in atlanta she needed to pack and get at least a few hours of sleep before her earlymorning flight she wanted desperately to share what she had found with someonealmost anyone who could be a sounding board and give her feedback verbalizing her ideas and streams of consciousness with colleagues had once been an invaluable tool but the wounds from bart though now more than two years old were still painful and that refractory pain reminded her over and over to trust as little as necessary rosa gathered her things thanked the clerk and promised to be back before too long then she left the building on the campus side two women dead of a mysterious medical complication and both of their charts altered rosa searched her imagination for some sort of innocent explanation but could conjure up none what had been a fascinating epidemiological puzzle had suddenly turned sinister sarah shook hands with the five mcb representatives and thanked each for his willingness to help in her defense the meeting which had gotten off to such a tense and confrontational beginning had actually ended up accomplishing a good deal all concurred that the key to a quick resolution of the grayson suit lay in finding an identical case of dic in an endstage labor patientwhether at mcb or any other hospitalwho had never had contact with sarah at matt danielss suggestion paris and snyder agreed to contact their associates around the country and blankenship to institute an indepth search of the medical literature arnold hayden vowed to stay in close contact with daniels and colin smith gave assurances that any expenses incurred by hayden or his staff would be covered by the hospital finally the group pledged to present a unified front to jeremy mallon and the press unless and until she was proven responsible beyond reasonable doubt sarah baldwin was innocent of any wrongdoing tomorrow morning in a show of support eli blankenship would accompany sarah and matt to the shop of her chinese herbalist nice going tonight sarah said as matt retrieved his coat and umbrella i think you handled a very difficult situation with a lot of restraint and class nonsense if you hadnt gone to bat for me i would have been out of the game im not much of a baseball aficionado sarah said but isnt it true that if someone goes to bat for you you are out of the game matts grin was for the first time spontaneous and unstrained and sarah added it to the growing list of things she liked about the man i still dont know why the claims adjuster at mmpo selected me for this case he said but im glad he did im not as slick as most of the attorneys i oppose but i promise you im a fighter and a survivor i do my homework and fortunately im smarter than i look im not worried believe me im not besides after tomorrow im hoping well be able to go out and celebrate the end of your shortest case ever tell me how did you ever manage to play baseball and get through law school well matt said i was a relief pitcher i always had good control but i was never that flashy to watch from about my second year in the majors on the press began writing about how i didnt have good stuffthats speed or movement on my pitches and about how the red sox had no plans to keep me and how i wouldnt last another year finally i had read enough of my own derogatory press clippings to decide that i ought to have something to fall back on so i started law school in the off seasons eight off seasons later i was done i had been with the red sox several times as well as the expos in the national league and pawtucket in the international league and i still had a year of major league pitching left in me thats amazing correction thats two rabbits feet a twothousandyearold egyptian amulet and that infamous blue ribbon dr blankenship talked about plus about a dozen other little rituals you really believe in that stuff to paraphrase something mark twain once said about god i choose to believe in that stuff just in case theres something to it a superstitious attorney who quotes mark twain and pitched major league baseball sarah said you certainly cant be called middle of the road neither can you matt said god its nearly eleven i promised to have the sitter home by then sitter although their relationship was strictly professional and sarah knew matt was ethically bound to keep it that way she found the news that he was married disappointing i have a twelveyearold son harry he lives with his mother most of the year oh i see well then shall we meet tomorrow morning at mr kwongs if you think you can find it ive already driven past it like i said i try to do my homework im going over to brookline do you need a ride thanks but i live in the north end and i have my bike besides the rains stopped now and riding just after a storm is something i really enjoy matt reached across to shake her hand their gazes met and for the briefest moment connected but just as quickly he looked away dont you worry he said were going to do fine i know one last question though before you arrived that lawyer arnold hayden implied that most attorneys would have scheduled a preliminary meeting like this one in their office why didnt you matt slipped on his coat took his briefcase in one hand and his umbrella in the other well the truth is i wanted to make a good impressionon glenn paris and his crew but especially on you and my current office is hardly the largest most opulent in the city i see she said again and to make matters even worse that damn partner of mine mr goldstein cant seem to keep the place neat next time maybe ill chance letting you see it meanwhile get some sleep we have a big day ahead of us sarah watched matt shamble down the hall to the elevator what apprehension she had about the next mornings gathering at kwong tianwens shop was more than offset by the notion that in just nine and a half hours she would be seeing her lawyer again are you all done in there the stoopshouldered cleaning lady had been patiently vacuuming and dusting in the corridor for most of an hour waiting for the milsap room to empty oh yes im sorry sarah said no problem no problem hes a finelooking man that one a finelooking man the old womans eyes were sparkling you know sarah said i was thinking the very same thing myself but i have a feeling you could tell that well chile i wasnt jes watchin him the woman chided i was watchin you savoring the sweet scrubbed summer air sarah left the medical building on the campus side and crossed to where she had chained her bicycle the campus was fairly well lighted and patrolled and although there were from time to time reports of women being harassed at night and in one case mugged sarah did not find the broad mall particularly menacing the groundskeepers periodically posted notices requesting that bicycles be left only in designated areas but since those areas were outside the campus house officers and nurses who planned to be at the hospital after dark continued to secure their bikes to the wroughtiron railings leading up to the entrances of many of the buildings sarah had chained her fuji to a low steelpipe railing by the side entrance of the surgical building it was a convenient site and one she had used frequently with no problem now as she rounded the corner she was struck by the darkness of the spot the light over the entrance was out although she could never remember its being so before she peered through the gloom and took one tentative step forward then another the man was pressed tightly against the wall to her left sensing a presence sarah froze she squinted and blinked but her vision had not yet adjusted enough to pierce the blackness the night was soundless she strained to hear breathing or movement of any kind someone was there close she shifted her weight to her right foot preparing to push off and sprint away i know youre there what do you want she suddenly heard herself saying five endless seconds passed ten ppplease ddont rrrun the man said in a whispered stutter sarah reflexively moved away from the voice even as she was turning toward it the man now a silhouette stepped from the shielding darkness he was not much taller than she and very slightly built sarah could just make out the narrow contours of his face doctor bbbaldwin ive been ffollowing you ffor days i must sspeak with sarah is that you sarah whirled rosa suarez was standing not ten feet away angled so that she could see sarah but not the man at the sound of the intruders voice he bolted head down he charged past rosa shoving her off balance and very nearly to the ground stop please sarah cried but the man was already crossing the lawn of the campus heading full bore toward the front gate her pulse jackhammering sarah rushed to rosas side are you all right im fine i think rosa was breathing heavily as she stared across the deserted campus in the direction the man had run she patted her chest who was he i dont know he called me by name and said he had to speak with me then when you called out he ran how strange he stuttered terriblyworse than almost anyone i can remember and he said that he had been following me you know now that i think about it i believe ive noticed him too he drives a blue foreign carmaybe a honda god was that weird just now i cant believe i just stood there and didnt run now i cant stop shaking rosa took sarahs hands in hers almost instantly the shaking began to lessen sarah unlocked her bike slowly the two women walked together toward the main gate sarah wheeling her bike along im sorry i couldnt support you at that meeting tonight rosa said how did it go pretty well i think lisas lawyer has a court order to inspect my herbalists shop tomorrow morning and take samples are you worried about that actually im relieved its happening the sooner they check the samples the sooner this lawyer will see i couldnt have been responsible rosa stopped and looked at her it was quite apparent to sarah there was something on her mindsomething she wanted to talk about sarah iid like it very much if you could walk me home she said finally my bed and breakfast is just a few blocks from here id like to explain why i chose not to discuss my findings and opinions at your meeting theres no need to the fact that youre being followed bothers me i think that what ive discovered may be very importantespecially if what just happened to you has something to do with this case go on to begin with in my native country cuba i was a physician sarah listened rapt to rosa suarezs concise eloquent sketch of her life a political exile from cuba she found herself in a series of refugee camps with only minimal english and the painful realization that there was no way she would ever be able to document her education or medical degree following a series of rather menial jobs she managed to gain an entrylevel clerical position at the cdc her husband a poet and educator in his homeland worked in a book bindery where he remained until his retirement a few years before within a few years rosas quick mind and medical expertise had landed her a place as a field epidemiologist some of her successesa major role tracking down the source of the legionnaires disease outbreak in philadelphia and tying a regional increase in leukemia deaths in one texas county to a nuclearcontaminated streamsarah had actually heard of then at the peak of what had been a valuable career rosa was sent to investigate reports of an unusual bacterial infection that had begun cropping up in geographic pockets throughout san francisco already the uncommon germ had killed a number of immunecompromised and otherwise medically debilitated patients her data amassed over nearly a year and involving thousands of interviews and cultures pointed the finger of responsibility directly at the us military the army she maintained was using what they thought was a biologically inactive bacterial marker to test germ warfareair current theories in the tunnels of the bartthe bay area rapid transit system because of the sensitive nature of her accusation rosa did not reveal her findings until her case was to all intents airtight but somewhere along the line she had spoken of them to the wrong person a blueribbon commission of the countrys foremost epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists was appointed by congress to validate her conclusions what they found instead were critical pieces of data missing all along the line computer programs that rosa herself had designed functioned poorly or not at all probability calculations failed to support hypotheses laboratory technicians denied ever having received specimens that she swore to having sent finally and most ignominiously one expert on the commission quite easily traced the source of the bacteria to a dump site on the edge of the city the directors of the private laboratory responsible for the disposal error readily admitted it they were fined but soon after rosa learned were the beneficiaries of a hefty military contract so she said the dumping site was cleaned up and of course the rate of infection began to drop i was put into mothballs so to speak and was brought out for this investigation only when no one else was available to do it they sabotaged your work i dont believe it sarah said correction actually i do believe it well at least now you may understand why i have maintained some distance from everyone involved in this caseincluding you please rosa dont worry about it just do your work tomorrow morning i am returning to atlanta for a while my investigation is still in a most preliminary phase but i have come across some things that disturb me and i wanted to warn you warn me its not what you think rosa said patting her reassuringly on the arm in fact ive wanted for several days to tell you that my initial studies are pointing toward some sort of infection not a toxin or poison but iive just been reluctant to speak of my work with anybody they had reached the doorway of the old stucco victorian where rosa was staying then what is there to warn me about sarah you are a kind and caring persona credit to your profession i can see the pain the charges against you have caused i dont want to go into details just yet but i have reason to believe someone may be trying to keep me from getting at the truth in these cases assuming that person is not youand that is an assumption i have chosen to makeyou must be careful whom you talk to and whom you trust but please sarah sharing this much has been difficult for me ill tell you more when it seems right to do so meanwhile i have a great deal of work yet to do and you have a defense to put together sarah sighed your assumption is right you know im not that person again rosa patted her arm i do know dear just be patient with me and be very very careful sarah waited until the epidemiologist was inside then she pedaled slowly toward the inner city for a time she worked at clearing her mind entirely failing that she tried to focus on her new lawyer and the strange stuttering little man but always her thoughts drifted back to rosa suarezs cryptic warning just be patient with me and be very very careful if the womans intention was to frighten her sarah acknowledged finally she had done a pretty damn good job chapter july the shop of the herbalist kwong tianwen occupied the ground floor and basement of a dilapidated fourstory brick tenement sarah paid more than customary attention to her appearance and to selecting an outfit then left her apartment at sevenfifteen and walked the few miles from the north end to chinatown she sensed some apprehension at having to deal with jeremy mallon and was still bewildered by the frightened stuttering man and by rosa suarezs strange warning but the morning was bright and unusually clear and she felt upbeatabout taking this step to eliminate her herbal supplement from suspicion and about seeing matt daniels again she had known kwong from her days at the ettinger institute and following her return from medical school she had checked him out with several members of the boston holistic community he was still highly regarded nevertheless she interviewed him twice before selecting him as her supplier he spoke almost no english but sarahs oncedecent chinese was still good enough to conduct business with him when she needed a translator kwong would rap his cane on the ceiling or strike it against a certain steam pipe and within a minute or two one of his americanborn grandchildren would appear sarah was impressed with the mans knowledge and drawn to his consistently optimistic outlook and of course there were the striking similaritiesphysical and metaphysicalbetween him and louis han she could not help but believe that in kwong she was getting a glimpse of her mentor had he lived into his seventies initially sarah picked up her herbal orders herself but as the pressures of her medical training mounted she had begun having the mixture delivered now perhaps for the first time she realized how much she missed her visits to the shop the frayed connection with kwong was she thought sadly just another item on the list of casualties exacted by her residency the shop was on a narrow street barely more than an alley off kneeland as sarah rounded the corner she saw the old man and debbie one of his granddaughters standing by the building she was wondering why the two werent inside when she noticed the yellow vinyl ribbon crisscrossing the doorway and windows it pained her to think of kwongs humiliation and confusion when some sheriffs deputy or constable showed up with a court order to seal off the place hello mr kwong sarah said in cantonese hello debbie im sorry for this she gestured toward the ribbons kwong brushed off the apology with a gnarled hand but sarah could tell he was agitated she suddenly realized that it had been perhaps a year since they had actually seen one another his graywhite goatee was unkempt and stained with nicotine below his lip his blue silk robepossibly the only outfit she had ever seen him wearwas threadbare and frayed had he aged so or had she simply been viewing him through younger more naive eyes a man has been guarding the shop ever since they put up those ribbons debbie said he goes from the alley back around to here and then to the alley again he said he wants to make sure no one tampers with anything inside what does he mean nothing debbie sarah said things will be back to normal for you before you know it im just so sorry that you and your grandfather have to go through this at all the old mans frailty was striking sarah prayed that mallon and his people would simply take whatever samples they wanted and leave if they tried intimidating kwong in any way it would be up to matt to protect him at all costs she was about to try to explain the situation to kwong through debbie when matt entered the street from the far end eli blankenship was lumbering along beside him gesticulating forcefully as if to get across a difficult point sarah was relieved to have him along there was no finer intellect at mcb nor any more imposing physical presence either matt was reasonably tall and well built but next to the professor he looked slight with debbies help she introduced the men to kwong it seemed clear the herbalist had no interest in any of them beyond having them leave him alone matt immediately excused sarah blankenship and himself and led them to the other side of the street does the old guy know whats happening he whispered sarah shrugged hes not addled by any stretch she said i suspect he has a pretty good idea of whats going on but im not sure he understands that it all has to do with me and not with him he looks like hes spent more than his share of time with his lips curled around the stem of an opium pipe so what opium is part of his culture any idea where mallon is nope i expected him to be late though its an old legal ploy to unnerve and annoy the other side its survived in the law game over the ages mostly because it works he motioned them back to kwong and the girl debbie he said kindly please apologize to your grandfather for our imposing on him and promise that we will compensate him for the trouble and inconvenience the girl dressed in baggy jeans and a sweatshirt was perhaps thirteen she had a plain face and short jet hair sarah was about to suggest that matt choose words she was more likely to understand than impose and compensate when the teen rattled off a translation to kwong the old man responded with no more than a grunt and a dismissive wave of his hand he says that it is his pleasure to serve you and that you need not think about paying him debbie said at that moment a lincoln town car pulled up at the end of the street sarah turned to kwong to reassure him about the new arrivals the pudgy guys sheriff mooney she heard matt say to eli and that tall guyisnt he the one from the weight loss shows on tv she groaned softly and looked back at the lincoln peter ettinger ramrod straight towering above mallon and the sheriff was staring down the narrow street straight at her even in the pale indirect morning sun his silver hair looked almost phosphorescent you bastard she muttered to herself this must be mallons expert witness she gave kwong who now looked somewhat confused a gentle touch then she stood back and watched as the two groups of men like combatants in some macabre sport approached one another for introductions she took the moment when matt reached across to shake peters hand and froze it in her mind for future reference the county sheriff the mcb chief of medicine peter matt a bewildered old chinese man a precocious teen the whole affair was suddenly taking on a carnival atmosphere in just a few minutes when the eight of them worked their way inside things were bound to get even more bizarre kwongs shop was an impressive hodgepodge with no clearly defined aisles eight people would be well beyond its critical mass matt led the opposition back to where she was standing peter allowed himself to be introduced to her he reached out his hand but sarah refused to take it so he said it appears weve gotten ourselves in a wee bit o trouble his smug expression was close to the one sarah remembered from that last horrid day in his office and it appears weve become even more overbearing and unpleasant than we used to be she replied this isnt the wideeyed earth child you brought back from the jungle peter she was thinking if its a fight youre spoiling for youre not going to be disappointed you two know each other matt said dr baldwin once did some work for me ettinger said quickly hard labor would be a more descriptive term matt im not proud of it but we lived together for three years before i woke up and jumped the wall lived together matt exclaimed mallon what in the hell in the second or two before mallon responded sarah could see the confusion in his eyes peter hadnt told him the bastard wanted to get back at her so badly he hadnt said a word about their past heummr ettinger is being used to help us organize our case mallon said blustering wewe certainly never intended having him appear in court he is serving us strictly in an advisory capacity well i would certainly hope you can do better than a rebuffed suitor for your expert witness matt said id hate to have my job made that easy shall we go in and get this over with mallon said nothing but it was clear from his stony expression that matt had drawn blood if only a drop or two nice going sarah whispered now please just make sure mallon doesnt take it out on mr kwong the vinyl ribbons were cut away and the combatants led by kwong tianwen and his granddaughter filed into the herbalists shop carnivale de baldwina sarah mused sheriff mooney the ringmaster in his white seersucker suit jeremy mallon snake and charmer in one eli blankenship sans leopard skin nearly spanning the narrow doorway peter ettinger the human stilt ducking to enter carnivale de baldwina once inside sarah noted with some pleasure that the protruding rafters kept the stilt in a persistent hunch the shop was more cluttered and more fragrant than sarah remembered stalks of wild reeds and dried flowers were everywhere interspersed with barrels of roots various ground flours rice and leaves the old glassfront counter and the shelves behind it were packed with jars of widely varying sizes shapes and contents one contained desiccated scorpions another huge beetles still another an eel in preservative a few of the jars had labels handwritten in chinese but many of them had none two somewhat mangy longhaired cats one pure white the other black as chimney soot huddled sleepily in one corner and standing like a totem or perhaps an exclamation point in the center of the disarray was a wellstocked wire display rack of dr scholls foot products i dont think parading a jury into this place will help our cause too much blankenship whispered lets hope it never comes to that sarah said well counselor how do you want to proceed matt asked mallon apparently unaware that his armani suit was backed up against a thick dusty crop of dried sunflower stalks made a visual survey of the shop that was theatrically slow and disparaging clearly he was back on track we have a list of the ingredients in dr baldwins supplement he said finally one at a time well ask for them mr kwongs granddaughter may translate if necessary the sample will then be placed in two labeled evidence bags the first will be sealed by sheriff mooney and the seal initialed by you or dr baldwin the second will be inspected by mr ettinger who will make what notes he wishes beginning later today he will be working with a team of botanists and chemists to identify each component scientifically does that approach meet with your approval counselor sarah eli is that all right with you matt asked as a representative of the medical center of boston i would like to examine the specimens as well blankenship said do you know herbal medicine sarah asked oh a bit his half smile suggested that as in many areas what he considered a bit of knowledge made others experts she motioned blankenship and matt into a huddle theres something i ought to explain she whispered to us or to everyone to everyone she cleared some nervousness from her throat just be very careful blankenship warned remember theyre the enemy i understand mr mallon before you start this process i want to explain that i brought the composition of the mixture i use back with me from southeast asia it was written out in chinese by a brilliant herbalist and healer i have a copy of that version here it is this list mr kwong has used to prepare the tea which i dispense some of the names on the list you havethe one i give to my patientsare my best guesses at the english equivalent of the roots and herbs he uses as long as the two lists are in the same order and you and mr kwong concur that what he puts in these bags is what you gave to lisa grayson i have no problem with what names you call things in due time mr ettinger and his team will be providing us with scientific names and chemical compositions id like a copy of that chinese list though debbie translated what had been decided to kwong and handed him the list sarah felt certain that the old man had the components of the mixture memorized but sharing that information with mallon would not serve their cause at all okay then mallon said number one is oriental ginseng panax pseudoginseng sarah heard blankenship whisper to himself debbie told her grandfather to proceed the herbalist nodded somewhat impatiently and with only the briefest glance at the list pulled a large jar of brown plant fragments from beneath the counter using a worn metal scoop he filled a pair of plastic bags sarah authenticated the seal on one and gave it to matt who gave it to the sheriff the other was passed first to blankenship and then to peter blankenship took only moments to assess the contents peter sniffed it tasted it and rolled a bit between his fingers then after a few hmms which sarah felt certain were to irritate her he placed specimen one in his briefcase the second item on the list a gnarled root was handled the same way as was the third which sarahs list called moondragon its actually shavings of bark from the medarah tree sarah explained endemic to java but also found in southern china wonderful for intestinal and stomach disorders great for morning sickness as she spoke sarah noticed that at the far right end of the counter sheriff mooney had begun peering intently into one of the glass containers it was on the topmost shelf behind several larger jars sarah strained to see what the lawman was finding so interesting and was about to inform matt when kwong began waving his arms wildly about and yelling no no no he shouted his expression a disconcerting mix of anger and bewilderment no no no he was nearly hysterical as he railed at his granddaughter gesticulating toward the fivegallon jar holding the sample he had just meted outthe fourth component on the list sarah had never before heard the man so much as raise his voice but the frightened frustrated look in his eyes was one she knew well she had seen it often in the eyes of her mother as the womans alzheimers disease inexorably progressed something had gone wrongvery wrong chapter d ebbie whats going on the teen who was trying with no success to calm her grandfather just shook her head sarah grabbed a small caneback chair and helped induce the old man to sit down kwong continued though hoarsely now to rattle at debbie and everyone else in machinegun cantonese sarah knelt beside him and stroked his hand until he finally began to quiet down i dont know what happened debbie said he scooped out the herbs and put them in the baggies and everything seemed fine then all of a sudden he took a bit from the jar smelled it and started shouting im very frightened for him hes not been well kwongs complexion sallow to begin with did seem even paler to sarah reflexively she checked the radial pulse at his wrist for a moment she thought his heart was beating wildly then she realized that it was her own pulse she was feeling hammering in her fingertips clearly the significance of this turn of events had registered in her autonomic nervous system if not yet completely in her mind the confusion the apparent error the hysterical reaction these were the last things she would have ever expected from her herbalist but then again kwong tianwen was not the man she remembered dr blankenship do you think hes okay she asked are you he whispered sarah bit at her lower lip and nodded i just cant believe this is happening just what is going on here mallon demanded sarah turned on him like a startled cat hes getting sick thats whats going on she snapped she took a deep breath to calm herself im sorry i didnt mean to jump all over you listen i need to speak to mr daniels and i think dr blankenship should check mr kwong over mallon backed away while sarah held a whispered conversation with her lawyer meanwhile eli blankenship tested kwongs carotid pulses and cardiac impulse checked his pupils and fingernail beds and assessed his respiratory excursions okay matt said after hearing sarah out the situation is this the fourth herb on the list is supposed to be a type of chamomile apparently mr kwong is upset because the herb in this jar is not what he expected well what is it mallon asked with sharklike eagerness is it on the list at all debbie ask him what that stuff is ask him whether he put it in the mixture he gave to dr baldwin debbie do nothing of the sort matt ordered god mallon what is with you eli how does he seem to you i wish i had my stethoscope blankenship said i think hes okay but i cant say for sure kwong was much calmer now though clearly no less bewildered he sat hands on knees staring at the offending jar shaking his head debbie is your mother home sarah asked i think we should get him upstairs and have him lie down no ones home the girl said i could watch him though maybe give him some chinese wine he loves that just a moment mallon said id like to have my questions answered stuff it counselor matt snapped this session is over peter who had been conducting an examination of the herb cleared his throat for attention i might be wrong he said his tone suggesting that he knew very well that he wasnt but i believe this is a herb called noni morinda citrifolia is its scientific name its used throughout the pacific islands as a poultice to stop bleeding and as a brew to regulate menstrual flow and abnormal internal hemorrhaging very effective very potent the implications of ettingers declaration if correct were lost on no one a powerful herb that affected blood clotting erroneously dispensed by kwong tianwen as chamomile for a time everyone seemed to be talking at once mallon urging peter to get a biological and chemical report prepared on the herb as soon as possible matt telling mallon to back off blankenship reassuring kwong and asking if he was feeling strong enough to continue sarah inquiring if debbie could fetch her grandfathers medicines so that they might get a sense of his medical problems the confusion and noise were brought to an abrupt halt by sheriff mooney excuse me everyone he said loudly i have a meeting i need to get back to my office for however before i go im afraid mr kwong here might have another little situation to explain he turned to blankenship doctor is mr kwong okay to reach up there and get that jar down for me the one with the brownish powder way in the back there at the very end of the shelf i suppose if its important theres hold it matt cut in sheriff mooney what are you doing you have no right to harass this man mooney with an inch or so of gut overhanging his belt bobbed a stubby index finger at the lawyer we never met before today matt he said but i sort of feel like i know you i enjoyed watching you pitch in fact i was at that famous toronto game however i dont much take to you telling me what i do or do not have the right to do but especially when youre wrong he withdrew a paper from his inside suit coat pocket and passed it over to matt this warrant was issued by judge john obrien yesterday afternoon it gives me the right to enter this shop and to take whatever samples i wish issued on what basis matt asked on the basis of a call regarding this man made to our drug hot line i obtained the warrant just in case i hadnt intended to use it until i had had some time to check up on him but i used to work for the dea and i know opium when i see it and i think that is precisely what is in that jar back there kwongs english though limited clearly included opium his agitation immediately began to crescendo again opium no no mine he shouted between staccato bursts of cantonese sarah could see not only confusion in his face but sheer terror dammit mooney matt exclaimed cant you see the old guy is in no shape for something like this young lady would you ask your grandfather to get that jar for me the sheriff persisted matt snatched the jar from the shelf and banged it down on the counter you want the bottle so damn bad here take it what kind of policeman are you doing this to an old man in front of his grandchild one who doesnt like dope pushers no matter what age they are at that moment kwong who had been screaming and waving his sticklike arms about stopped abruptly his breathing became suddenly labored and grunting and his color immediately darkened grandpa the girl cried sarah and eli grasped what was happening almost simultaneously acute pulmonary edemaheart failurealmost certainly from a coronary quickly they lowered kwong onto the floor he was battling for air now wheezing audibly breathing at a rate at least twice normal and fighting any attempt to lay him on his back get an ambulance blankenship ordered to no one in particular sarah can you communicate with him some come on down here beside him then and do your best to calm him down weve got to buy some time until the rescue squad gets here with some oxygen and morphine sarah toweled off the old mans forehead and face both of which were drenched with sweat she whispered in his ear and rubbed his back oxygen and morphine she was thinking oxygen and morphine dr blankenship she said suddenly the opium the professor understood immediately acute heart failureeven if caused by a coronaryoften responded dramatically to narcotic sedation morphine was one of the treatments of choice for the condition and morphine was a chemical derivative of opium are we sure of whats in that jar he asked sarah mopped kwongs brow again his color now was truly ghastly it was quite possible his pulmonary edema would result in full cardiac arrest before the rescue squad arrived debbie come quickly please she said please dont be frightened we need your help ask your grandfather if that really is opium in that jar tell him its very very important the girl stayed where she was debbie please sarah begged it may save his life we need to know please ask him i dont have to the teen said suddenly it is opium its his opium everyone in the family knowshe smokes it with his friends but he hardly does it anymore and he always keeps it locked up downstairs i dont know how it got onto that shelf thank you debbie sarah said you did the right thing telling us dont worry eli blankenship was already working some of the crystals beneath the old mans tongue sarah returned her attention to kwong reassuring him and drying him off after a minute blankenship dosed him again you practiced in the jungle he said for an old hospital man like me medicating this way is a bit scary but already kwongs respirations had begun to slow and his color to improve he was still laboring for every bit of air but the mortal fear in his eyes was clearly abating his pulse rate is coming down and its stronger sarah said excitedly for the first time during the crisis she looked over at matt nice going he mouthed by the time the rescue squad arrived eli had administered a third pinch of opium and kwong was no longer in extremis in minutes with the two legal sides watching in silent fascination the paramedic and emts had their new charge strapped onto a stretcher with oxygen in place an iv running and medications given as treating physician eli blankenship had ordered the meds now although the situation seemed under control he insisted on riding with kwong they loaded the old man into the ambulance and blankenship with surprising grace hopped up behind the stretcher then with a final nod from him and a thumbsup to sarah they were gone jeremy mallon mumbled something to matt about being in touch and led his two stunned associates from the shop debbie ran upstairs to leave a note instructing her mother to meet them at white memorial sarah suddenly only marginally less pale than kwong had been sank onto the caneback chair matt brought her a glass of water you did an amazing job there he said im grateful dr blankenship was here hes the best youre the one who thought of using the opium remember is the old guy going to be okay i dont know hehes so frail its as if hes turned old just since the last time i saw him not like he was then not at all matt im in trouble arent i well that depends do you believe kwong was giving you the wrong stuff all this time i dont know i dont know what to believe well i for one smell a rat what was that opium doing on the shelf like that tianwen may be getting senile he could have put it in the front window if thats the case i dont buy it at least not yet an anonymous call to the drug hot line give me a break what about the noni herbs if peters right and i think he is how do you explain that i dont know maybe the old guy has messed up there maybe that parts legit the opium part seems too neat though too packaged but you have no idea how to prove that tianwen was set upif in fact he was not a clue so im in trouble either way well i will allow as how weve got some hard work ahead of us he said grimly but hard work never scared me well be all right at that moment kwongs black longhaired cat stretched to its feet padded over to where matt stood and settled down on his shoes chapter the ball started right rumbling down the alley not an inch from the gutter much closer than leo durbansky would have liked ten menthe five on his perennial doormat precinct four team and five from dorchester the perennial police and fire league championsheld their collective breath as the english on the ball began to draw it back toward the onethree pocket it was taking forever to reach the pins go baby leo heard mack peebles whisper go baby go baby the whole thing was straight out of wide world of sports leo kept thinking the last ball of the last match of the season the championship on the line the neverwonanythings versus the alwayswineverythings and up steps leo durbansky with his onefifty average to roll the threegame series of his life two fortyfive two sixtyeight and now maybejust maybe a leos maroon brunswick slammed into the pocket with authority exploding through nine of the pins like a howitzer shell but the tenpin remained standing ticking from side to side like a metronome several teammates groaned one reached over and patted leo on the shoulder then suddenly from out of nowhere one pin clattered back onto the alley and began spinning across it in excruciating slow motion the teams froze the renegade pin as if pulled by an invisible string clicked against the tenner the moment was right the stars were right the ten slightly on one edge at impact tilted past its center of gravity teased for an interminable second and then toppled over the screaming and cheering were unlike anything leo had ever experienced he was a twentyyear veteran patrolman who had done nothing to disgrace himself over those two decades but little to distinguish himself either now his name and his heroics tonight would be immortalized mack peebles promised to submit the story to sports illustrated for their faces in the crowd segment joey kerrigan spoke about calling his cousin who wrote sports for the herald even the dorchester team bought him a beer it was after eleven when leo decided it was time to head home he had already called jo and told her about the incredible evening and that she shouldnt wait up but maybe just maybe she had the night was cool and moonless knowing he had had a couple of beers leo was driving with even more care than usual had he been going faster he might have missed the movement in the darkened basement doorway just ahead of him and to his right leo tapped the brakes on his taurus and instinctively cut the lights one man being pushed by another stumbled up the short stairway the second man blond was half a head or so taller than his victim he had his hand in the pocket of his windbreaker angled in such a way that leo had no doubt he held a gun leo cut the engine unlocked his glove compartment and withdrew his service revolver had he been in the cruiser protocol would have demanded an immediate call for backup but his own car had no cb protocol in this situation called for him to take whatever cautious action seemed appropriate other nights there was no telling what he might have decided to do but for him this night was charmed he checked the cylinder of his revolver and watched as the shorter man was pushed head to the floor knees on the seat into the passenger side of a black or darkblue latemodel olds it was a position in which the victim was virtually helpless and easy to control using it suggested that the taller man might well be a professional leo moistened his lips he recited the license number of the olds to himself as he followed it through the south end and onto the expressway his mouth was dry his palms damp still in spite of himself and the situation he kept reliving his moment of triumph at the beantown lanes in his mind the approaching ball sounded like a timpani crescendo its impact on the pins like a landmine explosion as they crossed the neponset bridge he saw some movement through the rear window of the car ahead and wondered if perhaps the guy on the floor had just bought it he shrugged at the notion if it had happened there wasnt a damn thing he could do about it but if it hadnt then this magical night held in store more than just a bowling trophy for leo durbansky leo was imagining how proud his wife would be of his departmental citation when the olds pulled off the bridge and down a dark sparsely settled street he slowed and dropped back this would not have been the first corpse to be dumped in this particular area but now fate had decreed that it just wasnt going to happen his uniform was folded on the backseat without taking his eyes off his quarry leo felt around for his cuffs and slipped them into his pocket the lights on the olds had already been cut but leo could still easily make out its silhouette against the glow from the city it was parked by the wall of a burnedout building leo spotted a couple of ways he could get close without being seen the interior light flicked on for several seconds as the hitman opened the passenger door shoved his captive onto the ground and followed him out perhaps not such a professional after all leo thought a real pro never would have allowed the automatic interior light to go on he reached up and flicked his to the off position then he eased his door open slid out and quickly dropped to one knee he could hear the voices of the two men but was too far away to pick up any words with no idea how soon the hit was going to be completed he had to get close in a hurry his stomach was churning an unpleasant jet of beer and bile washed up into his throat be careful he warned himself just keep your cool like you did on alley nine and youll nail this sucker to the wall he cradled his revolver finger on the trigger and quickly closed to within thirty yards ppplease ddont ddo this im nno danger tto anybbody youve got just one minute to tell me who youve talked to about this thats only sixty seconds make that fifty ppplease pplease the victim stuttering almost every word was on his knees moaning and sobbing leo moved to the corner of a decaying wooden fence he was no more than fifteen yards from the pair now he wished to hell he had kept a flashlight in the taurus as it was he had a more than decent advantage add a powerful flashlight beam in the blond mans eyes and the whole thing would be a lock he moved five feet closer then another five times up the gunman said freeze leo barked his heart pounding mercilessly not one move not one fucking the blond man turned his head just a fraction but somehow leo knew in that moment that there was no way he was going to give up without a fight leos finger was tightening on the trigger when the gunman dove to one side spinning in the air leo fired a moment before he saw a pop of flame from the hurtling shadow he heard the firecracker snap of his adversarys gun almost on top of the mans screech of pain gotcha leo thought gotcha the gunman had fallen heavily and was clutching his leg writhing from one side to the other his stuttering victim had scrambled away and was now on his feet sprinting off probably some smalltime punk leo reasoned as the man disappeared into the darkness the prize he wantedthe headlines and the departmental citationwas rolling about on the ground in front of him probably wanted he thought maybe on the big list okay now asshole stay right where you are and dont move im the police leo barked out the words but strangely he didnt hear any sound he felt suddenly dizzy detached nauseous only then did he become aware of the stinging on the right side of his neck just beneath his ear awkwardly he reached up to touch the spot warm sticky blood spewed over his hand and arm the dizziness and nausea intensified he sank to one knee then ever so slowly he toppled over onto his side the last sound leo durbansky heard was the enormous rumble of a thousand brunswick bowling balls thundering down a thousand alleys spinning right into a thousand onethree pockets chapter august just after twelve noon sarah crossed through the public garden and headed onto the boston common toward the spot where she was to meet matt the day which had dawned hot was sultry now businessmen in shortsleeved dress shirts their ties loosened ate their lunches beneath broad shade trees their suit coats carefully folded on the ground beside them all across the field where minutemen had once trained for the revolution pockets of mothers in shorts and tank tops chatted languidly their children racing about them on the rich summer grass sarah wished she could just stretch out and relax she wished that she and matt were meeting for a picnic of pesto turkey sandwiches from nicoles and then a leisurely stroll along the charles almost anything at all in fact would have been preferable to what lay ahead of her at one oclock she and matt would be in a room on the second floor of the suffolk superior court building facing a medical malpractice tribunal matt who had served on three such tribunals over the past few years had explained the process to her in some detail including the option that she not attend at all he emphasized that physicians being sued seldom chose to be present at this proceeding especially when as was the case today the decision was likely to go against them but with a flexible outpatient rotation at the hospital and an almost morbid need to experience her legal battle firsthand there was no way she could stay away the tribunal system begun in indiana and eventually adopted by massachusetts was an attempt to do away with frivolous litigation against physicians it was hoped that the screening procedure would one day lower the horrific insurance premiums that continued to drive many doctors out of clinical practice the premiums and retroactive surcharges totaling over annually for some specialists were a major cause of spiraling health care costs and adequate coverage was mandatory in the state for licensure those physicians who wished to continue practicing in massachusetts had no choice but to increase their patient load and order more and more defensive laboratory tests the tribunal made up of a judge an attorney and a physician of the same specialty as the defendant was not set up to determine guilt or innocence matt explained the only question to be answered today was assuming lisa graysons allegations are true has malpractice occurredor in legal terms do she and her attorneys have a prima facie case the tribunals find in favor of the plaintiff much more often than not matt had explained but even in cases where they lose in tribunal plaintiffs can proceed to trial if they are willing to post a bondin massachusetts its six thousand dollarsto cover court costs and the defendants legal fees and even then the judge can waive the bond if he doesnt believe the plaintiff can afford it thats obviously not an issue with the graysons a scuffed grassstained baseball bounced off the lawn and rolled over the sidewalk just in front of where sarah was walking she picked it up and threw it overhand to the teen who was chasing it the youth possibly hispanic gloved the toss with reflexive ease and smiled shyly at her from beneath a red sox cap not a bad arm for a girl huh ricky she heard matt call out he waved to her from across an expanse of grass and then left the group of boys he had been playing with and loped over he had on sneakers a greenpeace tshirt and the trousers to his suit as he spoke he gestured with his wellworn mitt as if it were part of his hand ricky thanks for the catch he said as he passed the youth that forkball of yours is really starting to move hey maybe ill see you guys tomorrow hes cute sarah said hes a felon matt replied just kidding sort of those kids out there are a gang los muchachos a couple of years ago the court assigned the defense of two of them to me nothing too serious fortunately anyhow i showed them some of my press clippingsonly the good ones of courseand we sort of got to be pals now the whole gang is playing ball and a number of them are working with younger kids ricky there actually made his high school team hes got some talent you made all that happen hell no they made it happen i just let them know there was nothing uncool about beating up on a baseball instead of someones head next week will mark the end of rickys probation i got a couple of box seat tickets to a soxbaltimore game i originally got them for me and harrythats my son but he had to go back home for some summer school so im taking ricky instead it was supposed to be a surprise but ive already told him im not much good at surprises where does harry live sarah asked a shadow of sadness darkened matts face california he said his tone discouraged further questions on the subject after a few uncomfortably silent moments he smiled thinly and nodded toward the far side of the common my office is that way sarah was relieved to turn away from his pain and just walk matts work clothes were in his office which was on the fifth floor of a converted brownstone the threeroom suite was not nearly as dismal or disorganized as he had painted it to be sarah pointed out everythings relative he said unfortunately in this law business with more attorneys around here than scrod image counts sometime just for the hell of it ill take you to visit jeremy mallons place spare me sarah said he introduced her to his secretary a pleasant motherly woman named ruth sarah could tell she was eager for conversation even before a word between them was spoken mr daniels is a wonderful man ruth began moments after matt had gone into the inner office to change he seems that way a good lawyer too and a great father he says youre the most important client hes ever had he always works hard but ive never seen him put in hours like he has on your case thats reassuring sarah smiled a little uncomfortably and scanned the narrow coffee table for a magazine of any remote interest to her she ended up with a dogearred fourmonthold copy of consumer reports the message she had hoped to deliver to ruth went unreceived hes here when i leave at night she prattled on and hes here when i arrive in the morning that lady he was seeing just couldnt understand how important building up this practice is to him after whats happened with harry and all i think thats why she broke it off because he wasnt paying enough attention to her i never liked her much anyway too snobby if you know what i mean mr daniels can do better suddenly sarah felt torn between asking the woman to stop sharing such personal information about her boss and grilling her for every bit of data she could deliver she settled on a middleoftheroad approach whats happened with harry she asked reflecting on the sadness in matts face and thinking the worst oh its not harry its that ex of his a few years ago she as much as kidnapped the boy and up and moved to california los angeles no less mr daniels fought her in court but he got no placeeven though everybody knows that she drinks too much and hed be a much better parent for him thats very sad you said it and he cares too much about harry to refuse anything that woman asks private school summer school extra money for clothes plus the cost of flying him here and back whenever she permits it i write a lot of the checks so i know how much he pays for those trips i think thats why this case of yours is so important to him if he does well with it the medical insurance company will probably send more business his way am am i talking too much mr daniels keeps scolding me for talking too much to the clients but the truth is if there were more clients id probably do less talking if you know what i mean sarah wondered how long she would have to know her laconic attorney and how well before learning as much about him as she had in just two or three minutes with his secretary at that moment the ancient intercom on ruths desk crackled sarah im sorry to be taking so long matt said i called a client about a small matter and hes had me on hold forever i wont be much longer ruth take a break from whatever youre doing and entertain her we dont want her to think were one of those stuffy aloof firms the suffolk superior court building a granite relic was a fiveminute walk from matts office i want to be sure youre not expecting something out of perry mason he said as they waited at a light to cross washington street today mallon gets to put on the gloves and hammer us as mercilessly as he wantsaffidavits letters from experts the works after hes done we get to regale the tribunal with arguments that are roughly equivalent to alleging that mallons mother wears army boots this is the first fire fight well be in only they get to have guns and we dont so its not going to be very pleasant but just remember its only a skirmish it sounds awful dont worry well have our chance just dont get rattled by what you hear as you were told that day in mr kwongs shop these people are not your friends i saw him yesterday by the way tianwen yes ive been over there a few times i dropped him as a client because of conflict of interest with your case but i got him angela cord shes an excellent attorney i really like the old guy by the way he says you havent been by to see him since he got out of the hospital with all thats happening to me ii just havent wanted to go hes a sweet old man i feel sorry about his getting sick and then being charged for having that opium but the truth is im angry too that was his opium he doesnt deny it yes matt said but as i recall youre the one who reminded me that his smoking opium was cultural not criminal besides he keeps denying ever having opium in his shop and he still maintains that even if he had smoked fifty times his customary pipeful he could never have confused that noni herb with chamomile but he did denying responsibility doesnt alter reality matt ive smoked opium a number of times when i was in thailand i know what it can do and its quite possible that because of carelessness or old age or opium or some combination of the three tianwen screwed up and because of his errorshis mistakes in preparing my supplementpeople have died i dont buy it well i certainly hope not youre my lawyer but until you can prove someone set him up including who and why ive got to believe that he might have been responsible for what happened to those women and that makes me just as responsible for using him they rounded the corner of the concrete and granite mall that fronted the superior court building ahead of them a small group of demonstratorsperhaps twentymilled about a single uniformed policeman kept them back from the steps off to one side a camera crew from channel was interviewing one of the demonstrators a gaunt bearded man who was wearing a fulllength hooded crimson robe i dont like the looks of this matt muttered stopping some distance away to assess the situation whats it all about unless i miss my guess its about you did you see the herald this morning sarah shook her head i was in the clinic working at seven i barely had time for a cup of coffee dont tell me i made it again you and your hospital actually on page four theres an article about some grant that mcb has just received to build a huge new center to scientifically study certain areas of alternative healing is there a charlton building its the chilton building sarah said its deserted and boarded up now in a few months theyre going to demolish it to begin work on the center but thats old hat everyone at mcbs known about that for weeks well its news to the herald and right across from that item on page five is the announcement that youre going before a malpractice tribunal today axel devlin mentioned it as well the beginning of the end for dr flake is the way i think he put it something like that my office got several calls wanting to know details i didnt speak to anyone but ruth told me it sounded like somebody was organizing a demonstration on your behalf and i think this must be it oh no she moaned theres no back way into this place unless prior arrangements are made i dont think we have any choice but to run the gauntlet so as your attorney im suggesting you limit your vocabulary for the next minute to four words thank you and no comment okay no comment thank you sarah said the small demonstration was made up primarily of practitioners of various forms of alternative healing sarah recognized some of them including a very talented chiropractor and an acupuncturist who was once a full professor in beijing there were also three women who had taken sarahs supplement had normal labor and delivered without incident two of them carried their infants with them in backpacks as sarah and matt approached the group fell back and applauded hang in there one called out good luck doctor a woman said were behind you she carried a handmade sign that read alternative healers really care the specter in the red robe broke off his interview with channel and rushed over extending a bony hand dr misha korkopovitch energy healing and shamanism he said were with you all the way dr baldwin youre bringing us all together like nothing else ever has thank you sarah managed as matt whisked her up the stairs matt this is very strange and a little hard to take some of those people i revere as healers some like that misha are probably kooks matt glanced back as they entered the building not much different than if they were a group of mds right he said lets look at what we have here and how we intend to prove our case jeremy mallon consulted his notes briefly and then began a slow strut before the tribunal he was closely observed from the plaintiffs table by two other attorneys one about his age and one quite a bit older graysons lawyers matt whispered he nodded toward the courtroom which had been nearly empty when they arrived several of the demonstrators had taken seats and now willis grayson and an entourage of four were making their way down a row before sarah could look away graysons cool gray eyes found hers the power and anger in them made her shudder as she returned her attention to mallon she wondered about lisahow she was doing and whether she had been given the option of attending today the physician on the tribunal an obstetrician from harvard named rita dunleavy and the attorney a balding rumpled man named keefe were squeezed in behind the bench beside judge judah land according to matt an implacable veteran of twentyfive years or more on the bench mallons opening remarks had included the words dangerous reckless irresponsible negligent arrogant substandard flawed and fatal sarah he alleged had prescribed a potentially powerful set of drugs to patients who were at their most sensitive and vulnerablethose readying their bodies to give birth given the lack of control over herbal medicines mallon went on there are any number of points between the soil in southeast asia and the bloodstream of a woman in boston where something can go awry our offer of proof today consists of letters from an obstetrician dr raymond gorfinkle and from a nonmd specialist in herbal medicine mr harold ling the letters from these two experts make it clear that dr baldwin acted outside of standard medical practice in prescribing an herbal supplement for her patients in place of prenatal vitamins and outside of standard holistic practice in the manner in which her supplement was prepared and dispensed specifically mr lings letter questions the competence of the herbal pharmacist who ordered the herbs and then compounded the medicinals prescribed by dr baldwin mallon then proceeded to read the two condemning letters out loud gorfinkle an obstetrician operating out of west roxbury stressed that in thirty plus years of practice he had seen all manner of rites and rituals used by his patients some of those he felt were unhealthy some innocuous but never had he seen any broad deviation from the norm at the request of a physician in his opinion in boston massachusetts in the s substituting herbs of any kind for fdaapproved prenatal vitamins constituted substandard medicine ling an herbalist from new yorks chinatown was no less damning herbal supplements had their place in maintaining health he wrote but only in small amounts and only when provided by an established responsible herbal pharmacist it was his opinion that kwong tianwen a wellknown chronic opium abuser was neither established nor responsible he further felt that noni the herb in the jar that kwong believed contained chamomile could well cause problems with blood clotting ling is one of peters oldest friends sarah whispered and gorfinkle is just a hired gun he makes a fortune testifying against other doctors im not surprised matt said im sure my exwife would love the chance to do to me what ettinger is doing to you mr daniels judge land said with a weariness in his voice that suggested matt might as well remain mute you have about five minutes to present your arguments you know that no letters from experts or other evidence will be considered from your side at this time i do know that your honor yes thank you sarah listen he whispered i dont want to say anything now that will give mallon a clue as to what part of his case we intend to home in on as things stand i cant see how we can win here so we can only hurt ourselves i understand but sarah wasnt at all certain she did your honor dr dunleavy mr keefe matt said eschewing the pacing tactics of his opponent and allowing just a hint of drawl into his speech what were all looking for today is the presentation of a prima facie case from my colleague mr mallon but what we have gotten instead is a very impressive smoke screen whats missing what void is mr mallon trying to hide behind all that smoke well i suspect you see the answer to those questions as well as i do hes trying to hide the fact that he has nothing that connects action taken or not taken by dr sarah baldwin with the development of dic in lisa grayson frankly with what little substantive material he has produced today im surprised mr mallon has the gumption even to bring this case before a tribunal weve heard a shouldnt have from dr gorfinkle and a could possibly have from mr ling but those are the weakest speculations theres no science here no expert saying that what this caring dedicated physician did was wrong and that becausebecauseof her alleged actions an infant was stillborn and her mother gravely injured without such an expert mr mallon has failed to prove his prima facie case on that basis i request a dismissal of the charges against my client bravo sarah whispered after matt sat down bravo bullshit he whispered back what im the one whipping up a smoke screen and you can see by the faces on our panel up there that they know it mallons done more than he had to to win here the judge thanked the participants promised to have a decision within the hour and dismissed the tribunal matt spoke not at all as they left the courthouse and headed back toward his office well sarah asked finally well what well what do you think think about what he seemed distracted and perplexed about what just went on in there of course she said irritably i think we lost so what you told me that was going to happen before we even went in that doesnt make me feel any better about it we were pretty much hammered in there and mallon did it without even working up a sweat he sank down on a curbside bench sarah listen he went on dead babies and maimed young women make juries angry sometimes very angry i dont know how solid a link mallons going to be able to forge between mr kwongs herbs and lisa graysons dic or even if a judge is going to allow him to introduce the two other dic cases but my sense is that with kwongs drug arrest and frail pretty onearmed lisa coming forward to testify hell be able to pluck enough emotional chords to make a jury stick the burden of proof on us and thats a position the defense never wants to be in there was a nervousness about him a tension in his eyes and the set of his jaw that sarah had never seen before maybe you should go right to the bottom line she said he looked up startled that she had read him so quickly and so accurately well the bottom line is that theres an option available to us that i havent discussed with you but that i think we ought to seriously consider namely black cat daniels chewed at his lower lip and scuffed at a cigarette butt with the toe of his shoe namely to quit he said chapter the threefamily clapboard tenement was on a deadend street in a decaying section of dorchester it was badly in need of new shingles gutters and a coat of paint lugging a heavy briefcase rosa suarez trudged up the front walk her datagathering was well along now but nothing had yet emerged to explain the three dic patients at the medical center of boston at her urging the cdc had sent out requests to hundreds of hospitals searching for other similar cases but those that had been reported so far all had logical wellestablished explanations such as abruptio placentae toxemia or overwhelming infection now in hopes of stirring up something that she might have overlooked rosa was retracing some steps she was starting with followup interviews with the families of the two deceased victims and later in the week with lisa grayson at the same time she planned to check and recheck the massive number of cultures she was running although her supervisor had said little to her directly the first signs of his impatience had already surfaced in the form of a brief memo dr wayne werner senior field epidemiologist would be finished with his current project and would be available for reassignment in three to four weeks it read anyone in the department needing werners help with an ongoing investigation should submit a request in writing within the next two weeks rosa knew that the memo was at least a demand for some sort of likely hypothesis from her and at worst a threat that she was soon to be replaced the name crudely painted just above the mail slot of the firstfloor flat was barahona fredy barahona a laborer was home all day every day drawing disability for a back problem his wife maria was working the night shift in a sneaker factory marias daughter by her previous marriage and the only child she would ever conceive was constanza hidalgo rosa was feeling the strain of her intensive investigation now nearly seven weeks along she had lost weight quarreled with her husband for the first time in several years and developed an annoying tic at the corner of one eye but she was frightened enough and determined enough to keep pushing herself to the limit she desperately wanted to leave her profession a winner more important she wanted to head off what she firmly believed was impending disaster someone had deliberately torn pages from the hospital records of at least two of the three dic cases she was investigating sarah baldwin was being followed and had been accosted once and the meticulous research techniques that had served rosa so faithfully over the years were not delivering she felt as if she were tiptoeing around a ticking bomb with no clear idea how to disarm it the only thing that seemed certain to her at this point was that unless answers were found and soon more women and their unborn infants were going to die maria barahona was a plump workweary woman who had almost surely been quite attractive at one time in her life she kept up a cheery front but the pain of losing her only child showed in her eyes once during rosas initial interview with her she had begun to weep but just as quickly she composed herself apologized and went on answering questions now with her husband across the room dozing on a tattered recliner she served rosa tea and talked once again of connie although her english was decent enough she seemed relieved to be conversing in spanish there were drugs in the car you know she said they told us connie had marijuana in her blood but i dont believe it she was a happy girl a good girl too and so so beautiful her only crime was falling in love with that bastard billy molinaro please mrs suarez please forgive me for swearing mrs barahona there is no need for you to apologize she was so beautiful you should have seen her mrs suarez men would just stop what they were doing and stare when she walked by we had already picked out her boys name guillermo even though he would have been called billy connie was going to spell it the spanish way as she had during their first interview maria barahona was rambling she was once again nearing tears rosa broke in somewhat desperately mrs barahona she said somewhere between three and five years ago your daughter was treated for something at the medical center of boston would you have any idea at all what that was some of the anguish left the womans face as she focused on rosas question ii dont remember anything she had some headaches and some stomach troubleespecially with you know her monthly but nothing that didnt get better when she took medicine she always had great faith in the doctors at the medical center if they said take this pill at three minutes after four my constanza sat looking at her watch until three minutes after four another dead end rosa stared at the floor trying to imagine connie hidalgos mounting terror during those last nightmarish hours of her life was there anything else anything at all she could try mrs barahona maria i know that connie was living with billy molinaro she said finally when did she leave home for good they were planning a wedding maria said obviously embarrassed and she still spent many nights here many nights please maria im sorry i didnt mean to imply anything at all i just wondered if her room still had her things in it thats all if it does with your permission id like to check it over oh well if you think it might help certainly you can look at anything you want its the room back there on the right i havent changed anything if you dont mind though id like to get dinner started i work the night shift you know i know rosa said glancing over at fredy barahona who was in need of a shave and hadnt so much as stirred since her arrival she wondered if he had ever prepared a meal on his own and reflected momentarily on how lucky she was to have spent forty years married to alberto suarez thank you maria ill be fine connie hidalgos bedroom spoke of a woman who had never really stopped being a little girl the bureau and bed possibly painted by connie herself were white with pink accents the pillow cases also pink were frilly with handpainted teddy bears and balloons and there were stuffed animals everywherea hundred or more zebras and elephants bears and orangutans kittens and all manner of dogs the walls were covered with posters of romantic island getaways and neonlit cities rosa swallowed against the sadness in her throat despite the marijuana reported in connies bloodstream rosa sensed she would have developed into a loving devoted parent rosa took a framed fivebyseven snapshot from the bureau and raised the window shade to view it in better light connie looking even more vibrant than in the newspaper photo rosa had in her files stood arm in arm with a swarthy handsome confidently grinning young man whom rosa was certain was billy molinaro the snapshot was taken on board a boat of some sort possibly the sightseeing kind behind them was the distinctive skyline of manhattan connie copper skinned slender and full breasted was absolutely lovely uncertain of what she was after rosa first checked the bureau drawers and then the contents of the small bookcase the books were mostly paperback romances and library books that had never been returned there were no photo albums or scrapbooks but there was a yearbookthe sword and rosefrom st cecilias high school the yearbook was clearly low budgeta far cry from the glossy fullcolor productions rosa had seen from other high schools including the one her daughters had attended she skimmed through the pages of blackandwhite photos searching for some that included connie there were at least on first perusal none nor were there many messages from classmates the few she read were hardly passionate all the best to a terrific kid we didnt know each other well but i hope you have a wonderful life good luck from your friend in latin rosa glanced again at the radiant sensuous woman sharing a harbor cruise with the dashing young man who was to become her husband the tepid comments from connies schoolmates did not jibe at all with that woman rosa flipped to the class photos at the back of the book where her daughters yearbooks had four goodsized color portraits per page the sword and rose had tenall blackandwhite printed in minute type beside each photograph was a summary of that students activities during her years at st cecilias constanza hidalgo had been a cafeteria aide and a member of the culinary arts club nothing else no music no drama no sports rosa stared at connies photograph even allowing for the fact that the portrait was slightly out of focus rosa doubted she would have been able to identify its subject without being told once again she held up the framed snapshot the girl in the yearbook was most certainly the woman with billy molinaro yet she wasnt the mouth was the same and the eyes too although they held none of the spark that rosa saw in the more recent picture but the face in the yearbook was much rounder and very much less interesting it was as if someone had taken a paring knife and carved away the younger connies plainness rosa set the yearbook on the bed and completed her inspection of the room there was nothing else of interest in the bookcase or on the floor she opened the small closet along with two maternity dresses there were a number of fairly chic outfits and dresses all size six and a dozen or more pairs of shoes if what rosa was seeing were the clothes connie had chosen not to move to billy molinaros place the former cafeteria aide and cooking club member had become a legitimate candidate for any bestdressed list the floor of the closet like much of the room was covered with stuffed animals rosa would never know what caught her eye or what instinct made her bend down and move part of the pile aside but there beneath the bears snow leopards and toucans was a shoe box bound with rubber bands and inside the shoe box was a diary matt delighted his secretary by sending her home for the remainder of the afternoon then sarah and he split the corned beef sandwich and fries they had picked up at golds and talked for a time about absolutely nothing of any importance do you have to be back at the hospital soon he asked as he poured coffee for them from the carafe of a wellused mr coffee i have some patients to sign out to the oncall doc some dictation i need to do and i have to get my bike but im okay for a little longer good there are some things we ought to go over like quitting like understanding what were up against here and how malpractice underwriters like the mmpo operate the tension that sarah had seen develop in her lawyer over the course of the past six weeks seemed indelibly etched across his brow when they had met initially her innocencetheir casehad seemed so clearcut so straightforward now she sipped at her coffee and asked him to continue first of all he said i want you to know that i think somethings screwy with this whole business i know youre not convinced but i believe someone set kwong tianwen up to make himand youappear responsible for those three dic women but as things stand we have no proof that he and i are not responsible only tianwens word and his familys we can put together a defense based on the presumption that someones out to make you look guilty but without who and why it wont hold up meaning if we pursue this into court well lose sarah were really up against it his voice drifted away his fist was clenched but hey she said arent you the one who told me that more often than not the legal system manages to sort out whats truth and what isnt more often than not is still not always things arent that simple in this case tianwens frail he gets confused a lot i might be able to get a doctors excuse to keep him off the stand but thats a long shot because hes not that bad off anymore and even if we succeed mallon will just depose him at home maybe use closed circuit tv one way or another the jury will get to meet him up close and personal as they say but how will mallon explain why so many women who took my supplement had no problem i suspect you know the answer to that you mean hell just claim that tianwen messed up with some batches and not with others or else that the incorrect herb or herbs reacted with some women and for whatever reason not with others in this situation he just has to have a response that works it doesnt necessarily have to be right with lisa grayson on their side and kwong tianwen on ours and the penchant of juries to think theyre settling claims against megabucks insurance companies not fleshandblood people im afraid its going to boil down to our having to prove in court that were not at fault i can just see mallon now he picked up his baseball and mitt and began pacing popping the ball into the pocket as he spoke this lovely young artist with two good strong arms and a healthy fetus puts her faith and trust in dr sarah baldwin dr baldwin does something unusual and irregular to the lovely pregnant young artist with two good strong armssomething well beyond the accepted norm for her medical community and suddenly the lovely young artist loses her baby and her right arm since nothing else happened during our lovely young artists pregnancy dr baldwin must prove to this court that she was not the cause of this tragedy that sounds gruesome in legal terms that little twist at the end is called res ipse loquitorthe thing or deed speaks for itself its a legal gun barrel that no defense lawyer ever wants to find himself staring down but it happensespecially from what ive been able to read in medical malpractice trials i thought i was supposed to be innocent until proven guilty if mallon gets a judge to accept res ipse loquitor and we cant prove that you are not responsible were cooked whats more if we lose here two more families are almost certain to go after what insurance you have left and whatever else you own or may ever own he stopped pacing and sank back into his chair what do you think we should do she asked well before i answer that theres one more thing you ought to know it has to do with willis grayson its been troubling me almost since the beginning of this case finally today seeing him and his legal army in that hearing room i think i know what it is sarah he doesnt want just to see you lose this case he wants to bury you ii dont understand she said feeling suddenly chilly the way i see it graysons got more money than god right i suppose im sure hes not adverse to winning sixty percent of a huge jury award but my guess is it still wouldnt equal the interest he earns on his personal checking account the way i put it together mallons in it for the money and to stick it to your hospital but grayson wants you or whoever is responsible for lisas tragedy to be put away for a long long time i cant believe this willis grayson out to destroy me its crazy absolutely crazy but do you want to know whats even crazier matt the absolute craziest thing of all i dont even know whether hes justified or not i told you how i feel about that i know what do you think we should do well we can try for some sort of settlement without admission of guilt im not sure i can get the mmpo mallon or grayson to buy it but you never know its sort of a mexican standoff our side says we would have won at trial but the legal fees would have been higher than the settlement the other side says that even though theres no admission of guilt the fact that the mmpo paid up implies that they were right to sue then the rhetoric dies down and everybody goes back to his life before you know it the ripples go away and the big pond is still again we can do that we can try and you think we should matt pressed his fingertips into a steeple and stared out the window the creases traversing his brow deepened if theyd accept the answer is yes he said finally yes i think we should i need to think about it how long do i have a week maybe a little longer if you need it thanks she felt distracted ill at ease and suddenly very tired kwong tianwen mallon lisa willis grayson the hospital goddamn peter criminal charges further lawsuits how could the case once have seemed so simple she set her cup down and turned to go ill drive you back to the hospital matt said thats okay no ii want to i want to very much sarah turned back to him but he quickly looked away and began loading papers into his briefcase i want to i want to very much had he really just said that offer accepted she replied matt fixed his gaze on the rear end of the car ahead of them as he inched his red legacy away from the city sarah would never have imagined a situation in which she was grateful for heavy traffic but she was this afternoon the ride from matts downtown office to mcb which should have taken fifteen minutes was going to take closer to forty except for some small talk unrelated to the case they rode in silence she looked at him directly when she was speaking but continued to study his face out of the corner of her eye when she wasnt the timing couldnt have been much worse she told herself falling for the attorney representing her in a malpractice case was hardly the wisest thing in the world but it was happening and there really wasnt a damn thing she could do about it though he hadnt actually said so she sensed matt was attracted to her as well but there were ethical issues that would be pressuring him neither to act on those feelings nor even to voice them perhaps if they could settle her case those considerations could be set to rest and they could get on with the business of really getting to know one another and possibly even falling in love but before she agreed to try and settle there was something she had to know matt tell me if you could script this whole legal thing exactly the way you wantedthe way that would benefit you the mosthow would it go he looked at her strangely what a funny question what do you mean the way that would benefit me the most financially careerwise you know she debated then rejected the notion of sharing with him what ruth had told her the woman was too gabby and probably a professional liability to him but it seemed premature to make trouble for a moment she was afraid matt was about to guess that she knew more about his situation than he had shared with her well he said finally i suppose if the hypothetical options were placed in order the numberone most desirable would be a knockdown dragout court battle against jeremy mallon that generated a ton of publicity and fees for me followed by a jury verdict of no negligence for you and the numberone least desirable the same exact scenario i suppose except that we lose that would pretty much finish me as far as malpractice cases go to say nothing of referrals in this game everybody knows who wins and who doesnt and nobody likes to put their life on the line with an established loser is that why you recommend that we try to settle he slammed on the brakes and glared at her oblivious to the blaring horn behind him is that what you think he asked iim sorry no thats not what i think and its not what i meant dammit matt im not putting things together too clearly i just want this whole business to be over his expression quickly softened he reached over and squeezed her hand then he pulled over to the curb sarah id let someone put bamboo splinters under my fingernails if i thought it would help us win in court but ive been working like hell on every angle i can think of and i keep running into dead ends if im pushing too hard to settle its probably because today just gave me a firsthand feel for what its going to be like still if its what you want or if they refuse our offer im ready to dig in and do battle you probably dont know much about relief pitchers but were notoriously lacking in the part of the brain that tells a person there is legitimate reason to be frightened of something suggesting we settle is what i think is best for you it may be best for me too but believe me thats incidental think about it though this case has already generated more publicity than most and it hasnt really even started if we go to trial youre going to be the featured performer in a threering circus like you couldnt imagine axel devlin will be just one of your problems i understand matt im sorry for what i said before ill let you know as soon as i decide he nodded and pulled back into the traffic dont worry he said one way or the other things will work out and no matter what happens yes go ahead matt say it she urged silently tell me that no matter what happens well face it together tell me how happy you are that weve met iumi just want you to know im behind you one hundred percent two silent minutes later he pulled to a stop by the main entrance to mcb sarah thanked him and momentarily considered sharing her own feelings finally she turned away he had enough pressure on him as it was if she was reading him wrong she would just be adding to it she entered the campus through the security gate and headed toward the surgical building where she had left her bicycle a short ride through the arboretum would be just the ticket before her longoverdue session in the dictation carrel to settle or to fight her thoughts were racing distracted she was just a few yards from the surgical building before she realized what had happened a bucket of paintbright red enamelhad been poured over her bike tied onto the seat was a rag doll also drenched in glistening scarlet one of its arms had been ripped off and dropped on the ground its abdomen had been slashed open pinned to its chest was a crudely written sign that read killer quack sarah tried unsuccessfully to keep calm tears streaming down her cheeks she raced into the surgical building her first call was to hospital security her second was to matt please call me at the hospital matt she said to his answering machine its very important that i see you as soon as possible ive decided what i want to do chapter the tissue cultures are ruined all of them this has never happened before absolutely never the distraught microbiology technician a bright young man named chris hall shook his head in disbelief rosa patted his arm consolingly although in truth she was probably the more upset of the two of them when did you check them last she asked yesterday afternoon i go through the incubators each afternoon its not just your stuff thats been lost its everything dozens and dozens of experiments and cultures are gone god i just cant believe this dr wheelock dr caro dr blankenshiptheyre all going to be furious i changed the growth media yesterday and the stuff i threw away was perfectcrystal clear somehow the replacement media must have been contaminated with some kind of cytotoxin easy does it chris rosa said these things happen anyone whos ever done any microbiology understands itespecially anyone whos worked with tissue cultures unlike bacteria which were grown in the laboratory on top of solid nutrient agar viruses could only be grown within sheets of living multiplying cellstissue cultures show me a lab thats never had any problem with tissue culture contamination she went on and ill show you a lab thats not getting any work done do you have any frozen backup specimens some any of the specimens i gave you i dont think so dr suarez im sorry i really am chris listen if you did it on purpose you may apologize otherwise just go and get your lab back in shape and dont worry well do fine she was determined not to add to the earnest technicians distress by snapping at him but a pounding fatigueandfrustrationdriven headache was making her more irritable every second in fact although she would not share the information with chris hall no matter what the lost cultures were not the disaster they might have beenat least not yet because of bart she had become nearly paranoid about backing up even the most trivial work she had sent duplicates of everything to ken mulholland an old friend at the cdc lab in atlanta at last check a week or so ago he had found nothing i hope the others are as understanding as you are chris said oh im sure they will be do you have the log book of the cultures you were running for me he handed over a standard cardboardbound lab notebook with r suarez written on the cover rosa opened her briefcase and laid the notebook on top of connie hidalgos diary after some tylenol and a nap the diary would be her next project did i mention that i was just beginning to see something in a couple of your bottles chris asked no no you didnt i marked the specimens with stars in the margin of the log book so i could check them a little more frequently it was nothing definite mind you just the slight rattiness of the tissue sheet that we sometimes see during early infection we see the same sort of changes when the tissue cells themselves are running out of gas thats when we know we need to thaw out a new batch thank you chris ill break the code when i get back to my room and see which specimens were in those bottles if those cultures were starting to grow somethingand i really doubt they werewhatever it was would be the slowestgrowing virus ive ever encountered its probably nothing i appreciate your telling me chris and also how cooperative youve been ill drop a note to dr blankenship and tell him the same thing thanks after this disaster ill need it rosa fished two extrastrength tylenols from her purse swallowed them with a drink from one of mcbs ubiquitous tepidwater bubblers and left the hospital the steamy afternoon heat radiating up from the pavement and off the tree trunks reminded her of home it also reminded her that no onenot her boss not her children not her husbandhad wanted her to return to boston no one except rosa herself now despite the contamination of the tissue cultures she sensed that maybe just maybe her hard work was beginning to pay off a previously unexamined diary and a log book containing possibly positive cultures not much but certainly more than she had just a few hours ago by the time she reached her bed and breakfast the underarms and neckline of her dress were soaked she handled the obligatory conversation and progress report to mrs frumanian with even terser responses than usual then she trudged up the stairs to her room grateful that her landlady hadnt taken the small window fan away after changing into shorts and a tshirt rosa checked the coded cultures chris hall had starred there were two of thema and bboth grown in fibrocyte cell tissue culture the code key which she kept inside one of her textbooks identified the source of both specimens as serum taken from what little remained of lisa graysons blood work rosa skimmed through the rest of the log book and then called ken mulholland in atlanta the virologist reported no growth of any of the specimens she had sent in fibrocytes or any other cell type dead end rosa put her feet up closed her eyes and tried to nap as she had planned within minutes she gave up there would be plenty of time to sleep when this whole affair was over she set a pen and legal pad on the bed beside her worked her large spectacles back onto the stillreddened bridge of her nose and opened constanza hidalgos diary the journal a fiveyear record had entries nearly every day some of them were just a few words long some were typed pages stapled to the appropriate date a few of the names were initials only or some other kind of shorthand and throughout the pages there were drawings faces mostlysmall sketches that were really quite good the entries began on connies seventeenth birthday and ended near her twentysecond the tone of the first entry made it sound as if a similar volume had preceded this one immediately rosa was immersed in the sad life and painful fantasies of a shy illeducated girl living with a mother who had little time for her and a stepfather who for years touched her far too often and much too intimately as she read along rosa vowed to keep the diary from maria barahona at all costs somehow connie had managed to fend off most of fredy barahonas advances and by her twentieth birthday there was no further mention of them if maria had not learned any of this while connie was alive there was no reason she should be exposed to such anguish now visits to various clinics at the medical center of boston were mentioned from time to time there were as maria barahona had related occasional sore throats and headaches there was also one episode of gonorrhea at age eighteen it was treated in the emergency room and gotten from someone named tg who lied to me when he said he loved me but i knew he was lying oh well connie had written at the bottom of that entry it was fun while it lasted and beggars cant be choosers rosa was again beginning to tire and was about to set the diary aside when she noticed another mention of a visit to mcb this one occurred when connie was nineteen april at mcb medical clinic today for headaches strange little dr dr s came up to me an arab or something i think he says i dont have to be fat anymore i told him diets dont help me but he said i wouldnt have to diet except just a little he wants to see me in a week i dont think ill go but maybe i will hes sort of nice suddenly rosa was wide awake many more visits to the clinic to see dr s followed several times there was mention of a diet powder of some kind and most impressively there was weight loss over just four months connie hidalgo dropped nearly fifty pounds in all she lost seventy over about six months finishing at that remarkable transformation was in and of itself impressive but even more intriguing to rosa was the realization that the date of connies initial visit with dr s and the ones that followed it fell within the pages missing from her hospital record there was nothing beyond the missing pages that connected connies visits to dr swhoever he waswith her violent death but if there was such a connection rosa had no doubt she would find it she was working her way through the rest of the diary when ken mulholland called from atlanta rosa i hope i didnt wake you he said you sounded bushed before i was ken but im perking up down one minute up the next you know how it is with us old ladies we should all be old like you are listen rosa after we talked i went back and ran a quick spectro on a couple of the specimens you mentioned one of themjust onehas a funny piece of dna floating around my tech is checking it again now i think it might be viral but the tissue culture seems clean and theres just not enough of the stuff present to tell is there any way you can get me some more specimen from the same patient maybe rosa said but she was sick at the time that serum was obtained and shes not sick now i see listen the best i can do is convalescent serum so thats what ill try for but im not at all sure i can get that either the patient in question is suing one of the doctors at this hospital for malpractice she may not be too anxious to cooperate at this point what about the other patients with the same problem theyre both dead and there are no other cases nope rosa said she hesitated and then added at least not yet there arent by the time matt returned her call sarah was home curled up on the sofa wearing her most comfortable torn unprofessional pair of jeans and working on her second glass of chardonnay she had filed reports with hospital security and the police and left a note for glenn paris who was away at some sort of meeting then she signed out to the resident on call and accepted a ride home from the obgyn unit secretary the dictation she decided could wait any idea who could have done it matt asked after she had sketched the events of the past few hours nobody everybody those three girls have friends and relatives to say nothing of the everyday runofthemill nutcakes who see some thirtysecond news clip on tv and become instant crusaders im not a cynic matt but i do know that people can be very ugly amen to that you said youve made a decision about the case want to tell me over the phone or in person sarah had hoped the question would be asked and had already decided on her response would you like to come over here she asked i enjoy cooking and almost never get to do it anymore theres enough stuff here to put some sort of meal together provided youre not too picky and you can do your part by keeping me from finishing this bottle of chardonnay by myself deal i can be there in half an hour do you want to give me a hint as to what youve decided i think i can do better than that she said i can tell you that ive decided that i cant agree to settle this case under any circumstances you know matt i thought i knew what i had to do when i left you this afternoon sarah said then the moment i saw what theyd done to my bike i was sure they sat on her sofa drinking decaf and eating what remained of a sara lee pound cake she had found in the recesses of her freezer dinnermushroom chicken crepes and some stirfried vegetableshad gone over reasonably well still she was not nearly as relaxed as she would have liked the incident at the hospital was one reason of course but another was that matt was the first man she had been alone with in her place in almost two years listen whatever you say is what were going to do he said if he was upset by her decision to go against his recommendation he hid it well im terrified by what might happen in court matt she went on but settling with no actual finding wont do anything to stop the redpaint people and i dont intend to spend my life running from them or being harassed by them if im innocent theyve got to know it and if im guilty ive got to know it believe me i wont fall apart even if the worst happens even if willis grayson gets his wish and i get sent to prison i believe in a higher power and i believe she has a plan for me so there you have it there i have it he said well for what its worth i suspected you would decide to push forward in fact after i dropped you off i started scheduling depositionsbeginning as soon as possible with your old pal ettinger i can promise you one thing mallon is in for a hell of a fight and im glad youre representing me sarah said there is one problem though something i need your help with just name it he stirred uncomfortably then suddenly he turned to her and took both her hands in his sarah we cant have anything happen between usat least not until this case is over i dammit i dont even know what im trying to say youve got to stop looking at me like that sarah locked her fingers in his his facehis kind wonderful facewas saying everything she needed to know about what he was feeling for her id like to help you out she managed but i have no control over how i feel or how i look at someone just like you cant control how youre looking at me now she ran her tongue slowly over her lips matt loosened his collar hey i need you to stop doing that before i melt altogether he said sarah listen im working ninety hours a week im lonely as hell and the truth is im starting to think about you all the time but if im going to continue being your lawyer this really isnt a good idea lawyers are strongly discouraged from getting romantically involved with clients it tends to wreak havoc with their professional objectivity in some states its the law now it may be in massachusetts before long i understand then youll help me out at least for now i dont have a lot of willpower ill think about it but matt im a big girl now i can take care of myself pretty well and i have no intention of reporting you to the bar no matter what besides what more could a client ask for than to be defended by a lawyer whos thinking about her all the time sarah i mean it there are a lot of choices to be made in a case like yours a lot of decisions tonights decision you made pretty much on your own but for others youll need an objective unemotional attorney if it seems like im too wrapped up in you to represent you properly ive got to quit wrapped up in me she said i like the sound of that matt im sorry please dont be upset with me i understand really i do im not trying to cause problems for you if you need another attorney to help you then im sure youll get one i trust your judgment on thatand mine my case is important sure but take it from someone whos spent far too much time behind a stethoscope the past few years sos this stuff she took his hands in hers their eyes met this time matt made only the most fleeting attempt to look away sarah felt her mouth grow dry how long had it been since she had felt like this with a man slowly her eyes closed his hands slid up her arms and drew her toward him she sensed his head tilt his lips draw closer then her phone began ringing instantly the fragile tension building between them shattered matt smiled awkwardly lowered his hands and pulled away i have an answering machine she said wishing she could rip the phone from the wall thats all right go ahead and take it he replied please take it the voice on the line was one she hadnt heard in six weeks sarah this is andrew truscott if youre about to hang up please dont damn sarah thought she covered the mouthpiece its andrew truscott she whispered the surgeon i told you about yes andrew she said with exaggerated coolness what do you want youve been really decent about not causing me trouble with paris he said and also with the way you handled that that other business is that what you called to say paris has just offered me a damn good staff appointment at mcb complete with a teaching appointment at the med school and my own lab in that new centerthe one theyre going to be constructing where the chilton building is hes setting up some really exciting programs apparently his methods have pulled the place out of its financial hole after all no thanks to you well if you had complained to him about me the faculty appointment might never have come through and thats what you called to say no no sarah please listen i dont know how much longer this guys going to be here somethings happening right now that has to do with you and i want to help you i really do i dont understand im in chinatown right now i was having dinner with an old friend from australia at a place called the szechuan terrace on hudson street my friend had to go back to his hotel after he left i decided to stay for one last drink thats when i heard someone in the next booth mention your name he was saying something about how you were in court today and about how easy it was to change the stuff in your herbalists shop he said he loved hanging your ass and kwongs out to dry sarah felt her heart begin pounding her body tensed where is he now she asked hes right over there right across the room from me i just paid the cashier twenty bucks and she told me his name its tommy szeto andrew spelled the name do you know him no ive never heard of him well hes with two other guys the cashier seems a little afraid of them she said she doesnt know where he lives andshit listen sarah i think theyre getting ready to leave im going to try and follow them meet me here in threequarters of an hour szechuan terrace hudson street see you then please believe me please come sarah listened to the dial tone for ten seconds or more before she set the receiver down nearly two months without so much as a word from andrew let alone an apology now this from his spot on the sofa matt was looking at her curiously there was no reason to believe andrew truscott about anything yet she couldnt come up with any ulterior motive that made sense if what andrew had just told her was true and they could prove it everything in her life was about to change for the better he says hes calling from a restaurant in chinatown and that the man who changed the herbs in kwongs shop was in the next booth talking about what he did he wants to meet me there in threequarters of an hour will you come of course i will do you believe him does it matter i want it to be over matt i want it to be over so badly he put his arms around her and held her tightly so do i he said chapter this place must serve incredible food matt said because it certainly isnt staying open on its atmosphere the operative description for the szechuan terrace was plastic plastic lanterns off the ceilings plastic coverings on the tables plastic basrelief chinese landscapes on the walls even the booths themselves some sort of red vinyl were separated by curtains of plastic sarah and matt had walked to chinatown from her apartment the air had cooled considerably and they could see lightning to the east but the breeze was pleasant and the city vibrant it was nearing ninethirty the szechuan terrace was still perhaps a quarter full most of the patrons were asian do you think that a measure of the goodness of a chinese restaurant is how many chinese are eating there sarah whispered of course doesnt everyone think that i used to before i spent all those years in the far east it turns out there are probably as many asians with a taste for bad chinese food as there are americans with a taste for bad western food its only a matter of time before someone opens a mcegg roll in beijing matt took a place at the long mahogany bar while sarah wandered nonchalantly past the booths and then back no andrew she said sliding onto the vinylcovered bar stool next to his just going by your description of this truscott this turnaround of his is very strange not really andrew knows i could have caused him a great deal of trouble at the hospital and didnt i also picked up an abnormal lab result he had missed not too long ago the patient might well have died on the table besides matt what choice have we got this tommy szeto may be the key to everything at ten minutes before ten sarah approached the cashier he checked briefly with the waiters and then reported to her that no one of andrews description had been in the restaurant however he added the night had been very busy there was a flicker of recognition in the mans dark eyes at the mention of tommy szeto but he denied knowing of any such person nobody here remembers andrew sarah whispered to matt but i think that guy knows who szeto is he says he doesnt but his expression says otherwise but where in the hell is andrew i dont know but i have this uneasy feeling right here under my sternum lets wait ten more minutes i have a better idea matt went to the pay phone just inside the front doorway and consulted the phone book sarah noted that from where the phone was situated andrew would have been able to see szeto leave almost any of the booths her intuition was telling her that truscott had overheard precisely the conversation he reported but if so she wondered uneasily where is he now sze dash to is that how you said the guy spells his last name matt asked returning to the bar thats what andrew said well there are some szetos in the book but no tommy im not surprised but theres a guy i knew from chinatownbenny hsing and sure enough bennett hsing is listed and benny was a clubhouse man with the sox before he got fired he was always into everyones business and always telling everyones business to everyone else if this szeto is anything more than a figment of truscotts imagination benny will know him where does he live regal street just a few blocks from here and will he talk to you he might he actually liked me for one thing my life was so dull that he never got into trouble by spreading gossip about me no one would have believed i was into anything out of the ordinary so he never bothered and for another when steve matz accused him of stealing his gold necklace and eventually got him fired i tried to point out that legally without an eye witness or the actual purloined item matz didnt have much of a case then why did this benny get fired well i was just a secondyear law student back then and not such a wily one at that and besides matz was leading the team in wins strikeouts and earned run average as long as he kept pitching that way he could have gotten just about anyone in the organization fired should we call this benny first benny never was one to stick his neck out for anybody else i think he might have more trouble coming up with a reason not to deal with us if we just show up on his doorstep at ten oclock they left the restaurant but first sarah called andrews home she had met andrews wife claire several times and had always viewed her as sweet though painfully shy never did she seem a heavenmade match for her flamboyant acidtongued husband i um i thought maybe you knew claire said you and andrew being friends and all knew what weve separated andrew left here about six weeks ago hes been living in an apartment not far from the hospital i have his phone number if you want it claire im sorry to hear that thanks but were managing okay it felt as if hed been married to the hospital the past few years anyway now he tells me hes been involved with someone else for a while he wont say who believe it or not i actually thought he might have taken up with you not at all claire in fact andrew and i havent spoken to one another in weeks sarah wrote down andrews new number and tried it before returning to matt there was no answer regal street was not far from what remained of the combat zone bostons oncebooming redlight district they walked the three and a half blocks through a light rain and the rumble of distant thunder benny hsings address was an uninviting brick apartment building with the odor of urine in the entryway and a column of what seemed like too many doorbells for the size of the place bennys name was beside one of them after two buzzes he appeared at the top of the hallway stairs peered down at them and then rushed to the door the cat he exclaimed are you ever a sight for sore eyes his speech was quick and choppy in sharp contrast to matts drawl hi benny howre you doing matt said benny this heres sarah baldwin you got a minute for you for black cat of course of course come up come up he was a paunchy balding man with bad teeth behind a smile that lacked much sincerity his chinos and tshirt were stained and he smelled of tobacco sweat and beer sarah acknowledged that he might have changed over the years since he last worked for the red sox but as things stood she did not have to stretch her imagination far to picture benny hsing pilfering someones gold necklace the wifes asleep benny said pointing at the bedroom door he motioned them to a couch that was covered with a brown army blanket i get you something a beer a coke gosh cat what a coincidence i watch the sox playing detroit just a little bit ago and i was thinkin aboutyou knowthe old days this man here was a hell of a pitcher miss a hell of a pitcher so ive heard sarah said and smart i tell you miss they dont come no smarter you lawyer now huh cat yeah benny we need your help matt said my help were looking for someone a man named szeto tommy szeto benny whirled and pointed a knobby finger at sarah the doctor thats who you are kwong tianwens doctor god you excuse me for saying so miss but you much better looking than that picture they have of you in the papers thank you sarah managed kwong claims that somebody set him up matt said he swears that someone messed around with the herbs in his shop and then brought his opium up from the basement and planted it on the shelf have you heard anything about that black cat daniels right here in my apartment i owe you cat you were only one who went to bat for me against that bastard matz the only one its been hard for me since they let me go cat damn hard he gestured around the tiny apartment matt re sponded by pulling out his wallet and laying two twenties on the coffee table its important benny he said benny eyed the money with disdain i dont know much he said nothing really benny thats all the cash i have believe me hey wait listen he reached into his wallet again and slid out the two tickets handling them as if they were priceless crystal herere two frontrow box seats to see the sox play the orioles next week first base line just behind the bag tell us what we need to know about tommy szeto and the forty and the tickets are yours sarah started to object to making ricky pay such a price on her behalf but matt stopped her with a quick glance benny eyed the tickets avidly you know how long since i been at a game next week youre there benny just tell us what you know about this szeto and where we can find him its only rumors what i know cat only rumors szetos no good no good at all he hears i talk about him to anyone he sells my body one part at a time hes tong you know what i mean a gang member right tong tougher than any gang cat gangs operate around here only if tong tell them okay go on rumoronly rumor rememberis that szeto got big bucks to mess kwong up big big bucks i knew it matt whispered from who sarah asked at once bewildered and frightened at the thought benny hsing shrugged and shook his head where can we find him matt asked he come and go in new york a lot you know where the ships come in here hes either with some woman or more often playing poker at maurice fangs benny eyed the money and the tickets but matt made no move to slide them over wheres this maurice fangs place please cat szeto finds out i told you anything im dead he wont find out anything now where is it benny hesitated then scribbled an address on the back of an envelope second floor green door poker game every night until five am starts up again at ten am maurice is okay but hes szetos pal szeto is a snake you should be careful we will be howll we know szeto benny drew an imaginary line from beneath his eye to the corner of his mouth bigleague scar cat he said knife i think matt backed away from the money and the tickets benny snatched them up then he hurried into the bedroom and returned with a baseball here cat he said you been good to me then and now this here is ball you threw to clinch division title against toronto remember ive almost sold it half a dozen times but i always say no this is cats ball and someday im gonna have the chance to give it to him thats very nice benny thanks matt hefted the ball a couple of times and then dropped it into his jacket pocket you just be careful of szeto benny said be careful and keep benny hsings name out of it good luck miss sarah thanked him and then preceded matt down the dimly lit stairs to the fetid entryway outside the glassfront door the rain was heavier now and more windwhipped lets go to that diner at the corner and figure out what we want to do next matt said sarah gestured to their surroundings and pinched her nose shut anything that will get us out of this spot that was really pretty sweet of benny though dont you think what giving you that baseball yeah matt said that was very sweet except for one thing i already have the ball from that toronto game in a case in my den the steady rain continued though it still was something less than a thunderstorm after coffee and deep dish apple pie sarah and matt left the small diner and darted from doorway to doorway to a bank of boston money machine they had considered and rejected all of the options they could think of and had finally returned to the first onefind tommy szeto and somehow get him to disclose who had hired him and why they would resort to whatever it took pleading bribery threatsif necessary even some arm twisting sarah no longer harbored any doubt that someone had hired tommy szeto to tamper with the herbs in kwong tianwens shop someone out there wanted to see the old man ruined or sarahs career destroyed possibly both but the chances of keeping a gangster like szeto around boston long enough to have him questioned through legal channels were slimroughly the same as the chances of interesting those legal channels in the whole business to begin with there really was no good option they had to confront szeto before he learned they were after him and disappeared it was that simple the money machine refused to shell out more than but matt allowed as how that might be to the machines credit they darted and splashed the four blocks to the address benny had given them for maurice fangs allnight poker game though unasked the question of what might have happened to andrew truscott continued to gnaw at them both their planwhat little there was of itwas to act as if they had official legal business with szeto maybe some money due him what if he doesnt bite on that sarah asked then we move on to plan b whatever that is in the end everything just might boil down to which one of us is bigger or more heavily armed the threestory dilapidated building was tucked on a narrow side street just a block from kwongs shop the street door opened on a foyer that was cluttered with junk mail and no better lit than the one on regal street the avocadogreen door painted in highgloss enamel was just at the top of the first flight of stairs sarah and matt could hear string music and a womans highpitched singing voice from the other side just remember to look like you know what youre doing matt whispered before he knocked the door was opened a fraction of an inchjust enough for them to see a sliver of a face and a single rheumy eye the singing louder now was chinese and clearly a recording of some sort what do you want the voice was gravelly and impatient my names matt daniels matt flashed a business card then just as quickly put it away im an attorney with hannigan daniels and chung if youre maurice fang i need to speak with you about what actually its about money that is owed to one of your clients a lot of money mr fangplease i know about the card game going on in there and i couldnt care less but i dont do business standing in hallways now please could we come in its very late and id really like to get this whole thing over and call it a night out of sight of the eye sarah nodded that she was impressed with matts performance after a momentary hesitation the police bar was moved aside and the avocado door opened maurice fangs apartment was considerably better furnished than benny hsings but it was also a lot smokier a thin cirrus cloud wafted out from a room one doorway down the hall who are you looking for fang asked he was a willowy man perhaps sixty wearing a black dress shirt and solid white tie someones grandfather trying to be nathan detroit was sarahs first impression matt immediately maneuvered his way around so that he was between fang and the smokefilled room as i said im an attorney this is my associate miss sharp theres been an estate settlement were trying to find a man named szeto first name tommy ive been authorized to pay up to fifty dollars for information that will help me find him so that we can take care of this matter weve been looking for him all day finally someone suggested we try here who mr fang im a lawyer everything thats told to me is told in confidence that way no one has to worry including you lets see the fifty maurice fang said he took the bills and ordered matt and sarah to wait in the living room then he stepped around them and into the card room matt remained where he was sarah moved up beside him after a minute fang returned and handed back the fifty no one knows where szeto is he said hey wait a minute matt had barged past him to the doorway i want to ask myself he said weve had a long day sarah stepped up behind him and could see immediately that one of the six chinese men playing cards and smoking was tommy szeto he was slightly built and pasty with simian features a pencil mustache and a striking scar running exactly as benny had depicted maurice fang tried to pull matt from the room but matt easily shook him off i dont know if any of you is mr tommy szeto he lied but i need to speak to him about money hes got coming to hima lot of money the men at the table just stared up at him no one moved you see fang protested you see now get the hell out of here matt glanced back at sarah they both knew there might never be a second chance szeto was obviously not buying matts story i guess we go to plan b matt whispered over his shoulder he gauged the room for a moment and then stepped forward and grasped a startled tommy szetos right hand with his nice to meet you mr szeto nice to meet you he gushed before szeto could react matt pulled him to his feet twisted his right hand behind his back and locked his own left arm around the smaller mans neck what the fuck szeto gurgled im not going to hurt you tommy matt said pulling him out into the narrow hallway but we need to talk he tightened his grip do you understand szeto nodded matt kept his firm hold and turned szeto around to face sarah do you know who she is he demanded do you szeto struggled briefly but quickly gave up he was at least six inches shorter than matt and fifty pounds lighter let go he managed to say do you know who she is yes and why were here yes yes let go matt loosened his grip with sudden surprising speed szeto whipped his hand free slammed matt backhand across the face and then kicked him full force in the groin matt grunted in pain and reeled back heavily against the wall szeto moved to follow up but matt was already steadying himself after the briefest hesitation the gangster cried out something in chinese to maurice fang sprinted to the window at the end of the hall and dove through it onto the fire escape matt his eyes glazed and watery the corner of his mouth bleeding lurched after him with sarah close behind they saw szeto vanish from the platform then they heard him cry out in pain from the alley below hes hurt himself matt said peering into the rainswept darkness through what remained of the window we can get him without waiting for sarah to respond he stepped out onto the slick slatted metal platform in seconds she was beside him fuck you you crazy bastard they heard maurice fang cry out szeto apparently unable to loosen the escape ladder had jumped now he was about twenty yards away hobbling badly through the heavy rain toward another alleyway weve got to hurry matt said kneeling and releasing the ladder are you okay sarah asked as he scrambled down to the muddy illpaved alley later he shot back come on sarah slid as much as climbed down the ladder and dashed after matt sloshing through muddy puddles as she ran she caught up with him at the corner of the next alley it was lined with trash cans and overflowing cardboard boxes and had no working lights they peered through the darkness and the rain but could see no one what did szeto yell out back there to maurice matt asked taking a few tentative steps down the alley could you tell im not sure call guoming something like that they made their way carefully down the alley ahead there were any number of places where tommy szeto could be hiding perhaps waiting to ambush them suddenly a brilliant spear of lightning flooded the alley with light moments later thunder exploded then there was another flash there matt cried pointing ahead szeto was a shadow gliding along the building heading toward the far end of the alley the moment he heard matts voice he took off they sprinted after him across a deserted street and onto the ribbons of railroad track leading into massive south station ahead of them szeto hobbled toward a row of vacant passenger cars and ducked between two of them breathless now in the heavy air matt followed with sarah clearly more fit just a few steps behind they worked their way between the two cars then they froze szeto was perhaps fifteen yards away but he had ceased running and turned to face them standing alongside him in the downpour were three other men two were asians one of whom was holding a gun the third was andrew truscott jesus matt murmured matt thats andrew she whispered squinting through the gloom i guessed he said sardonically andrew what are you doing she called out whats going on here come here szeto yelled out over the rumble of rain on the steel cars move slowly guoming here is an excellent shot dont make him prove it andrew whats going on sarah pleaded sarah cant you see matt said in an urgent whisper get behind me and move back toward the cars quickly sarah did not understand what he meant but she did as he demanded another step and youre both dead szeto warned just like your friend here the men standing on either side of andrew moved away and his lifeless body crumpled forward onto the tracks guoming please kill them szeto said calmly sarah run matt cried out as szeto limped forward behind the other two men run matts right hand was already in his sport coat pocket his fingers tight around the baseball with a continuous fluid motion he drew the ball out stepped forward and threw the gunman now no more than thirty feet away spent a second trying to comprehend what was happening for him that second was far too long the pitch a hard rising fastball caught him squarely in the throat just above the breastbone the revolver discharged harmlessly then clattered to the gravel the man snapped backward as if kicked by a mule dropped heavily to the ground and lay there moaning sarah was already backing through the space between the cars run sarah matt called out again back toward the alley they recrossed the road as they reached the alley they turned back in time to see szeto and the remaining man climb out from between the cars the revolver now in szetos hand sparked the brick just to the right of sarahs head shattered matt grabbed her hand and pulled her down then together they whirled and sprinted down the alley chapter do you see them sarah asked they were on a dark deserted street huddled behind a parked car it was nearing midnight the relentless stinging downpour was continuing matt peered through the windows of the car theyre across the street he whispered i dont think that other guy wants to go too far without szeto and szetos having trouble moving with that leg so messed up i think we can beat them out of here do you know where we are not exactly but downtown is that way sarah inched her way up until she could see the two men they didnt seem to be moving with any great urgency theyre crazy they killed andrew matt im really scared i cant stop shaking that means youre going to have to be in charge because im worse off than you are listen we can do this szeto can hardly move he scanned the street that alley over there we break for it and then try and make it to stuart streetor at least to where there are some people you okay for that matt look where moments ago there had been two now there were four a pair of men had emerged from behind szeto and now stood beside him scanning the street one of the new men held a gun the other was speaking into a cellular phone or radio of some sort both of them looked relaxed and athletic jesus theyre like an army the tong remember what benny said about them weve got to get out of here oh god matt over there i think theres more of them there were in fact three more sealing off the street from the far end that alley over there is our only way now weve got to go for it just keep low until we reach the corner of that building then run like hell ready yeah sarah ii really do care a lot for you come on lets do it crouched low they inched backward keeping their hands on the pavement for balance now matt said they whirled and fled down the alley behind them one of their pursuers cried out an instant later they heard the snap of two gunshots stay low matt warned keep running the alley was narrow and filled with debris and loose garbage matt pulled over one overflowing trash can as he passed then another cut to the right sarah cried pointing ahead of them at the far end of the alley two more men had appeared suddenly chinatown which was no more than a dozen or so square blocks seemed endless reacting to sarahs command matt spun into the narrow gap between two buildings slipped and fell scrambled up and kept running theyre multiplying like rabbits he said panting sarah im not sure we can make it out of here i think weve got to find someplace to hide sarah was now clearly the quicker of the two of them she was about ten feet ahead as they approached a cross street she slowed and glanced to her right the doorway of an old theater was just a few yards away the theater boarded up and not in any apparent use still displayed torn posters advertising chinese movies and even one showing humphrey bogart and katharine hepburn navigating the african queen matt she gasped pointing at the door can you get us in there he hit it once with his shoulder then stepped back and with one vicious kick slammed it open they slipped inside and closed the door quickly behind them the lobby glowed dimly with the outside light from two small windows set high in one of the walls except for a worn carpet of some sort the place was stripped still even after what was probably years of disuse sarah could smell the popcorn that had once been made and sold there hand in hand they entered the theater itself like the lobby the space had several narrow windows near the ceiling which had probably been curtained off during shows the light from them was enough to make out a stage in front of where the screen once had been the seats with a few battered exceptions had been removed probably dates back to vaudeville matt said weve got to find a place to hide or else a side door out of here and quickly sarah leapt onto the stage and then called out in a loud whisper matt up here look just offstage was a steel ladder freehanging its base just inches above the floor it led straight up to a narrow catwalk which was suspended from the ceiling the catwalk perhaps twentyfive feet overhead was barely visible in the gloom without waiting for discussion or agreement sarah grabbed a quilted moving blanket from a pile of them near the stage and began to climb its solid matt she called down come on moments later they heard the lobby door crash open then there were voices matt peered overhead but could not see sarah at all he threw two more of the packing blankets over his shoulder and scrambled quickly up the ladder the metal catwalk three feet across and suspended from the ceiling by steel struts was actually quite sturdy matt spread one of the packing quilts out next to hers and folded the other as a makeshift pillow the blankets were damp and smelled of mold but terrified and soaked to the skin the two of them were quite beyond feeling discomfort matt lowered himself down next to her and pulled his knees up just as some men entered the theater can you see anything she whispered her lips against his ear matt shook his head and then lay back praying they were both completely screened from the men below the menit seemed as if there were two of themchattered on in chinese without any particular urgency in their voices then after only a minute or two they made one pass around the theater and left the lobby door opened and closed had they both gone sarah started to speak but matt silenced her with a finger to his lips and pulled her closer to him five minutes passed before the man in the darkness below them cleared his throat and softly coughed i knew it he murmured at that instant the lobby door slammed open once again several different voices conversed with the man who had been standing guard and suddenly the dark musty air was pierced by spears of bright light shit matt mouthed more than spoke the word sarah pressed her body even tighter to his she tried desperately to understand the chinese being spoken below them but could only come up with scattered words and occasionally a phrase it was clear that tommy szeto was both frightened and furious it sounded as if someonethere was never a name spoken that she recognizedwasnt going to like it at all if sarah and matt got away and started talking whoever found them would be rewarded trying not to move even as they breathed they watched the beams of light play across the ceiling the catwalk and possibly even the underside of the packing quilts on which they were lying grabbing them had been sheer genius on sarahs part matt was realizing he tried to imagine what their nest looked like from below probably like nothing at all if they made it out he would have to find some special way to thank her if below them the lights and voices moved closer to the stage a beam flashed through the catwalk then another the lights panned back and forth sarah felt herself beginning to shake perhaps sensing her movement matt turned his head slightly and pressed his lips against her forehead the catwalk shook as one of the men below took hold of the ladder then it tilted as he stepped onto the first rung matts lips pressed even more tightly against sarahs skin another step and another they could see the mans flash playing over the spot where they lay another step then suddenly the catwalk heaved and shuddered as he pushed off and jumped back to the floor nothing they heard him say the flashlight beamswhat they could see of thembegan moving to other parts of the theater huddled on the overhead walk sodden and exhausted matt and sarah fought the need to move their limbs tingled and cramped electric pain knifed into their hands and feet they clung tightly to one another unable to move or speak together yet very much apart the search within the theater continued for at least another half hour tommy szeto left well before that but the others kept on looking twice sarah and matt heard the outside door open and close the theater was quiet sarah started to shift her position but matt stopped her theyre still down there he whispered almost soundlessly dont move he turned his head slightly and suddenly his lips were resting on hers from somewhere in the darkness below them there was a scuffing bit of movement and the clearing of a throat not wantingor daringto move her lips away from his sarah slid her free arm upward until her fingers touched his neck for the next two hours they lay that way their eyes closed their breathing synchronous every fifteen minutes or so the man stationed beneath the catwalk made some sort of movement or sound finally after a painful eternity he switched on his radio telephone and spoke in chinese he wants to leave sarah whispered excitedly they heard him stretch and groan he shuffled toward the back of the theater again the lobby door opened and shut then there was only silence what do you think matt risked asking i think they havent found us i believe hes gone matt i cant stop thinking about andrew please dont move yet matt turned his head so that once again their lips were touching if you insist he whispered at fivethirty the hazy light of the new day began to brighten the theater huddled on the rusting metal catwalk above the empty stage sarah and matt had moved enough to keep their limbs from paralysis but they had not broken their embrace nor had they spoken one or possibly both of them had slept for a time though neither of them was sure matt worked his hands up to the sides of her face and kissed her gently on the eyes youve been incredibly brave he said i did a very stupid thing trying to play green beret with that bastard are they really gone matt sat up slowly and carefully and peered between the rails of the catwalk i cant vouch for the lobby but the theater is empty i think we should wait until nine or ten before we leave though the more people out there the better chance we have of making it home although frankly if i were tommy szeto id already be on my way to someplace far far away from here poor andrew he really was trying to help me maybe he did it in time to reclaim his place in heaven matt said considering how he ended up i guess youd have to say it was a pretty damn noble act i only wish he had been able to learn who bankrolled szeto in the first place any ideas none sarah said no idea who and no idea why except now we know one important thing namely that someone is willing to go to any length to ensure that you look guilty of causing those dic cases thats not absolute proof that tianwen and i are innocent but it seems like someone thinks so when we get out of here we can begin to focus on who that might be but the first thing im going to do is go and speak with claire truscott i thought you said andrew had left her hes still the father of their child i intend to help claire out in any way i cannow and in the future matt glanced at his watch two hours he said maybe two and a half i think we ought to stay up here and keep pretty quiet i agree she smiled and kissed him lightly he slipped his hand up beneath the back of her blouse and rubbed her back you know he said this isnt exactly the underthesheet situation with you i had been fantasizing about and here i thought this whole night was an elaborate setup just because you knew that my tastes run to the unusual and the exotic promise you wont turn me over to the bar association if you promise not to drop me as a client she kissed him again this time more searchingly her tongue explored his mouth then she reached down loosened his trousers and gently caressed him you were pretty macho last night cat she whispered did that coward hurt you i dont remember he said looking at her wideeyed a little maybe god what youre doing right now is really helping i mean really helping again she smiled at him the horror of the night just passed had largely given way to thoughts of the future and of the man whose gentle eyes were fixed on hers thats just the beginning she whispered im a doctor remember when i think its clinically appropriate im going to kiss it and make it all better chapter october scalpel sponge please scope ready please howre you doing kristen are you feeling any of this excellent thats excellent do you still want to watch this procedure on the monitor all right then here we go the young woman on the operating table a mother of three had begged for local rather than general anesthesia although general was the norm sarah had agreed she had done her first tubal ligation by laparoscopy late in her first year of residency that procedure had gone without a hitch as had the twenty or twentyfive she had done since then three of them utilizing a local anesthetic with heavy sedation she was a damn good surgeon technically and clinically one of the best if not the best her training program had ever had why then had her life in the hospital become such hell okay kristen what youre looking at are your insides theres a small but very powerful light at the tip of this laparoscope right next to the light source is a fiber optic pickup that can take light and actually make it bend around corners the fiber optics carry the images back to this eyepiece and also to the television monitor as of this moment your left ovarythat little pink thing in the middle of the screenis a star amazing huh fiber optics sarah found herself momentarily wondering about the scientist responsible for the remarkable revolutionary discovery worldwide communications forever changed the frontiers of surgery pushed farther back perhaps than with any other single discovery since anesthesia had life rewarded the inventor was he rich was he at peace or had controversy illness or the machinations of others made things hard for him sarah had inserted a bipolar cautery instrument through a small incision just over kristens pubis now watching through the laparoscope she guided the tips of the cautery unit around the narrow fallopian tube next she traced along the tube from where it entered the uterus to its fimbriated tipthe fringed end next to the ovary okay kristen your tubes completely freed up im going to grasp it with the little pincher on the cautery unit and burn it closed if you still want to watch you might actually see the fat cells in the tissue sizzle and pop then just to be sure there are no little surprise tax deductions in your future im going to repeat the procedure in a second spot as well a bit closer to your uterus the burns were going to make will deaden the sensory nerves along with the tubal tissue so there wont be much pain from that area after were all doneif theres any pain at all were going to make after were all done the phrases used reflexively now sounded as awkward as sarah was feeling she glanced over at the nurses they used to love working with her theyd talk and joke with her during cases now whether they intended it or not there was distance she and matt had reported andrews murder to the police but the one detective assigned to the case had failed to find andrews body or any evidence at all of foul play he couldnt locate tommy szeto or even turn up a witness willing to corroborate any part of their story the malpractice case against her was proceeding along and fueled by her unsubstantiated account of the night in chinatown was still receiving a goodly amount of media attention there were any number of rumors circulating around the hospital grapevine one of them had andrew leaving his wife for sarah and then leaving for australia when sarah jilted him for another man another had sarah killing andrew after a lovers quarrel and then making up the chinese gang tale in case his body was ever found it was terribly frustrating to know that without concrete proof of some sort she was powerless to convince any doubter of the truth in the press the publicity about sarah and the medical center of boston had ranged from disruptive to brutal a nasty letter from the president of the chinatown neighborhood association had been published in the globe calling her allegations about tongs and violence damaging to his community in various publications and broadcasts her motives had been questioned as well as her morality and even her sanity worst of all nothing had changed absolutely nothing desperate to clear sarahs name and his own suddenly shaky reputation matt had hired a private detective after nearly three weeks and more than the man had come up with essentially no more information than that tommy szeto was no longer in boston and possibly no longer in the country nobody in chinatown to whom he spoke knew anything about dr andrew truscott thats it kristen a couple of bandaids and youre off to recovery sarah said thank you all thank you very much there were a few mumbled replies but no praise for a job that was in fact exceptionally well done sarah stripped off her gloves and rushed into the nurses locker room feeling quite alone and perilously close to tears she still felt committed to staying at work and to seeing things throughmore so than ever since andrews death but it was doubtful she would ever again feel comfortable at mcb being up on pedestals the way most mds were made them easy targets she would never have believed how fragile a physicians reputation and professional respect could be it was incredibly painful to realize that more than two years of consistently good workof always staying the extra hour of always helping out when help was neededwere no real match for baseless rumor and innuendo she changed into fresh scrubs and her clinic coat and stopped by the mail room to check her cubby among the pathology reports and copies of operative dictations there was a note from rosa suarez dated that morning asking sarah to get in touch with her there was also a letter from the chairman of the hospital board of trustees sent out via a computergenerated mailing sticker the envelope was indistinguishable from those she frequently received announcing a stafftrustee tea or requesting an update on her continuing education activities the contents of the envelope however were hardly routine the letter signed by some typist in lieu of the board chairman politely informed sarah that due to the confusion and uncertainty surrounding her and her future the professional conduct subcommittee of the board had requested obgyn department head dr randall snyder to submit an alternate recommendation for the position of next years chief resident damn sarah shoved the letter in her clinic coat pocket and pounded her fist on the counter damn what eli blankenship his massive pate gleaming beneath the fluorescent light smiled down at her the sight of him immediately softened sarahs anger throughout her ordeal the medical chief had been one of the few constants at the hospitalalways upbeat and encouraging always applying his incredible intellect to her problems there was no doubt he had told her that the story she and matt told about tommy szeto and andrew truscott was perfectly true any real student of mysteries would have known that he said their account was simply too far out too rough around the edges to be anything other than fact mornin dr blankenship the mail clerk said handing over a huge stack of announcements lab reports journals and magazines gmorning to you tate hows the mrs still doin great thanks to you blankenship smiled his pleasure and led sarah away from the window whats going on he asked she pulled out the letter from the hospital trustees and passed it over blankenship read it in seconds this is ridiculous he exclaimed rob mccormick and the rest of those fops on the board of trustees spend so much time worrying about appearances that they forget about accomplishments ergo they have none idiots sarah dont we have a meeting scheduled with you and your lawyer yes sir tomorrow evening well i promise you i shall have spoken with mccormick by then i cant guarantee you a reversal of his position but i can be very persuasive when i must be i also promise you a lengthy dissertation on dic ive become quite an expert on the condition i feel strongly that some force other than or in addition to your prenatal supplements is at work and i swear were going to find out what it is he studied the anger and frustration in her eyes sarah you must keep your chin up through all this you have a good deal more support around this hospital than you might think including as far as i can tell dr snyder id be surprised if he had anything to do with this letter how could he not sarah asked just a few months ago he was offering me a partnership now hes as chilly and formal as can be i get the feeling that most folks around here including dr snyder would be happy if i would just dry up and blow away but youre not going to right no dr blankenship im not im not because regardless of what most people seem to be thinking i dont believe ive done anything wrongnot to those three women and not to andrew blankenship put a reassuring arm around her shoulders we are going to get to the bottom of all this he said with firm conviction we are going to find out what afflicted those women and we are going to find out who was responsible for andrew truscotts death something is going to break for us soon sarah i sense it in my gut he patted his sumo wrestlers midsection which incidentally is hardly the most sensitive part of me and meanwhile i intend to do what i can to ensure that no one in this hospital takes action against you because of what they believe might be true thank you sarah said thank you for everything okay then blankenship said ill see you tomorrow eveninghopefully with some good news from that damn board of trustees where are you headed now to give rosa suarez a call apparently shes got something she wants to talk to me about well you can report on whatever it is tomorrow night blankenship said or better still perhaps you can talk our secretive epidemiologist into coming and reporting to us herself perhaps i can sarah mused feeling more centered and determined than she had in weeks perhaps i can at that rosa what do you mean youve been taken off the investigation seated on a maple rocker by the foot of the bed in rosa suarezs room sarah stared at the older woman incredulously i told you before that my supervisor and i dont see eye to eye much of the time that study you did in san francisco precisely but your data were altered he doesnt believe that anyhow hes cited my lack of progress and the absence of any further cases of dig and hes sent me back to the library until my retirement in four months for the time being i will not be replaced on the project thats terrible sarah felt a knot of panic in her chest she had hoped believed that the impressive diligent little woman would somehow solve the mystery that was threatening her career after the things you told me i really had high hopes for some sort of breakthrough now youre leaving i just rosa suarez stopped her with a raised hand she then sat down on the edge of the bed her gaze leveled at sarah there has been a breakthrough sarah she said and i am most assuredly not leaving but i had about six weeks worth of unused sick time so as of today i am on medical leave recuperating from a slipped disk an orthopedic friend of ours who owed me a favor has kindly supplied the official documentation of my plight sarahs emotional roller coaster began another upward swing thank you she said hoarsely thank you for not giving up but i dont understand how can your department head stop the investigation if theres been a breakthrough because rosa said grinning he doesnt know about it and he wont know about it until it is airtight and backed up twice over i sense that while the us military doesnt seem to be involved here as it was in san francisco some very powerful and resourceful folks might be tell me the problem you have faced is twopronged first there have been no dic cases found that are unrelated to you and second the three dic cases from your hospital have no major risk factors in common other than your herbal supplement yes i understand that well after many dead ends i have unearthed another most significant factor that our three dic cases had in common namely sarah asked excitedly namely their weight it took no more than fifteen minutes for rosa to describe the efforts that culminated with her discovery of constanza hidalgos diary and the revelation of the girls incredible weight loss achieved with some sort of powder from a foreign mcb doctor referred to in the diary only as dr s armed with that information she explained i retraced my steps through alethea worthingtons past and finally through lisa summers it has taken a lot more time than i would have liked because aletheas family is just about nonexistent and lisa and her father have been out of the country for much of the past month but what ive learned is more than intriguing alethea once had a horrific weight problem two hundred and forty pounds one of her neighbors told me here are a couple of photocopies i made from her high school yearbook this is alethea here as you can see she was quite large do we know if she took the same diet powder as connie hidalgo sarah asked not exactly but i have been able to ascertain that her weight loss occurred about four and onehalf years agothe same approximate time as connies and the pages covering that time have been torn from her mcb chart as well and you havent told anyone about this rosa shook her head after what happened in san francisco its not even easy for me to share this information with you she said but i know how much youve suffered and although i hardly consider myself an expert on the subject of who to trust i do trust you thank you sarah said oh god thank you so much blankenship was right a break was imminent theres more rosa said as if reading her thoughts much more lisa exactly i havent spoken to her directly but i did make several visits to her boston home her housemates were most suspicious of me especially in view of the lawsuit against you but finally they came around here are some pictures they gave me of her the top few are from when she first moved into the group house the last couple are more recent she must be fifty pounds lighter in these later photos seventy actually rosa said only one of the people in the house was there four and a half years ago when she lost the weight but hes sure she did it with a powder of some sort the same time probably the same powder sarah we are not dealing with coincidence here i promise you were not did you check lisas hospital record for missing pages theres no physical evidence that pages were removed but that means nothing there are no pages from that whole year rosa this is a breakthrough do you have any idea who this dr s might be some the clues provided in constanza hidalgos diary suggested a male possibly foreign i added to that equation the time frame over which this fascinating powder was dispensed and the initial s then i checked through the records at personnel she searched through her portfolio and withdrew a spiral bound notebook assuming the parameters i chose are all correct there are three good candidates i wasnt quite certain what to do with her impression that the man was foreign she did not seem that sure the first name of the three is still on the staff at mcb the other two havent been for several years she passed the notebook over to sarah gilberto santiago md sun soon md phd pramod singh dmed ayurv sarah read no bells for any of them not even santiago what does that mean rosa asked that last mans degree probably doctor of ayurvedic medicine its an ancient indian healing system her voice fell away what is it sarah you look like youve just seen a ghost slowly sarahs eyes came up to meet hers what i may have just seen rosa is the truth i need to make a call use that phone right there if the call is long distance just use this credit card ill be long retired before anyone realizes that a woman on sick leave in atlanta made this call from boston the best sarah could do to reach annalee ettinger was to leave an urgent message with the operator at xanadu she gave rosas name rather than her own and stressed several times the importance of the situation now rosa said after sarah had hung up it seems that it is your turn for explanations sarah shared what little she knew of pramod singh and the ayurvedic herbal weight loss system she had sketched peter ettinger as fairly as she could but rosa quickly picked up on the tension the man brought to her voice he sounds to me like a textbook megalomaniac rosa observed i always knew he was prideful but i considered him very much a visionary my experience is that both are often steppingstones on the road to megalomania when the phone rang sarah reached instantly for the receiver dr rosa suarez please sarah recognized annalees rich alto annalee its sarah how are you doing hey what a nice surprise we are doing beautifully thank you the babys getting cranked up for the big plunge how much longer six seven weeks for my money tomorrow would be fine peters got two midwives from mali hovering around me all the time since ive had no problems whatsoever they spend all their time cooking and cleaning and bumping into one another annalee im so excited for you yeah peters really come through this time so whats this urgent stuff and whos rosa suarez there really is a dr suarez in fact shes right here shesshes been studying weight loss programs for the government i told her about peters program and about dr singh those two are really raking it in annalee said peters added a whole new shipping area to this place twenty or so employees just packing it up an shipping it out it seems half of america is overweight and watching latenight tv and every one of them is looking to walk the high road to slimness as peter puts it annalee do you have any idea how we can get in touch with dr singh none he comes by every few weeks with a new supply of the vitamin caps that go with each order but i almost never see him i can try asking peter without telling him its for you hes furious that your lawyer has subpoenaed him to testify tough sarah murmured listen annalee dont get yourself in any trouble over this but it would be a huge help to us to speak with dr singh ill see what i can do is that it could you send me out some of that powder you mean you dont want to pay fortynine ninetyfive by check or major credit card and allow three to six weeks for delivery sorry no cods well i think i can handle that sarah gave annalee rosas address thanked her and again begged her not to get into any conflict with her father then she sat staring out at the rich autumn afternoon rosa you really believe this weight loss powder might be connected with the dic cases she asked assuming the facts as we have them are true rosa replied it is certainly as likely a cause as your prenatal supplement it makes no sense thats because the facts as we have them are clearly not all the facts id like to see one of those infomercials you told me about ill get to work on that my lawyer has some connections in tv ill see if he can get hold of a tape of one for tomorrow nights progress meeting by the way are you coming i wasnt planning on it but now that im officially off the case i think i will especially if one of the feature attractions is that tape besides with what you told me and what i heard over the phone just now i think the stakes might have just been raised i dont understand your friend annalee took that diet powder yes yes and shes due to go into labor in just a few weeks yes i didnt even think of that with all youve had to process this past hour thats understandable besides theres time not a whole lot of time but some ill see you tomorrow evening at your lawyers office sarah hugged rosa long and lovingly and promised not to share what they had learned with anyone then she hurried down the stairs and back to mcb the roller coaster was cranking upward again and she was feeling more excited and energized than at any time in weeks alone in her room seated crosslegged on her bed rosa suarez tried to incorporate the new information with what she already knew sarah was right blaming the dic cases on the shortterm ingestion of an herbal powder years before made no real sense yet it also did not connect in any obvious way with the missing hospital chart pages scratching lines and drawing arrows on her pad rosa strained to put all of the facts in order until she felt her concentration begin to evaporate exhausted she sank down onto the pillow nothing was solid nothing it was like trying to link up puzzle pieces made of jello she wanted desperately just to close it all off and go to sleep instead she called ken mulholland in the cdc lab hey rosa hows your back he asked just hearing his voice brought a smile of all those at work only ken knew where she was and how she had gotten the time off worse every day thank goodness she said have you got anything for me yes and no i dont know what it is with you and your boss but a memo has come down that your investigation is officially closed no one in our department is to be devoting time to it my section chief followed up the notice with a visit to me he knows ive been helping you i um ive been firmly instructed you mean warned my chief really wants to be sure i fail this one im sorry ken listen dont take any chances but i really need your help and youve got it you arent the only person around here with sick time coming you know if i have to ill just get the flu and work with you up there you did say you had access to equipment not like yours but yes a whole lab complete with technician now what have you got

specimen burned out yesterday if you want us to go further were going to need more serum then well just have to find a way to get you some and ill need the name and number of your technician up there

away from the ice cream bowl lets have a big herbal weight loss greeting for coach tom bear griswold tall granite jawed and slender as a sapling coach tom griswold bounded onto the stage clapping his hands the way he might have following one of his fabled halftime harangues packed into the waiting room of matts office the viewers watched the taped infomercial in almost morbid fascination as griswold recited his life story accompanied by startling pictures of his expanding career reputation and waistline i had more money in the bank than id ever want to spend a family that loved me a great career in broadcasting and at almost three hundred pounds a life expectancy that my doctors were measuring in months at first they calmly advised me to lose weight then they got more threatening they told me that unless i did lose that weight i might as well stop buying green bananas burst of laughter well look at me now he spun around in a graceless pirouette to the accompaniment of screaming cheers from the adoring studio audience amazing glenn paris murmured in awe no america eli blankenship said the country where you cant be too rich or too thin and now johnny the coach went on before we meet the man responsible for bringing this remarkable discovery to america give us the grand total to date a huge garishly lit tote board filled the screen its blank spaces awaiting johnny normans grand announcement okay coach here we go to date the number of people around the country and around the world who have joined us on the high road to slimness and health is five hundred and seventyone thousand six hundred and nineteen exuberant applause at fortynine ninetyfive apiece attorney arnold hayden added most incredible and how long have they been marketing this stuff about six months matt said but dont forget arnold colin smith reminded from all indications this stuff really works truthfully now wouldnt you pay fifty bucks to get rid of that michelin of yoursespecially if you didnt have to knock yourself out dieting thank you johnny norman coach griswold was saying now i want to introduce you all to the man who has put years back into my life to say nothing of what he has done for my tennis game andmy beautiful wife sherry will be quick to tell youfor my love life as well a few titillated oohs followed but first lets hear a song from one of the true daughters of the ayurvedic herbal weight loss system betty wilson was a broadway star at two hundred and thirty pounds but shell be the first to tell you how much she hated looking in the mirror today shes still a star but just look at what she sees in that mirror now whistles and cheers for the singer whose bluesequined gown seemed painted on her perfectly proportioned sizesix body ladies and gentlemen singing the title song from her new broadway show miss betty wilson matt fastforwarded through the song while the others in the waiting room muttered phrases of disbelief or of grudging admiration then the coach after a syrupy ninetysecond introduction brought peter ettinger onstage to a standing ovation from the studio audience at the sight of him sarah felt the muscles of her jaws harden but even she had to admit that the man who looked and seemed larger than life in most circumstances was even more imposing on tv striding from one side of the sound stage to the other with the graceful elegance of a giraffe peter recited the meticulously documented tale of his discovery of dr pramod singh of new delhi india and the mans remarkable herbal weight loss system next came a series of testimonials from various carefully selected clients all of whom were failures on other programs their moving tributes were interwoven with a stepbystep introduction to ayurvedic medicine tracing its development over thousands of years from the earliest recorded history through various periods of abandonment and acceptance to an incredible resurgence in the s and s and finally against a backdrop that was clearly india came a taped message from pramod singh himself the secret herbs included in the ayurvedic herbal weight loss system were only part of the story he stated although to be sure a most major part use our powder properly eat in moderation avoid the five forbidden foods he advised in a musical accent and you will lose the weight you wish no matter what else you do meditate five minutes each day and follow the other basic principles of ayurveda explained in your manual and you will know many new freedoms beyond simply being thin you will know freedom of the spirit i am sorry i cannot be with you all in person but i am here supervising the harvesting of the twelve crucial natural components of our powder i look forward to seeing you all in a few weeks and now back to dr peter ettinger doctor of what matt asked switching off the tape peter ettinger has a number of degrees from a number of institutes sarah said but i honestly dont know if any of them is a phd from a traditional university you dont sound as if you like the man much colin smith said hes a pompous ass if you ask me glenn paris said sarah smiled inwardly at the notion that almost certainly peter would have chosen the exact same words to describe the hospital ceo well matt said i think we ought to get started ive already said my piece by reasserting that the account of the nightmarish night sarah and i survived in chinatown is quite factual and that rumors or no rumors body or no body andrew truscott is quite dead the police have turned up nothing new neither did a private detective i hireda very good one we havent given up trying to prove our story but were also at a loss about where to go from here any suggestions well then unless there are any questions i propose we move on so far in this business jeremy mallons been scoring all the points and we have been very much on the defensive tomorrow with the formal deposition of peter ettinger i hope that status will change before i ran the video mrs suarez gave you all some idea of what sort of things well be trying to pin him down on i hope shell go into more detail in just a bit first though id like to hear from dr snyder and dr blankenship any order will be fine sarah caught matts eye for the briefest moment he was selfassured and very much in control of the meeting how far he had come since that first session in the milsap room at mcb silently she longed for the day when she could be with him openly as his friend and loverthe day when willis grayson his anger and his lawyers would be a thing of their past suppose i go first eli randall snyder offered what i have to say wont take very long he cleared his throat ive had the american college of obgyn send letters of inquiry to the heads of every obstetrics department in the country looking for any unexplained cases of dic in pregnancy or labor so far there hasnt been one where there wasnt at least some predisposing thing going onabruptio placentae infection toxemia sickle cell disease in utero fetal demise not one i must say sarah having sent the letters and made the dozens of followup calls the lack of any dic patient who did not take your prenatal supplement remains most disturbing and if i may say so most incriminating thank you matt said coolly you may say anything you wish someone has gone to a great deal of trouble and caused a great deal of pain to make sarahs prenatal supplement appear responsible for those cases that fact more than any other suggests to me that it is not dr blankenship the chief of medicine tapped a pencil thoughtfully against his palm before picking up the sheaf of notes he had set on the floor beside his seat well he said finally my assignment was to become one of the worlds leading experts on disseminated intravascular coagulopathy it turns out that this was not nearly the humbling task it first seemed it would be i have discovered that everyone in the clotting world knows when dic occurs but absolutely nobody knows why the more common name for this condition is consumptive coagulopathy because while it is going on all of the bodys coagulation factors get consumedused up in those tiny abnormal clots in its worst form dic is almost universally fatal this fact makes the accomplishment of defendant sarah in saving the life of plaintiff lisa all the more remarkable people who have dic as badly as the plaintiff simply dont make it would i testify to that on the witness stand mr daniels you betcha i would his manner and tone which had been quite matteroffact intensified dramatically i would do anything i honestly could to help i am quite disturbed about this case and the lack of overwhelming support sarah has received from our institution we made a promise to her and to ourselves months ago when we first met that we would present a unified front and that sarah would be considered innocent until provenprovenotherwise randall glenn ive spoken with rob mccormick about this letter he sent out requesting sarahs replacement as chief ob resident next year he says hell be happy to retract it for the time being if you two are in agreement to do so eli paris said this is hardly the place or time to glenn please i dont want to start a war here or embarrass sarah but if were going to present the unified front we agreed to then weve got to get mccormick to back off yes pariss annoyance was apparent whether or not he agreed with blankenships request he was uncomfortable with being told what to do finally after a long pause during which he regained his composure he grinned and nodded right you are eli i dont know where rob got the idea to do what he did but ill call him tomorrow and set him straight excellent randall no problem snyder responded unenthusiastically in that case on with the show blankenship said theres one last category of causes of dic i thought i might mention and thats poisons the injection of the naturally occurring clotting agent thrombin can cause a dictype picture as can certain snake venoms the toxin found in at least five different species of crotalids can cause lethal dic crotalids matt asked sorry matt rattlesnakes but i dont believe the poisons you describe are effective by mouth sarah said and lisa was at home when her dic began i cant imagine she could have received an injection of any sort or been bitten by a diamondback arnold hayden guffawed no one else laughed as i said blankenship replied i only included the poison possibility for completeness there may be an oral toxin we dont know about that can cause dic maybe someone has such a substance and is on a vendetta against our hospital or the obstetrics department at this point who knows thats all we need glenn paris groaned a psycho any questions for eli matt asked okay then rosa youve kindly shared some significant developments in your work can you sum up what your conclusions are at this point earlier in the day sarah had spoken with rosa for over an hour the epidemiologist felt torn between the desperate need for all concerned to share information and ideas and her deepseated bias against disclosing research still in progress until her results were checked doublechecked and locked away she felt uncomfortable trusting anyone with the details of her work in the end nothing was really resolved between them except that rosa would attend the meeting and disclose as much data and theory as she felt comfortable in doing no more i must first stress what dr snyder has already brought up rosa began the connection whether significant or not between the three dic cases and the ingestion of sarahs prenatal supplement is quite firmly established i should add however that my laboratory work and research does not suggest a direct toxic relationship between dic and the ingestion of any herb an allergy of some sort to one of the components or perhaps contamination with a toxin would be much better bets but i have serious doubts about either of those possibilities as well as has also been mentioned discovery of a labor patient with dic who has never taken herbal prenatal vitamins would effectively absolve dr baldwin of any responsibility what do you make of this herbal weight loss product paris asked i was hoping youd be able to help us there mr paris rosa said this pramod singh what can you tell us about him not very much really six years ago when i came to mcb i made the decision to incorporate various aspects of what is called holistic medicine into our hospital i was looking for an identity for mcbsomething that would make the public want to come to us pramod singh was a highly respected ayurvedic physician who heard about what we were trying to do and contacted me i put him on salary and he worked in our outpatient department for almost two years then he just quit no notice not even a letter of explanation just a onesentence note the next time i heard about him was when i saw him on one of these dumb programs i had originally hoped singh might be part of a larger holistic department at the hospital but until our mcgrath foundation grant weve been on such thin financial ice that i couldnt guarantee anything by the way as long as im on the subject i hope youll all be my guests at the demolition of the chilton building the end of the month it will kick off the largest construction project in mcb history well be having a champagne reception just before the big bang i also hope some of you will buy chances in the raffle were running to be the one to actually push the button a onceinalifetime opportunity if i do say so myself did any of you know dr singh was using this weight loss powder when he was at mcb rosa asked pointedly ignoring pariss bombast well you might ask around do you really think this product and the dic cases are connected snyder asked remember dr snyder rosa said my stock in trade is probabilities the more times a connection happens the more likely it is to be significant now to the many other commonalities i have uncovered among our three cases we can most probably add the exposure four or five years ago to dr singh and his product but remember as mr paris just explained he purposely established a unique facility where products like singhs powder or sarahs prenatal supplement might exist so in the end our three womens choosing to be cared for at the medical center of boston may prove to be the most significant commonality of all god thats all we need paris exclaimed rosa youre not planning to speak to the press about this are you rosa smiled at the notion it was like pulling teeth for dr baldwin just to get me to speak to you at all she said im not inclined to trust any wider audience with my findings at least not yet okay everyone matt said if theres no other business well call it quits and ill finish preparing for our first offensive arnold the ettinger depositions going to be taken at eleven at mallons office youre welcome to attend i just might the lawyer responded give em hell daniels paris said one by one the mcb group filed out until only matt sarah and rosa remained i thought the session went very well matt sarah said come on we got almost no place and you know it he paced to the window his fists clenched in frustration parts of hospital charts missing chinese tongs getting paid to frame you and a helpless old man some nervous little stuttering weirdo following you somebody someplace knows what in the hell is going on around here and im getting sick and tired of it not being me i might be able to help a little bit rosa said softly what are you saying matt stopped pacing theres something i know that i havent spoken about at all ive decided to share it with you two but for now at least with no one else please dont speak of this to anyone matt glanced over at sarah you have our word he said okay lisa grayson had some sort of dna virus in her bloodstream at the time she had her crisis my lab person doesnt know exactly what it is but he does know its not usual he wants some more serum from lisa even though she has no dic symptoms sarah asked hell take what he can get if nothing grows hell look for antibodies and see if he can back his way into an identification hes very good at what he does one of the best but im afraid we cant get to lisa without going through this attorney of hers in that case maybe we should ask him before we begin to dissect ettinger matt said its very important rosa said i dont believe either the herbal weight loss powder or sarahs vitamins are solely responsible for whats happened they may both be playing a role but an infection of some sort makes more sense i have a terrible terrible feeling that unless we get to the bottom of things soon more women are going to die fifty miles to the west annalee ettinger lay on her canopied bed nestled in the arms of her fiance taylor tay she said its happening again here feel right here i swear im having some contractions chapter october there were no polite introductions no civil shaking of hands once the combatants were present and seated at the massive conference table in jeremy mallons law firm library once the stenographer had readied her machine and loosened her fingers the battle simply began with no judge present sarah wondered just how ugly it might get state your full name please matt said after dictating the time date location list of those present and the purpose of the session peter david ettinger your occupation i am an anthropologist and a healer your education i have a bachelors degree from reed college and a masters from the university of michigan both in anthropology and both with honors on the television ads for your weight loss product you are often referred to as doctor have you a degree at that level i hold an honorary doctorate in herbal sciences from the holbrook college of chiropractic and several other honorary doctorates as well do you have a phd no an md certainly not and what is your current occupation i am the executive director of the xanadu holistic health community and president of the xanadu corporation and exactly what does the xanadu corporation do we formulate and distribute the ayurvedic herbal weight loss system the key to a successful deposition matt had explained to sarah was the same as that for a successful courtroom crossexaminationnever ask a question to which you do not already know the answer unfortunately he was quick to add the only significant questions he would be asking peter ettinger today were those to which they had no answer sarah stared down at her hands folded tightly on the table in front of her she hoped peter could not tell how tightly when she had first returned to boston she had actually entertained notions of reestablishing some sort of professional or platonic relationship with the man now she could barely stand to look at him she had never done anything more virulent than to move her life along in directions that did not include him no public condemnations no nasty letters no tellall articles no demands for palimony yet here he was helping to orchestrate a legal case against her that could well put her in professional purgatory if not in prison you mentioned you were a healer mr ettingeroh excuse me do you prefer to be addressed as mister or doctor either way mister will be fine dont badger this man counselor jeremy mallon warned matteroffactly either in your words or your tone you do and this deposition may be over a lot sooner than you expect mr mallon please dont threaten me matt countered it seemed to sarah he was purposely exaggerating his mississippi drawl you saddled this mule months ago in the shop of a sick old man now you and your stable of experts had better be ready to ride it yourselves in the corner of the room the stenographer dispassionately whispered into the hooded microphone of a tape recorder at the same time she was tapping out the exchange on her machine arnold hayden seated to matts right nodded that matts response was appropriate and necessary across from hayden jeremy mallons associate countered by whispering something in mallons ear sarah managed a furtive glance across at peter but saw only an emotionless mask circles within circles within circles the whole affair would have been incredibly fascinating to her had not her livelihood and way of life been at stake the morning had begun contentiously an hour before the actual deposition mallon flatly refused to allow his client lisa grayson to have her blood drawn or in fact to be contacted by matt sarah rosa suarez or anyone else who did not clear such contact with him matt had kept his cool and had stopped short of indicting the ayurvedic herbal weight loss system but it was clear to sarah that before this session was through peters remarkable gold mine would come under attack arnold hayden had been with them from the outset of the day sarah was pleasantly surprised to realize that her initial impression of the man as being far more legal form than substance was way off base he had a practical and theoretical acumen that matt clearly found useful and a calming manner that helped keep her inside her skin now in combat his presence and bearing seemed to add credibility and force to matts examination there was also the matter of haydens helping out should matts compromised objectivity become manifest in any way unwilling to give up either sarah or her case matt had asked for his assistance with that in mind and although he had not spelled out to hayden the extent of his and sarahs evolving relationship she suspected the hospital attorney had some idea okay now mr ettinger matt said getting back to the issue at hand would you mind telling us your definition of what a healer is for almost an hour and a half matt asked rephrased and asked again questions designed more to fill in blanks and set tone than to get at any major legal point the strategy he sarah and hayden had agreed upon was to try to get peter to acknowledge that sarahs method of prescribing and dispensing herbs was in fact no different from his own once made the point would essentially transform peter into an expert witness for them they would then begin to dissect the connection between ettinger the xanadu ayurvedic weight loss system and pramod singh when i get to that point matt said im just going to wing it he dangled his egyptian amulet i mean what chance does he have against two thousand years of black magic at the ninetyminute mark they took a break during which mallon had one of his secretaries serve coffee hey matt maybe you should switch cups with jeremy sarah whispered theres no telling what he might have put in yours nonsense matt drawled hes about as intimidated by me as a hungry mountain lion would be by the easter bunny the last thing hed want to do at this point is to bump me off im too much fun to play with but right about now im going to start tightening the screws on his expert the measure of how effective i am will be how loudly and how often mallon objects to my questions arnold do you have any suggestions none really hayden said except that i think its time to pin down some things about this dr singh so far im impressed by the way youve handled matters thanks thats kind of you to sayespecially considering that i havent done any damage whatsoever what youve been throwing are body blows the older lawyer replied no one really pays much attention to them but they set up the head shots youre doing just fine he patted matt encouragingly on the shoulder as the session resumed okay mr ettinger matt began id like to spend some time talking about this ayurvedic herbal weight loss system of yours why mallon asked youre the one who brought this man in as an expert matt said im just trying to document his qualifications peter i dont see where this line of questioning is relevant if you dont care to answer the questions i dont see any reason why you should offhand i can think of two reasons mr ettinger matt said with calm force first of all if you refuse i promise you that ill be in front of a judge before this day is done bringing a motion to compel you to answer and secondhe looked first at sarah and then at mallon before deliberately leveling his gaze again on petersecond i have good reason to believehell no i have proofthat just as lisa grayson took sarah baldwins herbal preparation before her illfated delivery so did she take your herbal weight loss product as well but i said proof wait mallon snapped peter hold it dont respond mr daniels i dont intend to bite at that worm but since what you are alleging is news to me i would like to speak with mr ettinger in private before we continue take your time matt said arnold hayden turned his face away from mallon and brought his fist up to the side of his jaw matts timing and delivery had been perfect his first head shot had landed squarely sarah watched as her former lover unfolded his reedy sixandahalffoot frame he glanced over at her his expression pinched and angry for a moment it seemed as if he was about to make an obscene gesture grow up she mouthed she was gratefully uncertain of his reply okay mallon said upon their return not only do i approve of mr ettingers answering this line of questions i encourage it his expression was smug his manner once again selfassuredtoo selfassured sarah strained to understand why mr ettinger how did you first meet pramod singh matt went on we had done a series of seminars together some years ago when he was on the staff of the medical center of boston he told me about a set of ancient ayurvedic dietary rules and herbs that he had been using on his patients for weight loss with remarkable success was lisa summer one of those patients i dont know constanza hidalgo i dont stop peter mallon snapped mr daniels stick to the issue and the patient at hand mr ettinger did pramod singh want to market his product to the general public he did with you as the spokesmanthe figurehead among other things and so you two ayurvedic entrepreneurs struck up a deal of some sort object to the antagonistic form of the question mallon cut in dont answer it peter mr ettinger exactly what is in this product of yours a number of herbs plants and roots twelve to be exact dr singh obtains them in india and elsewhere in the far east and ships them to me we have a production facility where the naturally occurring substances are combined with a protein powder to form a combination balanced nutritional replacement and appetite suppressant but you have no scientific verification of the products composition do you ettinger glanced over at jeremy mallon when he turned back to matt he was grinning confidently as a matter of fact he said unlike dr baldwins preparation we have absolute scientific verificationfda analysis and approval of the product i demanded those before ever allowing the xanadu name to be used and we insist upon retesting on an ongoing basis another head shot but this time from the plaintiffs side of the table matt fussed with his notes sarah could feel him struggling to maintain composure as he searched carefully for the next question this production and packaging facility he asked finally is it out there on the grounds of the xanadu community it is shipping too in a separate building but yes shipping is done at xanadu also mr ettinger just how much money are you two raking in off this powder objection mallon cried out peter dont answer mr daniels the form and content of that question are amateurishin the baseball terms you might better understand strictly bush league until now i have made a number of allowances for the fact that aside from a misplaced molar or whatever this is your first malpractice case but i draw the line at questions like this crimson rushed to matts cheeks beneath the table sarah patted him gently on the thigh easy does it she whispered matt calmed himself with a slow deep breath mr ettinger go over briefly what happens at this production plant of yours its quite simple really ettinger said as if he were speaking to a third grader the raw plants and roots come in get thoroughly washed inspected and sterilized by heat or uv light next theyre ground or pulverized proportioned out according to the ancient ayurvedic menu were using and combined with the commercially prepared protein base finally the mixture is sterilized again and packaged and then just like that its shipped the final shipped product includes four months worth of powder a manual on ayurveda and ayurvedic dietary principles and a supply of vitamins vitamins matt visibly perked up at the word yes herbal vitamins like dr baldwins again peter grinned smugly hardly his delivery was pure vinegar dr baldwins supplements are well dr baldwins ours are pure vitaminsstandard fdaapproved multivitamins manufactured for us by huron pharmaceuticals matts eagerness deflated pills he asked actually theyre gelatin capsules one is dissolved in each daily weight loss shake jeremy mallon feigned a yawn mr daniels please he said your fishing expedition has run aground and you know it mr ettinger has been much more patient with you than need be certainly more tolerant than i would have been in his position mr ettinger are you and dr singh partners matt asked ignoring mallons protest we are how would i go about locating this man this ayurvedic herbal partner of yours enough mallon barked thats okay ettinger said the truth is pramod spends most of his time in india now and mostly hes traveling i reach him through an american express office in new delhi if you want that address ill be happy to have my secretary send it to you now enough mallon said find another line of questioning or its over and out actually im done but i have something to say to both you and mr ettinger strictly off the record evelyn were finished thank you mallon chatted in whispers with his associate until the stenographer had cleared out okay go ahead he said then even though we havent mentioned them and i intend to see that they are not part of this case we all know with certainty that two other women beside lisa grayson have had this dic so i said before that we had proof that lisa grayson was treated by dr singh some years ago with what i assume was the ayurvedic herbal weight loss system well we also have proof that the other two dic cases lost large amounts of weight with him as well what ettinger exclaimed anticipating matts revelation sarah had her attention fixed on the man across the table from her his surprise seemed genuine however she reminded herself she had misread peter ettinger before easy peter mallon said this mans been playing losing cards all morning i see this as just a bluff to rattle us its no bluff sarah said i want to see your socalled proof mallon said and we want to see a blood sample from lisa grayson sarah countered angrily thats it were done mallon declared he threw his papers into his briefcase and as much as pulled peter ettinger to his feet and toward the door this is no game matt said this is peoples lives dont you care fuck you replied mallon peter sarah tried this is very important remember annalee took your powder too but she didnt take those bogus herbs of yours you just stay away from her and shell do just fine his vitriol nearly brought her hurtling over the table and into his face peter she said sweetly instead yes dont tell me what to do chapter october autumn on long island was profoundly beautiful dressed in an aqua running suit lisa grayson loped through a tunnel of shimmering foliage up the milelong hill of kennesaw road and onto the flat gravelly stretch that led back to stony hill she was perspiring but not excessively soespecially considering that when she reached home she would have completed her first halfmarathon ever fantastic she thought thirteen miles by a woman who not too long ago considered a brisk walk to the corner convenience store to be her physical limit too darn much too darn much she sang the words nurseryrhyme style in sync with her strides the boston marathon was in midapril and she might well be ready her physical therapist knew the organizers of the race if lisa could do the twentysix plus miles in anything under four and a half hours he would see to it that the documented marathon time necessary to receive an official entry and number was waived see how she runs see how she runs some sweat dripped from her forehead into her eyes slowing just a little lisa reached her right hand into her jacket pocket fist she thought intently fist the otto boch myoelectric hand was truly incredible but it had no sensory input she had to rely on other messages to tell her the prosthesis was doing what she wanted it to first she sensed the nowfamiliar tension around her elbow the electrodes had been implanted there in what remained of her forearm flexor muscles next she felt the firmness of the closed fist pressing against her side from within the jacket pocket come on fake hand she said panting in cadence do your stuff she pulled her arm free of the pocket and sensed without looking that the lifelike fingers were clutching her balledup handkerchief way to go hand she said mopping her brow without breaking stride way to go over the two months since receiving the limb she had made remarkable progress in time she had been promised by the physical therapist and the prostheticist she would be able to pick up a cigarette ash without having it crumble she would also be able to latch onto an object and dare anyoneanyoneto pull it away from her the bionic woman there were limits to be sure she had chosen the less obtrusive cosmetic skin over the more functional and more easily maintained metal pincers in general though the hand far exceeded her projections of what being an amputee would be like and focusing on learning to use it had done worlds for her depression she still missed her baby terribly and thought many times each day about how life would have been with him but she also knew that somehow all she had been through had become a passage for her in facing her tragedy in working to overcome the pain and grief she was growing up in areas that had not changed since the day she ran away from home and then of course there was her father the transformation in willis grayson over the months since her return to stony hill was if anything even more striking than her own he was mellower than she could ever rememberfar less controlling and more willing to listen and he went out of his way to spend time with her she had never really believed the man was capable of change but change he had she passed over the onelane bridge at the base of the long dirt and gravel drive leading up to the house the videomonitored security gate was closed but the narrow passthrough alongside it was not fourtenths of a mile to go the muscles in her legs were beginning to tighten up but she could make it she knew she could miss grayson a mans voice called out from behind her lisa stopped and turned still running in place a young man in a gray uniform and hat stepped from behind a tree he carried a federal express envelope beneath his arm meet me at the house she said with a pant keeping her distance and wondering where his truck was i want to finish this run i cant he said urgently im being paid to give this to you personally this is the third day ive tried to meet up with you your fathers security patrol will hurt me if they catch me again and theyll be back here again any minute weve got to hurry bewildered lisa glanced at her watch debated and then stopped running okay what is it she asked still keeping a good twenty yards between her and the man i dont know im being paid to find a way to deliver this to you thats all please i hear a car now set it down right there she ordered and then get away the young man hesitated and then placed the envelope on the grass by the road dont let them take this from you he said then he whirled and sprinted off through the still morning air lisa could in fact hear a car approaching from the direction of the house she snatched up the envelope and dashed back down the road until she found a copse dense enough to conceal her hidden there gasping for air she watched two of her fathers security people cruise slowly past by the time the motor noise had faded she had recovered enough to tear open the federal express envelope the enclosed unembossed white envelope had her name written on the outside in a meticulous womans hand the note within was typed dear lisa the man who delivered this is not with federal express i hired him in hopes that he might find a way to get this letter to you my name is rosa suarez perhaps you remember me i am the epidemiologist assigned by the centers for disease control to study the three cases of dic at the medical center of boston i need your help but have been unable to reach you by phone or mail after leaving several phone messages for you i called to find that your home phone number has been changed and that the new number is unavailableat least to me two certified letters from me were reported as delivered and signed for by you it is possible you received them but i have my doubts i do not believe your lawyer or your father want you to hear what i have to sayand what i must ask of you mr daniels yes phelps here roger phelps im glad i caught you in im not matt thought the claims adjuster for the mmpo may have been responsible for assigning him to sarahs case but there was something about the little mansomething in his speech perhaps or in his eyesthat made matt uncomfortable yes mr phelps what can i do for you matts desk was piled high with research volumes law tomes and xeroxed hospital records in the next two weeks he would be taking depositions from two of mallons expert witnesses as well as from lisa grayson herself on the plaintiffs side mallon would be getting a crack at sarah and at kwong tianwen there had been no feedback from the man following the intense ending to peter ettingers deposition not one word matt had half hoped that his opponent might at least suggest putting things on hold until the allegations about ettingers weight loss product could be evaluated but nothing it appeared that regardless of what facts and revelations cropped up mallon was not intimidated mr daniels phelps said first of all i want to thank you for keeping me abreast of the developments in the baldwin case its made it a good deal easier for us to evaluate things and come up with a decision of how to proceed decision yes mr daniels after carefully weighing all the aspects and prospects of this case weve decided to settle what youve done an excellent job and i can assure you that in the future youll be called upon many mr phelps excuse me but i dont understand dont understand what mr daniels we looked at the costs of continuing the potential magnitude of a jury award and the possibility of losing then we made the decision to try to settle came up with a figure presented it to mallon and on behalf of his client he accepted of course the settlement will include no admission of any guilt on dr baldwins part matt stared in disbelief at the phone mr phelps he said as evenly as he could manage sarah baldwin is not guilty of any malpractice there have been developmentssignificant developments we are going to win the case ah the chinese tong story im sorry mr daniels but we considered that too as things stand all a jury has to listen to is that poor old man and how much did you settle for mr daniels theres no need to get testy about this how much two hundred thousand and willis grayson accepted that apparently mr phelps willis grayson keeps that kind of money in his cookie jar he wanted dr baldwin behind bars her hide thats what hes after why in the hell would he agree to settle if he thought they had a case mr daniels please i did not call to start an argument the decision has been made and the other two women what happens when their families get wind of this well deal with that when it happens now if you have no further questions dr baldwin can refuse to drop the case she would then be personally responsible for all legal fees and any jury award why on earth would she want to do that because shes innocent thats why dammit mr daniels i know about your relationship with dr baldwin if you talk her into continuing with this case and collect any legal fees at all i would consider that a serious breach of ethics what do you know about legal ethics im an attorney and a member of the bar sir thats what now i hope i have made our position clear as far as the mutual medical protective organization is concerned this case is closed over her twentythree years as a government epidemiologist rosa had met cabinet secretaries governors and two vice presidents she had faced up to a boss who wanted to crucify her and stared down the barrel of the congressional subcommittee investigating her bart allegations but never had she felt quite as intimidated measured her words quite as carefully as tonight with willis grayson the wng corporation helicopter had picked her up on the roof of the surgical building of the medical center of boston and had then made one gratuitous sweep over the glittering downtown area before heading southwest toward long island the aircraft was more opulent and far quieter than rosa had imagined it would be the pilot and a second man were separated from the rear cabin by a glass slider that was essentially soundproof the only other passenger in the plush compartment beside rosa was grayson his chilly manner and persistent glower made it quite clear that flying her from boston to new york and back merely to draw his daughters blood was not his idea he had nodded a greeting to her as his man assisted her into the cabin and then had motioned for her to fasten her seat belt but they were over providence before he actually spoke to her i dont understand why you insisted on drawing lisas blood yourself when we have any number of people who could have done it he said after some small talk in situations that are critical to my work i have learned that nothing can be completely trusted unless i have done it myself graysons smile was ironic that understanding puts you well ahead of ninety percent of my executives you dont seem very comfortable are you afraid of flying no of me she shrugged youre very wealthy and very powerful and not at all a reassuring person im not accustomed to being told what to do mrs suarez now because of your letter and that stunt with that bogus federal express man my daughter is issuing me orders like a fivestar general i have no choice but to do what she asks or i risk losing her again mr grayson your actions left me no choice you signed for mail addressed to lisa you had your phone number changed to keep me from reaching her well now i have given you the new number as well as my promise to cooperate with you in any way you ask im sure lisa appreciates the significance of those actions i hope so do you have children mrs suarez three daughters if someone hurt one of those girls you would punish them if you could yes i would do what i could through legal channels to see they were appropriately punished if thats what you mean sometimes my methods are more direct grayson said today my attorney called and recommended that i accept an offer from the insurance company to settle our case against dr baldwin without a finding in view of the revelations regarding lisa and this diet product my lawyer feels we might not be able to convince a jury of dr baldwins guilt i however remain convinced she is responsible for the maiming of my daughter and the death of my grandson you are certainly entitled to that opinion sir my daughter is not as certain as i am based on what we know to this point i dont believe she should beor you either for that matter mrs suarez exactly what do you know it was rosas turn to smile she gazed down at the lights gliding past two thousand feet below mr grayson she said i have learned from bitter experience that it is unwise to discuss the findings of an ongoing investigation with anyone unless it is absolutely unavoidable ah yes your debacle in san francisco rosa spun to face him you sir are exactly the sort of person from whom i have learned to protect myself i dont like being checked up on mr grayson the mere fact of your doing so could already have jeopardized my work i assure you my people excel at keeping their inquiries discreet theyve had a good deal of practice im sure they have well if they are that good you must understand me well enough to know that there is no point in pursuing this discussion what i know is that your department chief would be upset to learn you had recovered from your ruptured disk so miraculously but had neglected to inform him rosa glared at him her cheeks burning mr grayson she said i can see that your reputation has been earned well sir if you want to bring the force of your massive corporate empire crashing down on the head of a sixtyyearold lady go right ahead i assure you there is precious little trouble you could cause me that others have not already but just remember there are some problems i can cause you as well willis grayson studied her for a time then suddenly he laughed roundly reached across and patted her on the arm perhaps mrs suarez he said after you complete this investigation and retire from government service youll consider coming to work for me chapter october it was eightfifteen in the morning when sarah maneuvered the borrowed maroon accord into one of the outbound lanes and inched down into the william callahan tunnel ovejas rosa said gesturing at the grimfaced drivers jockeying for their spots in the procession sheep its especially impressive considering the rushhour traffic is coming the other way sarah said she and rosa were heading to logan airport to pick up ken mulholland the cdc virologist who had been working on lisa graysons serum had come up with something but the pressure had intensified on him to turn over any information on the boston cases to rosa suarezs department head and not to assist her in any further way there are just too many egos involved rosa had explained my chief will go to his grave believing that i ruined his career i honestly feel he would rather see this mystery go unsolved than to have me come up with the answer ken is pretty immune to being squeezed by his superiors but i really dont want him to get in any trouble he has a wife and two little ones depending on him thats why i begged him to let us do as much of the work as possible up here he was involved in a portion of the bart investigation with me some of the culture reports that were altered came from his department since then hes had as little trust for the politics of the place as i do so hes taking a personal day off to fly up to boston hes arranged things with a friend at a terminal someplace in atlanta theyll plug in by modem to the data banks and electronics in his lab ken will be working on his departments computers but hell be doing it in absentia twice removed and all he wants from us is an empty room with an ibm compatible terminal and a modem in that case were all set sarah said glenn paris has provided us an office in the data processing unit no questions asked no questions asked rosa do you think this is something significant i have believed all along that infection of some sort was the most likelythough certainly not the onlyexplanation for the dic cases so yes i believe this day could prove most interesting and eventful the week just past had been most eventful as well it began with the surprise decision by claims adjuster roger phelps of the mutual medical protective organization to settle sarahs case then there was rosas flight to long island to draw lisa graysons blood and finally just a day ago there was the letter from sarah to phelpsformal notification that she had opted to reject the mmpos noguiltadmitted settlement she would either have the case against her dropped entirely or go to trial at her own expense there would be no settlement sarah swung onto the exit ramp leading out to the airport the earlymorning overcast was beginning to burn off the day with temperatures predicted in the sixties promised to be near perfect sarah had some clinic responsibilities and some library work she needed to do but she had no surgery scheduled and planned to spend as much time as possible with rosa and her virologist five whole minutes to spare sarah said pulling up in front of the delta terminal departure level ill wait here i dont imagine hell have to go through baggage claim i should think not hes booked on the threefifty flight back to atlanta rosa hurried into the terminal she emerged a short time later arm in arm with a cheery ruddycheeked fellow who was taller than average by any measure but positively gargantuan next to her he had a curved meerschaum pipe bobbing from the corner of his mouth and looked more like the burgermeister of some bavarian village than a scientist by the time they had passed through the sumner tunnel and back into the city though sarah knew why rosa spoke of ken mulhollands dedication with admiration that bordered on awe there aint much of our little viral friend in your ladys blood mulholland said with something of a midwestern twang but hes there alive and kicking for now until weve got something a bit more scientific were calling him george although we could just as easily have made him a georgia the first evidence we got was indirectan antiviral antibody that didnt match any of the ones we know about now we have some actual electron microscope pictures of the little guy handsome a veritable matinee idol might be in the adenovirus class were going to be working today on completing the chemical dissection of his dna but as far as weve gone hes a perfect match with the dna sequence from the previous sample you sent us from lisa grayson how much time before we get to your hospital dr baldwin ten minutes less actually listen though im afraid that when im being addressed by someone to whom i already owe a great deal of gratitude ill have to insist on sarah well then sarahand you too rosasupposing i use the drive time we have left to give you both a little background of what were up against and what were going to try to do today im glad i decided to conduct this business up here itll be much easier for me to operate without looking over my shoulder every other minute ive disconnected the screen on the terminal in our lab the modems hidden beneath a pile of papers my department heador yours rosacould be standing three feet away and hed have no idea that datas pouring out of the place thank you for going to all this trouble sarah said just being cautious this woman heres a star its time some people down there besides me know it now then theres no question your miss grayson has a lowgrade viral infection of some sort and not a commonly known virus rosa asked mulholland shook his head hardly were going to finish mapping out georges dna as soon as we get your computer booted up but even at this point i can say that whatever george is he aint in the books ive checked he could still be something natural that we just dont know about yet but i doubt that a much better bet is something manmade with luck well know for certain by lunchtime then what sarah asked well assuming we finish our dna sequencing and still suspect george is a product of man rather than a production of god i think it will be time for a crash legal course on diamond versus chakrabarty whats that all about the virologist nodded respectfully toward rosa suarez well he said its about these hungry little bacterial beasties that eat oil slicks i suspect that when we get to that point dr rosa here will tell you all about it since shes the one responsible for introducing it to our unit before we can do anything with diamond versus chakrabarty though we have to get a more detailed biochemical picture of george sarah pulled up to the security gate at the mcb campus were just going in to drop some things off joe she lied well be out in half an hour probably less finding parking within the enclosed campus was never any great problem but getting past the security guard often demanded inspired guile and panache this morning sarah had both she found an empty slot directly behind the thayer building welcome to the medical center of boston dr mulholland she said on the far side of the campus workmen were setting up barriers around the antiquated decaying chilton building is that the building theyre going to blow up rosa asked blow down from what i understand sarah said an implosion next saturday the hospital press release said that the expert doing the demolition is the best in the world he claims there wont be so much as a brick outside of the barriers should be quite a show mulholland said almost everything that happens around here is quite a show glenn paris the president of the hospital whos providing your computer today is the one primarily responsible for that atmosphere this time hes actually having grandstands put up hes also raising money by raffling off the chance to be the one who actually presses the button i bought five chances myself sounds exciting rosa said well if im still around here perhaps ill join you by noon they were getting close to identifying the manmade recombinant dna virus that ken mulholland had named george with the exception of a fiveminute break to stretch and plod to the mens room the virologist had not moved from in front of the screen seated to his right equally immersed in the evolving puzzle rosa suarez determined various probabilities with a calculator and took notes on a yellow legal pad sarah feeling at times like a fifth wheel came and went seeing her patients in the clinic and trying to do some reading for an article she was writing she returned to the small office each time with coffee or coke and danishalways politely refused by rosa and inevitably wolfed down by mulholland who seldom took his eyes off the screen to see what he was eating he was younger than rosa by two decades or so but it was clear the two of them delighted in working with one another three hundred iq points between them sarah estimated probably more she felt a spark of anger at those who had the audacity arrogance and selfserving immorality to have tampered with their bart investigation results okay mulholland said still transfixed on the screen this is the next sequence at at cg at at adenine and thymine cg cytosine and guanine the paired deoxyribose bases that were the building blocks of life from medical school courses sarah knew the rudiments of dna structure function and replication but these two working with mulhollands biochemist in atlanta were operating in the stratosphere of the subject at the atlanta end of the modem connection the chemista woman named mollyhad used specific enzymes to chop the viral dna into small segments those segments had been identified and now were being sequenced by computer to recreate the complex threedimensional dna double helix that was in essence the virus mulholland and rosa were pausing with each new set of data to extend the model they were building on the screen and to compare it to an extensive library of knowns sarah watched ken mulholland down a pastrami sandwich as he recited the latest sequence of phosphates and deoxyribose units to rosa thats all she wrote ken what you have is what george is im finished and famished good luck molly the message appeared on the screen and was followed by a gary larson far side cartoon in which two geeky scientists peering intently into their microscopes were themselves beneath someones huge microscope lens rosa took a turn at the keyboard running the final piece of structural information against the library of known viruses in just a few minutes she shook her head not here she said rubbing his eyes mulholland swung his chair around to sarah george is some sort of adenovirus but hes had parts added he said hes bioengineered rosa said no es de dios not of god the questions now to be answered are by whom and does george have anything to do with dic diamond versus sarah was going to attempt the other name in the case but mulholland spared her the effort chakrabarty he said rosa do you want to explain no no you go ahead please shes too modest mulholland said okay d versus c is the landmark case for patenting new life forms ananda chakrabarty was a microbiologist working for general electric back in the early seventies he genetically altered the naturally occurring bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa the resultant bioengineered germ could digest a number of the hydrocarbons found in crude oil breaking chemical bonds and in effect turning a disastrous slick into fish food the discovery was potentially worth hundreds of millions but the us patent office refused to allow him to patent the beastie in the us supreme court reversed the decision saying in effect that there was no difference between building a better mousetrap and building a better mutant how does that help us now sarah asked well it might not help us at all mulholland responded but then again it might thats where rosa here came in with bioengineering companies popping up from sea to shining sea like corks the possibility of an outbreak of disease caused by a new life form seemed more than possible the andromeda strain in the novel was from outer space in truth we no longer have to go nearly that far for trouble so rosa made a deal with the us patent office to share their data with us whenever a new life form is patented we get a description by law rosa explained the patent description must be detailed enough so that the life form could be identified and reproduced by an expert in the field now a majority of genetic engineering firms cooperate with us directly by submitting descriptions of their new microbes and often even their work in progress for inclusion in our data banks amazing sarah said so now you can tap into your data banks in atlanta and see if you can come up with a match do you have that many new life forms on file you dont want to know how many mulholland said do you want to take a break before you start that process sarah asked we should allow at least an hour to get you back to the airport in that case ill have lunch on the plane the virologist said or have i already had it no matter this part shouldnt take too long thanks to the miracle of how much money we convinced uncle sam to spend on our mainframe rosa why dont you do the honors seria mi placer rosa replied what well do sarah is start with the largest commonality in this case the type of virus initially used she typed adenovirus onto the screen and entered it then we work our way down if we get a no match at any point the game is over the truth is the computer could probably do the whole process itself but i like the adventure she likes the adventure mulholland echoed reverently piece by piece rosa entered georges dna sequence and asked the atlanta mainframe to search for a match sarah was astounded at how many recombinant viruses there were and the field of genetic engineering is only in its infancy rapidly though the number of matches to their virus got smaller and smaller okay rosa said this next piece of data should separate the man from the boys she entered another of georges sequences and a second or so later no match appeared on the screen damn rosa whispered the word was barely spoken when the screen flashed another message typo suspected check for data entry error or repeat inquiry well have to find that programmer and give her a raise mulholland said i never could type rosa muttered studying her notes then again entering the sequence next time i will let the computer do it in just seconds data began to appear on the screen unknown matched to access number acx probability of confluence please type access number and your security code to continue bingo rosa said she did as the mainframe requested and almost instantly george had a new name and a home crv bivir corporation new park cambridge ma us patent rdv adenovirus spliced with thrombin thromboplastin producing genes potential application rapid wound healing hemostasis no further information available rosa turned to sarah the epidemiologists expression was at once triumphant and grim thrombin she said unless i am mistaken it is also factor two in the biological cascade of blood clotting and thromboplastin is a clotting factor too sarah said excitedly rosa this is it i just know it is rosa was already dialing the biovir number well that was easy enough she said after a brief conversation i have an appointment tomorrow morning at ten with dr dimitri athanoulos president of the biovir corporation i wish i could go with you sarah said but i have a case and im on call fortunately i have no such obligations mulholland said my wife and kids could use a little vacation from me and i wouldnt miss this for the world does that landlady of yours have any spare rooms if she doesnt rosa said with a wink i have a double bed chapter black cat daniels was treading on thin professional ice and he knew it sarah had rejected the decision by mmpo claims adjuster roger phelps to settle her case all charges against her would be dropped she insisted and no settlement paid or she would go to trial at her own expense and despite the love relationship that was deepening each day between him and his client matt had chosen to continue representing her the truth was he admitted now he wished it was over deep down he wished she had simply said pay the man pay the man the two hundred thousand and close the book i want to spend some time getting to know this lover of mine without having this suit hanging over our heads the plastic fortunetelling eightball on his desk doubled as a paperweight it was a gift from harry several fathers days ago matt knew in the most sensible practical parts of his intellect that it was a toymolded plastic filled with water enclosing a floating octahedron or whatever it had been manufactured and sold for decades now by the millions and certainly this particular one had no more predictive ability than any of the others are we going to win this thing he asked hefting the eightball in his hand if anyone knew the number of major life decisions he had made after consulting the plastic sphere he would probably be disbarred he thought ask again later the ball replied as expected roger phelps was furious that despite his offer to settle sarah had elected to continue fighting the malpractice suit against her her obstinacy matt knew left doubt at the mmpo about the phelps had instructed them to give away that doubt would linger for however many monthsor yearsit took for the case to come to trial then if sarah lost for a big jury reward phelps would be hero for a day but if she won phelps would have approximately worth of egg on his face even for someone without phelpss arrogance that was the fixins for a big league omelette but matt also knew that he had no less at stake in this game than phelps for starters he would have to bill sarah to maintain appearances should his motives and ethics be called into question a loss in court and he could be accused of convincing sarah to continue the case in order to keep his billable hours going as well a win and the best he personally could hope to come away with was some positive publicity to all intents he had earned his last dollar from grayson v baldwin and in addition matt knew that lose or win he had also seen his last malpractice case from the mmpo by far the largest medical liability carrier in the state thanks to phelpss insistence on settling what had started as a huge break for him with unlimited potential was now doomed he snatched up his glove and ball and began to pace with his credit cards maxed out and much of his time to be spent on sarahs case flying harry east for thanksgiving or christmas was going to be the longest financial stretch yet left alone he quite possibly could have won sarahs case while he continued to have a decent income for his work why in the hell couldnt phelps have just let him be his fees to defend sarah would have stayed well below and bit by bit mallons case was beginning to crumble why hadnt phelps been able to see that something wasnt right about this whole business he began to think something he already knew but simply could not put a finger on how could phelps not believe that the families of alethea worthington and constanza hidalgo would go after similar settlements it stood to reason they would the cost of his move wasnt it was with the case matt was beginning to build and with the possibilities raised by rosa suarezs discoveries a giveaway was a hell of a vote of no confidence something wasnt right for five minutes he paced snapping the old ball into his mitt the source of his concern remained vaguea hazy mist swirling in his mind he thought about peter ettingers deposition he had spent much of the daymost of the past week in factreading and rereading the twoinchthick document much of it he knew by heart perhaps what was troubling him wasnt roger phelps but something ettinger had said something the pops of ball against leather were like rifle shots now beneath the paperthin pocket of the glove matts palm was beginning to sting his problemsolving ritual was threatening to break a bone in his hand but stopping wasnt an option black cat daniels never gave up on a ritual until it absolutely let him down he had to stuff a sponge in there as he did when playing catch with ricky and the boys or better still he thought he might get a grip on himself and snap the ball in a bit more gently what was bothering him so some strange wording in one of ettingers answers some odd reference something the intercom from the waiting room crackled on mr daniels ruth said im leaving now you do remember i said i had to leave early i dont remember no ruth but thats okay im sure you told me have a good time ruth was another problem he would have to face he thought she had been with him since day one and he did feel loyal to her but she had made no effort to curb her chattering to clients about anything and everything the feedback from several of them was downright embarrassing besides the way things were going it might be coming down to her paycheck versus a plane ticket for harry damn you phelps mr daniels what do you mean have a good time i told you i had a dentists appointment no one has a good time at the ruth thats it what the dentist thats it thats what was eating at me put yourself in for a raise on second thought better make that an extra day off the secretary muttered a bewildered thanks but matt did not hear her he had dropped his glove and ball on a chair and was skimming through the deposition once again but this time it wasnt a response by peter ettinger for which he was searching it was something said by jeremy mallon it took about twenty minutes but he found it he knew he would d shipping too e in a separate building but yes shipping is done at xanadu also d mr ettinger just how much money are you two raking in off this powder m objection peter dont answer mr daniels the form and content of that question are amateurish in the baseball terms you might better understand strictly bush league until now i have made a number of allowances for the fact that aside from a misplaced molar or whatever this is your first malpractice case matt took a yellow marker from his desk and highlighted mallons words how could his opponent have known about his only other malpractice case there was one answer to that question that made sensebut only one matt snatched up the phone and dialed the mutual medical protective organization mr phelps please attorney matt daniels here phelps listen ive spoken with sarah baldwin and i think shes willing to reverse her position on this settlement thing how about you and me meeting to talk out the details first thing tomorrow eight oclock my office perfect roger thats great itll be a relief to finally get some of this business cleared up he set the receiver back in its cradle and then added beginning with why in the hell you hired me in the first place matt hefted the plastic eightball once again am i the turkey of the decade for not seeing what they were doing to me he asked out loud the answer is most definitely yes crv in lisa graysons bloodstream at the time of her dic and three and a half months later seated at the nurses station on the obstetrics floor sarah scratched out the characters crv on a progress notepad crva manmade virus constructed years before by a lab in cambridge she had rounds to make and a number of notes to write but the remarkable discovery of the virus was making it next to impossible to concentrate as had been the case for months now most of the nurses were keeping their physical and emotional distance from her sarah was quite conscious of their coolness she always was but this afternoon it did not affect her as much as usual the pieces were finally coming together the end of the nightmare was drawing closer crvcreated to speed the clotting of blood how could infection with such a microbe not be somehow responsible for lisas dic dr baldwin the nurse speaking to her joanne delbanco was about sarahs age at one time they had gotten along quite well and had even gone out once for dinner now there was never any extraneous conversation between them another casualty of crv oh hi joanne sarah said with exaggerated cheer dr baldwin you have a visitor a woman shes very anxious to see you and shes very upset i put her in your call room she wont tell me what the problem is thankthe nurse turned and headed offyou the obstetricians oncall room was at the far end of the hallway as she hurried there sarah ticked through a quick mental list of women who might be waiting for her the list did not include annalee ettinger oh god im so glad youre here annalee said she was lying on her back on the narrow bed dressed in a nightgown and quilted housecoat her knees were drawn up tracks of tears glistened on her cheeks sarah sat beside her and instinctively laid her hand on annalees gravid abdomen even through the housecoat she could feel the solid irregular mass of a uterine contraction just squeeze my hands until its over sarah said dont be frightened annalee everythings going to be all right nearly a minute passed before the tightness in annalees womb began to abate during that time sarah calculated from their conversation following the july press conference trying to determine how far along her pregnancy had come thirtythree weeks perhaps thirtyfour she guessed how often are your contractions coming every eight or nine minutes annalee said ive been having them off and on for weeks but its been like this for about twelve straight hours your water break no fever chills no bleeding of any kind no wheres taylor believe it or not hes in east africa the bands touring for two more weeks i have no idea exactly where they are right now he wanted to cancel the tour and stay home because i was having those offandon contractions but i told him to go how stupid of me easy does it annalee dont be so hard on yourself you did the right thing and what about peter hehe doesnt know where i am he refused to take me to a hospital even though i told him it was too early for me to be delivering i ended up calling a friend and then climbing out through my bedroom window she picked me up on the road and took me here sarah peters crazy her eyes filled with tears he has those two midwives he flew in from mali at the house theyve been giving me some sort of tea that they say will stop my labor i mentioned your name once just once and he exploded he said if i saw you for any reason i neednt bother coming home sarah took the sobbing frightened woman in her arms annalee dont even think about peter or anything else lets just think about your baby youre definitely in labor and youre still six or seven weeks early delivering now is a concern but its not a crisis ideally wed like to see the baby stay where it is for a couple more weeks what can i do can you stop labor ii dont have any health insurance peters been paying for sarah i think another ones coming okay easy does it annalee sarah whispered again stroking her forehead one contraction at a time and one question at a time she glanced at the clock six and a half minutes since the last contraction this time responding perhaps to sarahs reassurance annalee closed her eyes and quietly breathed her way through the contraction annalee dont worry about the insurance sarah said dont worry about anything im going to get you admitted here and im going to get one of our staff obstetricians to care for you in fact i think i can get the chief of the service his names dr snyder what will he do well my guess is hell put you on an iv and give you some medication to try to stop these contractions and prolong your pregnancy that depends though there are ways we have for finding out not only how far along you are but how far along the baby is in terms of its lung development the status of the lungs is the key to when a woman in premature labor should be allowed to deliver you can measure the babys lungs before its born we can sarah said actually were pretty good at it annalee pushed herself up and threw her arms around sarahs neck i knew i did the right thing in coming to you she said i knew it sarah called the hospital operator and put in a page for randall snyder then she called admissions and asked to have someone sent up to the obstetrics unit finally she took a fetoscope from a hook on the door and listened to annalees belly the babys doing great she said after half a minute or so just great thats wonderful i can feel it kicking listen sarah please dont call peter hey kid i work for you that means you give the orders you may want to find a way to call and let him know youre okay though you dont have to say where you are i know he really loves you a lot its me he cant stand well thats his problem you know while you were on the phone i was looking at you and thinking about the incredible things you can do and i was remembering what you were like when you first came to live with us and lets just say youve come a long way baby a hell of a long way sarah hugged the woman once again save for her moderately prominent abdomen and engorged breasts there was virtually no bulge on her bodyno loose skin no fat whatsoever youre a member of the long way club too annalee she said taking pains to mask her concern one more thing when did you take that weight loss powder of peters and for how long about four years ago and for about three months dr singh had already tested the powder someplace on a number of people but before peter would allow himself to be associated with it he arranged for ten or twelve people he knew to take it altogether we lost about a half a ton why is there something wrong with it no no i was just wondering nothings wrong with it nothing at all well i hope not annalee said because according to the last figures i saw since they began marketing the powder about seven months ago a few hundred thousand people have done exactly the same thing i know sarah said flashing on a stainless steel surgical pan and the dusky severed arm of a young woman i know chapter october matt arrived at his office at am feeling the sort of nervous energy he had once associated with game day earlier in the morning he had run three milespart of the fitness regimen he had instituted after being so badly outclassed by sarah in chinatown he had also read several sections of the globe and the sports section in the herald and spent fifteen minutes of intense practice on nintendo baseballthe impressively realistic game at which he was determined at least once in his lifetime to beat harry after four arduous confusing months pieces in the bewildering puzzle of grayson v baldwin were beginning to come together rosa suarez and a virologist from the cdc had identified the genetically altered virus circulating in lisa graysons bloodstream and had traced it to a company across the river in cambridge the virus labeled crv by the biovir corporation had been developed to enhance the clotting of blood and the healing of wounds later that morning rosa and ken mulholland would be meeting with the director of the lab the biovir bug still might prove to be a red herring in terms of lisa graysons dic but given the purpose of its creation that possibility seemed remote and with any luck before the hour was out yet another piece of the jigsaw would be set in place matt had done what homework he had time for and had rehearsed the scenario in his mind now it was showtime unless he was way off base roger phelps had two achilles heelsarrogance and greed the trick was to expose one or both of them without alerting the man failing to accomplish that there was always plan bthe frontal assault approach he had used with such mastery against tommy szeto his groin ached at the memory he was reaching nervously for his glove and ball when with a soft knock phelps entered the outer office daniels in here roger come on in the claims adjuster wearing a threepiece suit tapped playfully on matts office door and then entered despite his dandyish appearance matt knew he was calculating and intelligenta man to be dealt with carefully matt offered him coffee and then motioned him to the seat across the desk from his so phelps said settling in its a change of heart weve had is it dr baldwins getting cold feet about going to court you can call her sarah ive heard rumors that the two of you know each other onumshall we say a firstname basis now roger what in the hell am i supposed to say in response to that remark nothing shes very attractivein a tomboy sort of way i really wouldnt blame you if you were carrying on with her right away an assertion of power and control matt thought the man is good damn good to tell you the truth roger the thought has crossed my mind but believe me nothings going to happen on that front until this case is resolved smart is that perhaps a reason you want to settle perhaps i told you that i honestly think we can win well obviously were not as sure of that as you are a pretty young girl with a dead baby and a stump for an arm makes a damn persuasive argument to a jury and when juries decide for plaintiffs they tend to decide big i understand im glad so then whats your pitch on behalf of my client im prepared to agree to your offer of a settlement with no admission of guilt but im a bit concerned about my reputation in this whole business grayson versus baldwin has been a highvisibility case if i go to trial and win im probably set for business for years to comeif not from the mmpo then either from the other malpractice carrier or even from plaintiffs goodness knows theres a pile more money to be made from suing doctors than from defending them so so id like some guarantee of referrals from you perhaps a retainer of some sort mr daniels you know we dont do that theres always a first time believe me for the right amount i can be as good or as bad as you want me to be matt could see that his remark delivered more or less offhandedly struck a nerve phelps paled visibly but then just as quickly regained his composure i think youd best stop right there he said matt pushed back from behind his desk and rubbed wearily at his eyes roger please i need your help he said im nervous as hell talking to you like this but im in financial troublepretty deep financial trouble i thought you were a big baseball star never that big believe me a few years ago i got talked into this cantmiss real estate deal and well it missed you know how it is right now im staying afloat but just barely so like i said i really need your help sorry no can do no retainer but i will keep you in mind as cases come in matt could see the suspicion in the mans eyes he was not going to be at all easy to trip up you know matt said theres this question ive been asking myself over and over why did roger phelps hire me for this case in the first place especially when i was being opposed by jeremy mallon the michael jordan of malpractice litigation why finally when the answer just wouldnt come but the question just wouldnt go away i started doing some checking did you know that jeremy mallon goes to trial more than any other malpractice lawyer in boston its like the man doesnt know the meaning of the word settle but hes settling here phelps said you know what else i learned matt went on as if the statement hadnt been made he was hoping that if he kept talking fast enough and with enough authority phelps would fail to consider that he might be winging it i learned that not one of the lawyers opposing mallon in those trials had much more experience in malpractice cases than i did lambs to the lionevery one of us now do you see what i mean about being as bad as you want me to be roger i dont need a cut of the jury awards or anything like that im not greedy a retainer will do just fine some guarantee that this business will continue rolling my way daniels i dont take kindly to this sort of innuendo besides what youre saying is utter nonsense like i said before mallon is settling in this very case thats because hes going to lose matt responded with icy calm he knows it and you know it roger get it through your head im not out to crucify you i want to work with you i need to work with you phelps eyed him for a time clearly weighing all the variables and then said go to hell damn you matt thought he was getting closer by the moment to plan b he stood slipped on his glove and began gently flipping the scuffed ball into its pocket the proof is out there roger he said any board of bar overseers with half a brain will be able to add one and one together and come up with you he began snapping the ball with more force how much of a cut of the jury awards does mallon kick back to you fifteen percent daniels youre crazy twenty twentyfive mallon knew about the dentist rogmy one other malpractice case i mentioned it to a couple of the people at the hospital but they hate mallon with a passion theres no way they would have told him it was you rog mallon needed another patsy to win a big jury settlement against and you fed him me matt turned his back on the claims adjuster he was totally improvising now but it really didnt matter you have no damn proof of that not a bit of matt whirled and without so much as a flicker of hesitation gunned the ball at phelpss head there was no time at all for the man to react the pitch tore past him perhaps two inches from his ear and shattered the protective glass on a huge print of the boston skyline at night the ball was already bouncing back toward matt by the time phelps threw himself onto the carpet jesus he screamed you really are crazy but fortunately i am also very accurate matt scooped up the rolling hardball with his bare hand and whipped it sidearm at the chair phelps had just vacated the cherrywood back of the chair exploded like balsa now tell me roger what does mallon pay you phelps tried to get to his feet but matt easily pushed him back onto the floor he picked up the ball once again and backed across the office the claims adjuster was cowering against the desk im very accurate with this rog he said only one point nine walks per nine innings pitched but i promise you im going to keep at it until i missor i run out of furniture youve tried to make me just another one of the patsies but unfortunately for you it didnt work this time now i want in i want to be part of this little scam you and mallon are running go to hell phelps shouted again okay i think im going to do this one off a full windup we relief pitchers never get to use full windups very much i need the practice and i dont need that paperweight right there by your head youre crazy here we go its a tie game fans bottom of the ninth the bases are loaded there are two outs heres danielss windup wait dont stay right there rog matt said freezing his arms with the glove and ball at shoulder height just talk okay okay youre right mallon and i have an agreement he lets me know when he gets a good case and i assign a um go ahead say it rog a loser an inexperienced attorney to oppose him and then you refuse to settle and insist on going for a jury award oh you are beautiful rog just beautiful has mallon ever lost one of those cases never until now how much do you get thats none of your business now let me up the tensions so thick baseball fans you can cut it with a knife matt said adopting his announcers voice again a walk means a run a hit batsman means a run the runners are leading off daniels is going into the windup a third of mallons forty percent phelps said quickly matt lowered his glove that can add up phelps scrambled to his feet carefully brushing slivers of wood and glass from his suit listen he said still hyperventilating you want in youll have in just give me a few days to work out the details matt slipped his hand from his glove do i have your word on that yeah yeah you have my word you are really crazy do you know that i want to hear from you within the week rog just be cool about this i will i will phelps backed toward the door i mean it he said just be cool roger why dont you think about starting me off with a little portion of this settlement youre offering two hundred k chances are mallon will represent the other two families and get the same settlement how about i get half of your third of mallons forty percent that would be lets see forty thousand not bad math for a dumb jock eh okay okay after all three cases are settled just let me the hell out of here go ahead matt said simply just like that just like that i trust that if you say weve got a deal weve got a deal matt waited until phelps had opened the office door then added of course i will have to charge you an additional two dollars and ninetyeight cents for your souvenir copy of the tape smiling broadly he opened his suit coat the miniature tape recorder was strapped to his beltright next to a rabbits foot and a small blue ribbon dr dimitri athanoulos the president of biovir welcomed rosa suarez and ken mulholland cordially his office was on the fourth floor river side of a somewhat dated building typical of the glass and brick hightech showpieces of the early s he was in his late fifties rosa estimated handsome and urbane his thick wavy hair was the color of his lab coat so you are both with the centers for disease control yes rosa said im a field epidemiologist ken is a microbiologist a virologist if im not mistaken some would say so from duke that was twelve years ago mulholland said quite obviously impressed if i recall correctly you did some wonderful work on tobacco virus phage infection cater to my ego and i am yours mulholland said well i am a dna biochemist primarily athanoulos said but i have always had an interest in viruses and in bacteriophage in the three years since i left academia to become director here my interest in both has become more intense and how should i say more proprietary rosa seeing how quickly the two men connected sensed that the biovir chief urbane or not tended to take men more seriously than women kens decision to stay overnight was turning out to be yet another break in the investigation she sat patiently through five more minutes of scientific small talk and doyouknows then shifted in her seat and cleared her throat athanoulos immediately picked up on the cue so now he said what can biovir do for our friends in atlanta ive been in boston for most of four months now rosa said investigating three unusual obstetrics cases at the medical center of boston the young resident who gave toxic herbs of some sort to her patients yes rosa sighed la potencia de las prensa she said the power of the press dr athanoulos despite what you and a million or so others have read it does not appear that those herbs are playing a major role in this drama although i should add that the possibility remains ken do you want to review your studies thus far dimitri mulholland said rosa here is far too modest to admit it but she has done a damn thorough job of evaluating these cases for many years shes been the best field person at the cdc go on she sent me some serum from one of the victims of this dic bleeding problemthe one of the three who survived weve gotten viral growth and identified an antibody indicative of a smoldering infection yesterday we finished sequencing the dna of the bug its composition matched a virus created in your lab athanouloss thick white brows rose a fraction mulholland passed over the printout describing crv and the lab director scanned it come he said standing abruptly let us take a walk to our primate unit i know absolutely nothing of crv the date of its patenting precedes my arrival here and assuming we once were we are no longer involved with such a virus of that i am certain since i took over we have focused on building viruses that make gamma globulin and viruses that make certain hormones but nothing like this cletus collins has been in charge of the primates we use since biovir opened in if anyone would know about this crv it is he they took the elevator to the subbasement even before the doors opened rosa could smell the animals the nearly silent corridor outside the elevator was lined with glass which was quite obviously thick for behind the glass wall were three long tiers of cages virtually every one of them occupied by an active monkey a stoopshouldered old man was swabbing the floor in front of the cages athanoulos rapped on the glass wheres clete he said the old man lipreading strained to understand the question then he smiled he pointed down the corridor and mouthed what seemed to rosa to be the rec room athanoulos opened a door at the end of the corridor and the three of them stepped into a glass cage five feet square and perhaps ten feet high surrounding the cage was a huge room rising two stories and packed with toys ropes tree limbs and climbing bars at the center of the room with one goodsize chimpanzee riding on him piggyback and another smaller one clinging to his leg was cletus collins rosa noted the man could almost have passed for one of his charges with his simian features and posture ken mulholland had clearly made the same observation remarkable he murmured yes isnt it athanoulos said im surprised you let him commune with the primates like that you mean because of the viruses the animals carry i assure you kenneth after all these years any virus they have he has clete can we see you for a moment he said into a speaker on one wall the primate keeper freed himself from the monkeys came over and accepted the introduction to the visitors from atlanta concern darkened his striking face we exercise these animals good real good he said in a midwestern twang that was several times more defined than mulhollands every day i take care of them like they was kin i promise you that mr collins were not with any animal rights group rosa said were trying to learn about some research that was done here a few years ago on a virus named crv it was related to clots i know the work you mean are there any records of it athanoulos asked who knows there should be at least the animal records probably in the old metal cabinets in the storage closet next to the boiler room i did not even know that room or such files existed abandoned projects mostly no ones ever been much interested in them i am interested would you please take us there clete sure you wait in the outer corridor while i get these fellows back in their cages theyd just as soon bite and scratch your face off as look at you everyone except me n old stan the cage man out there that is the trio of scientists watched from behind the protective glass as he returned the two animals to their cages rosa could have sworn that just before one of them let go of collinss neck it kissed him on the cheek i sort of liked fezler collins said as he led the three to the storage closet but i hated what his damn experiments did to my monkeys you sure youre not with one of them animal groups believe me i take good care of these guys real good care its hard on me when they you know when they dont make it you have nothing to worry about rosa said whos fezler collins searched out the storage closet key from a belt ring that might have been holding a hundred he connected on the second try warren fezler crv was one of his projects he had about a dozen of em it seemed not a damn one worked out right as far as i know too bad his job wasnt to come up with a way to kill monkeys hed a been a big success then collinss mucusy laugh was cut short by a spasm of coughing rosa instinctively backed away from him a step she wondered how many jobrelated diseases he might have contracted over the years he flipped on the light revealing a small concrete room barren save for half a dozen file cabinets fezler wasnt the best record keeper in the world he said but he was one hell of a worker weekends two in the morning holidays it didnt matter none to ol warren im only the director here athanoulos mumbled clearly dismayed why should i know this room exists or that we once employed a monkeykiller named fezler what happened to the monkeys rosa asked as collins used one of his keys to unlock a cabinet just got sick n died fezler would put them under with anesthesia then cut them with a scalpel in some weird way and draw some blood then hed measure how quickly and how well their wounds healed he flipped through one drawer with no success and went to the next you sure youre not from one of those wacko animal groups positive rosa said well i cant really tell you what happened to the monkeys they just kinda shriveled up n died it wasnt on purpose though i can tell you that much he skimmed through the files in that drawer and went to the next fezler liked the monkeys they liked him too he was the only one besides me and stan that they ever took to like that he always wore the protective suits when he was in the rec room with them but suit or no suit they never bit him that i recall not once they played with him just like they do with me they liked bouncing on his belly and believe you me he had a whopper maybe it was sort of like one of them moonwalks for the chimps you know like at the carnival again his laugh became a choking cough whats the problem athanoulos asked still irritated and now a bit impatient as well the files aint here it says right here on the top that theyre supposed to be in my handwriting too could they be somewhere else if you think that you dont know me ill lookitll take some time but ill look do that please athanoulos said ill check with some of the other scientists and lab techs about this fezler and also with personnel rosa said clete do you know when and why warren fezler left biovir id say it was six years ago at least maybe more im not really sure why except i think he got sick why do you say that i dont know for sure he rubbed at his chin in a way that any one of his charges might have done he went from being this rolypoly guy to being not much but skin and bones i guess thats why the chimps stopped bouncing on him because to tell ya the truth there was nothing much left to bounce on rosa and mulholland exchanged quick glances the previous evening she had shared with him the contents of constanza hidalgos diary and the discovery that hidalgo alethea worthington and lisa grayson had all lost massive amounts of weight i shall learn what i can about this incredible shrinking man and his work athanoulos said as they left the storage room and headed down the hall and i shall get back to you as soon as possible thats much appreciated rosa said absently behind her wide glasses rosas brown eyes narrowed as she worked at connecting some thoughts they had reached the elevator when she stopped short whirled and called back to cletus collins clete tell me something do you remember anything else about warren fezler anything unusual at all i dont understand what you the animal keeper suddenly broke into a broad grin oh yeah he said i think i know what youre getting at it was the way he talked he couldnt get his words outespecially when he was upset or something he i cant think of the word for it but you know i do know clete she said intently he stuttered didnt he yeah thats it cletus collins said he stuttered he stuttered like goddamn porky pig chapter october okay now sarah said this is one of the two delivery rooms on our unit for those women who want it and have no risks or complications we also have a birthing room thats quite a bit less formal ill show you that later the three thirdyear medical students shifted nervously as they stared about at the monitoring equipment the gleaming anesthesia apparatus and the delivery table before their tenweek clerkship in obgyn was over each would perform an unassisted delivery from start to finishpossibly a number of them the mcb rotation offered more responsibility and clinical opportunities than was customary at other hospitals and therefore was very much in demand one of sarahs duties as the next chief resident was supervision of the med students are there any questions so far she asked do you do any home births one student asked two of us residents do home births with a staff person along just in case of problems there was no point in adding that she had been asked by her chief resident not to do any further home deliveries until the charges against her had been resolved ive heard of you a second said i have an interest in alternative therapies do you teach acupuncture im afraid i havent time for any formal classes but feel free to join me at the pain clinic ill give you my schedule later anything else before we move on to the outpatient department yes said the third student motioning down the corridor the man who just came out of that room isnt he the herbal weight loss guy from television sarah whirled peter ettinger had just left annalees room and was stalking toward her his fists were balled at his side his face was crimson and so taut with anger that he actually looked to be snarling the medical students stepped back a pace sarah forced herself to hold her ground why didnt you call me ettinger snapped why did i have to search all over the city before i found my daughter if youd like to speak with me i think we should do so in the office sarah said theres no need to do any speaking i want my daughter released immediately from this this poor excuse for a hospital what in the hell are you putting into her body anyway peter please lets go someplace where we can sit down and talk about this like adults ettinger glanced over at the students whose name tags identified them all as ms iii whats the matter he said are you worried these virginal medical minds will be soiled by learning what you do to patients tell them whats going on tell them exactly what it is youre dripping into my daughters body go ahead tell them ill just listen in sarah bit at her lower lip and tried to think of some way out of the situation she was no match for peters intensity anger and charisma with his loathing for western medicine he had honed his arguments through countless presentations and organized debates now he had her in a corner a few yards away two nurses stopped to watch perhaps either recognizing peter or sensing sarahs discomfiture neither made any move to intervene sarah took a deep calming breath and turned to the students you want it peter you got it mr ettingers daughter annalee is a twentythreeyearold para one gravida zero she said evenly that means this is her first pregnancy the date of her lmplast menstrual periodis uncertain but by ultrasound and other studies she appears to be in her thirtyfourth week the fetus is female approximately twentyfour hundred grams thats about five and a half pounds annalee was admitted to our unit the day before yesterday in premature labor with contractions varying from fifteen minutes apart to seven minutes her membranes are intact her cervix is closed and she is nontoxicthat is without evidence of infection an amniocentesis done yesterday has disclosed fetal surfactant levels that are slightly below normal that means that the babys lungs should be all right if she is delivered now but each day we can keep the child in utero gives her that much better of a chance she now turned a bit toward peter grateful that he had allowed her to get this far uninterrupted dr snyder her private physician is the chief of obgyn she continued he is attempting to arrest her labor with terbutaline a beta adrenergic agonist so far she has responded somewhat to treatment although she continues to have some regular uterine contractions now mr ettinger if youll excuse us we have a visit to make to the outpatient department dr snyder is in the hospital if you have any further questions i suggest you contact him ive called an ambulance ettinger said i have discussed the situation with my daughter she wishes to leave this hospital immediately im making arrangements for her to be evaluated at white memorial prior to returning home with me sarah was stunned i dont believe she would agree to that ask her yourself if you wish ettinger said snidely beta adrenergic agonists indeed he looked at the three medical students with withering scorn the answers are not in your physicians desk references or your fancy tests or your beta adrenergic agonists he said they are in the minds and spirits of your patients keep your minds open to that and as your careers progress you will come to understand what i mean and someday when one of your superiors tells you to give a patient some drug or other that a pharmaceutical salesman has convinced him to use you will turn to him and simply say why mr ettinger im sure these students are pleased to be exposed to your views on their profession sarah said battling her exasperation now please excuse me im going to speak with annalee alone if you refuse to allow me to do that ill call security go right ahead ettinger said smugly i doubt youll turn her head again after youve satisfied yourself that she wishes to leave this place i want her discharge orders written the medical students exchanged bewildered uncomfortable glances sarah herself was surprised that ettinger exuded such confidence she wondered what he had said to annaleewhat he must have promisedto get her to agree to leave mcb it had to have been plenty otherwise there was no way at that moment annalee ettinger began to scream oh my god help oh god please help please help me the two nurses sarah and ettinger dashed toward the room as a pack with the three medical students close behind annalees piercing screeches of pain filled the corridor sarah was the first through the door annalee was on her side kicking her feet and wailing piteously her intravenous catheter had pulled out blood flowing briskly from the site was saturating the sheet in a widening circle of crimson my hands she cried my hands are killing me both of them page dr snyder sarah immediately ordered she gloved quickly grabbed a towel and put pressure on the iv site taking pains to keep annalee propped on her side so the heavy fluidfilled uterus would not be compressing the main artery and veins in her abdomen susie go ahead and get another iv ready please sarah said with forced calm ringers lactate largebore cannula whats going on here peter asked whats the matter with her hands my hands my hands the woman kept moaning sarah could see that the flesh beneath annalees nailsthe nail bedswere dusky her fingers still had motion but she was splinting them in a protective claw position sarah checked for radial artery pulses and felt them though faintly at each wrist dr snyder just called the nurse said breathlessly hes on his way so is the lab heres fifty of demerol and fifty of vistaril he said to give them im if shes not actively bleeding thirtyfive of demerol iv if she is theyre getting the fetal monitor now a thin trickle of blood began flowing from one nostril lets get that line in right now sarah said grimly also a temp she feels hot to me very hot i demand to know whats going on here peter said sarah glared at him shes sick even you can see that peter you were just in with her didnt you see that anything was wrong i she um she said she was having a headache and her arms were feeling heavy oh is that all sarah said irritably peter please wait in the hall and let us do our work i want her private doctor in here susie will you please call security and okay okay im going but ill be right outside and ill be listening im sorry to be a crybaby annalee sobbed but it hurts it hurts so much over the minutes that followed the tension continued to escalate first the fetal monitor and a third nurse arrived next the nursing shift supervisor then the phlebotomist one of the nurses called out that a rectal temperature was over annalees wailing was unnervinga hundred new pieces of chalk screeching at once across a hundred slates the urgency in the room was electric not only was there the realization that something terrible was happening to the woman and quite likely to her unborn child as well but there was the stillfresh memory of the other virtually identical cases sarah and the nurses were unable to keep annalee from writhing about but with composure teamwork and skill they were able to slip a widebore intravenous cannula into place before attaching the ringers lactate infusion sarah used the cannula to draw out a large syringeful of blood for the laboratory one less venapuncture site to worry aboutone less bleeding point the sedating painkilling demerol injection had just been given when randall snyder raced into the room he quickly took in the scene oh no he whispered though not softly enough to go unheard i saw her fortyfive minutes ago and she was fine sarah said her fathers here hes in the hall right now i know i saw him he was in with her fifteen minutes ago she was complaining of a headache and heaviness in her arms then suddenly she started screaming labs are off ive ordered four units crossmatched lets make it eight gosh shes burning up there was undisguised and uncharacteristic panic in his voice shes oneohthree point five rectally sarah said we just took it i called dr blankenship he should be here any moment good annalee listen just hang on we just gave you something for the pain youll be feeling better in a moment sarah once again toweled off her forehead and wiped the trickle of blood from her face immediately it began again im sorry im being such a baby annalee sobbed again but my hands are killing me now my feet are starting to hurt whats happening to me i dont know yet sarah said and stop apologizing youre being incredibly tough an internist is on his way right now to help us sarah snyder asked did she take your prenatal vitamins at all sarah shook her head but she did take what i wrote about in her admission history she answered softly four years ago annalee had begun to breathe easier she eased over onto her back her constricted pupils said the demerol was starting to work this is what happened to those other women isnt it she said the ones who died we dont know that snyder replied annalee were doing everything we can to stop whats happening to you were also watching the baby if theres any sign of trouble were prepared to take her out by cesarean he glanced over at the fetal monitor would somebody please call dr blankenship again within seconds eli blankenship entered the room whats ettinger doing out there he asked annalee is his daughter sarah said annalee this is dr blankenship the chief of medicine weve met blankenship said in fact i saw her just a little while ago annalee is part of the study weve instituted to draw blood daily on every obstetrics admission is barnes your married name annalee shook her head we picked that name because her father doesnt approve of hospitals sarah said especially ours annalee didnt want him to be able to track her down somehow though he did and im paying close attention to what goes on in here peter called out from the doorway well just stay out of our way blankenship snapped as he began his examination peter please annalee begged do what he says the medicines starting to work my hands feel a little better thanks for telling him that blankenship said i promise ill go out and speak with him as soon as i finish figuring out whats going on blood had now begun to trickle from both of her nostrils damn snyder whispered eli rectal tylenol run the iv wide open be sure the lab is running everything stat blankenship rattled off check her pressure and her radial pulse every minute get us two units as soon as possible and ten units of platelets i dont want to fall behind also find out whos on for hematology he motioned a nurse to take sarahs place at the bedside and then led her and snyder over to one side of the room a few feet away the three wideeyed medical students were like statues flattened against the wall sarah made no attempt either to involve them or to ask them to leave shes not in as active labor as the others blankenship said but shes progressing faster than any of them did i dont recall any of the others having fever sarah said they didnt even so it sure looks like dic agreed you know sarah snyder said assuming the lab confirms it we have the case rosa suarez was talking about the case that finally takes you off the hook in all this sarah narrowly kept from criticizing her chief for the inappropriate timing of his remark but she reminded herself that annalee had not been his friend and that the accusations against his next chief resident had severely disrupted his department id be lying if i said that point hadnt occurred to me she said instead but what concerns me most now is annalee i think we have to section her quickly remember how rapidly lisa began recovering after she was delivered what do you think randall blankenship asked as things stand shes too unstable for us to go in the fetal monitor is holding for now i think with a sixandahalfweek preemie in there and her labor slowing down as it has been we should try to get her bleeding and clotting under control i agree blankenship said sarah knew that in a medical discussion with two full professors her opinion mattered but only as long as it jibed with theirs in this instance it most certainly did not the cesarean section for whatever reason had all but cured lisa summer she excused herself and returned to the bedside the demerol injection had calmed annalee considerably but she was drenched in perspiration and the bleeding from her nose and her original intravenous site was intensifying her fingernail and toenail beds were at least as dark as lisas had been still as sarah conducted her examination she could not shake the feeling that the two cases were different in some basic way first there was the fever neither lisa nor the other hospitalized case had experienced a rise in temperature although it certainly could accompany dic then there was the frightening speed with which annalees symptoms were developing and finally there were unsettling weaknesses in her acupuncture pulses sarah tried to attribute the strange pattern she was feeling to altered blood flow but her instincts told her she was picking up on something significant whatever it waspossibly some sort of systemic toxinseemed to be affecting every organ in the womans body she returned to the two department chiefs and shrugged have you anything to offer her snyder asked i dont know i can try some of the things i did with lisa but no guarantees snyder glanced over at the fetal monitor eli ive got the anesthesiologist and the pediatrician standing by but i want to exhaust every possibility before we go ahead with a section a unit clerk raced in and handed eli a computer printout these clotting studies look remarkably like lisa summers did he said they make dic pretty much a certainty weve got to get her on heparin sarah if you want ill give you ten minutesfifteen if she gets no worse i cant promise anything but ill do what i can sarah said someone please talk to her father and tell him whats going on her thoughts swirling she raced past peter and off the labor and delivery floor for months she had hoped rosa was wrong about their seeing just the tip of the iceberg prayed that they had encountered the last tragedy from the macabre malignant complication of childbirth now the lives of annalee ettinger and her daughter were on the line but having studied the previous cases so intensively sarah had questions why the high fever why the unusual pattern in her twelve acupuncture pulses why the rapid evolution of symptoms she took the tunnel to the thayer building bypassed the elevator and raced up the five flights to her locker two spins to the right then stop at three left to forty as always sarah murmured the combination to herself as she dialed it halfway to the forty the dial caught momentarily in freeing it sarah spun well past the number she cursed out loud even in the most trying or situations her hands had always been her most supple dependable allies now with annalee in such trouble they were stiff as cold taffy she was about to spin through the combination again when she noticed the scratches in the metal door just beside the lock instead of redoing the combination she tugged on the dial her pulse was throbbing in her ears as the door swung open her lacquered mahogany box of acupuncture needles was gone as was the electrostimulator she occasionally attached to them in their place was an unopened federal express box addressed to her care of mcb on top of the box was a small brown paper bag her hands trembling sarah reached into the bag and withdrew a glass vial and a receipt the vial was empty but its label made all too clear what was going on it also answered the gnawing questions about annalees clinical picture crotalid m ixed r attlesnake venom for research purposes only caution highly poisonous have antivenin available and review usage the receipt from a mail order laboratory supply house in houston was made out to her sarah dropped the vial into her clinic coat pocket and carefully tore open the fedex package there was no doubt in her mind what it contained polyvalent crotaline antivenintwenty vials in all badly shaken sarah stood alone by her open locker on the dimly lit fourthfloor corridor of the thayer building in her pocket was quite likely the cause of annalees hellish imminently lethal situation in her hands was the cure no one was likely to believe her story that both the empty poison vial and the packaged antidote had been placed in her locker by whoever had actually administered the venom to annalee if her account of andrews death had strained her credibility around mcb this latest tale would snap it it made much more sense to believe that sarah had infused the rattlesnake poison in order to create a case of laborinduced dic that was unrelated to her herbal supplement that annalee was supposedly her friend would impress no oneespecially after peter got through telling whatever version of their history he concocted why then had sarah produced the antidote perhaps some people would reason she had intended to create a dramatic though sublethal condition but had missed only when things were clearly on a downhill slide for annalee had she come up with the antiveninand the farfetched explanation that it had just shown up in her locker perhaps others would claim she had not initially cared whether the case was sublethal or lethal but seeing annalees extreme distress had brought about a sudden change of heart the two groups might argue over nuances but clearly there was one and only one logical explanation for sarahs miraculous eleventhhour discovery of both the cause and cure of annalees dic sarah herself had to have administered the toxin in the first place no one with half a brain would believe otherwise for a moment the notion flickered through her mind simply to dispose of the empty vial and the antivenin she could say that her locker had been pried open and her acupuncture needles stolen no one except the person who had set her up would ever be the wiser with luck and aggressive treatment annalee and her childor at least one of themmight possibly survive and as randall snyder had said with a case of dic unrelated to sarahs herbal supplements she would at last be off the hook by the time sarah was even aware of having that notion she was bounding three at a time down the stairs to the tunnel the precious fedex box tucked beneath her arm like a football the scene in annalees room was much as it had been when sarah sprinted off except that hematologist helen stoddard was now conferring with eli and randall snyder sarah groaned at the sight of her since their conflict over lisa grayson they had passed in the halls and sat near each other at conferences and not one word had been exchanged between them well dr stoddard sarah thought as she approached the three treating physicians if you thought i was a quack before youre going to think im a positive lunatic now and a homicidal lunatic at that i need to speak with you all over here sarah whispered motioning toward the only unoccupied corner of the room its very important not again helen stoddard moaned eli i thought you promised helen either shut up or leave eli snapped with uncharacteristic impatience this girl is in big trouble weve got to do whatever we can to save her whats going on snyder asked are you all going to give her the heparin or not yes helen stoddard said quickly and definitively i think youd best hear what i have to say first sarah countered she briefly described what she found at her locker and showed the three physicians the contents of the fedex package i was concerned about annalees high temperature the speed with which her symptoms were developing and also the pattern of her twelve acupuncture pulses crotalid poisoning would explain all that youre absolutely mad helen stoddard said someone purposely placed this in your locker how on earth can you possibly expect us to swallow dammit helen eli cut her off would you just listen for once the woman glared at him then at sarah then she whirled and stormed from the room a moment later peter ettinger stormed in what in the hell is going on here why did the hematologist leave that way he demanded eli moved to confront him but sarah stopped the professor with a raised hand wait dr blankenship she said please i know how important annalee is to peter and i know how worried he is about whats going on let me talk to her for a second she whispered a few words in annalees ear and then returned to the group annalee says its all right with her if he stays okay blankenship growled but one disruptive word ettinger and youre out peter annalee has been poisoned sarah said someone has injected crotalid venom either into her iv line or into the iv bag i dont know enough about crotalid venom to know which or when it was done but i am absolutely certain of what im saying it is essential that we get this antivenin into her as soon as possible this is insane ettinger said how do we know the antivenin is what is in those vials randall snyder asked well for one thing theyre sealed for another if this was anything but antivenin there would be no sense in someone placing it in my possession assuming someone did peter said dr blankenship sarah asked ignoring ettinger do you know if there are any side effects to the antivenin an allergic reaction to the horse serum its made in i would think blankenship said nothing else comes to mind we can handle that here let me see the package insert randall snyder glanced once again at the fetal monitor eli theres been a slight drop in the babys pulse youve got to decide crotalid poisoning peter said sarah you are really crazy ettinger this issue has been decided eli warned glaring at the taller man from beneath his massive brow either go stand on the other side of the bed or get the hell out peter hesitated and then rather meekly did as he was ordered eli quickly scanned the instructions and drew the contents of ten of the vials into a large syringe sarah explained the situation to annalee there was complete silence in the room as eli slid the needle into the rubber port of the iv tubing and slowly discharged the cloudy liquid into her bloodstream the response to the antivenin was dramatic in less than five minutes annalee reported that the intense pain in her extremities had begun to abate twentysix minutes after the injection the bleeding from her nose and needle stick sites stopped completely by early afternoon her fever was gone and nearly all of her clotting studies and other laboratory tests were normal six hours after the administration of the antivenin glenn paris convened an emergency session of the executive committees of the hospital trustees and medical staff after hearing the accounts of randall snyder eli blankenship helen stoddard and the labor and delivery nurses the participants voted unanimously to place sarah baldwin on immediate indefinite paid leave from the hospital and from her residency until the details of her involvement in annalees case became known with certainty the body had been in the morgue at the state medical examiners office for three days before a definitive identification was made actually body was not so apt a description of the remains as skeleton a week before the crew of a trawler fishing seventyfive miles off the massachusetts coast had hauled it aboard along with several hundred pounds of haddock the skeleton had not a shred of clothing or tissue left on it except for some cartilage on the ribs and in several of its joints still the medical examiner was able to place the time of death within the past six months he also had no problem classifying the death as a homicide there were fracturedislocations of two cervical vertebrae the nature of the bony fragments strongly suggested blunt force the ropes and divers weights still tied around the skeletons extremities and what was once its midsection removed what doubt remained now the me inspected the dental x rays obtained from the boston police his dental forensics expert had just matched them with certainty to those films taken of the skeleton he dictated his findings into a handheld recorder and then called the bpd detective who had sent the x rays over i think you can contact the missing mans family and tell them he is no longer missing the medical examiner said unfortunately it would seem that your dr truscott has done his last operation chapter it was early afternoon when mrs annie frumanian knocked on rosas door its that charming mr mulholland calling from atlanta she twittered mulholland who had flown home shortly after the visit to biovir had spent his one night in boston at her bed and breakfast he was an almost legendary insomniac and had made inestimable points with mrs frumanian by staying up until well past midnight listening to stories of her life he later told rosa that no prescription sleeping pill had ever worked as well on him ken have you got anything rosa asked once she was certain the landlady had hung up the extension an address from three years ago is the best weve been able to do so far the virologist said if you find our mr fezler maybe you should let him know that assuming the social security number we used is the right one we have inadvertently alerted the irs that he hasnt filed a tax return in four years fezler the creator of the crv virus was almost certainly the skittish stuttering little man who had tried to make contact with sarah however although the oldtimers at biovir remembered him as having been there for at least five years none of them knew anything about his personal life and there was no record in personnel that he had ever worked for the lab from what little their inquiry around biovir turned up rosa and ken had formed a picture of fezler as an extremely solitary very bright and strikingly overweight man perhaps in his late forties or early fifties while in biovirs employ he lost an enormous amount of weight he also lost an enormous number of monkeys and much to the dismay of animal supervisor cletus collins the record of those primates like fezlers personnel file had vanished it was mulhollands idea to use fastfind to locate him the fastfind computer network had been implemented in by a commission secretly appointed by the president its purpose purely and simply was to track down individuals for the government it cost over million to install but in its first year of operation the tax evaders alone that it located more than paid that bill it functioned by rapidly integrating data from the irs fbi military police social security administration passport office immigration and naturalization service credit bureaus unemployment offices motor vehicle licensing offices and a dozen national mailing lists rosas department had used the system a number of times to locate people who had been exposed to infectious processes and dangerous toxins the address i got for fezler is in a place called brookline mulholland said i know where brookline is three thirtyone beech apartment twof rosa wrote down the address and then located it on her street map i found it she said another cab ride i dont know which frightens me the most with all these taxis ive been taking the fares or the drivers maybe its time to think about renting a car or borrowing one remember youre on sick leave no charging rentals to uncle rosa listen theres one more thing of interest while i was in boston one of my people here was sneaking in some more tests on lisas serum were getting a little above normal blip in her level of interferon interferon rosa took some time to process the development interferon a naturally produced antiviral protein was well known and extensively studied but still little understood in high doses it had definite anticancer effects in the lower amounts produced by the human body it almost certainly played a role in keeping chronic viral infections like herpes and chicken pox in check ken she said finally walk me through your thoughts on this well the way i see it right now lisas got a subclinical nosymptoms infection with crv the growth of the virus is held in check by her own interferon antibodies or more likely both sort of a biological mexican standoff i suspect we all have dozens of different viral infections smoldering in our bodies like that some of them may even be ones that cause certain forms of cancers anyhow heres this smoldering crv infection not getting any worse not getting any better then some specific stress comes along to upset the delicate balance like labor and bam the virus gets the upper hand and begins doing more and more of whatever thing its dna tells it to do in our cases inappropriate activation of the clotting pathway exactly then the stress is removed and the body summons up more interferon and more antibodies until balance is restored but are there ever any knockouts i mean of the virus maybe some mulholland said maybe lots but the herpes simplex modelthe one we know the most aboutsuggests that there are lots of draws anyone who has ever had cold sores or sun blisters pop out over and over again can attest to that the whole field of chronic viral infections is still too new to know precisely how it all works ken this is beginning to come together perhaps theres still a load of questions only now we know who probably has the answers rosa echoed matt daniels to see mr mallon matt said he glanced past the receptionist through the glassenclosed library and out at boston harbor several years before he had actually sent in a resume to the firm of wasserman and mallon he had been granted an interview with a junior partner who produced a ball for matt to autograph and asked perhaps one or two questions unrelated to sports during their twentyminute session the man whose name matt could not remember had not even bothered to suggest that his application would get serious consideration it had not been necessary for matt to explain to jeremy mallon his reason for wanting a meeting roger phelps had laid the necessary groundwork given the choice of sites matt had opted for mallons office perhaps in some sort of grand ironic gesture to that sanctimonious junior partner there was also of course the more practical matter of his not yet having cleaned up the glass and shattered furniture from his own office mr mallon will see you now the receptionist announced in a pronounced british accent will he now matt muttered to himself wondering if the accent had been a requirement in the original job description the jeremy mallon who met matt at his office door was clearly the worse for wear his face was drawn and pale his slightly bloodshot eyes enveloped in gray hollows the odor of mouthwash hung heavily about him and matt suspected he had spent a goodly portion of the previous night in his cups you wired for sound this time mallon asked after closing the door why should i bother with that i have the tape i need you threatened phelps to get that tape you threw a baseball at his head jeremy at six or seven feet if i was throwing at his head roger would have been awarded first base and a bed in intensive care how do i know the wire actually worked how do i know theres anything at all on that tape matt grinned ruefully always the lawyer he said well first of all jeremy it makes no difference if i have that tape or not once a bar overseers investigator is pointed in the right direction he wont have to be any rocket scientist to figure out whats been going on and second i didnt come over here to blackmail you i came over to get the case against my client discharged once and for all done mallon interjected quickly are you speaking for the graysons you may assume that i also want to know exactly what changed to prompt you to instruct phelps to settle in the first place i might be able to tell you that first though id like it if we could come to some sort of an understanding like what like we have a position open in this firm you want it its yours junior partner for two years then full guaranteed one fifty a year to start thousand of course he withdrew a document from his desk ive had the contract drawn up the guarantee is spelled out in it ive already signed it just sign it at the bottom and your names on the door matt glanced at the two pages they were titled simply agreement they might just as well have been titled set for life he thought about harry and what income like this at this stage of the game would mean to them both you dont have much of a poker face mallon said matt folded the agreement and slipped it into his inside jacket pocket ill have to study this he said now i want to know why you offered to quit the baldwin case because you were starting to win thats why thats bullshit matt stood to leave wait wait will you just cool your jets matt stayed where he was he did not sit back down okay okay mallon said i grant you the case is still a tossup but you were coming on strong too strong and i realized that i made a mistake in preparing the case namely will you sit back down for chrissakes thank you namely i should never have gotten involved with that egomaniac ettinger it was an accident that i called the bastard to begin with he was on tv so much i figured he was a giant in the field of holistic healing he is no matt what he is is a liar and a vindictive liar at that it wasnt until after we went to that chinese guys shop that ettinger admitted he and your client had been lovers for three years he says he didnt think it was that important not important i mean give me a break my take is that he wanted desperately to get even with her so he insisted on being part of the team who cares that his past relationship to the defendant makes him about as useful to me as a pair of cement running shoes then he conveniently neglects to tell me that his fucking diet powder was invented by some guy who just happened to be working at the medical center of boston you mean pramod singh yes i mean pramod singh oh this ettinger is beautiful matt just beautiful what do you know about the powder i dont understand what youre driving at i dont know anything about the powder again matt stood to leave okay okay mallon said waving daniels back to his seat where in the hell did phelps find you anyhow in some south chicago junkyard he underestimated me ill say well the only thing i know about ettingers powderand thats the truthis that something very screwy is going on with the money all those chubby people are sending in go on after you brought up the diet powder thing at ettingers deposition i asked him to tell me everything about it he didnt of course but i really didnt expect him to goddamn egomaniac so i started to do some checking i put a couple of my sharpest people on it according to the charts on ettingers office wall and the quantity of product rolling out of his shipping operation each day that powder is taking off like a space shuttle ten thousand orders a week now and rising four million bucks a month so so we cant find the money what those tv shows of his are being aired all over the country but the addresses to send checks to and the phone numbers to call in orders to are different for different areas there are at least eight of them la chicago florida new york somehow the orders find their way to ettingers place in hillsboroughyou know xanadu but the moneys going every which way explain im assuming youre going to accept that partnership offer matt its a safe assumption tell me about the money it moves around faster than the pea in a shell game theres an office in each areaat least eight of em maybe more the money gets deposited in one area bank then it gets wiretransferred to another eventually it ends up in banks in the caribbean and europemaybe a dozen of them then it begins to work its way back to ettinger but from what we can tell so far the amount that comes back to him isnt close to the amount that goes out its like hes a junior partner in all this we dont have enough money ourselves to bribe all the bankers wed have to to sort out how ettinger or singh or whoever it is set up this laundry or where the rest of the money is but one thing has come to light that has big potential for us i mean big in addition to ettingers paychecks the xanadu foundation has received extensive support from someone named tj mcgrath maybe a million bucks worth so far and and crunchy granola generalyou know mcbhas been saved from bankruptcy by a huge grant from something called the mcgrath foundation until last week goddamn paris guarded the name of that foundation like it was the combination to his family safe saturday hes blowing up a building on the hospital grounds and starting construction on a new research facility hes paying for the whole extravaganza with mcgrath foundation money is this coincidence really going on we may be able to put glenn paris and his motley crew out of business for good do you know what kind of bonus is waiting for us if we can pull this off for everwell can you spell yacht matt grinned i always was very good at spelling he said is that all you know about the powder so far my people are still working on it when can i expect to get that signed agreement back within the day i promise excellent were all looking forward to having you on board a most appropriate figure of speech matt tried unsuccessfully to think of a way to avoid shaking hands with the man cheerio he said to the receptionist as he headed through the art gallery and out to the elevators he left the plush office building and had not walked half a block when he came to a grizzled old man pushing a shopping cart full of bulging plastic bags empty bottles and other junk gday matt said handing over a fivedollar bill howre you doing cant complain bucko cant complain the old man said with a broad grin he wore a red bandana around his tangled gray hair and had a rolledup green plastic bag looped around his neck the bag was tied in a fourinhand knot that was actually quite passable in addition to perhaps a new tie he also needed dental care in the worst way whats your name matt asked siggins the man said alfie siggins well mr siggins i have good news for you he took out mallons agreement crossed off his own name wrote in alfies and helped him sign it see that building over there number one hundred go on up to the twentyninth floor show the receptionist this contract and tell her that you are mr mallons new partner if the security guard tries to stop you just show that to him sell it back to them if you want but dont sell it cheap what do i have to lose bucko alfie siggins said you got nothing to lose alfie matt replied nothing at all here take this ol rabbits foot for luck its on a roll matt watched until the man and his shopping cart disappeared into number federal plaza then he headed for the lot where he kept his car phelpss tape would be in the hands of the board of bar overseers within a day now it was time to let sarah know that thanks to the plaintiffs expert witness she was no longer the defendant in a malpractice suit then provided she was not on call he would beg her to celebrate their victory by going for a walk together boldly and unabashedly holding hands in public sarah was summoned to glenn pariss office where she was informed that until further notice she was no longer a resident physician on the staff of the medical center of boston the joint executive committee decision did not come as much of a surprise and she took the news with little emotion in truth she was drained almost beyond feelingbeaten by an unknown adversary who had systematically methodically destroyed her what few believers she still had at mcb could hardly be expected to stand by her after this latest movement in her carefully orchestrated decimation now there was really nowhere for her to go but home later she would call matt he would understand she had been set up once again at least he might before going up to clean out her locker sarah stopped by the labor and delivery floor to see annalee a uniformed private security guard posted by her door firmly and not too politely refused to allow her in she returned to the nurses station and wrote a note to annalee reaffirming her innocence and explaining as best she could what had been done to both of them she had just finished the note and was searching for an envelope when one of the nurses handed her one she was about to thank the woman for the envelope when she realized that dr sarah baldwin was typed on the front of it a pink lady just dropped this off for you the nurse said referring to one of the salmonjacketed volunteers she turned and left before sarah could voice any acknowledgment if you are interested in learning about rattlesnake poisoning go to room thayer i will call you there at exactly six pm tell no one about this until you hear what i have to say you were framed the note was neatly typed and unsigned sarah glanced at her watch five fiftyfive she folded the note and the one she had written to annalee and thrust them both into her pocket then she raced through the tunnel to the thayer building and took the elevator to the fifth floor room was at the very end it was exactly six when she reached the door inside the phone was ringing without knocking sarah hurried into the dark room and across to the bedside phone as she reached it the door slammed shut behind her the blackness was immediate and total before she could react a blanket was thrown around her from behind and she was thrown facefirst onto the bed she cried out and tried to resist but the blanket and the weight of her assailant made movement almost impossible please no she cried the man on top of her thrust his pelvis tightly onto her buttocks then he grabbed her hair in his fist and forced her face into the pillow an instant later she felt a sharp needlestick pain in the back of her scalp please she cried again please no her voice was muffled in the soft feather pillow seconds later a tidal wave of dizziness and nausea washed over her her arms and legs began to shake violently her breathing grew heavy the man remained on top of her although he no longer had to work to hold her down she was helpless and fighting a rapidly losing battle to maintain consciousnessa losing battle to remain alive please she whimpered please this time there was no sound no sound at all her thoughts quickly dispersed and the darkness grew even more oppressive for a few seconds she could hear the gurgle of air being sucked desperately into her lungs then that sound too disappeared relentlessly the oppressive darkness consumed her then suddenly mercifully her terror vanished chapter it was nearing six when rosa arrived back at the brookline apartment building that had until about two years before been the home of warren fezler she had interviewed as many of the buildings residents as would answer their doorbells and had then returned to biovir to see if there was anyone they might have missed who could add to what little she had learned of the man by and large her efforts had been fruitless according to the few neighbors with whom rosa had been able to speak fezler had been a quiet most unobtrusive tenant until one day he simply did not return home his furniture had been put in storage and eventually auctioned off the secretary at the rental agency swore that no rental application was ever thrown out for at least five years after a tenant moved away but apparently warren fezlers was an exception rosa glanced up at the apartment building it was dinnertime perhaps people were home now at some of the noanswers perhaps one of those she had interviewed had remembered something suareztype thoroughness demanded one more crack at the neighbors and before she quit for the day she knew she would do it but reluctant to start ringing doorbells again she wandered off through the gathering evening searching for some other move that made sense details she thought as she headed absently down the street think about the man think about warren fezler she had already passed by the smallish upscale market when she stopped the air outside the market was rich with the aroma of fresh breads cut flowers and bins of fruits food judging from the descriptions of fezler prior to his remarkable transformation he had been pounds or more food would quite possibly have been at the epicenter of his life and if so a gourmet market not a block from his home would have been the equivalent of a hangout rosa started with the cashiers and worked her way through the employees in the store with the fourth person she questioned an older man working behind the meat counter she hit pay dirt course i know warren the butcher said he was about the nicest guy who ever came in this place a real sweetheart never talked muchhe had that speech thing you know but hed give you the shirt off his back has he been in recently not for a while a few months maybe probably not since sometime this past summer a few months fezler had left his apartment two years ago yet he continued coming to this little market any idea why he stopped shopping here or where i might find him rosa asked nope but ill bet mrs richardson knows shes a sweet old lady cant see much and cant walk too well neither i dont think she has anyone warren used to bring her groceries to her to save her a little money since he stopped coming around weve had to deliver poor old gal three dollars a bag hurts someone like her bullseye rosa said fifteen minutes later she was brewing tea and straightening out the kitchen of elsie richardson the spinster who certainly was ninety and very possibly much older than that lived in a cluttered tworoom basement apartment with three cats none of whom seemed any younger than she did she moved with excruciating slowness on swollen feet and ankles and had only enough vision to make it about her place but she seemed somehow to be managing and her mental clarity was spiced with surprising wit its miss not mrs she had corrected rosa i kept waiting to marry a man who was smarter than i was and he never came along at least not until mr fezler its so nice to hear mr fezlers all right she said now he hasnt called in weeks i dont know if hes all right or not miss richardson im trying to find him i take a little lemon and sugar dear the lemons on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator lefthand side i know where that is but i dont know where mr fezler is he never said such a kind man do you know how we met i fell thats how right in front of the market he helped me up and brushed me off and that was the last time i had to go out to the store six dollars a week thats what he saved me to say nothing of the money he gave me i tried to refuse but he just left it anyway he sounds like quite a guy rosa said flashing on the horrible descriptions of the women who died of dic miss richardson is there any place he might have gone ifif he was in some trouble any friends or relatives none that i can wait he has a sister her name is mary no no not mary martha my sister martha he talked about her all the time like that i cant believe that i didnt remember oh im so sorry youre doing wonderfully miss richardson rosa said setting a tea biscuit on the womans saucer was marthas last name fezler do you know no im afraid i she suddenly brightened the calendar she said calendar mr fezler said it was from his sisters place he gave it to me because the numbers are big he hung it up for me too but im afraid i never look at it its in there dear she pointed through her bedroom door the calendar hanging on a side wall had a photo of a hugebreasted platinum blond model on the top half she was scantily clad in skintight overall shorts and was holding a gasoline can printed on the calendar was fezler marine and automotive repair shop martha fezler prop mercruiser specialists the address of the shop printed at the very bottom was in gloucester a city rosa knew was thirty or so miles north of boston she wrote it and the phone number down then she straightened up the bedroom as best she could gave elsie richardson a hug and twenty dollars and headed back to her rooming house if martha fezler was not actually hiding her brother she knew where he was every ounce of intuition was telling her so rosa walked to the closest thoroughfare and flagged a cab she felt elated soon very soon her career as an epidemiologist would be over but not before the ghost of bart was at last laid to rest ruth hi its matt im sorry to call you at home thats all right how did your session with mr mallon go theyre dropping the baldwin suit oh thats wonderful just wonderful congratulations thanks ruth listen im at the medical center of boston and i cant find sarah have you heard from her yes she called just before i left an hour or so ago i put the message on your desk she said shes not going to be on duty tonight shes staying at the hospital until six or so and will be home after that she sounded upset from what ive been able to learn she has reason to be thanks ruth ill see you tomorrow and thanks for getting my office cleaned up is there anything else i can do no you switched the phone over to the answering machine i always do that mr daniels i know i know good night ruth ill see you tomorrow matt set down the pay phone receiver and glanced about the busy lobby area it was sixthirty sarah said she would be leaving the hospital at six but her new bicycle was still chained outside she had not answered her motorola page nor had she responded to two separate voice pages by the hospital operator a call to her apartment had gotten only her answering machine and there were no messages from her on the one at his home something significant and unpleasant had occurred involving sarah and a patient matt had learned that much although no one around mcb seemed anxious to share details apparently she was being asked to take a leave from the hospital glenn paris to whom matt had been referred for details had been tied up in some sort of emergency meeting now feeling more anxious and uncomfortable by the moment matt again sought the ceo out in his thayer building office im sorry mr paris is tied up on a call his harried secretary said break in tell him its matt daniels and that its an emergency but do it please or ill do it myself less than a minute later he was ushered into pariss inner office you cant possibly think she would do such a thing matt exclaimed after paris recounted the events surrounding annalee ettinger mallon and the graysons have dropped the malpractice suit against her completely doesnt that tell you something look all i know is that this hospital has received more negative publicity in the last six months than in the previous six years and your client is involved in virtually every bit of it we had to put her on leave until the dust settles and we can sort out whats happened isnt it clear whats happened somebodys tried to frame her for sarahs sake i hope thats true i like her daniels i really do but as things stand we have to take action thats in the best interest of the medical center of boston and our patients there are a good number of people on our medical staff and board of trustees who think that she is a very sick and dangerous person thats utter nonsense i hope so but at this point theres nothing i can or want to do listen sarah hasnt answered her page for the past hour do you have any idea where she might be now no youve made a mistake matt said as i said i hope so paris responded matt was already heading out the door he made another pass through his office and home answering machines and left another message on hers then he called the hospital operator who again attempted to reach sarah by her beeper and the hospitalwide loudspeaker system tell me matt asked when you cant get hold of residents who are supposed to be on duty whats usually going on that doesnt happen very often the woman said but when it does our motorolas have a display window but they also can be voice activated usually if a resident is on call and doesnt respond their page unit is defective and theyre asleep in the house officers quarters they wouldnt be able to hear me on the overhead there is none there we use the room phones where are those rooms can you call them thayer building fourth and fifth floor but i cant call every room there are about twenty or twentyfive of them look matt said just in case could you please keep paging dr baldwin over her beeper every couple of minutes use the voice mode its very very important youve got my name in case she calls in ill check back with you shortly and thank you thank you very much shes gone for a walk or else shes sleeping in one of the oncall rooms matt told himself as he headed up to thayer four either possibility makes perfect sense shes upset over whats happened a nap or a long walk id do one or the other so would she he began going from room to room knocking on each door then trying the knob most of the small oncall quarters were open and empty two rooms were locked but in both a sleepy voice responded to his knock a third though unlocked was also occupied the resident within fully dressed lying facedown spreadeagle on the narrow bed was so deeply asleep that he barely stirred when matt knocked and entered youve got to really want it matt thought gazing down at the exhausted young physician he closed the door with unnecessary care and headed up to the fifth floor the sixth or seventh door he tried was locked he knocked and waited for the expected sleepy response there was none he knocked again this time a bit louder only visions of the spreadeagle man on the fourth floor kept him from kicking at the door he decided to check the rest of the floor before knocking any more forcefully but then just as he was about to turn away he heard a womans voice broadcasted from within the room dr baldwin dr sarah baldwin please call the operator dr baldwin dr sarah baldwin the operator please sarah matt cried out kicking the base of the oak door with force the retort piercing as a gunshot echoed down the empty corridor sarah matt stepped back and rammed the sole of his shoe into the center of the door with all his strength the wood split a second kick opened a hole large enough for him to peer into the dimly lit room sarah was lying peacefully and motionless on the bed beside her on a portable iv pole a plastic intravenous bag was draining its solution into her arm matt reached through the hole and unlocked the door from within sarah was warm but her color was poor and she was not breathing he found a shutoff valve on the intravenous tubing and shut the infusion off he hollered her name and checked her neck and wrist for a pulse there was none that he could feel he tilted her head back pinched her nose closed and tried several mouthtomouth breaths after the third one he thought he felt her jaw move again he cried out her name then impulsively he slapped her sharply across the face she responded with a single gurgling breath he slapped her again again she took a breath battling dread unlike any he had ever known matt snatched up the phone and dialed the operator i found dr baldwin he said breathlessly shes in cardiac arrest fifth floor thayer building please get a team up here now chapter october it was a nightmare within a nightmare at some level of her mind sarah struggled to believe thatto remember that as a teen she had always awakened always been safe and in her bed but there was nothing she could do with her thoughts and absolutely nothing she could do with her body to stem the helplessness the pain and the unremitting terror as they had during countless dreams in her early life rough hands pinned her on her back then tied her down she fought to free herself until her arms and legs burned but the bonds were like steel then thick powerful fingers began forcing a wadded cloth between her teeth she pushed against the cloth with her tongue she shook her head violently from side to side but the gag was thrust deeper and deeper into her mouth clogging the back of her throat and choking her she strained to pull in air through swollen narrowed nostrils her efforts grew weaker she prayed for unconsciousness or even death but always there was just enough air to keep going just enough to prolong the agony please let me die please just let me go to sleep and die sarah honey listen to me its matt try to hold still and listen better thats better you can keep your eyes closed but please listen sarah youre on a ventilator theres a tube down your nose and one down your throat and into your lungs helping you breathe and theyve got you strapped down squeeze my hand if you understand all that good good just try and keep calm honey im going to tell the nurse youre waking up sarah felt matts huge comfortable hand squeeze hers and then vanish she strained to separate nightmare from nightmare bit by bit she remembered as her consciousness and awareness grew so did the indescribable discomfort of the endotracheal breathing tube and the fearsome sensation of air hunger she could hear the ventilator bucking and whirring as it fought against her own attempts to breathe clearly it was set on automatic rather than assist it was set to breathe for her not necessarily with her slow down she begged herself dont fight it remember what you tell patients on vents easy now go with it relax and go with it meditate find the swan find your spirit find it and just watch it fly sarah can you hear me sarah open your eyes its alma alma young there thats it sarah blinked against the blurriness and the sting of light gradually her vision cleared the sicu nurse was looking down at her with concern they were full in the medical icu she said we all wanted you in here anyway and dr blankenship said okay one of the other nurses called to tell me what had happened and i came back in to special you do you understand all that good im going to undo the restraints on your wrists please dont touch the tube understand good sarah waited patiently as the broad leather straps were loosened and then removed her pounding headache was subsiding she was fully awake now and rapidly regaining control someone had tried to kill her someone had injected her beneath her scalp with something rapidly acting and incredibly potent now she was on a vent all those school psychologists and university psychiatrists had been wrong the recurring dreams that had once so plagued and disrupted her life had never been a distorted reenactment of some terrible event hidden in her past rather they were a prophesy just as louis hans thai healer had intimated they might be this was the struggle for which the dreams were preparing her this was the battle of her life and she had survivedfirst in chinatown and now in the sicu thanks in some way to the horrible nightmares she was continuing to endure against whatever evil was trying to crush her to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose sarah flexed some circulation into her hand and then reached up and pointed to the endotracheal tube i know i know alma said as soon as we get your blood gas results im going to call anesthesia and dr blankenship and see if we can get that tube out are you okay for now good ive switched your vent to demand so you can breathe any way you want you sure youre okay sarah i just want to say that whatevers going on will pass if you let it theres never the need to do what you thought you had to but listen we can talk about all that later im just glad youre all right a respiratory therapist came in and drew a sample of blood from the line in sarahs radial artery during the interminable half hour that followed matt stayed beside her doing what he could to keep her calm and filling her in on the events surrounding her resuscitation it was morphine in the iv bag he said the empty vials were on the floor dr blankenship says we got to you just in time whatever the emergency team gave you worked incredibly well youve actually been awake for most of the night but the nurses have been giving you stuff so that they could keep you on the ventilator the box of acupuncture needles that you reported as stolen was on the desk in that room along with an unopened vial of the rattlesnake venom and a scribbled unsigned note on a prescription blank that just said im sorry the door to the room was bolted from the inside right now im about the only one in this hospital who doesnt believe you tried to kill yourself am i right sarah squeezed his hand and nodded as vigorously as she could manage i knew it matt whispered its been at least oh three or four months since any woman who was my lover tried to kill herself squeeze my hand if you think that was funny oh i see listen there have been some wild things going on in this ayurvedic powder businessnot the least of which is that mallon is going to tell the graysons to drop their suit against you not settle drop ill tell you all the details later rosa told you she found out who engineered that virus right the guy who stutters but she wouldnt tell you or anyone else his name right well now she thinks she knows where he is she tried calling you at home and at the hospital to bring you up to date finally one of the nurses told her what had happened and exactly where you were and she showed up here around eleven last night she came in again at two this morning she really cares about you id be surprised if shes slept any more than i have she wont say where this virus guy is but shes driving there today to try to find him elis arranging for her to use a hospital car for the day no questions asked hey hang on now pal almas coming and i think the anesthesiologist is with her the news from the laboratory was excellent sarahs blood gasesher ph oxygen and carbon dioxide levelswere all good enough for her to come off of assisted ventilation the sensation of having her trachea suctioned out and then the endotracheal tube pulled was one sarah hoped never to experience again she sputtered and gagged and coughed spasmodically but again matt was there for her steadying her through the coughing jag stroking her arm even kissing her on the forehead careful you dont get disbarred she rasped when the cough had finally subsided i told you theyre dropping the case i wont be your attorney anymore we can go public in fact ive rented a sound truck for later today just to cruise the streets and tell the people of boston that i love you and that were going to get to the bottom of this i love you too matt i really do hey what time is it anyhow six a little after god twelve hours of my life gone just like that it could have been all of it matt reminded her sarahs response was cut short by the sound of a throat being politely cleared standing at the foot of the bed was a rumpled graying man wearing a red clipon bow tie he held sarahs looseleaf sicu record cradled open in one arm and peered down at it through ben franklin spectacles although she had never met or even seen the man sarah correctly guessed his specialty before he introduced himself im dr goldschmidt he said im a psychiatrist sir if youll excuse us for a few minutes this is matt daniels sarah said quickly hes mymy lawyer goldschmidt eyed matt for a few seconds perhaps he should stay then he said if its all right with you please she said hoarsely very well then i know youve been through a lot and that they just took your breathing tube out so ill be as brief as i can he moistened his thin bluish lips with his tongue tell me dr baldwin have you ever tried to hurt yourself before last night sarahs eyes flashed she glanced over at matt who motioned for her to keep calm the answer is no but i did not try to hurt myself last night either dr goldschmidt someone tried to kill me and make it look like suicide i see goldschmidt said scratching something down in her chart but how do you explain the door being bolted from inside someone had a key perhaps but from what ive been told even housekeeping and maintenance dont have keys to those rooms i didnt try to kill myself dr baldwin i just want to help you then let me go home you know i cant do that why matt asked i have been assigned dr baldwins case by dr blankenship because it is hospital policy for every attempted suicide to have a psychiatrist and i am on call for my department today her current diagnosis ishe read from her chartnarcotic overdose suicide attempt i have both the power and the obligation to hospitalize her on a secured mental health unit until i am convinced she is neither a danger to herself nor to others surely you as a lawyer can appreciate the importance of my doing just that i do yes matt said he thought about all he wanted to accomplish that day to clarify the connection linking peter ettinger the mcgrath foundation and the medical center of boston what safer place could sarah be for the moment than on a locked closely controlled ward sarah he said i think youve got to go along with whatever he says at least for the time being if the psychiatrist appreciated the support it did not show on his face which looked tense he was about to speak when eli blankenship strode up beside him thanks for coming in so promptly mel blankenship said sarah are you okay im feeling better every second dr blankenship please tell dr goldschmidt that im not crazy and i didnt try to kill myself no one ever said you were crazy listen someone injected me with something right here under my hair and tried to make it look like i killed myself blankenship studied her scalp with a penlight and then shook his head nothing it was a tiny needle a twentynine gauge or smaller shave my hair off if you need to sarah pleaded youll find it sarah please just be patient with us and let us do our jobs alma says that your lungs are clear and your vital signs are stable within an hour or two when were sure your larynx isnt going to go into spasm id like you transferred out of here to dr goldschmidts service apparently theyre going to be very tight on beds here when the surgical schedule starts where am i going the only place you can go and stay in this hospital is underwood six matt please thats a locked ward dont let them do this sarah it wont be for long besides with what happened last night id worry if you were anywhere else ive got things to do and people to see today to try and sort out this powder business just go for today and then well see what we can do im telling you theres a needle puncture mark someplace under my hair where the man who tried to kill me injected something please dr baldwin goldschmidt said im sorry if you have something against psychiatrists or dont trust me in particular i do want to help you but its sixthirty in the morning ive been up most of the night and i have a full day of patients and consultations ahead of me try not to make this situation any more difficult than it is sarah listen blankenship said my gut tells me that youre okay and that youre telling the truth but there really is nothing else we can do right now ill tell you what twentyfour hours of observation and ill do everything in my power to convince dr goldschmidt and the staff to send you home i promise sarah studied the determined expressions on the three mens faces and then reluctantly agreed to the transfer the psychiatrist wrote a brief note in her chart and promised to be by to see her on underwood six as soon as he had a break in his schedule one of the psych residents would be by to do her intake history and physical i can hardly wait sarah said the yellow vinyl police ribbons across the doorway of room on thayer five were not unlike those that had been used on kwong tianwens shop the door itself with its shattered center panel was shut matt checked to be sure he was unobserved then loosened the ribbon and slipped inside the iv pole was still there but the infusion bag was gone as was sarahs lacquered box there was no evidence that the room had been dusted for fingerprints there was no closet and no room for concealment except under the bed someone had found a way to get out and lock the door behind him matt inspected the lock which seemed no different from others on the floor certainly whoever it was could have called in a locksmith and had a key made but for the killer to purposely create such a witness hardly seemed likely he walked to the only windowed wall the two ancient doublehung windows were nearly opaque with months if not years of outside grime through them he could see the next building some hundred or hundred and fifty feet away screw holes told him that at one time in the remote past the windows had had latches replacing them had undoubtedly been a low item on the mcb maintenance list at five stories above the ground there was hardly any need for outside security then matt glanced down not three feet below the sill running the length of the building was the tattered slate roof of some sort of porch on the fourth floor the slight pitch of the roof was to all intents negligible matt opened the window and carefully stepped outside forcing himself not to look down he eased his way along peering into the other rooms on the fifth floor until he saw one that was empty the window like the one in room was not latched moments later he was standing in the deserted hall once again so much for that mystery he muttered it was possible that his discovery coupled with sarahs protestations would be enough to get her discharged but matt knew that it was in her best interests to spend at least this one day someplace safe and this was hardly the day he wanted to be worrying about her he still had few answers to the mystery of the ayurvedic herbal weight loss system but at least now he had the questions and he had a short list of those he felt could fill in the blanksbeginning with hospital comptroller colin smith he closed the door behind the yellow ribbons and hurried down the hall chapter sarah youre sure paris told you about the mcgrath foundation matt asked im positive hes known about a possible grant from the foundation for a year or more he told me that himself he said he was counting on the money to help get mcb out of the hole in fact i think colin smith mentioned it too if that much money is coming in it seems to me the chief financial officers got to know about it maybe he and glenn and peter are in it together somehow maybe hes skimming off the top before the hospital gets its share ill ask him hes numero uno on my list for today matt please listen to me im fine and i can take care of myself i dont want to get shipped off to the damn nut ward besides peters in all of this right up to his righteous selfcentered eyebrows and i want to help nail him it was nearly ninethirty in the morning sarah had just been notified that transportationand securitywere on their way to transfer her from the surgical intensive care unit to the locked psychiatric ward on underwood six sarah i know this isnt what you want matt said but the truth is youve been through hell youre just a couple of hours off a ventilator and ive never seen you look so tired if you dont go to the psych service freely goldschmidts going to have you committed as long as he believes you tried to commit suicide he doesnt really have much choice and theres something else we shouldnt forget since we both know you didnt try to commit suicide we also know that someone out there tried to kill you correction sarah said her voice still quite hoarse someone out there tried to make it look like i killed myself thats what administering that venom to annalee was all about matt dont you see it had to look like i attempted suicide because i was guilty of causing those other dic cases as well as trying to create one in her killing me in any other way would have said just the opposite were hitting somebodys raw nerve maybe peter maybe glenn maybe this dr singh maybe some combination of those i dont know but were getting close to the truth trying to set me up was a very desperate move weve got to get to the bottom of this before whoever did it tries something else i can help matt really i can i know but please there isnt anything i can do i hate the idea of your being on a locked ward as much as you do but for the next day weve got to go along with it even if we could somehow get you discharged which we cant id be worried about you every minute we werent together i talked to rosa and eli before i went to your apartment to get your things were going to be working like hell to find out whos behind all this and today weve got a lot of moving around to do hang in there for just this one day then i promise well do whatever we have to to get you sprung the brief meeting with blankenship had been fruitful matt had shared the details of his encounter with jeremy mallon and mallons belief that peter ettinger and glenn paris were somehow connected through the mcgrath foundation and the ayurvedic weight loss system blankenship knew the mcgrath foundation was based in new york city and that the heads of the philanthropic organization had made initial contact with glenn paris and colin smith some four or five years before he had never seen the application paris had submitted to the agency nor the actual terms of the grant but he did know that millions of dollars were involved he took on the job of trying to locate and penetrate the foundation he also would arrange for the car he had promised rosa the epidemiologist playing her cards close to the vest as always would say very little of where she was going or even whom she was after other than that she was still not at all certain of his whereabouts the strategy they decided upon for matt was to speak with colin smith then peter ettinger and finally glenn paris smith seemed to blankenship the likeliest of the three to crack if he did they could play one off against another and of course matt added if that approach did not work there was always good old plan bsome sort of spontaneous frontal attack transports here the charge nurse called over matt pulled the curtain closed and waited outside it while sarah changed into the jeans and sweatshirt he had brought from her apartment okay im ready as ill ever be she said the security guard kept a respectful perhaps embarrassed distance as the transportation worker pushed his wheelchair to sarahs bedside the visitors hours on underwood six are six to eight in the evening matt said i checked thats it just two hours matt took her hand in his it takes younger men days to accomplish what us older more experienced guys can do in two hours he said just be strong okay reluctantly sarah slid off the bed and into the wheelchair oh dont worry about me ill be fine she said as long as you dont let them keep me more than a day besides the cuisine on the psych ward is world famous they serve soup to nuts she pointed toward the sicu exit home jeeves the locked ward on underwood six was newly painted and furnished each room contained two single beds the exception was the room next to the nurses station which had no furniture at all except for uncovered mattresses on the floor and walls that made it literally a padded cell sarah had been on the ward for two hours before she noticed that the heavy screens were on the inside of the windows and the inside door handles were not there at all except for a brief physical exam by a male psych resident who used his stethoscope penlight and ophthalmoscope but seemed loath to touch any part of her body with his hands she was left pretty much alone the second bed in her room was for the moment at least unassigned for a time she lay on her bed trying to read an obstetrics journal then failing at that a sue grafton mystery finally when she could not even concentrate on good housekeeping she wandered out of the room and joined the eight or nine people who were hanging out in the lounge group in fifteen minutes everybody a woman called out in a cheerful singsong right here in the lounge attendance mandatory sarah gazed absently out of one of the windows she was on the side of the building facing the mcb campus streaming through the pane free of any breeze the autumn sun felt hot enough to bake bread far below to one end of the broad grassy mall workmen were completing construction of a temporary grandstandperhaps ten tiers high with a platform and podium at the top loudspeakers were mounted on poles to either side of the stands sarah was wondering about the setup when she looked across the campus the chilton building on the side farthest away from underwood was the site of intense activity it was friday the twentyeighth she suddenly realized demolition day minus one the huge old eyesore had been boarded up for as long as sarah had been at mcb the grass around it noticeably less well maintained than the rest of the mall tomorrow in just a few spectacular seconds the decaying structure would cease to exist the view of the extravaganza from underwood six would be astoundingperhaps the one real perk of being a patient on the locked ward resting on the window ledge was a scratched ancient pair of binoculars whose optics turned out to be surprisingly good the chilton building was cordoned off by two concentric rings of blue sawhorses huge canvas dust shields had been strung together and draped over the nearby parking garages a small group of men in shining metal hard hats were talking and gesturing up at the condemned structure but most of the workmen seemed to be packing up their gear apparently the preparation of the building and the laying of charges was complete sarah wondered if any of the officials from the mcgrath foundation would be at the next mornings festivities just then she noticed a white panel truck pull away from the deserted side of the building slowly and unobtrusively it eased through a small opening in the barriers and headed off through the binocs it was not difficult to make out the bright red block lettering on the truck huron pharmaceuticals the printing was repeated in smaller letters across the trucks rear doors the name struck a chord of some sort but why okay group everybody the singsong voice announced attendance mandatory no excuses lets get going huron pharmaceuticals sarah mulled as she took the seat that seemed the least conspicuous where in the hell had she run into that before where okay everyone the group leader said to the twenty or so patients on the locked ward weve got two new people with us today so i think its appropriate to go around the group for firstname introductions im cecily one of the group facilitators on underwood six marvin the wornout looking black man next to her said lynn im nancy dont ever call me nan pete peter sarah did not hear any of the succeeding names and had to be prompted to say hers when her turn came she had suddenly remembered why huron pharmaceuticals had seemed so familiar ours are standard fdaapproved multivitamins manufactured for us by huron pharmaceuticals peter ettinger had spoken those words at his deposition sarah was absolutely certain of it she heard them now in his voice and in her minds eye saw his smug expression as he delivered them first the mcgrath foundation and now huron pharmaceuticals two direct connections between peter ettinger the ayurvedic herbal weight loss system and the medical center of boston coincidence sarahs fists clenched tightly in her lap no fucking way she thought very well sarah cecily said if you dont want to share today we all certainly understand but i also must tell you that we frown on profanity during group chapter it was nearing noon traffic southbound on the central artery leading out of the city was light nevertheless matt was well aware of the vindictive nature of boston drivers and stayed in the middle lane intent on offending no one colin smith was out of the hospital for the remainder of the day his secretary reported an avid sailor he spent every friday afternoon from midapril to early november aboard his boat however she added a meeting had run late and he had left the office not twenty minutes ago if matts business with him was important he might try calling the south boston yacht club instead of calling matt had decided to show up at the dock unannounced he knew the way having been there several times during his red sox years and colin smith very much the cpa seemed like someone who might not do well with surprises before calling smith matt had stopped by eli blankenships office the medical chief had tried new york information in an attempt to reach the mcgrath foundation they were not surprised that there was no such listing the foundation had undoubtedly been established some years before with no purpose other than to prepare for the laundering of the huge profits projected from the sales of the ayurvedic herbal weight loss system whoever had set up the operation had remarkable foresight as well as keen insight into weightconscious doittheeasyway america properly marketed a nodiet slimming product with or without any proven effectiveness was a virtual gold mine and the ayurvedic herbal weight loss system was not only well marketed but actually seemed to work the way matt saw it the herbal product had been introduced and possibly developed at mcb by the mysterious indian ayurvedic physician pramod singh about four and a half years ago the powder was tested by singh and quite successfully so on at least three peoplealethea worthington constanza hidalgo and lisa summer there were probably more test subjects but fortunately none of the others had become pregnant and gone into labor eventually singh joined forces with peter ettinger and then with a marketing agency that had an understanding of the power of infomercial television king midas himself could not have done a more efficient job of turning their herbs and protein into gold a portion of the profits from the sale of the product was now finding its way into the coffers of the hospital perhaps in payment for the early work done there some other monies were at work fostering the establishment of xanadu and ettingers holistic healing empire but the rest according to jeremy mallons operatives the sums funneled to xanadu and the medical center of boston were still only fractions of what the marketing blitz was actually generating it was quite possible that colin smith did not have the whole picture of what was going on but he had to know something the south boston yacht club for many decades a landmark for boaters was a rambling threestory clapboard affair built on pilings easily visible from the expressway and from the harbor it was harder to get admitted into than a celtics playoff game a network of floating docks fanned out from the old building like spokes during the summer not one slip of the several hundred along the docks was unaccounted for and even this late in the season there were still a good number of boats in the water the dirtandgravel parking lot adjacent to the club was fenced off with access restricted by a guard house matt slipped a ten across to the attendant in exchange for allowing him unannounced to surprise his old college classmate colin smith following the attendants directions matt parked just behind the club and made his way down a stony slope onto the docks colin smiths boat the red ink was at the far end of spoke a thirtyfoot crimsonhulled catboat the attendant said the prettiest boat in the club smith was neatening some lines at the stern and was apparently alone his expression upon seeing matt approaching was not one of pleasure daniels he said dusting his hands off on his tan jeans and eyeing matt suspiciously what brings you down here business matt said simply with me mind if we sit down for a couple of minutes no longer though he motioned matt into the cockpit this is the nicest day in weeks im late as it is and i want to get out there you can sail her alone blindfolded im impressed listen colin have you seen this mornings paper you mean about their finding andrew truscotts body what was left of it what has that got to do with me maybe a lot sarah baldwin and i have been telling people all along that truscott was murdered no one believed us now they will from the day sarah was sued by willis grayson someone has been doing his damndest to make sure she appeared guilty of causing those dic cases truscott was murdered trying to prove she was being framed then last night someone tried to murder her and make it look like she had killed herself to be perfectly frank colin i think youre involved youre crazy i think you either did it or you know who did it smith stood up and began to uncleat one of his stern lines go chase an ambulance he said colin whats with the mcgrath foundation why is it sending money to your hospital at the same time its sending money to peter ettingers operation who started it whos the one thats really getting rich the money man finished uncleating the line and started loosening another matt looked for anger in his face but saw only fear and confusionhardly the expression of a man who was a willing participant in murder im heading out now daniels he said if you have accusations to make i think you should be talking to the police or to a lawyer not to me shit not plan b again matt sighed he grabbed smith by the front of his shirt and yanked him upright the spark of fear in the mans eyes intensified listen to me and listen good matt said through nearly clenched teeth he hoisted the smaller man up until he was on his tiptoes that fucking powder that everyone is getting rich off of is killing people dead young women and babies and god only knows who else you may not know that but somebody youre connected with does and that somebody doesnt give a damn whether people die or not as long as the bucks keep pouring in do you understand smiths weathered face was chalk let me go he said hoarsely matt loosened his grip then slowly released it every second you keep your mouth shut youre getting dirtier and dirtier i dont think youre behind all those people dying colin i wondered about you while i was driving out here but i can see now that youre not i actually think you might be a decent guy i am now get off matt handed over his business card its paris isnt it he said glenntheshowman paris and that dr singh get off you may not have known before today that people were dying matt said stepping up onto the dock but you do now so im holding you responsible for whatever happens from here on out you hold out women and babies die your fault get that call me when you change your mind about sharing what you know and have a real nice sail without waiting for a reply matt turned and stormed off he was twenty yards down the dock when the red inks engine rumbled to life matt slowed but continued walking his eyes straight ahead his concentration riveted on the man behind him come on he urged certain he had gotten to smith but not at all certain how deeply call out to me colin call me back daniels wait yes matt said he whirled around and had taken a single step back toward the red ink when it exploded it was a fierce molten petroleumdriven explosionone that no living thing could have survived reftexively matt dove belly first onto the coarse planking fiery debris clattered about him and hissed in the water seconds later the cabin cruiser in the slip adjacent to smiths catboat exploded in sympathy taking with it what remained of the seaward thirty feet of dock accident something rigged to the ignition something detonated by radio matt scrambled to his feet and brushed himself off he stepped to the smoldering edge of the dock and assured himself that there was no sign of colin smith then he spun back toward the clubhouse six or seven people were racing frantically onto the dock he scanned upward beyond the men to the parking lot just as a jadegreen jaguar xjs backed up and sped away spitting sand and gravel matt had no chance to make out the driver ill be right back he lied to the men as he dashed past them head down he sprinted up the slope to the parking lot his legacy only a year old was damn quick but the jaguar had quickness power and a huge head start if it reached the expressway unseen there would be no way of knowing whether it had turned north or south and that for all intents would be that matt cursed his habit of always activating his zloc security system he deactivated it and then lost several more precious seconds fumbling with the ignition key spraying a rooster tail of dust and gravel he shot past the bewildered attendant out of the lot and down the access road the jaguar was nowhere in sight immediately the guessing game began the first choice was no contest left at the paved road and head toward the expressway matt skidded around the first corner then cut the next one by speeding across a lawn the subarus engine usually remarkably silent was screechingfirst gear to fifth then to first then back to fifth still no jag another intersection more possibilities right keep heading toward the expressway to his left above the trees matt could see the expanding cloud of black smoke carried up and outward by an offshore breezethe breeze that colin smith just a few minutes before was expecting to fill his sails oh god matt whispered as the horror of what he had just witnessed sank in the expressway was just ahead and the chase just that close to being finished then far to the right matt saw the jag it was already up on the elevated highway speeding north toward the city but by the time matt had cut off half a dozen cars and a tractor trailer and darted out to the lefthand lane of the expressway the xjs was gone again he flashed past one offramp then another there was nothing he could do now but keep heading north and pray they were still both on the same highway the traffic slowed as he approached the mass ave exit and beyond it the south station tunnel the distance between cars quickly narrowed a vintage midday central artery tieup the chase was over matt slammed his fist against the wheel he would have to find some way to backtrack from the distinctive jag to its owner difficult perhaps he thought but certainly not impossi then once again matt spotted the car it was a hundred or so yards ahead and three bumpertobumper lanes over but even worse it had just pulled away from the jam and was now starting on the long circular drive leading down to the massachusetts turnpike matt leaned on his horn and began screaming emergency at anyone who looked over at him many did not inch by inch he took first one lane then another receiving along the way a number of obscene gestures several of which he had never seen before tires screeching he rode the very edge of control around the sweeping entry ramp and was going nearly sixty by the time he hit the turnpike the jag was gone again but this time matt was more relaxed the back bay exit was less than a mile ahead if the driver took it there was nothing matt could do but if not the cambridgeallston tolls would almost certainly bring them close in fact matt was several miles beyond allston almost to the newton tolls at route before he spotted his quarry i guess it was just meant to be he settled back in the seat slowed down and rolled through the automated ticket dispenser nine or ten cars behind the jag the trick now was to follow the driver to hisor herdestination without being seen for a year he had debated putting a phone in the subaru now a day late as usual he decided he would do it a call to the state police would have given them a crack at the radio control that had triggered the bomb aboard the red ink as things stood matt still had a chance at recovering itprovided the driver felt home free and not pressed to dispose of it the jag left the turnpike east of worcester moving now with no apparent urgency it headed into the beautiful rolling countryside of northcentral massachusetts matt still keeping well back had yet to catch a glimpse of the driver but with each passing mile it became less necessary for him to do so just a dozen or so miles ahead was hillsborough the home of xanadu and the ayurvedic herbal weight loss system and unless matt was absurdly off base the man in the jade motorcar in front of him was six feet four with thick silver hair and an ego the size of greenland xanadu entrance one mile ahead an exclusive residential community based on the healing principles of ayurveda live spiritually live longer live here homes starting at the huge billboardelegant lettering overlaid upon a himalayan sunrisealso included a number to call for an introductory tour and interview matt stopped by the sign as the man he assumed was peter ettinger drove on down the deserted newly paved road toward the entrance across the street two endless stretches of sevenfoot chainlink fence converged in what was probably one corner of xanadu xanadu matt knew the name came from a mystical magical land in some poemone that he had once been forced to study and it seemed even memorize in xanadu did kubla khan a stately pleasure dome decree his minds eye saw the words printed in an even hand on some teachers blackboard milton wordsworth maybe coleridge he simply could not remember the author nor could he remember anything else of the poem the image though of peter ettinger as kubla khan was not a hard one to conjure matt was sorting out his options when he heard a car approachingthe same direction from which he and ettinger had just come he ducked behind the subaru and inspected its right front tire just as a white panel truck flashed past continuing on along the road perpendicular to the one ettinger had taken having read ettingers deposition almost to the point of memorization matt immediately honed in on the name painted on the truck huron pharmaceuticals produced the vitamin capsules that were included with the ayurvedic weight loss powder assuming the truck was making a delivery and the billboard was pointing toward the main entrance there had to be some back way into xanadu matt scrambled into the legacy and followed the truck after half a mile another newly paved road cut off to the right as did the chainlink fence keeping a safe distance matt continued following the huron truck until it made a right turn onto a dirt road that apparently cut through the fence and into the sprawling compound he found a littleused path off the opposite side of the paved road left the subaru in a concealed spot and hurried across to where the truck had turned in the gate in the fence was about a hundred feet up the dirt track not surprisingly it was unlocked the huron delivery man clearly anticipated a quick turnaround matt glanced about then he slipped through the gate and headed into xanadu for about a hundred yards the dirt road snaked through dense woods the trees and bushes were well past fall peak but autumn had been unusually mild and they were still far from barren the forest ended suddenly at expansive acreage that had been carved out of the rolling woodland straight ahead of where matt crouched was an impressively large lake newly landscaped and probably manmade spaced along the far bank were new sumptuous homes merely within his line of sight matt could see several that appeared completed and several more that were under construction in xanadu did kubla khan the huron pharmaceutical truck was parked behind a complex of low whitewashed buildings set in a densely wooded grove a short distance to matts left to his right perhaps two hundred yards was a large twostory farmhouse also white with a singlestory wing jutting toward the spot where matt was hiding parked on the drive by the farmhouse was the xjs there was the hum of machinery coming from the buildings that matt assumed housed the herbal weight loss factory but there was no one in sight either there or at the farmhouse from the woods to the wing of the farmhouse was no more than twenty feet and from there to the jag fifteen more it seemed quite possible to reach the car unseen if it was unlocked he would take a crack at finding the radio detonation device failing that he would take as much of a look around as he could manage and then slip back out the way he had come even if he failed to uncover anything to connect ettinger with the death of colin smith there was always the chance that the attendant at the yacht club parking lot would have seen and remembered the jaguar or possibly even ettinger himself staying low and just within the tree line he crept to the rear of the farmhouse and flattened himself against the wall next he worked his way to the corner of the building and was gauging the distance to the jag when he heard sirens approaching from the direction of the main entrance he pushed back into the shadows not thirty seconds later two cruisers their sirens now cut sped up to the farmhouse and stopped on either side of ettingers car two officers stayed by the jag while two others raced to the front door of the farmhouse one of them had withdrawn his service revolver matt inched back into the woods and nestled into concealment in a shallow swale several minutes passed matt tried desperately to imagine what might be happening inside the farmhouse he strained to make out the exchange between the two remaining policemen they were close enough to him but with one seated in the cruiser and the other facing away their conversation was muffled finally the door to the farmhouse opened and the two officers emerged one on either side of a clearly agitated peter ettinger ettingers hands were manacled behind him i was there i admit that matt heard ettinger protest but dammit i didnt do anything colin smith called and told me to meet him at the yacht club at least he said he was smith remember mr ettinger one of the officers said like i told you inside anything you say may be used against you in court now is this the car you were driving yes of course it is and these are the keys you just gave me yes yes now go ahead and open it dammit theres nothing in there totally bewildered matt scrunched even deeper into the leafcovered gully how could the police have gotten here so quickly ettinger was a national celebrity and the jag hardly an inconspicuous car perhaps the lot attendant or someone else at the club had recognized him got it the officer searching the car said after just a minute or so under the front seat he held up by its edges what was clearly a radio control box someone get me an evidence bag will you mr ettinger do you really think were that dumb ettinger suddenly stoopshouldered and almost limp gazed from the policeman to the control box and back even at some distance matt could see the filmy confusion in his eyes i want to call my lawyer he said from the station mr ettinger ettinger was helped into the screenenclosed back of one of the cruisers the slam of the door echoed in the still afternoon matt waited until well after the cruisers had disappeared before he worked his way over to the factory he assumed there were security people about someplace but without ettinger around to identify him he could be a bit more brazen some sort of inspector perhaps yes he thought as he backed against the wall of the smallest of the factory buildings better not to get caught but if he did a health inspector story should work there was a small anteroom near where the huron truck was parked matt glanced around for the driver and then rolled along the wall and peered in the window the space was empty save for two freezers both topopening each had huron pharmaceuticals painted across the front in letters identical to those on the truck neither appeared locked a final check around him and matt slipped inside the halfglassed door from the anteroom to the main building was closed through it matt could see twenty or more women each at a work station filling shipping boxes with what he assumed were the components of the ayurvedic herbal weight loss system he backed away from the door and moved to the freezer that was out of the line of sight of any of the women keep vitamins frozen until shipment was stenciled on the lid carefully he twisted the handle to one side and eased up the heavy lid the fitted rack containing sheets of vitamin capsules completely filled the space just beneath the lid matt studied the sheets for a moment they were identical to those sarah had received from annalee ettinger each contained ninety capsulesa threemonth supply he was about to lower the freezer lid when for no particular reason he lifted one of the racks the body beneath it a mans lay serenely on its back eyes open it was staring sightlessly up at matt it was dressed in a dark business suit and red silk tie and fit into the freezer with no more than an inch or two to spare at each end its hands and bronze mustached face were covered by a thin film of rime but matt had no difficulty recognizing the man he had seen him a number of times on videotape and had wondered about him often over recent weeks pramod singh the xfactor in the ayurvedic puzzle was a factor no more suddenly queasy matt lowered the freezer lid and wiped off the handle with his jacket then he slipped out the back door and braced himself against the building breathing deeply and deliberately fighting the vision and the nausea sarah nearly murdered colin smith and pramod singh dead peter ettinger either guilty of killing them or more likely set up to look guilty someone was tying up loose ends in a hurry someone was panicking relax matt said to himself just get the hell out of here and back to sarah he sensed the presence behind him an instant before he saw the shadow on the wallthe shadow of an arm slashing downward toward his head he began to react but way way too late an object heavy and unyielding slammed onto a spot just behind his right ear his teeth snapped together as paralyzing pain exploded through his head and into his neck the last thing he saw was the ground careening up toward his face chapter rosa suarez had just passed the gloucester rotary at the end of route when the medical centers ancient chevy wagon began handling strangely she sped up wondering if perhaps she had snagged a branch but the problem only worsened cursing softly in spanish she pulled over as things were she had gotten off to a much later start than she had wanted if martha fezler closed her shop early for any reason the day and possibly the whole weekend would be lost she carefully folded the map that was spread open on the passenger seat and slid across chastising herself for not renting instead of borrowing the wagon she stepped out onto the soft shoulder and into the hazy midafternoon glare the problem it was immediately apparent was the right rear tire which was shredded and hanging off the rim in spots rosa had never in her life changed a tire she opened the rear door and located the jack and the spare then she retrieved the owners manual from beneath a stack of repair receipts in the glove compartment if the procedure seemed clear to her she decided she would give it a try if not she would risk flagging someone down she returned to the rear of the wagon engrossed in the instruction manual hi the mans greeting startled her so she dropped the instruction book he was standing a few feet away arms folded grinning kindly he was in his late twenties rosa guessed with a fine handsome face and wirerimmed glasses he wore a woolen seamans cap and a dark windbreaker his car was parked twenty or so feet behind hers its hazard lights flashing sorry if i frightened you he said i just stopped to see if you needed a hand rosa took a calming breath assured herself that her heart was still beating and retrieved the manual oh my she said patting her chest you did startle me yes but i thank you for stopping its very kind of you as a matter of fact if i change this tire myself it will be a first for me id be happy to do it for you the man came forward and pulled out the jack and spare he walked with a fairly marked limp caused by his left leg which seemed not to bend at the knee at all she hoped the problem was nothing permanent an old college football injury he said setting the jack in place i often wish i could have that moment back oh im terribly sorry i didnt mean to be staring you werent really its just that i notice things except that i didnt notice that linebacker if i had dodged to the left instead of to the right who knows where my life might have gone you heading into gloucester as a matter of fact i am are you from there temporarily im a biologist with the department of marine fisheries were doing a lobster project up here how interesting im a scientist with the government too an epidemiologist at the centers for disease control atlantas a nice place he said although a little hot for my taste one hint in changing a tire is always to loosen the lugs before you jack up the car it makes everything much easier and safer wherere you headed in gloucester a place called fezler marine never heard of it the man took off his cap and wiped his brow with the back of his hand his hair was the color of the sun he had all the physical attributes of a movie star or a model rosa noted yet here he was a highly educated scientist she was impressed its on breen street she added never heard of that either he said jiggling the spare into place and spinning the lugs back on maybe i should pay more attention to where im living i suspect you have more important things on your mind id like to pay you for helping me im very nonsense i could use a cup of coffee though if youd like im sorry i would very much like to learn about your work but i really must get going im terribly late hey no problem my names darryl its been a pleasure rosa she said thank you so much the man smiled warmly shook her hand and then hobbled back to his car and drove off rosa glanced at her watch fifteen minutes was all it had taken dios hace las cosas she said as she slid back behind the wheel and headed into gloucester god provides two sets of service station directions and two missed turns later rosa found breen street it was tucked among a tangle of narrow waterfront byways that were paved but were probably still laid out exactly as they were when the revolutionary war began fezlers marine railway and automotive was a huge decaying shingled barn flanked by two equally dilapidated wooden warehouses the whole area seemed like a tinderboxa conflagration just waiting to happen rosa drove nearly two blocks away before she found a street wide enough for parking both of the large streetside doors and a smaller entrance just around the corner of the building were closed rosa knocked once waited knocked again waited and finally entered shutting the door behind her it was as if she had taken a step back in time the inside of fezlers marine railway was as cluttered and dimly lit as it was spacious tools some fairly modern many antique filled the barnside walls lines and chains and hauling blocks of various sizes hung everywhere the atmosphere was heavy with the pungent odor of oil grease and gasoline to one side of the shop was a large rolltop desk cluttered with invoices magazines and catalogs above the rolltop was the same calendar rosa had seen in elsie richardsons bedroom from somewhere on the far side of the shop classical music was playing almost certainly mozart rosa thought hello she called out no one responded there was an enclosed loft on the water side accessed by an open staircase that climbed up one wall rosa glanced upward at the moment someone closed the door at the top of the stairs hello she called again is anyone here in the back a gravelly voice hollered rosa followed the voice toward the music and the water the huge doors at the rear of the building were open to the harbor a set of steel rails rose up from the water cut through an opening in a narrow platform and leveled off on the floor of the shop two feet above the tracks hung a large marine engine it was suspended perhaps thirty feet from the ceiling by a complicated series of pulleys and lines standing beside the engine working on it was a woman she was not impressively tall but she was physically imposing in almost every other respect big was the only word that came to rosas mind not fat not even heavyalthough she most certainly was that just big her broad shoulders and back splayed the straps of her greasestained bib overalls the sleeves of her black tshirt were stretched to the limit by her arms her hair beneath a mobil cap was tied back in a short ponytail welcome she said she glanced up at rosa just long enough to size her up and then returned her attention to the engine im looking for martha fezler rosa said you found her she loosened several bolts and dropped them into a coffee can half filled with an acridsmelling liquid fezlers famous degreaser she explained gasoline boric acid and just the right amount of saliva she looked up at rosa again smiled mischievously and winked the boom box is over there by the stairs feel free to turn it down if you want me to hear what you have to say rosa did as the woman requested when she returned martha fezler had taken hold of a heavy oilstained line and was hoisting the massive engine up over her head how heavy is that rosa asked without the reverse gear oh twofifty three hundred maybe im very impressed no need to be with the block and fall setup i have here i could lift two of these at once if i ever really wanted to or had to at least i think i could she wrapped the greasy line just a single time around a cleat on the wall and tucked a loop under to secure it rosa could not believe what she was witnessing just that one loop will hold it up there rosa asked as the woman reached overhead and loosened the oil pan will if no one messes with it martha said and since i work alone here no one does her moonish face was unlined and open and although her manner was brusque and her voice like sandpaper there was an appealing quality to her rosa introduced herself miss fezler i need your help she said its martha and unless youve got car or boat trouble i dont see how i can martha i need to find your brother warren its very very urgent martha lowered her hands and wiped them with a towel that seemed incapable of absorbing any more grease for just a moment rosa thought she was going to deny having a brother and demand that she leave then just as quickly the womans expression changed maybe we ought to go sit down she said would you like some coffee the small metaltop table overlooked the placid harbor from a spot just to one side of the rails seated across from martha fezler rosa traced her involvement in the dic cases from her arrival at the medical center of boston through her discovery of constanza hidalgos diary and finally to ken mulholland and their efforts to pin down the source of the virus crv i believe that somehow the women i have been investigating became infected with the virus that your brother created she concluded it is quite possible that some component of this diet powder they all were taking was contaminated i dont know i hope warren does once the virus got into the women their natural defenses battled back but never completely eliminated it it remained in balance with their bodies until the stress of labor upset that balance how many women have died from this two that we know of and their babies a third womanthe one we cultured the virus fromlost her baby and almost died i fear she is not going to be the last case martha thats why i need to find your brother martha fezler stared out at the water and the lengthening afternoon shadows finally she handed a pencil and notepad to rosa write down your name where you come from the name of the virus and the name of that disease she said she waited until rosa had complied then tore off the sheet and slipped it into her overall pocket wait here she said she lumbered up the staircase and disappeared through the door to the loft rosa doodled absently on the pad as she watched a pair of gulls do strident battle over a mussel only when she glanced down did she realize that she was shading in the carefully blocked letters bart five minutes passed once rosa swore she heard martha fezler shouting the gulls resolved their dispute and glided off across the harbor finally the loft door opened and warren fezler emerged followed by his sister he was even slighter than rosa remembered from the time he dashed past her on the mcb campus compared to him martha looked positively hulking he approached rosa and smiled sheepishly ssorry ive given you ssuch a hard time he said ive been vvery frightened he took the seat opposite rosa martha brought over another folding chair and settled onto it facing the tracks warren says its okay if i stay for this she said thats fine rosa replied believe me warren coming forward is the right thing to do even if i gget kkilled well have to see to it that doesnt happen when my department head finds out whats going on youll get all the protection you need if im right warren others have already died from this virus theres a good chance that by coming forward you may save a lot of lives i honestly ddidnt know it was hurting anyone he said that ddr bbaldwin caused their problem nnot the virus whos he warren warren fezler rubbed at his eyes which looked flat and tired he turned to martha who gave an encouraging nod blankenship he said suddenly eli bblankenship rosa stared at him incredulously blankenship the one person aside from sarah and matt daniels whom she had trusted with all her information she felt a sick empty churning beginning in her gut explain she said i sstutter a lot im ssorry theres nothing to apologize for warren dont even think about it just tell me about crv and eli blankenship if i spspeak slowly its not as bad youre doing fine fezler took a calming breath in fact when he did begin to speak again he seemed more composed and fluent the crv sstands for coagulationrelated virus i stumbled on its weight loss pproperty by accident i ththink its due to some sort of gene thats closely linked on the chromosome to one of the ones i wwas working on the linked gene interferes with the digestion and cellular storage of fat by blocking a specific enzyme in isolating my clotting genes from their chromosomes i apparently cut away the genes that provide the checks and balances on the fatinhibiting one my mmonkeys began losing weight a lot of them died after i realized what was happening with them i pplayed around with the inoculum size and some other stuff they stopped dying and just lost weightright down to dry weight ffinally i ingested the virus myself it wworked perfectly i llost a hundred pounds in just a ffew months with no pproblem and absolutely no side effects but cletus collins said all your monkeys died iim ashamed to say it but i kkilled them mmyself to protect the secret it was bblankenships idea we were classmates in graduate school he has an md i have bboth an md and phd i sswear i nnever thought anyone would get hurt youve ggot to believe that she does warren martha said sadly just go on i ttold eli about the virus and what i hhad found he said we could get very rich from it there were two pproblems though already for rosa the final pieces had dropped into place the patent she said exactly bbiovir owns the virus and i guess the second would be the fda youre very ssmart fezler said rosa thought about how much she had shared with eli blankenshipespecially over the past two days not so smart she said so blankenship concocted the herbal weight loss powder to avoid any lengthy research protocol with the fda which they wwould nnever have approved of anyhow eli set up the whole thing hes incredibly bbrilliant but hes a demon hes a liar and hes vvery very secretive no one involved ever knew wwhat anyone else was doing nnot singh not ettinger not paris nnot even me none of them knew about the virus just me and eli but its in the diet powder nno not in the powder in the vitamins one of the vitamin capsulesnnumber nineis different ffrom the rest i made them myself in a lab eli sset up for me at first i believed him about ddr baldwin being responsible for those women then i bbegan to have doubts i got ffrightened about what we wwere doing especially with sso many people buying the ppowder so blankenship tried to kill you not blankenship a mman he hired tall and bblond with no rosa was about to say the word herself when martha fezler screamed it her eyes were wide with terror at that instant a soft pop came from rosas right martha cried out and flew over backward as if she had been hit by a wrecking ball warren and rosa dropped to where she lay she was grunting for breath her eyes were glazed oh god warren said touching the dimesize hole in her overall bib which was already soaking through with blood shes been shot excellent deduction warren they spun to the voice which rosa had recognized even before she saw the man darryl was leaning comfortably against a support beam grinning at her the way he first had on the highway the silenced revolver held comfortably in his hand was pointed at a spot somewhere between her and warren hhes the mman fezler said from his knees bblankenships man why ddid you shshoot my ssister you ffucker why its just business warren he said taking a step toward them im sure rosa there understands that she doesnt hold it against me that i shot out that tire of hers she knows it was just business just a way to find out exactly where she was headed i dont hold it against you that my knee got blown apart the last time we were together and that im going to be a fucking gimp cripple for the rest of my life occupational hazard is the way i look at it business now though its your turn you sson of a bitch fezler whined get up now numbly the scientist did as he was asked he looked like a man resigned to death darryls gun came up rosa could see fezler had no intention of moving she dove at him from the side and pushed him as hard as she could he stumbled tripped and then toppled off the rear platform between the rails and the building the gunmans reflex shot splintered the floor where fezler had been standing run warren run rosa screamed darryl turned to her and smiling in a calm twisted way shot her in the chest in grotesque ballet rosa spun nearly full around her arms flapping like a rag dolls her glasses flying off she fell heavily to the floor not two feet from where martha lay pain exploded through to her back from a spot just above her right breast she cried out but was not aware that she had made a sound drawing even a shallow breath sent daggers through her chest and up into her shoulder and jaw darryl now ignoring her completely had moved to the spot where warren had fallen from the platform he held the obscene silenced revolver loosely as he stared out toward the water lying on her side gasping for air rosa prayed that fezler had overcome his cowardice and kept his head enough to try to escape pplease ddont shshoot she suddenly heard him beg up darryl said slowly now on your feet silently rosa cursed both men moving through pain unlike any she had ever known she pulled herself toward them now warren this way come on come on boy rosa felt herself move then move again first on her belly then on her hands and knees her lung had collapsed of that she was sure she tasted blood and sensed it welling up from her chest she felt dizzy her vision blurred then as she wondered if she could move even one more foot her hand brushed against martha fezlers coffee can hearing the soft scrape darryl turned with all her strength rosa splashed the solvent into his face he staggered backward screaming pawing frantically at his eyes with his free hand and firing the revolver wildly with the other a bullet tore through the flesh of rosas arm but she barely noticed she had pulled herself up by a line and stumbled over to the wall warren help she cried hoarsely darryl now writhing on the floor by the tracks fired instinctively at her voice the bullet shattered the barnside just inches from her face please help me again a bullet slammed into the wall by her face the blood gurgling in her throat was beginning to suffocate her her cough was futilely weak her consciousness beginning to go the room swirled mercilessly as she slipped toward the floor suddenly through the unrelenting haze she heard a crash followed instantly by darryls dreadful wail then just as suddenly there was silence rosa lay by the wall conscious but barely so her hand was inches from her eyes still it took some time before she realized that she was clutching the safety line martha had so loosely tied she peered across through a deepening gloom twenty feet away blankenships hired killer lay facedown and very still the huge marine inboard engine rested squarely on his back warren rosa whimpered almost soundlessly please come there was no response rosa battled the encroaching darkness but slowly her eyes closed rosa fezler meekly whispered her name as he touched her shoulder ccan you hear me rosa nodded but could not speak she felt blood oozing from her mouth hang on ill ccall an ambulance wait she gasped wwhat pad pencil over there bewildered fezler retrieved the pad and then lifted her head and rested it on his lap painfully slowly she dictated a phone number to him call now she managed explain to him sarah is at m c b this man will help ill gget an ambulance warren said rosa dammit rosa no the muscles in her face relaxed her lips curled up in a thin smile go she said chapter october each hour of sarahs incarceration on the locked ward of underwood six was more traumatic and unpleasant than the last the staff seemed determined that she should neither expect nor get any special treatment merely because she was a physician and some of them clearly enjoyed having power and control over an md every request she made however minor was prohibited or modified by some sort of unit rule her primary antagonists were the mental health workersmostly recent college graduates who majored in psychology or sociology and who all seemed to have taken the job as a stopgap while they tried to decide what to do with their lives my doctor hasnt been by to see me all day its very important that i talk to him could you please call him im sorry we never call doctors unless its an emergency or a problem with medication hell be here later tonight or in the morning just like all the other doctors hi i hate to bother you but id like to see the nurses physicians desk reference please im trying to check on a drug company named huron pharmaceuticals im sorry no staff books can be lent out to patients well could you check on huron for me perhaps later after group if theres time eventually a surprise letup in the line waiting to use the one pay phone had allowed sarah to call a friend in the hospital pharmacy there was he told her absolutely no such company as huron pharmaceuticals not local not regional not national not foreign nowhere that information sent sarah marching once again into battle against the mental health workers i was certain my lawyer was coming during visitors hours now theyre over and he hasnt shown up can i see him just for a minute if he comes late its very important im sorry thats not possible if he happens to call the nurses station could you put him through to me outside calls can only come through the patients pay phone but the pay phone was tied up all evening and then it got shut off at ten no one told me that was going to happen could i please use the nurses station phone to try to reach him everything will be just the same tomorrow morning sarah you may not believe that but it will now why dont you take the medication dr goldschmidt ordered read for a while and get some sleep after learning that the pay phone had been shut off at ten sarah gave up on hearing from matt before morning but with each passing hour her concern for him grew why would he not at least have called she calmed herself only by reasoning that he had inadvertently missed the narrow twohour visitors window and then had become the victim of a constant busy signal on the pay phone perhaps he had come to the ward late and had been turned away by one of the mental health workers the hours on underwood six had dragged past a minute at a time now it was halfpast two in the morning sarah sat in a worn leather chair by the lounge window grateful that no one had produced a rule prohibiting that specific behavior the one redeeming thing about being a patient on a locked psych ward she was realizing was that one could act crazy and have no one take much notice her throat was still raspy from the endotracheal tube and in addition to feeling tired and weak she had a rather nasty cough but she also felt committed to staying up all night if necessary if and when the huron pharmaceuticals truck returned to the chilton building she wanted to know it in less than seven hours the building was going to blow and secrets were either going to be buried beneath the rubble or were being hauled away before the blast made their removal impossible the huron people might have already finished their business within the condemned building but maybe just maybe they hadnt one lucky shaft of light one good look at the driver of the truck might pull everything together howre you doing sarah perhaps drifting off was startled by the voice oh hi she said the man wes was a mental health aide he and an rn were the graveyard shift staff on underwood six at forty or so he was older than the day and evening shift mental health workers but sarah assumed that his role on the floor had more to do with security than therapy he had the lean muscular frame of a gymnast or weight lifter and a tattoo of a skull and dagger on one deltoid that he seemed determined to show off sarahs impression was that he was quite taken with himself she also doubted seriously that his formal education extended much beyond high school since his arrival at eleven this was his third trip over to talk with her you watching anything interesting not really that building over theres going to be blown up tomorrow i know im going to stay to watch it thesell be the best seats anyplace you ever work in there he had made it clear in their earlier conversations that he had learned a great deal about her from the evening shift report and from reading her chart the notion of that infuriated her what oh no its never been open since ive been here im just curious about it thats all sarah continued staring across the campus thinking about matt logic told her he was fine but a heavy unpleasant totally illogical sensation in her gut told her something had gone wrong so are you dating anyone wes said scanning her unabashedly oh no sarah thought yes yes im engaged she said quickly the mental health aide coming on to her just what she needed she flashed on how valuable it would be if every prospective doctor was required to spend time as a patient they could call the course helplessness hey that doesnt matter to me if it doesnt matter to you wes said adjusting the sleeve of his tshirt to fully expose the skull there are a lot of rules here i can help you get around some of them sarah thought for a moment he was going to reach over and touch her the prospect nauseated her but if she rebuffed him too harshly almost anything might happen to her the sealy posturepedic suite as the patients called the padded room was occupied primarily by those who lashed out in some way against the authority of the staff look um wes i really appreciate your coming over to talk to me but i just need to take things slowly if you know what i mean the mans face lit up oh oh yeah i know what you mean you want anything right now a cold drink something sweet maybe something white and powdery you have no roommate and the room next to yours is empty sarahs nausea intensified if this nightmare ever was over for her she vowed to return to underwood six as a physician and in the name of all those women who would ever be incarcerated there she would hang this sleaze out to dry if she begged off any favors from him for the time being told him it was fine for him to stop by later provided she was still awake and continued staring intently across the campus with each passing minute she felt more and more determined before the big blast to find a way off underwood six and into the chilton building now that idea she acknowledged with a half smile was crazy by threethirty she was beginning to lose her battle with exhaustion she knew she was nodding off between stints with the binoculars but she was totally unwilling to quit and kept prodding herself awake rosa matt and eli had spent most of their day unraveling various threads of the crv mystery she had spent her day in group and her night fending off a mental health aide who was more disturbed than most of the patients the impotence of her situation was intolerable somehow she was going to make a contribution she insisted to herself somehow she was going to find a way to sarah shook her head to clear it and wiped her face with the damp washcloth that had been her only ally through the long nights vigil there was movement on the far side of the chilton building she cut the overhead fluorescent lights took up the binoculars and braced her elbows firmly between the sill and the window lighting immediately around the chilton building was nonexistent but the moon though setting was nearly full and the campus walkway lights were numerous enough to further soften the gloom sarah waited for her eyes to adjust to the darkness but she felt certain already of what she was seeing the huron truck was back black cat daniels knew that he was going to die and at times over the brutal hours he had spent as eli blankenships captive he had prayed that he would some time after being knocked unconscious he had come to lying facedown in the back of what he assumed was the huron pharmaceuticals van his hands were bound tightly behind him with thin wire and his ankles were lashed to one wall his head throbbed mercilessly and his debilitating dizziness and nausea refused to ebb the van was parked inside a darkened structure of some sort possibly a garage there was some street noisean occasional passing automobilebut no voices the position matt had been left in was horribly uncomfortable but even his slightest movement sent pain screaming up his arms from where the wire cut into his wrists blankenship made his first visit to the van long after matt had regained consciousness there was some surprise at seeing that it was he but in truth not all that much i should have known matt said yes yes i suppose you should have you killed colin smith i had to and pramod singh had to and you set up ettinger to take the blame now that i wanted to do so then ive answered your questions suppose you answer a few of mine i need to know if there are any other shall we say loose ends i need to tie up is there anyone else i should be concerned about anyone else youve spoken with jeremy mallon paris what did they say to you matt did his best to turn away but blankenship merely shook his elbow matt screamed with the pain i dont know anything he cried i dont know anything else blankenship pulled his head up by the hair i hope youre telling the truth he said well see he let go suddenly matts face slammed onto the metal floor the next time he came he brought a drugsome sort of injection matt nearly passed out from the pain of merely having his arm moved about for the needle then moments later the pain vanished for a stretch that might have been minutesor dayshe heard only isolated words and phrases first in blankenships voice then his own floating through his mind like feathers finally darkness and silence swept down and enveloped him when he regained consciousness he was sitting on the floor of a damp totally darkened room his legs extended his ankles tied together his hands were lashed behind him to a metal pipe the air was dusty and smelled of concrete and mold his face felt battered and swollen one tooth was broken off the only positive thought he had was that he was still alive but he knew that condition would not be lasting too much longer minutes later now fully awake he learned precisely how long the voice a mans came over loudspeakers that were mounted somewhere in the blackness attention attention please it said this building will be demolished by explosion in three hours no one should be inside the structure or within the blue protective barriers repeat this building will be demolished help matt hollered please help his voice echoed weakly about him there was no chance anyone would hear him no chance at all silently he cursed eli blankenship and his own carelessness then he lowered his chin to his chest and waited chapter at sixthirty when a set of chimes announced wakeup sarah had showered and changed and was back in the patients lounge drinking coffee if all went according to her stillevolving plan she would be inside the chilton building within the hour the clock was still ticking toward the am demolition but the stakes had risen considerably for hidden somewhere within the building probably in the basement or subbasement was a body the huron pharmaceuticals truck had remained by the building for half an hour the driver a large strong man from what sarah could make out had pulled the body from the back of the van swung it up over his shoulder and hauled it down into the basement through the binoculars sarah had gotten a clear unmistakable look at the arms of the victim dangling down the drivers back thirty minutes later the man returned to his van emptyhanded and drove off a few minutes after that sarah approached wes charming the aide was easy charming him without having him touch her was not she flirted as she had not for many many years and pandered to his ego in every way she could she made thinly veiled promises that had the mans fantasies exploding like independence day fireworks she ran her lips over the rim of her coffee cup as if it held vintage dom perignon by dawn she had learned how mealtimes were organized on underwood six group aone of two classificationswere the least stable patients on the unit they went down for meals in the cafeteria but with no more than two patients per staff member however the evening shift staff had determined that sarah was not predictable enough even for group a her breakfast was to be sent up to the unit the day shift could decide about lunch now some flattery some promises and a few comehither smiles had bought her a promotion wes had moved a patient to group b and added her name to the group a list she would be dining in the cafeteria from six fortyfive to sevenfifteen a nonetoosubtle allusion to the anatomical secrets known only to mds and wes also allowed her to use the phone in the staff office although that deal almost fell through when she begged off sitting on his lap while doing so before wes signaled that the shift nurse had finished preparing meds and sarah needed to vacate the staff office she had managed to make two calls the first was to matts home she felt sick when she heard his answering machine come on the second was to the hospital page operator who functioned as the answering service for eli blankenship sarah had written out the message she wanted the operator to give him however after a minute on hold to sarahs surprise the medical chief himself came on the line he had spent the night in the hospital he said and was napping on the couch in his office sarah are you all right he asked as soon as he heard her voice how did you get to a phone at this hour ill tell you that one when i see you dr blankeship and no im not all right i need to get off this ward and quickly sarah dr goldschmidt is the only one who can discharge you from a locked ward im sorry but thats the please dr blankenship i dont have much time on this phone you said yesterday you believed me in your gut and that was even before everyone found out i was telling the truth about andrew youve got to believe me now something terrible is going on in this hospital it involves a company called huron pharmaceuticalsthe company that supplies vitamins to peter ettingers weight loss company i can prove it how im going to be in the cafeteria for breakfast at six fortyfive can you be there yes but just keep an eye on me youll know what to do you said proof can you get us into the chilton building i yes yes i can the proof is there dr blankenship ive got to go please trust me please be there for me count on it eli blankenship said one of the mental health workers called out the list of those in group a sarah shuffled over to where they were convening by the electronically controlled door after a brief discussion among the staffsarah sensed that it dealt with herthe door was buzzed open and the procession of six patients and three overseers made its way off the locked ward standing off to one side wes gave her a wink and a thumbsup sign the mcb cafeteria was modestly busy primarily with residents and nurses sarah felt herself under scrutiny as she queued with her group but after nearly six months of the hell she had already endured she barely noticed keep staring everyone she thought in just a few minutes youre going to get a real eyeful she selected items with no intention of eating them and kept searching for eli blankenship the mental health workers assigned each patient to one of two tables sarah positioned herself to get as wide a view of the cafeteria as possible it was then that she noticed the delivery floor nurse joanne delbanco having coffee at the next table over joanne she said in a half whisper oh hello sarah the nurse looked away quickly but not before sarah saw the expression of distaste on her face sarah knew the keepers were watching her one sign that she was annoying the hospital staff and she might find herself on the way back to underwood six still she had to try joanne just tell me how annalee is doing is she all right the nurse hesitated for an interminable few seconds and then made a partial turn back almost speaking over her shoulder if you must know she said coolly shes in active labor shell probably deliver sometime this morning or early this afternoon sarah was horrified what about the terbutaline she asked sarah could see the two keepers at her table exchanging glances she was operating right on the edge of their tolerance now and blankenship still hadnt appeared dr snyder stopped all her medications joanne replied he felt that the stress youthe stress shes been through was enough the babys big enough and the surfactant level is joanne sarah cut in excitedly youve got to find dr snyder hes got to do a section on her before its too late ive got to what sarah i think thats enough one of the keepers said joanne please its sarah if you dont stop right now were going back up to the unit early everyone in the group will be punished for your actions sarah barely heard the man the huge bald pate and massive physique of eli blankenship had just appeared in the doorway farthest across the cafeteria from them thank god sarah sighed the news from joanne delbanco had changed everything she was no longer fixed on getting into the chilton building now the only thing that really mattered was to explain the situation to blankenship and get him up to the labor and delivery floor with his influence and perhaps rosa suarezs as well they might be able to convince snyder to perform a cesarean on annalee before disaster struck if in addition they could stop the demolition of the chilton building so much the better but annalee and her baby were far higher priorities than anythingor anyonethat might be buried beneath the rubble okay everyone sarah thought its showtime i dont feel well she whimpered whats the matter ii dont know im dizzy andand i keep seeing these little flashing dots of light has this ever happened before sarah i asked you if this has ever happened before sarah began by snapping her hands rhythmically at her wrists then she jerked her head up and down her eyelids flickered and beneath them her eyes rolled up until only the whites showed sarah someone cried out at that instant affecting a dreadful gurgling moan she threw herself backward twisting just enough to avoid smashing her head against the linoleum shes having a seizure she heard the mental health worker exclaim back off everyone back away just let her be you ass sarah thought get me on my side out of the way she heard eli blankenships voice boom get her on her side quickly before she aspirates he worked his beefy hand beneath her head to cushion it moved her on to her side and then slipped his billfold between her teeth sarah bit down on the wallet continued her seizure activity for another half a minute and then allowed herself to slow down next would be a lapse into unconsciousness im her medical doctor blankenship explained with calm authority she has a past history of epilepsy theres nothing to worry about absolutely nothing everythings going to be all right thats it sarah youre doing fine i think just in case we ought to get her over to the er would someone please call transportation and have a litter sent down one of the mental health workers rushed off to do as he requested what should we do about her another keeper asked just notify dr goldschmidt of what has happened tell him that for the time being well transfer dr baldwin back to the medical service im dr blankenship yes doctor i know sarah sensed the gaggle of onlookers begin to disperse blankenship bent over and whispered in her ear that she was doing great and to keep her eyes closed until he told her all was clear she moaned a minute or so later transportation arrived and she was lifted up onto the litter okay everyone shes doing fine blankenship said sarah kept her head lolling from side to side as she was wheeled from the cafeteria then down the hall and into the elevator although the cafeteria was on the basement level sarah felt the car go down she tried to picture where they were as she was wheeled out and down another fairly long corridor okay you can sit up and open your eyes now my friend blankenship said that was an academy award performance sarah pushed herself up blinked her vision into focus and looked around she and the medical chief were alone in the subbasement tunnel they were outside a steel security gate draped with canvas on the far side it bore a large sign warning of the time and date of the demolition and requiring that anyone entering the chilton building prior to the th of october be accompanied by hospital security there was a wall phone by the gate taped above it a printed card gave the number of the demolition company and the extension of the hospital security office wheres the transportation guy she asked abe left us at the elevator blankenship said unlocking the gate i got him his job about a million years ago and i take care of his family he does favors for me when he can dr blankenship its all true theres a connection between peter ettingers diet product and those dic cases its a virus of some sort rosa suarez went out yesterday to speak with the man who created it i know i got her the car she used well now annalee is in labor her terbutalines been stopped dr blankenship peter tested that diet powder on her several years ago if shes not sectioned soon shes going to go into dic like the others im sure of it weve got to get up to the l and d floor and speak with him hey slow down slow down blankenship said you just had a grand mal seizure remember dr blankenship this is serious well what about that pharmaceutical truck you told me about the proof this is more important can you get them to hold off on the demolition maybe provided i can come up with a damn good reason the mayor the governor and dozens of high rollers are going to be up there in the grandstand this is the biggest day of pariss career but listen sarah we used the chilton building for storage thats how i have the keys to these gates i was in there just a week or so ago helping to move the last of our stuff out theres a lot of debris and rubble thats all well theres a body inside now i guarantee it thats reason enough to delay things isnt it but please annalee took that weight loss powder the farther she gets into labor the more danger shes in weve got to help her sarah was still seated on the litter moving too quickly for her to react blankenship opened the security gate shoved the stretcher inside and slammed the gate behind them instantly they were in neartotal darkness what are you doing sarah cried as blankenship reached through and resecured the padlock but in that moment she knew the broad hand supporting her head in the cafeteria the distinct unpleasant blend of body odor and cologne she had experienced both before he was the manthe assailant in room help she screamed help he pulled her roughly off the litter and shoved her down the darkened corridor yell all you want he said its therapeutic theres no one within a few hundred yards of this place he twisted her wrist to keep her still and flicked on a powerful flashlight they were at a second security gate almost identical to the first the canvas is for dust protection during the big blow blankenship said withdrawing the ring of keys from his clinic coat pocket the last thing we want is dust in our hospital right sarahs intense fear was quickly displaced by anger she swung a fist at his face and actually connected a glancing blow but he merely twisted her wrist a bit more and forced her down to one knee they know im with you she said everyone knows you broke free took off and disappeared he said simply eli that girls dying everyone dies he dragged her through the second security gate and again locked it behind them his grip on her wrist kept her in check the corridor was strewn with rubblechunks of concrete and pieces of glass and plumbing he flicked off the flashlight giving her a sense of the oppressive total darkness then from somewhere down the hallway a loudspeaker announced that there were ninety minutes to demolition and that absolutely no one should be in or around the chilton building i guess id do well not to lose these keys blankenship said he switched on his beam now then lets go find that body youre so damn curious about chapter eli please sarah begged as he pulled her into the subbasement of the chilton building youve been such a wonderful physician and teacher youve got to stop this before annalee and a lot of others die do you know that nine days after the first infomercial hit the airways i made more money than i had in twenty years as a wonderful physician and teacher everyone thinks we just get our md degrees and step into the cadillacs and country clubs if you want to get angry at someone get angry at them for setting up those expectations in us you know i didnt even have a damn retirement fund well i do now eli please dont let this happen to all those women oh dont be so dramatic science will figure out a way to overcome their problem it always does besides do you know how many manyears of life have already been saved by all of that blubbermelting weve accomplished if the nobel committee ever did that arithmetic id be a shooin for the prize now look we dont have much time do you want to see this or not sarah kicked his shin as hard as she could stop it he ordered tightening his grip good thats much better now lets take a brief tour of our facility then i promise ill set you up with that body youre so intent on finding who is it she asked frightened by the mans imposing size and strength but not nearly so much as by the total lack of feeling in his words perhaps the most brilliant man she had ever known and he was absolutely mad who is it well who do you think he asked half shoving half dragging her down the coalblack corridor oh god eli where is he now behind this door was our virology lab the nerve center of the ayurvedic weight loss system if you will he kicked the door open and panned the light about a large fully equipped laboratory where is he dr baldwin are you going to pay attention it took almost two years to get this operation going no one but my virologistmake that my late virologistand i have ever seen this room until this morning do you realize how difficult that was to pull off damn it wheres matt what did you do to him can you believe singh and that fop ettinger actually believed the herbs i concocted were causing people to lose weight i spent a week in the library and came up with an ayurvedic mix that i must admit the maharishi himself would have been proud of but a week thats all i made the whole thing up every herb i told singh a friend had brought the mixture back from india and i needed to test it out the minute he heard the word ayurvedic he adopted it as his own no questions asked now isnt that something later on after the first group lost so much weight i suggested that singh ask your exlover to be the spokesman for the whole thing in exchange for a modest share of the profits and ettinger bit hook line and sinker why shouldnt he though right it was alternative medicine and he loved that and it was going to make him rich and he loved that even more do i know human nature or what he kicked open another door shined his light into the room and snapped sarahs head around making her look inside heres the little suite where my late virologist lived while he was putting together our product he went on home home in the hospital and no one ever knew he was here now isnt that just something wheres matt all in good time attention attention please this building will be demolished by explosion in seventyfive minutes no one should be inside the structure or within the blue protective barriers repeat right on time blankenship said that asshole paris runs a tight ship in spite of herself sarah began to cry you bastard you crazy bastard she whimpered now just shut up he rasped his voice reverberating down the corridor if you dont have the decency to listen and appreciate what ive been able to accomplish then just keep your mouth shut ive already helped half a million people lose weight live longer and feel better about themselves and ive banked almost twentyone million dollars in just eight months if youre not impressed then youre not listening wheres matt oh i am just sick and tired of you he said i expected more from a woman of your breadth and worldliness he dragged her a few more feet down the corridor i give you your knight in shining armor he announced unfortunately he is at this moment a tad the worse for wear he cast his light down at matt who was seated on the floor a broad adhesive tape gag across his mouth his hands were secured behind him to a vertical sewage pipe and his face showed the ravages of a fearsome beating but he was alive hes been waiting here patiently just in case my cleanup campaign hit any lastminute snags but except for your unfortunate recovery from your suicide attempt the other night there really havent been any blankenship loosened his hold on her sarah rushed to matt and gently peeled off the tape he breathed in the stale dusty air hungrily she stroked his face and kissed the dark swelling about his eyes matt im sorry im so sorry was all she could say i love you he managed i was praying he wouldnt hurt you any more theyll find us eli sarah said angrily theyll dig this place out theyll find us and theyll get you youre really not as smart as you think there are too many loose ends there are none he said at least none that i cant deal with especially with peter ettinger around to absorb the blame for absolutely anything the dupe from heaven thats what i call him in jail and absolutely clueless now if youll be so kind as to put your hands together behind your back i have just enough wire left over sarah stayed where she was her arms around matts shoulders blankenship was reaching again for her when matt lashed his feet out in one motion he knocked the light free and continued upward until he made solid contact with blankenships chin run sarah he shouted as blankenship reeled several steps backward run matt cried out as blankenship hit him but sarah was already through the doorway the subbasement corridor was pitchblack she slammed into the wall stumbled momentarily and then dragged her hand along it moving as fast as she could in the direction away from the tunnel and the locked security gates the windows and doors from the first floor on up were boarded over if she could somehow get to one of those and kick the boards out there was a chance behind her she heard blankenship laugh what a flashlight he said first chance i get im writing a letter of endorsement to the manufacturer sarah give it up sarah continued working her way along the wall as the powerful flashlight beam began sweeping the corridor searching her out at the moment it found her she glimpsed the stairs just a few feet ahead and to her left she raced upward as fast as she could hitting the wall at the landing bouncing off it and then sprinting upward to the basement level behind her she could see the bobbing light and hear blankenships heavy footsteps the debris was a problem now huge pieces of concrete and planking tripped her once and then again as she picked her way up to the first floor give it up sarah blankenship called out once more if she could only put some distance between them sarah thoughtjust find a place to hide until he had to leave the buildingshe had a chance every story meant more possibilities blankenship had to consider before he could confidently move on every turn that presented her with new options presented him with new problems she fell again but scrambled up and as quietly as she could manage worked her way to the second floor this was where she would stop she decided this was where she would hide she dragged her hand along the wall as she made her way over the rubble and through the oppressive darkness searching for a room of some sort up ahead through what she felt must be a boarded window she saw the faintest sliver of light behind her blankenships footsteps and labored breathing were getting closer suddenly the floor beneath her left foot vanished at almost the same instant her left hand slipped from the wall into nothingness she felt herself falling reflexively she pushed off her right foot and dove forward she fell heavily to the floor pieces of concrete gashing her chin and knee then helplessly she toppled off into what she realized at that instant was the elevator shaft she was beginning to freefall when first her right hand then her left found the edge of something metal her fingers closed on it her arms snapped to full extension but her grips held and suddenly she was dangling over a black abyss desperately she tried to comprehend her situation she was clinging to the metal frame that had once held the elevator doors the concrete had broken away from the frame leaving a gap several inches wide between it and the remaining floor through the darkness she could hear blankenship leave the first floor following the sound of her fall to the second the metal was cutting into her fingers she had only seconds to make a decision she either had to try and haul herself up or drop three stories to the subbasement she figured twentyfive feet maybe would she have any chance at all dropping through the impenetrable blackness to a concrete floor the answer was clear planting the sole of her sneaker against the wall of the shaft and pulling with strength she would never have believed she possessed she kicked one foot up to the doorway and over the metal frame the gap beyond the frame was quite wide actuallyeight or nine inches with her heel set in the space she had just enough purchase to haul herself up attention attention please this building will be demolished by explosion in sixty minutes shielded by the noise of the loudspeakers warning sarah scrambled on her hands and knees across the corridor she was cowering against the wall in a small alcove opposite the shaft when blankenships light knifed through the darkness from the stairway landing come on sarah he called inching his way along well talk maybe work out a deal im not leaving until theres only a minute or two left you dont have a prayer without me neither does daniels hes hurt you know hurt pretty bad you can help him there was one chance sarah realized as he approached only one she braced herself against the wall if he spotted her before he reached the open shaft it was over for her but if not ten feet away five still the beam had not found her three one more step she urged just one and at the moment the light hit her she sprang forward hurling her body against blankenships chest with all her strength it was as if she had leapt against a slab of granite before she even realized how totally she had failed the mans arms were around her crushing her not a chance he said laughing out loud and intensifying his grip not a sarah felt his bulk suddenly shift and his hold on her lessen he had taken a single step backward she knew that but then something had happened he was off balance falling backward and to his left falling into the shaft still clutching sarah too tightly for her to break away blankenship began to scream my leg jesus my leg he howled again and again bellowing as he toppled backward in what seemed to sarah to be slow motion she was frantically trying to sort out what was going on what action she might take when blankenships two lower leg bones snapped the moment she heard the crunch and his hideous wail sarah understood he had stepped into the space between the metal frame and the concrete floor what little force she had provided against his chest was just enough to keep him from recovering his balance he swung backward rapidly now his leg bending at a newly created joint several inches above his ankle still conscious and screeching in agony he hung upside down in the pitchblack shaft clinging to sarahs right wrist dangling her beneath him then wailing piteously he let her go sarah had the briefest warning before blankenships grasp on her wrist released in that second countless thoughts and bits of advice on how to fall and land flashed through her mind roll relax land on your feet land on your butt land on your side push off when you hit flatten out so desperate was she to do something to keep from dying that she was completely unprepared for the actual impact which came after a free fall that lasted only moments and covered less than six feet she landed heavily on the steep slope of a mountain of rubble that extended upward into the shaft almost two stories from the subbasement clawing at the chunks of concrete and other debris she stopped herself from tumbling downward for half a minute she lay there gasping for breath she hurt badly in spots but none of the injuries seemed incapacitating above her enveloped in the intense darkness blankenship continued to moan he had not passed out she realized because he was suspended upside down there was no reflex blood vessel dilation no drop in blood flow to his head no merciful lapse into unconsciousness she peered through the gloom her vision now adjusted to the circumstance she could see the slight changes in the shaft above and below her at what must have been the doorways at the first floor and basement she was inching her way downward when she suddenly remembered the keys blankenship had slipped them into his clinic coat of that she was almost certain without them she had no option but to find a window and try to break through the boards fifty minutes to go perhaps less now with blankenship suspended the way he was could she possibly reach his pocket she turned and began picking her way back up the slope of shattered concrete she would work on obtaining the key until there was half an hour to go she decided and then she would try the firststory windows eli she called out eli listen to me im just below you i need the keys can you work your clinic coat off and let it drop the soft whining moan from above continued sarah pushed herself up the rubble another foot she was opposite the very top of the firstfloor opening now but the slope had ended she was as high as she could go blankenship was close just a few feet above her at the most she tried to picture his downstretched arms and imagine how his clinic coat might be hanging if she leapt up and out could she reach it could she hang on to it enough to pull it free what if the keys had already fallen out she stood at the very top of the slope her back pressed against the rear wall of the shaft blankenships heavy breathing seemed almost within arms reach still she could see nothing one try one try and that would be it expecting to connect with nothing but air she braced her foot against the wall behind her and threw herself up and out blankenship screamed as her outstretched arms flailing for his coat collided with him she hurtled on through the blackness landing heavily on the unyielding slope and tumbling over and over toward the basement doorway at the bottom of the slope she dropped out of the shaft falling several feet from the rubble onto the basement floor air exploded from her lungs at the impact she lay there battered and sobbing struggling to catch her breath to regain her composure to will herself to move suddenly she realized that she was clutching blankenships clinic coat the key ring was in the righthand pocket painfully she limped to the stairway and then made her way down to the subbasement she called out matts name and followed his voice to the room that had so nearly become their tomb the darkness was suffocating its over she whispered touching his face with her fingertips ive got blankenships keys now weve got to get you out of here and ive got to get to annalee she kissed him and then reached behind to where he was bound to the pipe its wire of some sort he said its cutting my wrists to shreds im not sure you can do anything back there in this dark without pliers let me try sarah blankenships a demon he had rosa and warren fezler killed he wired explosives to the ignition on colin smiths boat and then arranged for ettinger to be arrested for it hes engineered everythingeverything singh is dead too blankenship shot him and set it up to look like ettinger did that one as well he was just about home free you were the last loose end andouch careful that really hurts sorry matt i cant do this the wires too tight well weve got forty minutes or so get hold of paris have him stop the countdown and get some people down here is blankenship dead maybe i dont know listen theres a phone just outside the outer gate in the tunnel ill be right back youd better be he said i dont like it here too much i think its a very unlucky spot she kissed his forehead then moved as quickly as she could down the corridor and through the two security gates until she picked up the receiver she hadnt considered that the house phone outside the second gate might be disconnected the dial tone was a hymn i need to reach mr paris she told the operator this is dr baldwin its an emergency hes in his office she said i just put a call through to him in fact hes still talking break in sarah said in seconds glenn paris came on the line the moment she heard his voice sarah knew the nightmare was truly over the last problemthe chilton building countdownwas under control she gave him the briefest summary of what had transpired and asked him to send someone down to the chilton subbasement with flashlights and a wire cutter well also need a stretcher for dr blankenship she said and maybe one for matt as well im not sure hell be able to walk and i think well need an orthopedist i dont know how were going to get eli up from where he is dont worry paris said ill take care of everything just stay right where you are by the security gate ill stop the countdown and ill be down in a minute with help thank you and sarah yes youve done a hell of a job thank you sir please hurry theres another problem going on right now with annalee ettinger and to overcome it i may need your help with dr snyder well be right there sarah sighed and sank to the floor her jeans and shirt were torn her face legs and arms were bleeding from dozens of scrapes and cuts but far more painful to her than any of her injuries was matts news about rosa suarez rosa had wanted so badly to have everything turn out all right within minutes sarah heard footsteps hurrying toward her down the connecting tunnel moments later glenn paris entered the chilton cutoff he smiled and waved the flashlights he had brought everythings on hold up above he said breathlessly thank goodness you reached me i was about to go out to the ceremonies well i was prepared to run across to the grandstand if i had to paris led her back into the stygian blackness of the chilton subbasement i guess you havent heard about colin smiths death yesterday he said panning his light about i was just sitting in my office thinking about him matt just told me he said blankenship killed him and framed peter ettinger that son of a bitch matts right up here on the left sarah said matt honey were coming i hear you paris stopped at the doorway of the room and shined his light in from there maintenance is on the way with wire cutters matt he said they should be here in a minute meanwhile if you can hang on id like sarah to take me to blankenship sarah hesitated go ahead matt said ive been here like this for hours ill be okay she took a flashlight and led paris up to the elevator shaft opening on the basement level hes hanging from the doorway on the second sarah stopped in midsentence directed the light onto her forearm and gasped she had been spattered by several thick drops of blood she leaned into the shaft and directed the beam up at the second floor the lower third of blankenships leg remained wedged as it had been but the medical chief was gone hes not th snarling in pain and rage blankenship came tumbling out of the darkness down the slope of rubble he slammed into sarah sending her sprawling out of the shaft and onto the concrete sarah cried out as blankenship grabbed her ankle paris quickly stepped forward and put a foot down on his wrist he held it there until she scrambled free then he aimed his flashlight beam straight into blankenships face the medical chief was an apparition smeared with gore yet ghostly pale and clearly more dead than alive is a medical team on the way sarah asked paris did not answer instead he kicked blankenship viciously in the mouth you ruined me you son of a bitch he said i invested every cent my hospital could beg or borrow in that diet shit of yours because you swore there were no problems with it you never said anything about there being a goddamn virus in it you bastard nothing you knew sarah said stunned yes i knew im not stupid but by the time i realized what that powder was doing to women it was too late we were in it too deep i know about all the money too eli colins been checking up on you and your bogus foundation since day one and that goddamn lab in therei found that months ago weve already gotten into two of your accounts as soon as i get back to the office im cleaning them out then ill decide if i need to bail out of here or not i was set to leave because of what this whole thing was going to do to me my career and reputation down the drain everyone blaming me for those women but now from what sarah tells me it seems that everyone who could connect me to you and that goddamn powder is dead that is what you said isnt it sarah he loosed another short choppy kickthis time to blankenships chest before sarah could react he whirled around and grabbed her hair im sorry about this he said ignoring her cries of pain i really am he reached into her pocket and pulled out blankenships keys im sorry about not stopping that countdown too he added i ordinarily dont lie about things that important he produced a length of rope from his jacket pocket forced sarah onto her belly and tied her hands behind her then he dragged her to her feet and back to the stairs to the subbasement ive changed my mind about a research building on this spot he said i think instead were going to fill it all in and go for a parking lot or perhaps some tennis courts i assume youd rather be downstairs with your lawyer than up here with that monster please glenn sarah pleaded as he forced her down the stairs please dont i beg you i know you didnt actually hurt anybody i can tell everyone that sorry i really have no choice and i promise you wont feel a thing he pushed her back into the space that once again was to become a tomb ignoring matts pleas and sarahs attempts at reason he lashed her to an exposed girder across the room from matt and secured her ankles then without a backward glance he left them in the darkness and hurried from the chilton building an instant later the overhead speakers announced that there were fifteen minutes left before demolition chapter it is our hope our dream that this new institute for medical and healing studies will form a golden bridge between our rapidly advancing medical technology and the more mystical healing arts from across the centuries and around the world glenn paris proudly accepted another round of applause from the two hundred or so dignitaries and other ticket holders seated in the grandstand the morning was sparkling clear and nearly windlessperfect conditions for the spectacle at hand all around the campus patients staff and visitors watched from rooftops and windows on the far side of the mall the chilton building stood alone a deposed queen facing the crowd with what little grace she could muster as she awaited the guillotine now before the winner of our drawing steps up to thrill us all i would like to pause for a moment of silence in honor of mr colin smith the chief financial officer of this hospital who perished yesterday in a most tragic boating accident i intend to recommend that our board of directors name a wing of this new institute after colin he will certainly be missed and now governor mr mayor esteemed colleagues and all of you who have been so faithful over the years to the medical center of bostonit gives me great pleasure to announce the winner of our raffle thanks to the devoted efforts of our raffle ticket sellers and canvassers this contest has netted almost thirtythree thousand dollars for the new institute thank you thank you the winner is here with me and she is he glanced down at a threebyfive card mrs gladys robertson of west roxbury to the accompaniment of polite applause a nervously smiling middleaged woman in a floralprint dress stepped up to paris and whispered in his ear oh my apologies paris said into the microphone our winner is miss gladys robinson im not actually a doctor but obviously i write like one paris milked the ensuing laughter as long as he could so then miss gladys robinson of west roxbury he said finally this is your moment heres the plunger that will set off the charges placed by our team of worldrenowned specialists and give you your place in history mr crocker do we have the green light excellent miss robinson if youll just allow us to get in a little drumroll paris pointed to his right from among the spectators five men stood up with snare drums slung in front of them the surprise brought a murmur of approval from the crowd the drumroll began softly and then crescendoed paris waited and waited until the tension in the air was almost palpable now he shouted a thousand pairs of eyes were fixed on the chilton building as miss gladys robinson depressed the plunger that had been set on the podium for a suspended moment there was only silence then heralded by puffs of smoke from around the base of the foundation and up the brick walls a dull rumble began and quickly expanded the ground shook as the noise increased a huge thick cloud of gray dust erupted enveloping the first two floors then with a wondrous roar the walls of the building dropped straight down into the billowing gray abyss seconds later there was silence once again the crowd watched in awe as the dense concrete cloud floated upward and began to slowly disperse on the higher thermals then there was applause and cheers and whistles and pats on the back glenn paris accepted them all with the confidence and aplomb of a man accustomed to successes the governor shook his hand and then the mayor proudly jaw thrust forward paris turned to survey his hospital suddenly he paled his smile vanished two men and a woman none of whom he expected to see were approaching the grandstand across the grassy campus behind them walked two more men both of those men were tall and broadshouldered and carried themselves like the bodyguards paris knew they were great job glenn great someone said slapping him on the back but paris fixed on the approaching quintet did not respond the group had reached the base of the grandstand when willis grayson his arm around his daughters shoulders beckoned him to come down flanking lisa grayson on the other side limping though not badly was matt daniels he was filthy and disheveled his face swollen and discolored but he squinted up at the man who had left him to die and through cracked bloodied lips he forced a smile you blew it glenn he said hoarsely you blew it big time im disappointed in you mr paris willis called up very disappointed paris glanced frantically about for an escape route dont even think about it grayson warned either of my men could run backward and still catch you five minutes paris thats all the time that remained when we arrived in the basement of that building five minutes you left dr baldwin and mr daniels here tied up and helpless you just turned and walked away and left them to die youre a very crude man paris the group around glenn paris peeled back and stared down at the new arrivals clearly a number of them recognized the man known as the ross perot of the northeast the governor who had reached the bottom of the grandstand crossed to grayson spoke briefly with him and matt and then looked up at the hospital ceo i think youd best come down here he said sharply glenn paris his face pinched and ashen hesitated then his shoulders and his gaze dropped and he trudged slowly down the redcarpeted stairs obviously if we had knknown ththe trouble you and your ffriend were in we would have ttried to get here sooner warren fezler said he and sarah were hurrying as best she could manage through the tunnels toward the labor and delivery floor im just glad you made it when you did sarah replied youre sure rosas okay she sspent six hours in the operating room but when we all left to fly ddown here they told us she was stable thank god after rosa was shshot jjust before she llost consciousness she wrote down mr ggraysons home number as soon as i explained what was going on he fflew right up in his chchopper rosa ssaved my life i wwish she could have ssaved my sister thats very sad im sorry but im very angry tooat blankenship at all of you i understand i ddont know what i can do just help me now and then try to set some things straight with that damn virus of yours sarah wanted to take the stairs up to l and d but her battered body dictated she use the elevator warren how did you manage to find us she asked as they waited for the car nnot that hard ffor a man like grayson he knows how to mmove people like no one ive ever sseen he thought for a moment and then added except maybe ffor eli we started at ththe icu and then went to the psych wward some man therewes somethingsaid you had had a seizure at breakfast and wwere in the er he also said you had sspent the whole nnight watching ththe chilton building through binoculars next wwe found out you were wheeled away by eli and someone from transportation and then when we ffound you had never arrived at the er we began to suspect where you were mr ggrayson latched onto the man from transportation then we knknew we were right so you went into the basement of the building through the back door i hhad the keys that was once my home away from home remember mr ggrayson decided to look for you rather than to ttry and sstop the explosion they pushed through the doors of the labor and delivery floor and were immediately confronted by a sound sarah had heard before annalee ettinger was screaming in pain mindless of the nursing staff sarah grabbed warrens hand and pulled him down the hall to annalees room the uniformed guard was gonedischarged sarah assumed when the evil dr baldwin was locked up on underwood six randall snyder quite obviously agitated and on the razors edge of panic was checking the pulses at annalees wrists would one of you please page dr blankenship again he was saying to the nurses assisting him you can page him all you want sarah cut in but i guarantee you he wont be answering not now not ever annalee will you let me talk to you please its very important they said you tried to hurt me they were wrong will you talk with me can you help this pain in my arms and my feet i can make it go away huddled to one side of the obstetrics family room willis grayson lisa matt and warren fezler watched the monitor screen intently glenn paris had installed the video system as part of his overhaul of the obgyn service the cesarean camera was mounted directly above the operating table the field it projected now consisted of two pairs of handsrandall snyders and sarahsand annalee ettingers smooth gravid belly okay is the blood up and running they heard snyder ask up and running a nurses voice replied signs stable all systems are go said the anesthesiologist ready sarah ready lisa grayson gave matt a teasing nudge okay then snyder said its your case doctor ill assist but quickly all right all right the four viewers watched as sarah and randall snyder vanished from the screen and then reappeared having changed places at the table sarah flexed her gloved hands once then again okay everyone lets do it she said scalpel please epilogue october sarah ettinger west meet your new godmother radiant in her hospital bed annalee held the infant away from her breast long enough for sarah to see you make a great kid sarah said im honored to be her godmother after a beginning that was considerably rockier for mother than daughter both were now doing fine as sarah had predicted the cesarean section delivery essentially cured annalees dic first lisa now annalee two cases sectioned two cases cured at least they had a place to start in dealing with the virus how many women do you suppose are facing this annalee asked as if reading her mind people are checking on that now but i can tell you its going to be a lot blankenship just didnt care he didnt care at all i still dont understand it crazy doesnt require any understanding it just is i guess fortunately it appears your father kept decent records of who received the powder and vitamins he always was the decent record sort the products been on the market for almost eight months now that means the first cases of infected women going into labor could happen any time i can give you the list of people peter tested the stuff on at the time he gave it to me great that will leave only the rest of singhs group from the clinic herethe original set of guinea pigs with singh dead we have to rely on finding blankenships records of his work i think he must have a listthats how he knew right away that the first women who got the powder were starting to get into trouble if we cant find his records well have to rely on publicity to bring them in and all for money all for money sarah echoed sadly plus whatever thrill blankenship got from using his intellect to maneuver and control people speaking of which sarah knew what was coming next whats the situation she asked peters still in jail his lawyer called a little while ago theres some sort of hearing scheduled later today he says that if you came and spoke to the judge peter would probably at least be able to post bail and get out if you dont tell them that blankenship admitted killing that man on the boat peter might have to stay a thought that is not entirely unappealing the two women exchanged conspiratorial smiles hes the grandfather of your godchild remember i know i know i just wonder how much of a dent this whole thing has made on his castiron ego blankenship played him like a violin and peter went right along with it no questions asked all for money sarah said xanadu was in trouble i think it was as much pride and ego as profit well im going to insist that whatever money we can retrieve from this whole mess be used to find some sort of definitive cure and that includes whatever peter has i agree the sixfoot fourinch violin boy ill bet he really loved the publicity of those damned infomercials he did that annalee said lifting sarah e west and gently bringing the infant over to her other breast maybe another week or so in jail mightokay okay ill give his lawyer a call and see what i can do thanks doc sarah stood to go annalee do me one favor though she said anything sarah bent down and kissed first mother then daughter dont ever let him forget it take it or leave it by axel devlin july yesterday i had an appointment with my acupuncturist her name is dr sarah baldwindaniels when my back goes out which it tends to do when i engage in any activity more strenuous than clicking my channel changer my

worries and the missing person just shows up well this missing person is an incredibly talented musician who would never leave her band in the lurch which she has she is a wonderfully dependable friend who would never do anything to upset me which she has and she is an extremely compassionate and kind woman who would never say anything abusive to anyone yet before she disappeared she had become abusive to everyone doctor solari tell me something honestly were you and miss wilson lovers oh christ nikki desperately needed to wrest the worry from her brain if only for a while and the only ways she had ever been able to do so were running making music and performing autopsies it was eleven in the morning one more hour until lunch she could go out and splash through a few miles then she stood by the window of her office watching the cars creep down albany street past the modern building that was the headquarters of the chief medical examiner and his staff this was her third year as an associate in me josef kellers office she was fascinated by the work and absolutely adored the man but the past week had been hell she glanced over at her desk there were reports to read dictations to do and several boxes of slides to review but the concentration just wasnt there hey there beautiful youve got a case without waiting for an invitation brad cummings strode into the office divorced with a couple of kids cummings was the deputy chief medical examiner he was athletic urbane and in the eyes of perhaps every woman in the city except nikki handsome she found him smug selfabsorbed and way too prettyquite possibly the absolute antithesis of what she was looking for in a man wheres dr keller she asked away until one that means im the boss until then so i get to say who gets what case and you get this tubber this what sixtysixyearold guy had a coronary getting into his jacuzzi smacked his head on the side and went for the eternal swim hes just eight months postbypass surgery i spoke to his doctor who said he was on mucho cardiac meds and undoubtedly had an mi so hes really just a view you dont have to cut on him at all and that means we have time to go have lunch at that place on newbury street ive been telling you about brad i dont want to go out with you but i thought you broke up with that drip you were dating correction that drip broke up with me and im not interested in starting up with another one she digs me i can tell in the best of times nikki had precious little patience for the man brad you have more than enough scalps hanging on your lodgepole without mine and im sure there are plenty more where those came from well keep getting along fine so long as you keep things on a business or collegial basis but i promise you brad call me beautiful again or sweets or honey or babe or anything other than nikki or dr solari and ill write you up and hand it over to dr keller clear hey easy does it nikki could tell that he stopped himself at the last possible instant from adding babe im going to get started on the new case she said i told you this is a straightforward view no scalpel required just eyeball him and sign off if its all the same to you ill make that decision after ive seen the guy nikki didnt add that there wasnt a chance in the world she would pass on this case regardless of how open and shut it was here was the perfect opportunity to get her mind off kathy for a few hours without getting soaked on the streets of boston suit yourself cummings said three days what three days thats how long the dudes been in the water hes a little um bloated sure you dont want to just view and then skiddoo have a good lunch brad nikki changed into scrubs and located the remains of roger belanger on the center of three stainless steel tables in autopsy suite the daughter of an italian and an irishwoman she could easily trace her thick black hair and wide some said sensuous mouth to her father and her fair skin seagreen eyes slender frame and caustic wit to her mom at her fathers urging she had tried to follow his rather large footsteps into surgery but after a year of residency she switched to pathology realizing that her desire to have a life outside of medicine was precluded by spending most of it in the or or on rounds not once had she regretted her decision belanger was hardly the most unsightly corpse nikki had ever examined but neither was he at all pleasant to look at overweight and nearly egg bald he was extremely bloated and discolored with purplish marbling of his skin his flaccid limbs were well past rigor mortis the white scar from his bypass ran the length of his breastbone goodbye for now kath she thought as she began to focus in on the details of the body ill let you back in in two hours no matter how obvious a case is joe keller had reminded her on more than one occasion no matter how apparently open and shut you must make no assumptions process is everything if you stick to process step by step you will seldom have to explain having missed something step one read over as much information as you can lay your hands on about the subject step two inspect every millimeter of the skin nikki used the footactivated dictation system as she went there is a wellhealed threeinch scar in the right lower abdominal quadrant possibly from an appendectomy a teninch scar less than a year old down the midanterior chest a teninch scar of about the same age on the inner right thigh probably from harvesting a vein for his bypass and a wellhealed twoinch scar just below the left patella probably from the repair of a laceration many years ago there is a single contusion just above and behind the right ear with discoloration and some swelling but no depression of the bone beneath there is a nickelsize abrasion just beneath the right mandible that nikki peered at the innocentlooking scrape it was the only place on belangers waterlogged body where skin was actually scraped off she put on a pair of magnifying goggles and illuminated the area with a gooseneck lamp the abrasion was actually a perfect hexagon and in the center of the shape were ten tiny bruises perfectly forming the letter h she photographed the area then proceeded with her meticulous examination process is everything an hour later she had accomplished two major things she had in fact managed temporarily to drive her concerns for kathy wilson from her mind and she had come within one final step of proving that roger belanger had been murdered she stripped off her gloves grabbed the boston yellow pages and made a call minutes later she paged brad cummings jesus he said the dishes clinking in the background this pager goes off so infrequently it scared the heck out of me you almost done we were just waiting for our flans nikki didnt want to go anywhere near who we was i need you to pick something up for me and come back to the office brad but no buts no flans just go to mulvaneys pool and patio on route nine right after the mall you know where that is yes theyll have a package waiting in your name eleven ninetyfive plus tax ill pay you back hurry for the next fortyfive minutes nikki finished collecting her specimens and waited inexorably her concerns for her friend reemerged the two of them had met almost three years ago at a folk club in cambridge nikki had been a classical violinist from age three when her father enrolled her in a suzuki method class she played in chamber music groups right through college and medical school when time allowed and was reasonably satisfied with what she got from her musicthat was until she heard kathy wilson and the lost bluegrass ramblers play kathy sang lead and played stringsmandolin guitar and basiswith astounding deftness and heart nikki had heard bluegrass before but in truth she had never paid much attention to it that night the ramblers and kathy in particular brought her an exhilaration that had long ago vanished from the music she played and listened to after the performance she waited by the dressing room door i dont collect autographs she said once kathy had emerged but i wanted to tell you that i love your voice and your energy jes doin what comes naturally you play the fiddle professionally hardly how did you youve got a fiddlers mark right there under your jaw nikki knew the reddishbrown mark and the small lump beneath it caused by longterm pressure from her violins chin rest it became permanent sometime during college she said i play mostly chamber music eyes and necks thats how i judge a person eyes and necks an yours tell me you care a lot about people an about music half an hour later nikki was drinking beer with the band and sharing intimate details with kathy of her laughable lack of judgment when it came to choosing men a week after that kathy gave her a lesson in bluegrass over the two years that followed nikki developed into a reasonably proficient bluegrass musician good enough to sit in with the group when they werent touring girl youre capable of hittin on all cylinders when you put your mind and soul to it kathy said but you gotta learn how to shut out the extraneousespecially all them folks who want a piece of you do that an youll feel your feet start floatin off the ground when you play from day one being around kathy was an adventure in spontaneity nikki had friendsclose good friendsfrom college and before and two from medical school but from their earliest times together often talking and giggling from the end of a show until breakfast kathy and she were sisters ive had it with men kathy moaned after she and her bassist boyfriend had broken up for the third and last time pass the beer nuts is all theyre about that and apologizing for leaving the toilet seat up again but only after youve gone for another unexpected dip the night of that conversation a year ago they decided kathy would move into nikkis secondfloor flat in south boston the deal was one quarter rent and utilities for kathy plus weekly lessons for nikki kathy had been religious about giving them too when she and the band werent on tour she was a treasure absolutely irrepressible and in love with life in general and her music in particular not at all shy about grading every man nikki dated she once told a lawyer he simply wasnt interested enough in anything but himself and his bmw to have designs on her friend they were in a gritty club one of kathy and nikkis favorites and the man was fidgeting uncomfortably as if battling the desire to wash down the furniture and probably some of the patrons as well often outspoken when she was sober kathy had consumed perhaps a beer or so too many give it up councillor she said suddenly as nikki sat watching in stunned silence i know this woman heres beautiful an i know shes smart an i know shed look great at your office christmas party to say nothin of in your bed but i am the guardian of her chastity and im tellin you what shes too damn nice to say there aint no set of car keys you can produce is gonna get her to where you want her to be not highly educated in any traditional book sense kathy was a patient listener wildly funny when she wanted to be and always philosophical in an earthy homespun way the perfect roommateat least until the mood swings began it might have been four or five months ago that the sleeplessness started two three four in the morning she would be pacing the apartment or walking the streets then a day or two or even three would go by without her coming back to the apartment at all soon after her meltdowns began at home and with the bandrages that could be neither predicted nor controlled nikki begged her to see a doctor and even arranged for several appointments none of which kathy kept finally maybe six or seven weeks ago odd lumps began appearing on kathys facethe first two just above her eyebrows then one by her ear and another on her cheek she wouldnt let nikki touch them or even talk about them until ten days ago in a rare totally lucid moment she sank onto a chair in the kitchen buried her face in her hands and sobbed nikki whats happening to me where has my mind gone where has my music gone why are they doing this to me her sobbing became uncontrollable nikki held her tightly and felt the fear and confusion in her body beneath her hair she could feel more lumpssolid rather than cystic slightly movable not tender that she could tell lymph nodes some weird kind of firm cyst neurofibromas it was impossible to tell nikki begged her to come with her to the er finally kathy agreed to see nikkis doctor the next day but at the appointment time she was nowhere to be found she came back to the apartment once more that nikki knew of then vanished again nikki how are you doing dr josef keller had entered the autopsy suite and now stood beside the bloated corpse of roger belanger nikki had covered the open thoracic and abdominal cavities with moist towels keller a german jew whose family had fled the holocaust was a year or two from retirement but still vibrant curious and energetic still the strain of overseeing a department responsible for the evaluation of more than deaths statewide each year was taking its toll he limped from arthritis in his hip and had a back condition that made it painful to bend over the cadavers for long im glad youre here nikki said this is an interesting case i thought this man had a coronary keller replied with still the hint of an accent well i think he was murdered murdered have you been watching reruns of that pathologist showum what was his name quincy nope i may be wrong but here look at this first nikki showed him the bizarre abrasion beneath belangers chin a ring keller asked immediately on top of things as usual i think so with diamond studs forming the initial exactly theres more nikki handed over the otoscopethe tool used by physicians to examine the ear canal and drum more often than not she had found residents and even boardcertified pathologists omitting this part of the postmortem exam process keller took his time murmuring to himself as he examined belangers ears by turning the large violet head from one side to the other and back and inserting the otoscope into the external ear canal ruptured with flakes of dried blood he said finally both eardrums were ruptured shortly before his death i havent been to see his jacuzzi nikki said but i would bet it isnt at least five feet deep five feetthe minimum depth where the pressure on the drums if not equalized could cause rupture you are postulating that this man did not drown in his tub i am i think he drowned all right but i think someone he was swimming withsomeone with the initial h on his ring in diamond studsdragged him underwater by the throat maybe to the bottom of a pool and then brought him home and put him in the tub an argument perhaps and the water in his lungs and stomach im waiting for home is the hunter home from the kill oh hi joe its home from the hill brad nikki said did you pick up the package i did what do you need chlorine test strips for i think your tubber as you so quaintly put it actually drowned in a pool but then how did murdered you are exceedingly sharp nikki said no wonder they named you brad she dipped one of the strips into the water in belangers stomach in seconds the tiny indicator square had turned faint purple i am most impressed keller said i shall call our friends at the stationhouse and let them know this is quite fascinating quite fascinating indeed he limped back to his office good thing i insisted you do a full autopsy on this guy brad said nikki glared at the man but honestly couldnt tell if he was being serious the overhead speaker kept her from finding out dr solari are you still in there yes ruth im here theres an outside call for you im going to transfer it seconds later the wall phone rang brad held his ground as she passed forcing her to squeeze between him and belangers autopsy table grow up she said as she passed she digs me brad said this time nikki ignored him pathology this is dr solari nikki nikki felt her heart stop kath where are you honey are you all right kathy wilsons voice was that of a small child nikki im so cold theyre after me and im so cold there were traffic noises in the background now a car horn she was calling from a pay phone kathy stay calm im going to help you youre going to be all right why are they trying to kill me nik why am i so cold hey what gives brad cummings asked nikki snapped a finger against her lips then waved him out of the room get out she mouthed okay okay you know youre really very touchy today you must be having your out this time she shouted the word pouting theatrically cummings left kathy listen just tell me where you are and ill come right over and get you kath youre just like all the others nikki you want my music to stop is that why theyre after me because they want my music to stop her singsong voice was haunting and vague nikki imagined her on some street corner huddled at a payphone kiosk in the pouring rain she cast about for some way to alert the police and maybe have this call traced kathy she tried look around and tell me what you see nikki nikki nikki you sent them didnt you you sent them to silence my music ill get you for this nikki ill get you if its the last thing i do i love you kathy youre my friend i would never do anything to hurt you in your heart you know that honey youre not thinking clearly right now youve got to come home let me help you help me there was a prolonged silence then nothing kathy nikki waited for thirty seconds before slowly setting the receiver in its cradle then making no attempt to deal with the cadaver of roger belanger she burst into tears and raced from the room
