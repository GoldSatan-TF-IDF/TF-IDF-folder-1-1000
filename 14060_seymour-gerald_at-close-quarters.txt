at close quarters gerald seymour he turned sharply he disliked to be touched he shook the sallow hand from his sleeve around him the reception was warming he was for a moment alone alone except for the man whose hand had tugged at his jacket for attention seconds ago he had been disposing of a small but tiresome problem with his australian counterpart minutes earlier he had been deep in conversation with his french colleague he heard around him english and french and spanish and arabic and european russian his glass was empty the australian had left in search of a waiter his host the host of all of them gathered in the gold and white tapestry hung chandelier lit salon was stationed beside the high double doors for the entry of the general secretary the tides of many languages flooded his mind and the hand rested once more on his sleeve the australian was lost in the throng cosse brissac had insinuated his way close to the door no doubt to be among the first to shake the general secretarys hand his private secretary was out of reach and engrossed with an angular blonde from the finnish contingent he lifted the hand from his sleeve and dropped it as if he were in the street and the hand were the wrapping of a sticky sweet that had attached itself to his jacket the man was short dumpy at the waistline he thought the mans suit certainly cost more than all of those in his own wardrobe the man wore a vivid orange silk tie knotted wide in contrast to his own slim knot that carried the faded emblem of the all england lawn tennis and croquet club the man seemed scented by a cocktail of lotions and his thick dark hair was heavily oiled if i might have the privilege of a moment of your excellencys time i would be so grateful if you would kindly remove your hand he said sir sylvester armitage i am the ambassador of england of the united kingdom he corrected for a fleeting second the foreign minister himself caught his gaze over the shined head of this creature but then the foreign minister raised his two hands fingers and thumbs extended indicating another ten minutes before the general secretary arrived then turned his back his sleeve was tugged please dont do that again he said i have the honour to be excellency the political counsellor of the embassy of the syrian arab republic do you indeed extraordinary that the australian had not cornered the wine waiter by now and hed have a sharp word for his private secretary for leaving him exposed to the syrian it is difficult at this time for there to be effective contact between our two governments you would agree excellency he could clearly see an airliner in flight he could see rows of passengers he could see the cabin crew moving along the aisles of the huge airliner it is intended to be difficult otherwise my government would not have severed diplomatic relations with the syrian arab republic the political counsellor had edged closer in a rhythm his hands clasped and unclasped there were two heavy gold rings on his right hand fingers one on his left there were misunderstandings excellency through a restoration of normal relations between our two governments such misunderstandings can be erased he could see a young woman passenger he could see her nervousness it was the first time she had made a longdistance air journey he could see the bag that had been given to her by her fiance nestled between her legs and close to the brightly decorated shell of the aircraft he could see the restless movement of the digital clock face of the pocket calculator resting at the base of the bag my government does not accept that there were misunderstandings he said the political counsellors voice was a whisper my government can see no benefit to either of our countries by continuance of a situation of misunderstanding please to listen carefully to me excellency i have the full authority of our head of state to say he saw a flash of light he saw the rupturing of the outer wall of the aircraft he saw the distintegration of the young woman the passenger how interesting the syrian looked up surprised but he resumed our head of state wishes it to be known to the government in london that privately it is accepted in damascus that junior functionaries in a division of the military planned and attempted to execute an attack on an el al jet while en route between london and tel aviv i am further instructed to inform you excellency that our head of state sincerely regrets the actions of these junior functionaries who have now been severely punished he saw the snow topping the steep peaks of the mountains of austria he saw the spiralling fall of the airliner down towards the nail bed of the rock crags have they really he did not notice that the australian ambassador stood a pace behind him holding two glasses of brandy he did not register that his private secretary was at his shoulder i can tell you that these junior functionaries have been purged from the armed forces i am instructed to tell you that my country is totally and without equivocation opposed to international terrorism and we are thankful that the attack on the airliner was thwarted in london without reservation we condemn such attacks what we seek excellency is the speedy restoration of diplomatic links and the ending of this most unfortunate period of misunderstanding he said i will of course pass on your remarks to london i am most grateful excellency for nothing we look forward to the quick return of your ambassador to damascus and ours to london my opinion personal is that well want deeds not words a frown formed on the forehead of the political counsellor what deeds off the top of my head the expulsion from syria of all terrorist groups abu nidal and all the other abattoir gangs an end to the financing of such groups colour lit the cheeks of the political counsellors face we are innocent of all such involvement because he was angered because he was tired because he wished to be among his friends his voice rose he sought to be rid of the creature and you might just use your influence in lebanon to win the freedom of the foreign national hostages we are innocent of hostagetaking he was not aware of the turned heads of the talk congealing around him so innocent that evidence of syrian involvement in terrorism just about keeps one of our computers turning full time my dear sir we have found your countrys finger on the trigger on the grenade pin too often the political counsellor said i insist on our innocence he was not aware of the audience gathering about them bloody nonsense we deplore terrorism bloody nonsense i am instructed then your instructions are bloody nonsense half the salon was hushed following the sport the australian laughed out loud innocent in a brothel sir you would not be believed senior officers in your armed forces planned and did their damnedest to achieve the destruction in midflight of a fully loaded civilian aircraft you and your clan you disgust me the laughter ran the tittering amusement spread over the end of the salon the political counsellor seemed to rise on his toes you insult my government he boomed the mans not born who could do that the political counsellor swung on his heel thrust his way through the diplomats the laughter would have been a tide in his ears his back vanished the australian handed the british ambassador the glass bit strong sylvester but you gave us a good laugh he looked keenly at his friend my elder daughter aggie shes doing a years voluntary work on a kibbutz in southern israel if those bastards had had their way shed have been obliterated along with others she happened to be on that flight after two more drinks and a full minutes conversation with the general secretary he left the reception down the steps to his waiting car he shuddered the dark depression of autumn was settling on moscow just before midnight the british airways boeing touched down at sheremetyevo modern and miserable and the gateway to moscow an hour later customs and immigration on high quality goslow young holt met his girl pretty damn late young man they had to hold the flight so i could say goodbye to my lady pig jane pouted and she came to him and grabbed him and hugged him and kissed him the second secretary stood back and looked at his watch and coughed and shuffled and wondered whether the foreign and commonwealth office had got itself intothe business of lovebroking for crying out loud he had to cough twice more and there was a ring of petal pink smudges around young holts mouth fifteen pairs r i g h t just the same as usual fifteen atextra large with gussets just as long as you dont forget and give my love to hermione bye darling keep safe the ambassador put down the telephone and looked up god and the boy seemed young not tall and not short but with an impact because of the set of his shoulders and the sturdiness of his hips the sort of boy who would have captained the fifteen at marlborough an adults body and a youngsters face he had been in the room through the latter part of the ambassadors call and had stood midway between the door and the desk as if on a parade ground and at ease relaxed and yet formal so youre young holt welcome to moscow mr holt thank you sir none of that formality im not sir were a family here i may be the patriarch but not a frightening one i hope whats your first name mr holt its peter sir but im generally just holt then we have a bargain ill call you holt and you dont call me sir done thank you ambassador youre a stickler for etiquette young m a n did he not look young the smile was that of a teenager bright and open he liked his naturalness he reckoned a man who could smile well was an honest man what do you think of the job theyve given you it seemed to me that private secretary to the ambassador was about the best first posting that a soviet specialist could expect i was where you were three weeks before the cuban missile crisis broke i loved every day of my year here and i hope you will no i wasnt talking in code on the phone my wifes had to go back to london mother not well and she may be stuck there for a couple of weeks we have a tradition of always bringing back some presents for our staff the soviet staff money doesnt matter to them so we try to get them merchandise thats hard to come by here you wont have seen the ladies who clean our apartment cook for us but theyre all former olympic shot putters so its marks amp spencers tights that keep the cobwebs out of the corners and the pots scoured were a small compact unit here we all have to pull our weight it is as interesting and fascinating a posting for me as it is for you but its only by damned hard work that we stay afloat there are no passengers in this embassy now i have to move on to the facts of life for you in the soviet union everything you have been told in london about the hazards of illicit contacts with the local population is true we call it the honey trap if the kgb can compromise you then they will if you dont believe me then go and talk to the marines the american marines at their embassy theyll tell you how sticky a honey trap can be our security officer will brief you at much greater length but my advice is always always always be on your guard understood the ambassador liked the reply couldnt abide waffle miss davenport showed you in shes my personal assistant but you as my private secretary will be responsible lor keeping my schedule workable youre my troubleshooter if things need sorting out and youll and i have a very short fuse when the planning goes awry i hope it wont come to that in twelve days were heading for the crimea thats something of a bonus for you getting out of the rat cage no quickly were away for five days based on yalta youll find it all in the file that miss davenport will give you pity there couldnt have been a handover from your predecessor i understood he has pneumonia we flew him out always get a man out if hes lick standard procedure id like you to go through the file and check each last detail of the programme i dont want to be pitching up at a hotel where the booking isnt confirmed and i dont want to be in a black tie when our hosts are in pullovers ill get on with it the ambassadors head ducked but his eyes were still on holt there was a glimmer of a smile at his mouth i hear youre engaged to be married holt couldnt help himself blushed not officially itll happen sometime shes a lovely girl our miss canning broken all the bachelors hearts here a touch of romance will lift our spirits youll both be in demand but i expect it to be a circumspect romance yes ambassador nose to the grindstone holt holt took his cue left the room the ambassador was sir sylvester armitage when he had been young he had cursed his parents for the name they had christened him with but as he had risen through the ranks of the diplomatic corps as the honours and medals had gathered in his pouch so the given name had achieved a certain distinction a tall bluff man working crouched over his desk with his suit jacket hooked to the back of his chair and his braces bright scarlet he had warmed to young holt and if young holt had won the heart of jane canning then there had to be something rather exceptional to be said for him he had a silly idea but enough to make him laugh out loud he loved the hill stream freshness of youth he loved romance which was why he spent all he could afford on scholarly works on the elizabethan poets he had meant it he generally said what he meant a youthful romance inside the embassy that looked across the river to the towers of the citadel of the kremlin would hurry them all towards the moscow spring and young holt had seemed to him the sort of man who could keep it circumspect he gave a belly laugh as he jotted the note on his memory pad he had always been young holt the name had stuck to him from the time he was first sent from his devon home near dulverton to the south of the county and boarding school something about his face his appearance had always been younger than his age hed lost his first name at school and there was always enough of his school contemporaries staying during the holidays to call him by his surname his parents had picked the name up from the boys who came to stay at home he was just holt at university college london three years and an upper second in modern history he was just holt nine months in the school of east european and slavonic studies language learning he was just holt two years in the soviet department of the fco and still just holt he didnt discourage it he rather liked the name and he thought it set him apart for the whole of the first morning in the outer office attached to the ambassadors miss davenport watched him large owl eyes and her attention distracted sufficientlt for her to make more typing errors in minutes than she would normally have managed in a month holt had looked once at her wondered if she was in the running for a set of lady armitages tights and discarded the thought as cheap she brought him three cups of coffee as he unravelled the file for the visit to yalta if his predecessor had stayed the course then holt would have been glad of a gentle run in to his duties but it was a mess had only been taken so far had missed two necessary weeks of knocking into shape holt reckoned the file could have been part of the aptitude test theyd given him at fco after the entrance exam he attacked the problem and wished miss davenport didnt smoke holt was a smoker and trying to kick it and the camel fumes were rich temptation he wrestled the crimea programme into shape so that he could dominate it first flight to simferopol helicopter transfer to yalta check in at the hotel hire car booked with intourist lunch at the city authority with the chairman and the deputy chairman and then back to the hotel for an hours break before meeting the local newspaper editors dinner at the hotel the british hosting and the guest list including the same chairman and deputy chairman and the legion of freebooters they would have in tow that was day one day two in sevastopol day three in feodosija and the ambassador had said that if he was coming all that way he was damned if he was going to be prevented from walking the length of the light brigades charge his predecessors note on that was underlined twice another note in the handwritten scrawl of his predecessor the ambassador intended to lay a wreath at any british military cemetery that was still fit to visit stormed at with shot and shell while horse and hero fell they that had fought so well came thro the jaws of death back from the mouth of hell good for sir sylvester if he was going to remember cardigans heroes with a poppy wreath but there was no sign of the cemetery yet that he would have to do himself holt worked late that first day and he didnt see jane only a cryptic message on his internal phone to state that she was going straight from the office to the oklahoma rehearsal that he should get his beauty sleep for young holt the first week flew he would have sworn he had learned more from life in the capital of the soviet union in that one week than he had gathered togetherin two years shuttling paper and calling it analysis on the soviet desk at fco he went with the ambassador to the foreign ministry and was present at a preliminary planning meeting with the secretariat of the deputy foreign minister for the arrival in moscow the following month of the interparliamentary union from london he attended a reception thrown by the foreign trade crowd for a scots firm working on the natural gas pipeline across siberia he explored the metro he was taken out to dinner with jane by the second secretary commercial andhis wife he was invited to supper with jane by the first secretary political and his wife he went to the disco with jane at the british club he drove out of the city with jane in the british leyland maestro that he had been allocated to the embassys dacha for aweekend picnic with her boss the military attache and his wife that he was determined to be circumspect and that jane had the curse were the only drawbacks at the end of that first week he had the programme for yalta beaten also the draft of the programme for thel members of parliament when they flew out and he had persuaded miss davenport to restrict his coffee ration to two per day and he had seen the wisdom of the ambassador because of his girl he was the centre of attraction in the confined oasis that was the embassy community of n u r s e he didnt touch her not in public not where anyone could see but they were light in the darkness their laughter and their fun and their togetherness were a lift to the embassy personnel who had endured the short day long night misery of the moscow winter at his morning meeting with the ambassador holt presented the programme for yalta theres one problem lady armitage isnt back so her aircraft seats are extra should we cancel them wouldnt have thought so whom would you like to take ambassador id like to have a hostess for our receptions and i would like to take the most competent russian linguist on my staff to you she may among other things just be personal assistant to the military attache to me she is a very highly regarded member of the t e a m jane a flood of pleasure the ambassadors voice dropped miss davenport has hearing that puts to shame the most sophisticated state security audio systems i fancy that a few days out of the clutches of our colleagues wives would not distress you thats very good of you shes coming to work and dont forget to make double sure that youve booked an extra single room for every hotel were staying in will be done holt its a good programme well presented i learn more about the life blood of the soviet union from these visits than from anything else i do and most important we are on show we are the representatives of our country youll give miss canning my respects and request her to accompany us having first checked with the military attache that he can spare her you will fix the hotel accommodation you will sort out the necessary travel permission for her from the foreign ministry get on with it holt darling nothings what it seems bens not an agony aunt he talked about us getting out of the clutches of the embassy wives they were in the bar of the british club not up on the stools where the noise was where the newspaper men and his buisness community gathered but against the far wall she was on her second campari and soda and there was a strain about her that was new to him he drank only tonic water with ice and lemon because besides cutting out cigarettes he had forsworn alcohol from monday to friday and he was suffering dont be silly holt dont think hes taking me to yaltajust so that we can have a cuddle in the corner without anyone knowing why is he taking you then put your thinking cap on holt im a hell of a good linguist at east european and slavonic i actually had abetter mark in the oral than you did had you forgotten that i m in moscow im personal assistant to the brigadier who is the military attache an excuse has been found to take me down to the crimea he stared at her she was taller than he was she had fair hair to her shoulders she had gunmetal grey eyes that he worshipped she wore a powder blue blouse and a severe navy blue suit asi said bens not thinking of you and me bens thinking of the job and at sevastopol there i s i dont want to talk about sevastopol nor do i want to talk about whats at simferopol i want to have a drink at the end of a vile day he was bemused i honestly didnt know that that was your line when do you tell a bloke first date first time in bed first night after youre married bit late then leave it raise your glass to ben curse is over tomorrow poor darling his elbows were on the table his chin rested on his knuckles he didnt know whether to be shocked or proud hed always thought of jane as a soupedup secretary and now he had lit upon the truth that there wasenough toher line for her to be required in the crimea bloody hell she was probably on a higher grade than he was to ben she said holt raised his glass clinked hers to adjoining rooms in yalta under the table she squeezed his knee why do you call the ambassador ben her voice sunk and he had to crane to listen and from the bar it would have seemed like sweet nothings from the love birds remember the guy who tried to plummet the el al spring of he was organised by syrian air force intelligence name of nezar hindawi nasty man put his lady on a plane with three pounds of czechmade explosive in the bottom of her hand baggage timed to detonate over austria the syrians didnt just burn their fingers they were scorched right up to their armpits shouted like hell but they were caught still smoking when hindawi rattled off his confession so we broke off diplomatic relations big deal told the syrians that if they didnt behave like gentlemen then they were going to get booted out of the club they were pretty upset big loss of face and they started doing their damnedest to get our ambassador back they made their first overtures right here at a reception in the kremlin one of their diplomats sidled up to sylvester and gave him the glad news that the el al had all been a dreadful mistake the wild fantasies of a couple of bottle washers that syria was dead against terrorism what their little man didnt know was that sylvesters beloved daughter was booked on that very same flight hes got a big voice right well half the kremlin heard him dismiss these fervent syrian protestations of innocence with repeated and thunderclap replies of bloody nonsense youd have thought he was a guards sergeant at drill stopped the show he did they heard him all over the room bloody nonsense bloody nonsense then your instructions are bloody nonsense just like that spirited stuff everyone heard him first world chaps and second and third world they all heard him within days he wasknown all over the place as bloody nonsense armitage it came down to b n armitage and from that to ben in this littleminded town hes ben half the time to his face so our man in moscow wont be taking his summer holidays in damascus youre very clever tonight my darling i wish id known how clever you were holt said cleverer even than you think clever enough to get rose and penny tickets for the ballet tomorrow will you by any chance be free for dinner he would like to have kissed her but circumspection ruled and he simply smiled and gazed at her lovely grey and laughing eyes and their wretched bloody secrets so youre young holt i was going to look you up but youve beaten me to it what can i do for you it was his first visit to the secure section of the embassy next to the diplomatic section the largest in the building was that of the security officers the former policeman and army officers were a group apart he had already recognised that they had staked out their own corner in the british club and they had the ingrained habit of closing down their conversations when anyone came within earshot jane had pointed that out to him and said they were probably talking about the price their wives had paid for potatoes on the market stalls or why the whitbread draught had gone cloudy but they still went silent the security officers face was florid a jungle of blood vessels and his head was lowered as he sat at his desk so that he could see over tiny halfmoon spectacles he wore a thick wool shirt loud checks with twisted collars and a tie that was stained between the shield motifs holt took him for a regular army half colonel on secondment to the security services in london and on double secondment to fco i was letting you settle in for a bit so much to learn eh i find if i rush in with the heavy security lecture the new chaps tend to get a bit frightened best wait eh sit down they were in the heart of the building holt thought that further down the basement corridor would be the safe room he had heard about the safe room in london the underground steel walled room where the most sensitive conversations could be conducted without fear of electronic eavesdropping he was disappointed that he had not yet been invited to attend a meeting in the safe room my wife was saying only last night that you must come round to supper you and miss canning super girl that my wifell be in touch with miss canning thats the way things get done here holt reckoned that he had spotted the security officer allocated him his responsibility by the second day he had been in moscow it was his little game but he was still searching through the faces for the top spook the guy from the secret intelligence service who was janes real boss might be the one in trade with the titian beard who looked like a naval officer could be the one in consular who always kissed miss davenports hand when he came to see the ambassador im a busy man youngster so whats troubling you no crisis bea bit soon for a crisis itsonly that im going with the ambassador and miss canning to the crimea on saturday and i wondered if there was anything i should know about what well about security that sort of t h i n g he felt absurdly pompous he should have stayed at his desk the security officer looked sternly at him just the obvious what youd naturally assume you dont discuss anything of a confidential nature in your hotels nor in any vehicle you dont accept invitations late at night to a soviet household what theyd have told you in london your rooms might be bugged there will probably be a kgb operative with you as chauffeur or interpreter a natural assumption but his excellency and miss canning know the form should be rather a nice trip good idea of he to take in the battlefield wish i was with him if you could walk down that field with a metal detector god youd make a fortune theres nothing else i should know like what well i just wondered holt stopped making a fool of himself ah i get you the security officer beamed all avincular you wondered about security your own security eh just that this is not beirut young man he does not have minders in russia this is a very peaceable country hurts me to say it but he can walk the streets of any city in the soviet union any time of day or night and have less prospect of getting mugged assaulted stuck up than in a good many cities at home this isa highly policed country the moscow posting iscategorised as low risk im not a bodyguard the personal security of the staff here is about bottom of my agenda and thats the same with every western embassy in town my job young holt is to protect the confidentiality of this establishment to block kgb attempts to compromise and recruit our staff and that takes the bulk of my time right thats all i wanted to know good well as i say my wife will be in touch with miss canning youre very kind holt left he dreaded being summoned for the full security briefing he thought it would be as hideous as the promise of dinner with the man and his woman a penny for them lover she lay on her side and her clothes were on the floor and the street lights gleamed through the thin curtain and her fingers played with the hairs on holts chest what to tell her to tell her that he had been rotten in bed again because he couldnt get it out of his reinforced concrete skull that this lovely girl of his worked with the embassy spook to tell her that hi thought spooking was a shoddy grubby way of life to tell her that he had thought bloody nonsense armitage was doing them a favour when in reality he had con trived an opportunity for a wellqualified operative to run a trained eye over the port facilities of the soviet navy at sevastopol and over the cap badge insignia of the troops in the garrison town of simferopol he turned to face his jane he took his stranger in his arms over her shoulder he could see the travellinj clock and no bloody time because in half an hour the other girls would be back from the bolshoi no time to tell her body to body and his head was buried in the softness of her breasts and he ached with his love for her he could think it out he could work it through but it would take him an age he had thought he knew everything about her every mark of her mind and her body and he knew nothing what he thought he owned was not his clinging to her holding her for the comfort he fell away her head and the silk of her hair were on his arm just a bit tired thats a l l she kissed him wet and sweet and belonging stay safe darling what else she laughed at him head back hair falling by rights they should have travelled in the embassy range rover out to vnukovo airport from which the internal aeroflot flights left the range rover was supposed to be used for all the ambassadors journeys that were not official but holt had decided they would go in style and so valeri had been roused early and the silver cloud rolls royce was at its polished best the ambassador and jane sat far back in the rear seat upholstery while holt shared the front with valeri holt reckoned that the chauffeur was about his own age he had expected an old retainer had not anticipated that his excellencys driver would be a smartly turned out young man with the sort of hair cut that any limousine man in mayfair would boast it was still dark when they pulled away from the embassy courtyard onto the riverside across from the kremlin there was no traffic he had learned that at the best of times cars were in high demand and short supply even at rush hour the streets were good for a pretty fast run but at this time they were empty the pavements showed life the dribble of a night shift heading for the metro tunnels and street cleaners and the office advance guard appearing at street level making darting runs across the wide streets he had barely spoken to jane when they had met while they waited for the ambassador mercifully the man had been punctual striding down the steps from the main door with that unnecessary glance at his watch to demonstrate that he was on time he hadnt knowr how to communicate or what to say so there was a problem last nights problem and he didnt want to talk about it not in whispers he had known jane for two weeks under three years met at the school met in the way that most young men meet the girl who will one day become their wife one seat free at a canteen table and a curled gammon steak that needed disguising and a request for the tomato ketchup please two young people both older than the average students around them the one shuffling the tomato ketchup and the other pushing the salt and pepper what a meeting the young man thinking that the girl was quite beautiful and the young girl thinking that he looked interesting the young man able to say quietly and without conceit that he had done well in the civil service entrance examinations and then well in the diplomatic corps entrance aptitude tests she had said looking straight at him that she was just a secretary in whitehall nothing specific and that she was damn lucky to have been plucked out of the pool and given the opportunity to learn russian more time together and hed thought she was struggling sometimes in the tutorials and the relationship started when he made a habit of calling round at her earls court bedsit to give her a hand with the essay that was the fortnightly chore fingers touching mouths meeting the unhurried building of something lovely weeks and months of learning to share lives work and fun a young until who was determined to be something special at his chosen career and a young girl who was just a secretary in whitehall right no messing hed been pretty shattered by the marks she had won at the end of the course not quite at his overall level though pretty close but young holt had never questioned how it was that a girl who was just a secretary won marks that were pretty damned close to his own how do you like moscow mr holt very well indeed thank you valeri his thoughts drifted away from jane away from him being hopeless in bed with her away from the deception his thoughts were on the ambassadors driver be a chosen man wouldnt he not chosen by the british chosen by the organ of state security nice looking fellow but hed large ears and theyd be well rinsed they would hear everything said in the car holt wondered how it was done did the men from kgb call by on a friday evening after valeris shift finished for a quick resume on what hed learned that week while piloting the rolls did he write out a little report every saturday morning before he took his small kids to dancing class or the ice rink he was far gone concerned now with whether valeri had a large wife or an extra large wife whether he was on lady armitages list for tights with gusset they travelled in the fast lane where the government officials were driven big blasts on the power horn to keep clear the path of her britannic majestys ambassador there were men with brushes there were old women with bundles of sticks the street and pavement cleaning had started holt could have cried he felt so bloody miserable but how could she have told him of course she couldnt have bloody told him at the airport there was already a slowmoving confusion of queues valeri deposited their luggage at the rear of a queue and checked with holt when they would be back and the time and number of the return flight he wished them well and said the crimea would be beautiful after the moscow winter he had good cause to be pleased with the big man away hed have time on his hands the chance to burnish the bonnet of the roller with a leather holt carried the ambassadors briefcase and jane carried her own and holt hoped to hell that there wouldnt be a foulup with the tickets there wasnt nor were there special facilities for the ambassador and his party it was the way he liked things done didnt want a brace of officials there to shake his hand andwish him well thats what hed said to holt on such a trip he could sense the mood of the nation and the temperature could not be taken in a vip lounge they took their place in the queue the ambassador lit his pipe and unfolded yesterdays times from london holt craved a cigarette the prohibition could not last and jane touched his arm they had been in the queue for five minutes and not moved an inch do you know the hoary old one about queuing here if you do youre still going to hear it again ivan was in a queue for two hours trying to buy a pair of winter boots and he snorts to the people around him that hes had enough and hes going down to the kremlin and hes going to shoot old gorbachov and thats going to be his protest about the inefficiency of the soviet union off ivan goes and three hours later hes back hes asked if hes indeed shot comrade gorbachov no ivan says i couldnt be bothered to wait the queue was too long like it holt managed a small smile jane squeezed his arm as if to tell him to calm down as if to say that a queue at vnukovo wasnt his fault certainly hoary miss canning the ambassador intoned i have heard that anecdote told in turn of messrs brezhnev chernenko andropov and now gorbachov but i think that i am safe in stating that it was never said out loud during the revered leadership of uncle joe stalin dont fret holt it wont go without us the blockage at the head of the queue was removed a man was shoved aside hoarse with complaint and waving a ticket jane said it meant the flight was overbooked and they were shedding the least important a sourfaced woman behind the counter examined their tickets looking at them as if to ascertain whether they could possibly be forgeries they were checked once more by a bored militiaman at the gate who then took an age studying holts and janes foreign ministry permission to leave the moscow environs zone they went on to the security barrier two more militiamen an xray machine and a metal detector arch to pass under jane had a camera a palmofthehandsized olympus that she took out of her handbag before it went on the belt the ambassadors spectacle case attracted the flashing red light and earned him a cursory body patting they were in the departure lounge holt and jane went off in search of coffee for themselves and an orange juice diluted for the ambassador bit heavy wasnt it the security theyve their quota of nasties just like the rest of us hed noticed since reaching moscow how much she enjoyed filling him in on insider detail couldnt have happened in london when he was doing his initial fco time and she was just a secretary in whitehall georgians and jews and estonians and ukrainians theyve all got grievances they all foster little cells that want to get out not easy theyve sent up fighters to shoot down aircraft that have been hijacked in the past and if theres half a chance of settling the problem on the ground then they go in firing happened last year they dont play about here none of your patient negotiation storm and shoot is their answer not that they admit theres a political problem its always drug addicts and delinquents i laugh like a drain each time i hear of a hijack its the biter bit isnt it that little shit carlos was trained at the patrice lumumba university right here in downtown moscow and hes only the tip of the iceberg they train them to do horrible things to us and we broadcast on bbc world service and the voice of america what theyve done and the folks back home pretty soon get into the same act is that what you specialise in holt asked she smiled at him a big and open smile she said god knows why ben wants orange juice its quite foul here theres a fancy dress party at the dacha next saturday whatll we go as ill go as a boar with a ring in my nose and you can go as a farmer and lead me round and show everyone whos boss they both laughed she thought it was funny and he thought it was sad and the ambassadors orange juice looked as awful as their coffee tasted they boarded and take off was only minutes late the ambassador was behind them in the aisle seat and next to a man in a dark suit with a bulging briefcase before the belt sign was off the ambassador was booming out his conversational russian angling for a rapport a oneclass aircraft a tupolev rear engines and passengers he had hardly slept not after shed run him back to the embassy and hed been plagued with the niggling worries about getting the trip moving well he started to doze there was the drone of the voice behind him and he was wondering how the ambassador managed to test the waters of soviet opinion when he talked so much that the fellow next to him barely had the chance to get three consecutive words up his gullet hed sort it all out hed sort it all out with jane in time because he had to because he loved her up to cruising altitude and he was nodding eyes opened then collapsing shut so damned tired he was a wild pig and she was pulling him round and they were all laugh ing all the second and third secretaries and their wives and all the personal assistants all laughing their heads off because his girl had him on a leash flying due south a journey of miles a route over tula kursk and charkov cruising at feet ground speed miles per hour he felt her pull him forward and then to her and his eyes were closed and he waited for the soft brush of her kiss behind his ear where she always kissed and he waited he opened his eyes she was looking down at her watch concentrating his head was forward as if guarding her hiding her breasts and her hands and her lap away from her watch looking through the porthole window the visibility was stunning and the daylight spreading the fields sharp and the roads clear and a city laid out as a model she took three photographs quickly and the camera slipped back into her bag and she grinned at him and eased him back so that he was fully into his seat then she kissed him behind the ear a fast peck he was a pig on a lead and he didnt have the strength to argue the vapour trails of the airliner were brilliantly clear five and a half miles above the ground surface the first airliner of the day and a lorry driver leaned from his cab to watch the slow progress of the puffy white scars in the blue skies the lorry driver was delivering prefabricated walls for a factory development on the east side of charkov the factory development was an extension of square feet and when in production would manufacture onepiece cast turrets for the t tank it was the evaluation of the boffins in british and american intelligence who concerned themselves in such studies that the t main battle tank was technically superior to those of the nato forces the factory when enlarged could greatly increase its output of the low silhouette turret so low that the crews fighting in them could be no taller than to have a photograph of the tank turret factory extension would not be an intelligence coup but it would be useful there were few coups in that painstaking world but much that was useful the size of the extension would enable the analysts to calculate the increased output of new t s the vapour trails bowled on the lorry driver reached the building site gate at a military airfield west of moscow an antonov transporter bearing the insignia of the air force of the syrian arab republic was in the final stages of loading the manifest listed a cargo of mig interceptor spares a sizable cargo but not enough to fill the aircraft because space had been set aside for basic seating forward in the hold the pilot was engaged in his final checks before take off clearance and the start of a filed flight plan that listed a brief stop at simferopol to take on personnel and then a direct onward flight to the el masr base close to damascus on that saturday morning in the yalta spring a major had command of the citys militia force his superiors were at home in their gardens or in the shops with their wives or in the mountains with their children this particular militia major years old and twice passed over for promotion sipped a poor imitation of gritty turkish coffee and cast his eyes wearily over the backlog of reports on his desk he was responsible for the department for combating theft of socialist property and speculation for the department of criminal inves tigation for the internal passport service for the state automobile inspectorate for the patrol service and the preserving of public order in public places and for the department of visas and registration of foreigners his intray contained the overnight reports of apartment block caretakers reports on the hunting of draft dodgers an essay on the failure of the traffic lights on botkin street a surveillance report on two latvians who would be arrested in the following week to face charges of leading an antisocial and parasitic mode of life the radio in the control room spluttered occasionally to life to disturb his halfhearted concentration he had to last until six oclock in the late afternoon and then he could take off his uniform tunic put on a sweater and go home to his family deep in his intray was a memorandum stating that the british ambassador was arriving in yalta in company with his private secretary and an interpreter for a semiofficial visit and would stay at the oreanda hotel he was not required to furnish the delegation with a militia car escort it was the militia majors belief for what little that was worth that unless the traffic lights on botkin street were repaired their failure would lead to an accident but there was nothing he could do a waste of his time to try to dig out an engineer from roads and transport at a weekend in his briefcase was a book that would help him through the afternoon he was held up at the lights at the junction on botkin a main intersection and all the lights showing red and the dumb fools waiting as if they had a day to kill could not have happened in moscow could only happen in this secondclass junk yard to which he had been consigned after eleven months in the backwater of yalta it still burned in him that he had been dismissed from the capital and posted to oblivion he had been a captain in the organ of state security he had had a promising future in the kgb by hard work by passing his exams he had entered the favoured guards directorate he had served in the personal protection squad of the politburo member who was first deputy prime minister he had been tipped for membership of the guard assigned to the general secretary of the party and he had drunk too much been smashed out of his skull he had been reduced to corporal and transferred he was no longer the high flier he no longer possessed the plastic card that gave him access to the luxury goods at the state security commissariat he no longer lived in a threebedroomed flat with a view over the park one bottle of vodka after a stint of hours continuous duty had greased him down the pole caught drunk in uniform on the street on his back in the gutter and dumped with his wife and two toddler children onto a hour train journey to nowhere yalta of course it still burned from the personal protection squad of a politburo member with the magic card and the right to carry a makarov pm mm automatic pistol down the chute to kgb corporal he was unarmed he was at the wheel of a sluggish chaika car which needed a new gear box he was a chauffeur and held up at the lights on botkin street and his job was to drive the ambassador from great britain the kgb corporal hit the horn to clear the dumb fools out of his way holt didnt wait for the lift there was too much of a queue he went up the two flights of stairs and down the corridor to the ambassadors room knocked went in the cars here finally relax holt you are in one of the most unpunctual regions of a country noted for its tardiness if were there on time well be standing around on our own scratching our backsides not miss canning of course but you and me certainly ive checked the room for this evening and the menu dont try too hard holt for heavens sake foulups make life so much more entertaining i feel a younger man already damn nice air down here the ambassador slipped on his jacket straightened his tie knocked his pipe out into an ashtray ill go and rout jane out the ambassador frowned sharply at his private secretary damn it holt havent you been listening i am not in a hurry i want to make an entrance i will not make much of an entrance if i am the first to arrive you may put it down if you wish to old imperial grandeur but i do mean to make an entrance when i visit the worthies of the yalta municipality got me got you youve the bridport stuff in my briefcase holt wondered how on earth bridport on the english south coast had made the decision to twin itself with yalta must cost the sad ratepayers a fortune in exchange visits then best foot forward holt he snapped the door open he went out into the corridor and rapped gently on janes door the ambassador led the way down the corridor no glance backwards the viceroys procession and jane exploded out through her door thrusting her small olympus into her handbag down the staircase the ambassador leading and jane happily in pursuit thanks be to god that we didnt forget our camera holt said he was always useless at sarcasm dont be childish holt she said coolly quietly so that his excellency would not hear down the stairs across the foyer the ambassador smiled warmly at a group of exhausted tourists speaking german and attempting to check in and none of them had the least idea who it was that smiled at them holt reached the door first pulled it open and stood hack he saw the driver moving to open the rear door of the vehicle he saw a young man darkskinned long hair ambling across the road towards the hotel and holding a windcheater across his stomach distraction because the ambassador had passed playing the oldworld gentleman ushering jane through first jane was out onto the steps and hesitating as if the light of the crimeas lunchtime sunshine were too bright for her as if she needed to adjust slow stilted moments and each slower than the last jane going forward and giving her winning grin to the driver and the driver bobbing his head in acknowledgement and the ambassador beaming and holt coming through the door each movement each moment slower and the man who was dark skinned with long hair coming off the road and onto the pavement and the windcheater falling past his knees and past his shins and past his ankles and something black and stubbed and squat in his hands something that he was lifting to his shoulder something that was a protuberance from his head and mouth and nose something that was a gun for christs sake he stared at the man he stared at the barrel of the rifle no longer slow movement the moment the world stopped jane in front of the ambassador holt in the doorway the driver with his back to them all bent inside the car to smooth down the rug that covered the leather upholstery everything frozen no voice in holts throat the warning scream locked in his mind gazing into the face of the man and then the flash and the flash repeated and the smoke then jane spinning away beaten and kicked and punched backwards jane falling against ben and ben not there to hold her upright ben fading from his feet sliding down the glass shattering to his right and to his left caving in holt shaking his head because he couldnt understand looking at the face that was topped by a wig that had inched over the right ear looking at the scar on the mans left cheek puzzling how a face came by a scar that looked like a crows foot the rifle dropped to the mans side he peered forward as if to be certain of his work all movement now speed returning to the world the man ran in that moment holt found in his ears the crash of the gunfire and the cordite in his nostrils and the scream from his throat he was on his knees his body covered their bodies to protect them so bloody late he lay across them sheltering them as if they were still in danger blood was on his hands and on the cuffs of his shirt red on white he had taken janes hand in his an unresisting hand as it was when she was exhausted or sleeping the scream in his throat had died with them he was aware of men and women fearful around him they formed a circle at the level of the door and on the steps and on the pavement the shoes of one of them crunched the glass fragments and the shoes of another nudged the spent cartridge cases ambulance holt said in english get us an ambulance the duty day manager called that the ambulance was sent for holt saw his face quivering and streaming with tears he saw that the driver was talking urgently into a personal radio couldnt hear the words could see the whitefaced shock of the man the street was blocked from holts view only the line of knees and skirts and trousers and shoes for him to focus on empty ground between the legs and the feet and where holt lay covering the bodies of jane and ben empty ground laced with blood trickles and with shards of glass he held tightly onto janes hand as the misery welled in him he had seen the face of the man he had seen the smooth pine varnish skin and the eyes that were burnished mahogany and the thin chisel of the nose and the clip of the moustache he had seen the scar hole on the mans cheek and had followed the lines that ran from in four lines into the shape of a crows foot there was the far away sound of a siren he had been behind ben and behind jane he had been behind them and safe he had seen the man with the aimed gun and he had done nothing could not explain to himself how he had watched the slow ballet movements of the man raising the weapon and aiming and done nothing desperate misery and it had all been so slowly drawn out in front of his eyes he squeezed janes hand her fingers hard enough for it to have hurt her and she did not flinch the driver broke the circle he jostled the people back and was shouting to them to retreat pushing a corridor clear through them holt could see down the corridor down the steps across the pavement into the street he could see where the man had stood and taken his time to aim he was aware of the closing bleat of the siren his view of the street was cut by the white bulk of the ambulance the driver was tugging at his shoulders trying to pull him upright trying and failing to break his hold on janes hand he still held her while the ambulance men swiftly heaved ben onto a stretcher carried him away down the corridor to the open rear doors they came back for her for his jane he saw the shrug in their shoulders the shoulders and the faces told him that they knew this was not work for ambulancemen they lifted her more gently than they had lifted ben and more awkwardly because his hand never unclasped hers the doors closed behind him bens litter lay on one side of the ambulances opaque interior janes on the other holt crouched in the space between one ambulanceman was with them going perfunctorily through pulse checks and bending to listen first at bens chest and then at janes breast the ambulance was going fast siren loud her last words were clear in his memory scathing words dont be childish holt young holt had loved jane canning and the last time he had seen her face it had been puckered screwed up in annoyance he bit at his lip he looked down at the fright that was set like wax on her face that was the obscenity of it that all the good times wonderful times were blasted out dont be childish holt he had a bowl of beetroot soup in front of him and a tub of sour cream and two slices of black bread he had a quarter bottle of vodka in the desk drawer beside his knee the militia major was tucking a napkin into his collar when the news broke out of the control room garbled staccato chaos a shooting on lenin street he was gulping a spoonful of soup a killing at the oreanda hotel his napkin sliding into his soup foreign visitors attacked with rifle fire he was careering from his desk the sour cream slurping over his papers a call for all assistance it was saturday lunchtime it was the time that yalta closed itself down and the militia headquarters was at onethird strength he felt sick the tang of the beetroot and the chopped onion was choking in his throat into the control room a relay coming through on the loudspeaker from ambulance control the young sergeant at the console listening at the telephone and writing urgently the telephone slapped down major the management at the oreanda hotel on lenin street report that the british ambassador and his interpreter were shot outside the hotel dead they did not know ambulance control reports that they are carrying two cadavers and one survivor to the clinic on naberezhnaya a foreign diplomat possibly dead everything he did now was going to be examined under a microscope at the investigation in a week in a month inform the kgb control exactly as it comes in the sergeant was reaching for his telephone to go to the clinic to go to the oreanda to stay in headquarters which he picked up a telephone himself he rang the number of criminal investigation two floors above and the telephone rang and his fingers drummed on the console surface and his feet shuffled bastards gone their lunch the sergeant came off the telephone and the major told him to send all militia cars to the oreanda the major ran out of the building howled in the yard for a driver had himself taken to the oreanda the kgb had beaten him half a dozen of ther there crowds gathering but back on the far side of the street he shouldered his way forward to the knot of men all with radios all either talking into them or listening to the return messages in front of the broken plate glass front door he saw the blood stains perhaps in the car he had half hoped the radio at headquarters had carried an aberration well that some hysterical idiot had the bloodstains and the kgb swarming over the steps of the hotel wiped that out they treated the militia major as dirt they were the organ of state security he was a common policeman brusquely he was told what had happened you had a very fast call the militia major said for answer there was a cursory gesture down the steps towards a black chaika car a man was sitting haggard over the wheel of the car a radio in his hand shaking his head in response to the questions of two others the driver the militia major understood a kgb driver had been assigned to the british ambassadors party so you have a description something i can broadcast the man he spoke to looked away if i am to seal the city put in road blocks i have to have a description he saw nothing what a close quarters shooting right under your own mans nose and he saw nothing how could he see nothing there is no description there has to be the militia major shouted he did not see the killer approach he took cover when the shooting started he did not see the killer leave there is no description shit spat the militia major you pick your men the kgb officer walked away the militia major sighed his relief the fear of failure was shed a kgb matter a kgb failure best news he could possibly have been given he followed the kgb officer what do you want of me the militia major said flatly we have closed the airport we have suspended all telephonic communication from the city we have referred all details to moscow you should put blocks on all routes out of the city for what are they looking no response he sat on a long wooden bench in a corridor of white walls and polished linoleum flooring two old ladies hadat first shared the bench with him but they had long since been ordered away by the militiaman who stood with arms folded and watched over him through the flapping rubber doors on the other side of the corridor the trailing white coats of the doctors and surgeons and the white skirts of the nurses came and went he waited another militiaman stood on guard by the rubber doors he hadnt fought it he hadnt wanted to be inside the emergency room he was alert now conscious of everything around him aware enough to know that he did not want to see the last medical rites performed on the girl he loved and the man he admired each man and woman who went into the emergency room or came from it gave him a glance and then looked away when he met their eyes it was an older man who came to him white haired and lean and with his smock coat bloodstained he spoke with his hands his hands said that hope had gone in russian holt was told that the man was the senior surgeon on duty at the hospital he was told that the injuries had been too severe for treatment he shook the hand of the surgeon and thanked him holt said that he needed a telephone again the hands of the surgeon were in motion it was outside his province the surgeon backed away two trolleys sheet shrouded were wheeled through the rubber doors and down the corridor he sat numbed watched them go his attention was to his right the man wore perfect creased slacks and a well cut wool jacket the man flashed an identity card didnt linger with it but it was there long enough for holt to recognise the komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti holt read the name of the kgb officer i want a telephone holt said speaking in russian the kgb officer was fishing a notebook from his pocket and a ballpoint pen i said that i wanted a telephone there will be a telephone mr holt but my first priority is to apprehend the despicable culprits responsible for this crime just a telephone the street was packed solid you dont need me to tell you mr holt we need to have a description from you he was in a police state a state controlled by the leviathan apparatus of the organ of state security a state where the kgb crushed all dissent kept the gulags filled he was in a country that boasted no terrorism no law and order problem no incidence of armed crime he believed as never before that in this country nothing moved nothing happened without kgb authority now a charade about the need for a description ask someone else what the bastard looked like holt yelled at him the militiaman close to him had clenched his fist ready to intervene and the militiaman beside the rubber doors had his hand wavering close to the wood truncheon fastened to his belt the kgb officer strode away all so clear now to holt the state had butchered them the authorities had killed them he went off down the corridor he shrugged away a feeble attempt by his militiaman minder to stop him he went into an office that was empty because of the weekend he picked up the telephone he dialled a zero and then seven for long distance he waited for the clicks he dialled the moscow code and the embassy number the unobtainable whine sang back at him he tried twice more twice more the same blank whine out of the clinic the short walk along the sea front the two militiamen trailing him a distance away as if he might turn on them savage them he reached the oreanda hotel the street and the half steps picketed off brown paper stuck where the glass panels had been the glisten of soap and water on the steps in past the militia and more kgb up to the reception desk he wanted a telephone call to moscow it was regretted there was no telephonic communication with moscow then he wanted a telex connection with moscow and he wanted it now right now it was regretted that there was also no telex communication with moscow by whose authority by the authority of state security so tired so bloody exhausted slowly deliberately i have to speak to moscow i am so sorry mr holt but it is not possible for anyone to speak to moscow all the lines are closed is there a post office it is saturday afternoon the post office is closed mr holt ihave to speak to my embassy i am sure that later mr holt the lines will be restored the reception manager gave him his room key and then reached below the counter and shuffled to him janes handbag dropped it when she was hit it was a small kind gesture by the reception staff to have retrieved the handbag kept it for him he offered his thanks he went slowly up the flights of stairs to his room he locked the door behind him he tipped her bag out onto the coverlet of his bed her purse her passport her notepad her pen her embassy id her lipstick her mirror her hairbrush her letter from home her photograph of holt in whitehall held in a small silver frame her camera he was shipwrecked his landfall was a room on the second floor of the oreanda hotel in yalta his sea was a closed down telephone and telex system to moscow and a wall of silence he had gone through shock and misery and fury now his reserve failed alone where noone saw him holt knelt beside his bed and wept and his face covered her possessions and he said over and over again the words she had spoken to him dont be childish holt the ciphered message whispered onto a teleprinter at main headquarters in dzerzhinsky square a report from kgb yalta to kgb moscow giving information requiring guidance saturday afternoon in the capital city the message still in cipher passed to second directorate domestic countersubversion and to fifth chief directorate suppression of dissent rows of weekend empty desks in second and fifth chief dust covers over the computer consoles skeleton staffing the minutes sliding away second directorate duty officer going in search of his senior his senior telephoning home to the man commanding the second department of the directorate the man commanding second department waiting for a call back from the directorate chief out walking his dog fifth chief directorate on hold and looking for a lead from second directorate foreign ministry embassy liaison stating they would take no action until briefed by second directorate and until consultation with fifth chief directorate the dog was a young german shepherd and needed a good long walk on a saturday afternoon the duty officer at the british embassy whiled away his afternoon in the near deserted building and watched the ripple of the moskva river from his upper room he had run down lenin street he had turned away from the shore front into a small alleyway no more running then he had walked as he had shrugged into his windcheater one bad moment when the windcheater had been on the ground and he had had to scoop it up the gun under the shoulder of the windcheater another right turn and another left turn and the volga car in front of him and the man starting the engine the rifle magazine detached and metal stock folded down wrapped in sacking on the floor of the car going fast out of the city and towards the alushta road did you succeed he punched the air in front of his face and turned to the wide billowing smile of his commander there was no obstacle to their flight they had beaten the road blocks he was abu hamid abu hamid was the name he had taken when he had joined the popular front for the liberation of palestine he was years old his body was bone thin spare as if he ate little as if he enjoyed no luxuries the complexion on his face was smooth with the exception of the scar under his left eye he wore no moustache and his matted dark hair was cut close to his scalp beyond the scar he was unrecognisable unremarkable he was a chosen man he sucked hard like he was panting on his cigarette he exploded the smoke from his mouth he had stripped off the civilian clothes in which he had appeared on the front pavement of the oreanda hotel he was now in military fatigues they had stopped by the roadside at the citys limits and behind the cover of flourishing saplings abu hamid had swiftly dug a deep hole in the ditch and crammed in it the windcheater the trousers the shirt the moustache and the wig the city of yalta was behind them the high slopes of oak and beech forest that dominated the city were lost to them in a comer of the car park of the sechonov climatic and physiotherapeutic institute shielded by small recently planted acacia and laurel and magnolia trees they had transferred from the volga car to a military jeep the car could not be linked to them the car had been hired from intourist the car had been fitted with false plates later the plates exchanged the car would be returned the bill paid none of that was the business of abu hamid the commander knew that the journey from yalta to simferopol would take given a few minutes either way one hour and three quarters they hammered through gurzuf past the signed turnings to the defence ministry sanatorium and the sputnik youth camp the commanders eyes flickered to the side mirrors of the jeep they had no tail through alushta as if it did not exist as if the narrowing streets in the town were merely an inconvenience on their journey the commander pricked his ears to listen for a trailing siren he heard nothing the jeep straining when they climbed towards the lower reaches of the chatir dag that rose higher than any mountain in lebanon higher than the mystic hermon of syria higher than any mountain of palestine that was the homeland of abu hamid the aircraft should now be leaving moscow there was a schedule to be met at the roads summit under chatir dag they did not pause to look back and down towards yalta and the hazed seascape abu hamid leaned forward he unwrapped the ak assault rifle from the sacking on the floor space between his feet he emptied the magazine on semiautomatic at a range of five or six paces he had fired eleven bullets he knew the weapon as he knew himself now he put the remaining rounds with the magazine and the rifle carefully into the mouth of the sack wrapped it tight into a bundle and tucked it under his feet a tradesmans tool and he had finished with it holt lay on his bed he had heard the whispered talk in the corridor outside his room he had already been into bens room and into janes room and he had packed their belongings bens case and janes were at the foot of his bed he presumed the low voices outside were of a guard posted there for his protection to keep him inside the room each half hour he rang reception to see if the line to moscow was open and each half hour he was told that it was not each half hour he requested a call to kgb headquarters in the city and each time he was told that all kgb numbers were engaged there was no other explanation of course they had killed ben and jane he lay on the bed her blood still on his hands and on his shirt simferopol is in the centre of the crimean peninsular the city with a population of close to is the hub of the crimea and from this regional capital the roads snake out to yevpatoriya and sevastopol and yalta and feodosija and dzhankov it is an old city dominated now by industrial estates its university several research institutes at simferopol is also a military academy for the colonel commandant foreign cadre training that saturday was a hell of a good day at the military academy his best day in six months in fact the colonel commandant would this day wave goodbye without a shade of regret to the delegation of palestinians for the ethiopians the cubans the angolans even for the north vietnamese he could find some words of praise nothing good could be said for the animal palestinians not even as a courtesy at the farewell airport parade before the animals filed onto their aircraft when the doors closed on the fuselage they would get the sharp index finger nightly in the mess to his brother officers he catalogued their abuses three of the animals caught trying to climb over the walls after curfew hour to hitch into the city one with the insolence to complain that a prostitute in simferopol had stolen his wallet one returned to the academy by the militia after being arrested when trying to sell counterfeit american dollars one brought back to the academy by the militia dead drunk and violent four who would be in solitary confinement right up to the last minute for attacking a senior instructor one accused by a fine party man of getting pregnant his fine daughter not much sympathy from his colleagues in the mess and rudeness to his face from the odious commander of the animals one rifle lost damage done all over the camp and throughout the course an atmosphere of indiscipline that was insufferable to the colonel commandant he would cheer their going every last one of them from their ridiculously named groups popular front saiiqa democratic front liberation front general command struggle command idiot titles he was a career soldier he despised these animals through the colonel commandants office window came the blast of western music loud and decadent cassette players turned to full volume the animals taunting their instructors because the animals were going home his telephone rang the animals were in the gymnasium with their baggage waiting for transport to the airport a fighter from saiiqa had argued with a fighter from the struggle command and knifed him the fighter from saiiqa was in the academy military police cells the fighter from struggle command was in the academy sick bay where is their commander their commander was off base too much he slammed his fist onto his desk in fury this was too fucking much the teleprinters linking moscow and yalta murmured through the afternoon on into the early evening questions and demands for more information from moscow scant detail relayed from yalta a crisis committee sat at dzerzhinsky square feeding from the teleprinter material and going hungry no workable description of a gunman no getaway car identified cartridge cases that were from the kalashnikov family and there were more than two million weapons in the country that could fire such bullets the files on dissident elements in the crimea were being studied in his office the foreign ministry embassy liaison was left to clean his nails and watch his silent telephone the commander drove his jeep through the main gates of the military academy at simferopol he waved cheerfully to the guard he braked to allow a squad of soviet conscripts to march across his path all the conscripts were marched wherever they went in the camp a difference in attitudes he reflected between the training demanded by the red army and the training required for the fighting in lebanon he checked his watch he thought they had made good time he thought the antonov transporter would now be approaching simferopol airport he stopped by the gymnasium punched the shoulder of abu hamid he was too concerned with the tightness of his schedule to take note of the three military policemen standing outside the main doors of the building the commander did not have to tell the young man to hold silence to play a part of relaxed indifference when he was inside the gymnasium his abu hamid would know he drove away drove to the office of the colonel commandant he breezed into the inner office on any other day he would have waited more respectfully at the door but it was the last day and it was the day that was the brilliant culmination of a difficult and dangerous mission later than i thought colonel profuse apologies he laid the jeeps keys on the desk of the colonel commandant one last expedition for shopping in the city an opportunity to purchase merchandise that will remind me for the rest of my days in the service of the palestinian revolution of the warmth shown to us by the soviet people he saw at once the barely controlled fury of the commandant i trust my lateness has not inconvenienced you colonel shopping in the city is not always as fast as one would wish you have been gone seven hours some shopping a good lunch time drifts he saw the clenched fist the white knuckles there has been a problem a problem the colonel commandant snorted while you took lunch and wine and shopped your hooligans have been brawling i have one in the sickbay i have one locked in the guard house the colonel commandant slapped a small doublebladed knife down onto his desk a knife fight while you were lunching and wining and shopping i will tell you the military crime code for such an offence assault by one service person on another in the absence of any subordinate relations between them that carries a minimum of two years confinement and a maximum of twelve years my abject apologies colonel i will deal with the offender at once the colonel commandant stood you will do nothing of the sort you will get it into your head that i have the authority to detain the entire cadre until a full investigation has been carried out the commander thought of abu hamid coming panting to the volga car he thought of the kalashnikov in the sacking hidden in the large shopping bag of the simferopol beryozka souvenir store and hanging from his hand the rifle listed as lost on manoeuvres but our aircraft fuck the aircraft a serious breach of discipline has taken place amongst unsupervised personnel we have to take the aircraft the bombast gone from the commander nervous and wheedling now it is of critical importance that we take the aircraft a fortnights delay a thorough investigation will teach these hooligans the authority of discipline it cannot happen dont tell me what can or cannot happen it should happen and it will happen out of the confusion in yalta would soon come order the commander shivered the trap would close i make a deal with you you are in no position to offer me a deal military regulations are not subject to negotiation give me a pistol for what and a mop and bucket for what and access to the guard room for what so that i can shoot your hooligan and clear up the mess and remove your problem the colonel commandant blanched sat down you would do that with my own hand give me the pistol the knife was returned to the drawer take him with you then take both of them and punish them at home an admirable solution the injured man is fit to travel he was told that the injured man could certainly fly the commandant regarded the palestinian with disgust and with awe he told his duty officer to send the bus to the gymnasium even in the crowded interior of the bus seats for personnel and the luggage filling the rear boot and the aisle between the seats the commander thought that abu hamid was a man apart dreaming his own dreams in his own privacy the man from struggle command sat pale at the back of the bus with his left arm in a sling the man from saiiqa stood in the aisle at the front beside the commander in handcuffs they drove out of the gates only the commander and abu hamid and the man from the struggle command and the man from saiiqa refrained from cheering as the barrier was lowered behind them through the drab city where a greyness hung that even the sunlight could not lift past the ukraina hotel and over the wide bridge spanning the salgir river and past the museum and the terraced parkland and the railway station through the industrial estates out towards the airport around the perimeter of the airport fence waved through the gates into the military section past the buildings and the control tower out along the edge of the tarmac the sun was low in the west and it hit the silver lower belly of the antonov transporter the antonov was decorated with the green and white and black roundels of the syrian air force the commanders breath squeezed between his teeth military bandsmen were grouped around a rostrum there were steps in position at the forward door a fuelling tanker was driving away from his hip pocket the commander took a folded khaffiyeh scarf shook it open and wound it round his head and his face as if he were a revolutionary fighter for palestine not an embarking passenger at the military section of simferopol airport in the crimea as he descended from the bus the commandants transport drew up the camp instructors impeccably turned out jumped down from their truck the men were lined up in two platoonsized squads the anthem of the soviet union was played by the red army band interminable and they were a single phonecall from disaster a phone call from yalta to simferopol the band struck havoc with a fighting march of the palestine revolution in his ears the bell of a telephone screamed the colonel commandant cold and contemptuous scarcely pausing for the interpreter addressed the men if they had been seen transferring from the volga to the jeep in the car park in the mind of the commander the bell of a telephone clamoured our party supports and will continue to support peoples fighting for their freedom we will never agree to the unacceptable american demands that the soviet nation should cease to support its friends the commander stood at attention in front of his men only the major who was his friend only major said hazan would have dared to launch the plan such daring such brilliance he pleaded for the speech to end i wish you good fortune in your war for the regaining of your homeland long live free palestine long live the soviet union long live our friendship of i r o n the final words were drowned by the starting of the engines a ripple of applause from the two ranks of instructors behind the colonel commandant was lost in the aircrafts engine roar the colonel commandant and the commander exchanged salutes shook hands without warmth the palestinians gathered their luggage and then scrambled to get aboard the commander came last gesturing that abu hamid should be ahead of him they threaded their way around the wooden crates that filled the centre of the hold and looked for the canvas seats their backs to the fuselage the light from the doorway was blotted out a member of the aircrew turned the locking handle a terrible tension in the commander as the antonov inched forward and started to swivel he seemed to hear in his mind the ring of a telephone in the colonel commandants office and the squawk of a radio in the control tower his stomach was knotted they could still be brought back the member of aircrew was yelling at him above the drive of the engines for his belt to be fastened four hours and three minutes after an incident in yalta the antonov transporter lifted off the long simferopol runway it took a course as it climbed to the south west and crossed the shore line of the crimea close to the old battlefields of sevastopol and balaklava then swung south over the darkening black sea the aircraft had prior permission to overfly turkish airspace a standard arrangement ahead of it was a flight of two hours and minutes cruising speed miles an hour altitude feet within minutes the four giant kuznetsov nkmv turboprop engines had carried the antonov beyond soviet jurisdiction the captain made the announcement the excited yelling rang inside the aircraft the commander sat slumped drained of the energy to celebrate beside him he saw that abu hamid sat back in his seat swaying with the motion of the aircraft the commander thought the killer was at peace and marvelled moving down the aisle towards them steadying himself against the lasheddown crates came major said hazan the question was in the smooth childs stomach skin around the majors eyes it was successful the commander said the target was destroyed abu hamid saw that the major wore smart syrian air force uniform but his face was hidden by a wrapped wool scarf and his head was hidden by his wide peaked cap only the eyes were for him to see abu hamid leaned forward there was pride in his voice there was a girl with the ambassador she too died major said hazan ducked his head in acknowledgement clasped the shoulders of the two men each in turn with a leathergloved hand he made his way back to the cockpit the landfall would be high over the turkish town of samsun the flight path would be above the central anatolian mountains the syrian frontier would be overflown east of aleppo and then the long descent to damascus the words as taught him in the camps of damascus before the journey to simferopol were soundness in the throat of abu hamid the thoughts echoed in his mind the thoughts were of the old man of the mountains who had built his fortress a thousand years ago in the valley of alamut and gathered his followers who were the assassins enclosed in the valley that was paradise were palaces and pavilions channels flowing with wine and honey and young girls who danced and sang every pleasure was found here for the assassins until the old man of the mountains called one forward go from here and kill the man whose name i give you when you return you will enter again into paradise should you not return then my angels will seek you out and carry you back to our paradise a thousand years ago word of the skill and dedication of the assassins of syria travelling from the valley of alamut had spread across the known world brilliant in disguise unrivalled in their dedication and fanaticism ruthless in murder the assassins were feared by kings and princes and military commanders and civil governors and the priests of sunni islam abu hamid saw himself as the descendant of the old assassins of ten centuries before the words soundless in the throat of abu hamid were those of the old man of the mountains handed down over a millennium to kill these people is more lawful than rainwater there was no advance warning the car drove unannounced into the forecourt of the embassy three men in the car all pressed into service and summoned from their weekend break a first deputy foreign minister a protocol official a full colonel of the second directorate they were shown into an ante room on the ground floor where they were watched by a security man the duty officer for that weekend was a second secretary trade he was still buttoning his collar when he came into the room grim faces staring back at him all three men standing they introduced themselves even the one from state security not the moment to offer them tea nor the moment to ask them to sit their seniority meant urgent business to be conducted without delay i am the duty officer he said he produced a pencil and notepad and waited on them the first deputy foreign minister seemed for a moment to examine the close patternwork of the carpet from bokhara then he straightened it is with the utmost regret that as the representative of my government i have the sad duty to inform you that his excellency sir sylvester armitage and miss jane canning were today the victims of a cruel and cowardly attack in the city of yalta as a result of this attack his excellency and miss canning have died the third member of the delegation mr holt is unhurt i am instructed to inform you that the soviet government has made available a military aircraft to take to yalta any members of your staff who would wish to go the aircraft is ready to leave at your convenience i am able to tell you that a comprehensive criminal investigation has been launched in yalta and it is our earnest hope that the investigation will bear fruit soon the duty officer was scribbling his note in longhand incredulity on his face lips moving but they could not formulate the barrage of questions the deaths were caused by shooting his excellency and miss canning were hit many times as they were leaving the hotel for lunch with the city authorities they were dead on arrival at hospital the initial indication is that the culprit was involved in an attempt to enter the hotel for the purpose of robbing the cash desk but panicked as he was confronted by the british delegation leaving wheres holt the first stuttered question he is in the hotel he is quite safe but this happened you say before lunch why hasnt he telephoned mr holt is in shock the mind of the duty officer was racing incoherent didnt they have any protection later there will be an opportunity for such detail the kgb colonel added there was a representative of state security at the hotel he performed his duties with great bravery but sadly was not able to prevent the attack god almighty the first deputy foreign minister said we shall be at the foreign ministry we are at the disposal of the british people in this moment of anguish it wasnt terrorism it was the act of a common criminal in pursuance of theft the kgb colonel said decisively in darkness and amongst a sea of pimple landing navigation lights the antonov put down at el masr military airbase they were checked with military thoroughness for contraband goods they were home in that home for these refugee strays of the middle east was to be found in the syrian arab republic they had been together six months now they were to disperse minibuses each for the struggle command and for saiiqa and for the popular front and for the democratic front and for the general command and for the liberation front the culprit from saiiqa had lost his handcuffs five minutes after take off the victim from struggle command embraced his attacker when they parted the commander reflected that the russians could never understand his children all went their separate ways except that abu hamid with his commander travelled from the base in the mercedes car that had been sent to collect major said hazan abu hamid unshaven and with the sweat smell on his body from his sprint away from the oreanda hotel rode out of the base cushioned in the back seat between the officer of syrian air force intelligence and the officer of the popular front for the liberation of palestine when the car had gathered speed along the wide highway from the airport the commander said softly to major said hazan it was magnificent said it was just as you had said it would be the voice was muffled through the scarf you played your part friend two quiet men talking casually across abu hamid as if he were not there but you took a great risk risk nothing and it is not possible to achieve victory when will the claim be made claim what has happened has been a triumph for the popular front the popular front should be must be credited there will be no claim there will only be silence abu hamid heard the ice chill in the voice he felt the major shift his body further into his seat he was in the darkness on the bed when he heard the light knock on his door he thought he might have been to sleep he felt the wet of his tears on his face when he rubbed his eyes he heard his name called he slid off the bed opened the door let in the flood of light the security officer said thank god weve reached you young man holt blinked at him turned away from the door they gave us an executive j e t bloody decent of them i came down with the counsellor hes at the hospital ive been at militia hq super first class its all right holt youve had a bloody rough time eh holt gazed into the security officers face rubbish its not bloody rough when youre watching a shooti n g easy young man holt flared easy its to be easy is it we come down here low bloody risk bloody posting were set up for a shooting gallery were chopped down like boxing day pheasants i understand you were not exactly cooperative would you have been what do they want cooperation for theyve just wiped out my boss and my girl and they want me to help their bloody inquiry put a gloss on their bloody lies course i didnt bloody cooperate a sharpness in the security officers voice i have to tell you that the soviet authorities could not have been more sympathetic and eager to help me i have been given a very full briefing on their investigation and its conclusion so they soaped you up a full briefing on their investigation and its conclusion holts voice dropped what conclusion they have told me that they identified an army deserter as the criminal responsible it was his intention to rob the hotel at gun point he panicked as the ambassador and miss canning and yourself were coming out of the hotel and opened fire they had good eyewitness descriptions of him and this evening a vehicle in which he was travelling was waved down on the outskirts of the city in attempting to evade arrest he was shot dead what else did they tell you about this deserter that he was a yearold byelorussian thats minsk hed be a european did you see him holt did you get a look at him at feet i saw his face the security officer lit a cigarette the smoke spiralled in the quiet dark room the man you saw holt could he have been from byelorussia they soaped and flannelled you give it to me straight eh if hes from minsk theyd had to have had a heatwave there through this winter soaped and flannelled as you say im very sorry very sorry about your girl holt went to the window showed his back to the security officer on sunday morning a royal air force vc was diverted from its cyprus to brize norton flight run to drop down at simferopol the coffins containing the bodies of sir sylvester armitage and jane canning were carried to the cargo doors by a bearer party of soviet marines the coffins were taken past an honour guard of officer cadets from the military academy who stood sternly to attention heads down and rifles in reverse the sight of the coffins and the presence among them of young holt and the counsellor and the security officer was sufficient to subdue a company of paratroopers returning to the united kingdom from a months exercises it was good of you to come we appreciate it she was a small woman brightly dressed and with heavy makeup that he presumed was to hide the ravage of her bereavement she stood in the front doorway and the rain lashed down onto the head and shoulders of young holt strange really that in all the time he had known jane he had never been asked to her parents home in south london he saw the water dribbling down from the black mocktudor beams and down the whitewashed stucco he hadnt a hat and so his head was soaked gently he said do you think i could come in mrs canning her hand jerked to her mouth and she was all movement embarrassment whateverll you be thinking of me of course come in father its mr holt here janes father took his coat off to the kitchen and janes mother led him into the front room a friendly room full of the furniture that dated back to the beginning of a marriage worn armrests on the sofa and the chairs a burn mark in the carpet by the fire plants that needed cutting back on the mantelpiece was a photograph of his girl a posed portrait that was all shoulder and profile he stood with his back to the fire with his back to the photograph of jane and his damp trouser legs steamed he wondered what it was like for them to meet the man who loved their daughter and who had slept with their daughter around the room he counted four more photographs of her of his girl janes mother had sat down in her chair the most used chair and she had her knitting bag on her lap and was routing for needles and wool she could see each one of the five photographs from her chair she asked him to sit and he said that he had been in the train a long time and that he preferred to stand he reckoned that her clothes were a brave gesture a postofficered skirt and a white blouse and a vivid scarf knotted at her throat he admired a woman who would dress like that for her daughters funeral janes father came into the room wiping the raincoats damp off his hands onto a handkerchief he wore his best suit and a starched white shirt and a tie that was either dark navy or black janes father seemed exhausted as if the strain of the past ten days had sapped him nice of you to come young man she never told us your proper name you were always just called holt by her janes father said thats what i am really what everyone calls me please just call me that it means a lot to me that i can be with you today he meant it sincerely he had been two days in london telling his story he had spent a long weekend at his parents home walking alone on the soaked wilderness of exmoor he wanted to be with janes mother and father on the day of the funeral janes father asked him if he would like coffee and he said no he was fine and he asked him if he wanted to sit and again he declined and mrs canning knitted and mr canning searched for flaws on his finger nails i wanted to be with you today because quite soon i think jane and i would have told you that we were going to become engaged to be married she didnt look up her husband still explored the tips of his fingers i loved her and i like to think that she loved me youve got to put it all behind you janes mother said when i arrived in moscow and found her waiting for me at the airport i dont think that ive ever felt such happiness janes gone mr holt and youre a young man and youve a life ahead of you right now i dont see it that way you will and the sooner the better lifes for living holt saw her bite at her lower lip janes fathers head rose his mouth was moving as if he were rehearsing a question unsure of the form of words the question when it came was little more than a whisper was she hurt eight high velocity shots fired at a range of less than ten paces thats what the post mortem had said he could feel the lifeless hand he could see the tabletennisballsized exit wounds she wasnt hurt there was no pain what did they tell you foreign and commonwealth just that it was a grubby little business this man was a heroin addict and an army deserter they told us what was in the newspapers that he had gone to the hotel to rob it they said it was just a one in a million chance that he should have chosen that particular moment for his robbery when our jane and the ambassador and yourself were coming out of the hotel they said the soviet authorities were very sympathetic they told us that the man was shot dead while trying to escape he saw the sallow face of the man with the windcheater and the rifle and the crows foot scar on his cheek holt said theres probably not much more that anyone can tell you janes mother stared at her knitting her face puckered in concentration we were so proud both of us when jane joined the service began to work for her country it isnt easy for a girl to get a good position in it and i think they thought she was outstanding im not saying she told us much about it a very discreet little soul but we knew she was working in intelligence she probably told you more he remembered the photography over charkov he remembered his remark about the camera he remembered the last words he had heard her speakdont be childish holt she was very much admired by all her colleagues janes father pushed himself up from the chair like mother said youve your life ahead of you it was good of you to come today but we shant expect to see you again holt saw the black car outside he saw janes mother putting her knitting and her needles back into the embroidered bag he saw janes father straighten his tie i loved her mr canning we were going to be married he saw the trace of impatience get on with your career get on with the living of your life pity its raining mother holt followed janes mother fast down the short path and through the front gate to the car janes father carefully locked the door behind him he sat with them in the back as they were driven to the crematorium that was away to the west close to the river they didnt talk on the journey and holt wondered whether they held their peace because of him or because of the driver as soon as they had arrived at the crematorium holt removed himself from their side there were cameras there television and press photographers and he felt that by hanging back he drew away from them the attention of lenses and the clicking shutters holt was good raw meat for the cameras it had been leaked that they were close that he had seen the killings he tried to keep his head up his chin jutting he walked past the sprays of flowers and the wreaths he saw the signature of the foreign secretary and of the head of the soviet desk at fco and there were four bundles of flowers which were simply signed with christian names inside the porch of the chapel holt saw a tall austere man shaking the hands of janes mother and father there had been fco people outside but holt understood the director general of the secret intelligence service could not stand in front of the cameramen nor could his people sign their names on the wreaths he wondered what had become of janes camera what had happened to her photographs from the plane he felt a surge of anger as if these nameless men and the director general of the service were responsible for her death it was a short service he sat alone behind her parents he couldnt find his voice when they sang the rd psalm he watched the coffin roll away from him he watched the curtains close he was crying in his heart he remembered her voice her grey eyes her soft hair and her lifeless hand he remembered the man with the rifle he saw her parents walk back up the chapel aisle and they didnt turn to him he sat in his seat and stared at the closed curtain youre young holt yes he turned the chapel had emptied fast the man was thickset with a fine head of grey hair and the brush of a military moustache was squashed between nose and mouth i am we have to be moving theyll be queuing up outside for the next one damn conveyorbelt operation do you have wheels he had steeled himself to spend the day with janes mother and father he had made no arrangements to get himself away and now it had been made plain to him that he was not expected back to the semidetached home in motspur park i dont have you the afternoon to spare his studio flat in london was rented out the tenant had signed for a year ahead of him was only a train journey back to devon plenty of trains they ran all afternoon and evening his father would come down to exeter to collect him an usher appeared beside the man trying to hurry them for what my names martins percy martins im from the service your initial debrief by the fco people landed on my desk he looked up at percy martins he saw clear pale blue eyes that never wavered from his glance what is there to talk about what you saw what happened holt felt the control going voice rising i thought everyone knew what bloody happened i thought they all swallowed the soviet crap not swallowed by everyone come on holt followed obediently he noticed that martins walked out of the chapel well ahead of him so that he would not be included when holt was again the cameramens target holt reached a small estate car martins was already behind the wheel engine started pushing the door open for holt my son is at university in york hes playing a match in london today thats where were going my wifell kill me if i get home tonight and havent seen him we can talk when were there he drove fast and in total silence occasionally peering down at the dashboard clock on the m nothing passed them holt thought it must be a hell of an important game a league decider or a cup final he felt no urge to speak was relieved to be left to his own company he had had enough talking two whole days in london going through the programme that he had confirmed for the ambassador and working over and over his description of the shooting and each time he had questioned what appeared to be the general acceptance of the soviet version of the killings he had just been shushed and assured that all was being put into place they came to the playing fields during the drive it had stopped raining but now it had started again percy martins flung himself out of the car and scampered round to the boot to fetch a pair of wellingtons holt saw that the back of the car was filled with fishing gear an outsize rod bag a cavernous landing net a solid tackle box he had to run to catch the man it was the farthest soccer pitch whos playing holt said when they reached the muddied touchline york chemists against a gang of lawyers from university college london is your boy good bloody awful which one is he the one who cant kick with his left foot and hardly with his right so what the hell are we doing here they were the only spectators there was no protection from the weather holt thought it was the worst game of football he had ever watched as i told you the report on your debrief landed on my desk holt turned into the rain he had to shout over the wind why are you buying all this bullshit about a criminal robbery it suits us who can it suit everybody nearly everybody anyway who is everybody good question look at it young holt there is a shooting in the soviet union a highly embarrassing shooting and they havent a clue who is responsible best way to calm the matter down is to come up with a plausible story that cannot be disproved that has the culprit removed and that does not show the ivans in a particularly poor light just a bit of bad luck wasnt it wrong place at the wrong time they might just as easily have been walking along the pavement and a car had blown a tyre and swerved into them professionally speaking one has to see it as a successful exercise in damage limitation and everyones so supine that they accept this convenient lie im not everybody why arent we saying out loud that this killing was the work of an arab that our ambassador and miss canning were set up by the soviets to be murdered i think youve jumped too far i believe you are right in thinking the killer was arab but not that the soviets set it up highly embarrassing as i said in my opinion this was an act of terrorism in soviet territory they cant admit that can they oh christ almighty one of the players had tried to kick the ball that wallowed in ankle deep mud missed and fell on his back and left the ball to be slotted into the net thats my son and heir god hes pathetic his mothers boy fco wouldnt see theyve much choice but to go along with ivans version so ive been brought to this absurd game to be given a lecture in anglosoviet relations youre being asked to help jane canning was a member of the service and we will not take her death lying down holt saw that the player who had given away the goal had been dismissed to the wing the young man was pencil thin and pale he was beginning to feel sympathy for the kid particularly if his father was a pompous ass called percy martins what does that mean in practice not taking it lying down what it says holt you were in the crimea in the centre of the crimea is simferopol in simferopol is a military academy which takes groups of foreign cadets for periods of up to where is this getting us listen will you among the foreign cadets are always syriansponsored palestinians the shooting was at lunch time that same saturday evening a syrian air force transporter put down at simferopol and then flew on to damascus how do you know that listen and thats none of your business it is quite credible that a palestinian at least an arab shot the ambassador and miss canning and was flown back to the middle east the same evening it is even credible that the soviets knew nothing of the plan why are you telling me this we need your help in identifying the man who killed armitage and a member of our service your girl and then thats none of your business either id want him killed so tell me what he looked like everything desultory cheers hray hray hray the game was finished martinss son tramped off the field he didnt so much as look at his father martins made an attempt to greet him but the young man kept walking holt thought martins too proud to chase after him and then it was too late the two teams disappeared into the pavilion martins and young holt paced the touchline they were still there after the groundsman had come out to unhook the goal netting and to gather up the flag posts they were still there when the two buses with the chemists from york and the lawyers from london drove away from the pavilion holt poured out every detail from his memory on the man who had held the kalashnikov assault rifle the way he moved height weight age the clothes the wig the shape of the eyes movement features again and again the crows foot scar still talking when it was too dark for holt to see martinss face beside him finally they walked back to the car you never even spoke to your son watched him play didnt i thats what i promised his mother how close would you have to be to him to see the scar well i was ten paces and could see it as clearly as i described it to you i mean you wouldnt miss it if you met him youll go after him she was one of ours martins dropped holt off at paddington station thanked him again and said hed be in touch in a day or so then he crossed london and the thames and parked his car in the basement at century house it was not unusual for him to be returning to his office as the commuters were heading for home martins lived in a torpid culdesac in putney but his home was the seventh floor of century no need for him to ring his wife and tell her that he would be back late she took it for granted that he would work eleven or twelve hours six days a week and that he would fish on the seventh he had been years in the service he had served in amman and cyprus and tel aviv he was a graduate years before the fighting ripped the city apart of the american university of beirut the debrief had taken days to reach him it bore a string of fco staffs initials and in century it had come by way of the soviet desk the seventh floor was middle east martins was the middle east desks third in the chain the head of the desk was twelve years his junior his immediate superior was years younger martins would climb no higher sometimes it rankled most times in fact his solace was his work on his desk was the debrief and transcripts of messages sent from an antonov en route to damascus these had been intercepted by the dhekelia listening post in cyprus and deciphered at the government communications hq in cheltenham it was indeed none of young holts business that the messages sent from the antonov within minutes of its leaving soviet airspace were in the code systems of syrian air force intelligence and not those of the regular air force for the next two hours he wrote down in neat longhand everything that holt had told him by the time he had completed seven foolscap sheets he believed he could build a picture of a face a working likeness of a man he was satisfied that he knew exactly where the crows foot scar should be placed later at a time when the train carrying holt was west of taunton inter city and hammering percy martins took the lift two floors up the storey building to a small cubbyhole of a room where a technician had been whiling away the hours making a balsa wood scale replica of a vintage churchill tank it would be a late night the technician would work with martins to make a likeness of the face of an assassin the following evening the actual size portrait and the four typed sheets of briefing were carried in a large buff envelope in the nearly empty briefcase of a government messenger en route to tel aviv for the duration of the flight a little over four hours the briefcase was attached to the wrist of the messenger by a length of fine steel chain it would have been impossible for the messenger to eat the airline meal without his chain being noticed so he went without food at tel aviv the messenger was met by the services station officer a docket was signed the papers were exchanged the messenger flew back on the return flight after killing four hours in the transit lounge and twenty minutes in the restaurant before dawn a light burned in the upper room at the rear of the british embassy on hayarkon this upper room had no view of the stretching mediterranean sea the walls of the room were of reinforced concrete the windows were of strengthened glass the room was reached by an outer corridor in which had been placed a gate of heavy steel vertical bars behind the locked door of the room the station officer examined the face that had been built for him and read martinss brief the killer of sir sylvester armitage and of jane canning was believed to be arab most probably palestinian the distinguishing feature of the arab was a crows foot scar of approximately one inch in diameter on the upper left cheek the station officer smiled at what he called martinss fingerprints all over the brief his unlovely grammar but the substance of it was good near the bottom of the third page was the text of the message underlined in red typical martins touch from the antonov transporter after it had entered turkish airspace the target is taken it was left to the discretion of the station officer as to whether he went for help to the mossad israels external intelligence gathering organisation or the shin bet the states internal counter subversion and counter terrorism apparatus or to military intelligence since the trial of nezar hindawi and the severing by britain of diplomatic relations with syria cooperation between london and tel aviv was unprecedentedly close he had no doubt that he would get the help martins requested as the lowlevel sunbeams rose above the squat duncoloured apartment blocks of tel aviv the station officer dialled the private telephone line of the man whose friendship he valued most in military intelligence he liked the hours they worked he locked his room behind him and with the photofit in his bag he drove to the ministry of defence on kaplan as the crow flies and nothing larger than a crow can make the flight without plucking up a barrage of groundtoair missiles it is miles from tel aviv to damascus the principal cities of the old enemies are adjacent in the currency of modern warfare behind the frontier that divides them syria and israel have massed divisions of armour and mechanised infantry regiments of artillery squadrons of interceptor aircraft the two client states scowl at each other from the cover of curtains of stateoftheart united states and soviet equipment two great coiled armies awaiting the order to commence the bloodletting poised to exploit the moment of maximum advantage in the waiting time as the troops idle away the hours in their fox holes and base camps the tanks are kept armed and fuelled stacks of ammunition lie beside the heavy howitzers the aircraft are loaded with their missiles and cannon shells and cluster bombs they wait two nations obsessed with the need for one gigantic heave to ultimate victory for the israelis the waiting is harder they are the smaller nation and they are crippled by the cost of the feud for the syrians the waiting is easier they have a surrogate force obedient to their discipline they have the palestinians of the salvation front the palestinians from their bases in lebanon or from the camps around damascus can be organised to strike at israel to harass israel to wound israel and the palestinians are expendable it was a dry dustladen morning it was a morning when the flies with persistence crawled at the eyes and into the nostrils of the men who paraded in the dirt yard of the yarmouq camp the sun climbed and shortened the shadows and the stink of the shallow latrine pits lay across the camp the recruits had been standing on parade in the growing heat for a little more than an hour because the guests from damascus were late and there was no explanation for the delay and no one dared to stand the men down they had come from the refugee centres in west beirut from sidon and tyre and from camps in jordan and south yemen they were aged between and they had joined the popular front for the liberation of palestine because they believed that that organisation would give them the greatest chance to hurt the zionist state some wore uniforms and boots that were syrian army surplus some wore jeans and tshirts and pullovers some had already shaved their heads some wore their hair to their shoulders all held their unloaded rifles as if it were second nature to them they were children suckled on conflict the commander was at the gate fretting with his watch abu hamid stood in front of the squad of eighty recruits his uniform fitted him well he wore the tunic and top camouflaged in pink and green and yellow of a syrian commando he carried loosely over the crook of his arm a kalashnikov assault rifle occasionally he barked an order at the recruits ordered them to straighten up he felt a new degree of authority no one at the camp other than the commander knew his part in what had happened in yalta but there were other signs of the favour that had fallen into the path of abu hamid two days later than the others who had flown back from the soviet union abu hamid had reached yarmouq and when he had rejoined his colleagues he had been driven to the camp in a mercedes benz car by a chauffeur who wore air force uniform three times since then he had been off camp and back late in the evening with the smell of imported whisky on his breath and his girl had been allowed to the camp and he had been promoted which was why he now stood in front of the recruits the cars when they arrived billowed a dust storm abu hamid yelled for his men to stand still he aped the instructors at simferopol he saw the commander fawning a greeting to an officer who wore the insignia of a brigadier general the breath came in a sharp gasp from abu hamids throat he thought that every recruit behind him gawped at the officer who now climbed from the official car that had followed that of the brigadier general into the camp the officer strode forward he carried his cap in his left hand the officers walk was normal his torso was ordinary he had no fingers on his right hand a stump at the knuckle it was his head that captured attention there was nothing sharp in the definition of his features the skin across his cheeks and his nose and his upper lip and his chin seemed fragile and tightly drawn the opaque skin of a butterflys or a moths wings the skin had a lifeless quality dead skin that had somehow been reprocessed for further use and stretched over the bones of the face and the muscles by a human hand and not by nature the nose of the officer seemed a squashed bauble and his mouth was a parched slit the earlobes were gone the eyebrows were gone what hair there was seemed to have been planted behind a line drawn vertically down from the scalps crown to the deformed ears the hair was bleached pale a soft small voice a voice that he recognised a voice with the lilt of a persuasive song good morning to you hamid he swallowed hard good morning major said hazan he stared blatantly into the broken face he saw the cracked amused smile that rose in the expanse of skin he saw the medal ribbons on the chest of the uniform tunic major said hazan waved abu hamid forward the commander was ignored as the major introduced abu hamid to the brigadier general the ranking officer knew what abu hamid had achieved it was there in his eyes for abu hamid to see a shared secret abu hamid escorted the brigadier general and major said hazan along the four rows of recruits only one cloud in abu hamids mind that morning of course he had expected that military security would check all the weapons issued to the recruits to ascertain that no live rounds would be carried on parade he had not expected that his own ak would be scrutinised that he would have to clear the breach and show that his magazine was empty one small cloud after the inspection the brigadier general called for the recruits to come close to him in todays world no man can be neutral a man is either with the oppressed or he is with the oppressors we have to fight to our last breath it is better to die with honour than to live with humiliation when he was cheered when the fists of the recruits were aloft the brigadier general smiled his satisfaction abu hamid clapped his hands waved three of the recruits towards the administration building his remaining recruits formed a circle facing inwards a photographer edged forward stretching on tiptoe to see into the circle a european photographer abu hamid saw the brigadier general gesture to the photographer to push harder a dozen live chickens were brought to the circle thrust into the ring abu hamid shouted death to all enemies of the palestinian revolution the circle closed the chickens were caught torn apart wing from breast leg from body head from neck hands groping into a bedlam of movement the raw meat of the chickens the warm flesh of the chickens was eaten the blood drunk young faces frothing pink meat spewing red blood it was a tradition of the popular front designed as the first measure in the breaking down of the human inhibition against killing for the first ritual a live chicken sufficed to play the part of an enemy of the revolution the photographer was on assignment from a news magazine in the german democratic republic he took a roll of film on each of two cameras among his images was the man who wore a khaffiyeh headdress across his face and who chewed at a chicken wing the brigadier general congratulated abu hamid on the dedication of his recruits and major said hazan clasped his shoulder in farewell abu hamid was bathed in pleasure the prime ministers cars swept into downing street there were a few older men and women on the head of governments staff who could remember when a prime minister travelled with only a single detective and the chauffeur for company but over the wreckage of a seaside hotel from which a cabinet had been pulled by firemen or dragged by police minders a spokesman of irish liberation had declaimed you have to be lucky every time we have to be lucky once the prime minister detested the paraphernalia of the bodyguards and the closed circuit cameras and the alarm systems in downing street the director general who waited in the outer office knew well the prime ministers impatience with security he saw the prime minister hemmed in by branch men in the brief moment between the car and the doorway as he gazed down from the window above the street the flash of the face that was reddened from the sunshine of the asian tour and the jetlag the director general had the automatic right of access he reported directly to the prime minister it was a pretty dreadful funeral the prime minister said and shrugged off an overcoat lady armitage was first class could have been welcoming us to a cocktail party but there was a granddaughter there who cried her eyes out noisily rather spoiled things what a thing to get back to fourteen hours in the air and straight to church the director general knew the form he allowed the talking to go on neither of the previous prime ministers he had served had exactly rushed to allow him to throw into the fray whatever hand grenade he was waiting to communicate do you know the soviet ambassador read the second lesson and read it pretty well i thought that was a very spirited gesture he was badly overdue a spirited gesture prime minister the director general murmured i dont follow you the deaths of sylvester armitage and miss canning are a considerable embarrassment to the soviets the killings were an act of political terrorism the director general said flatly my brief from fco said quite clearly that our diplomats were shot down by a common criminal which is regrettably untrue meaning what meaning that the soviet union lied prime minister we are still looking for the last piece of evidence but our belief is that the assassinations were the work of a palestinian terrorist who was on a course in a military academy in the crimea we believe he flew out of the soviet union on the same day as the killings where does he lead us the director general said heavily the road goes directly to damascus where he is beyond our reach the director general produced a small leather notebook from his inside pocket they must never be beyond our reach prime minister may i quote you your words i keep this with me always you said two years ago when speaking of the threat of terrorism we need action so that the terrorist knows he has no safe haven no escape your very words prime minister as i remember you were heavily applauded what do you have a face we hope soon to have a name the prime ministers head was shaking the eyes ranged anywhere in the room but back to the director generals face we cannot just storm into damascus of all places miss canning was a member of my team i have never taken anything you have said prime minister to be empty rhetoric hell be beyond reach the prime minister said hell have to hide well there is something i have to know yes prime minister were the deaths of the ambassador and your miss canning condoned by the government of the soviet union we think that they knew nothing of it may not know it now hence the embarrassment hence the deception i find it beyond belief that syria a client state for gods sake would instigate a terrorist outrage inside the soviet union they may be a client state prime minister but not subservient their missile systems for instance wont allow soviet personnel near soviet hardware most certainly they do not take orders they had a target a motive too if you accept their twisted logic and they would have believed with some justification that they could get away with it i repeat myself we cannot just storm into damascus and i repeat myself we need action so that the terrorist knows he has no safe haven i will keep you fully informed the flies surged in the room careless of the swatting irritation of the commander he gestured that abu hamid should sit he brought him a can of pepsi from the fridge the sounds of the camp drifted through the windows what do you want of me major said hazan abu hamid said you have pleased him his face what of his face what happened to his face his hands you are not a child to be frightened hamid you are a fighter tell me what happened he was a pilot mig in combat over the golan heights in he was shot down hit by a sidewinder airtoair missile fired from a f phantom there was fire in the cockpit he had to level out before he could eject he is not a man to panic he waited he would not know the meaning of panic when it was safe to eject then he did so his parachute brought him down behind his own lines his face was rebuilt in leningrad perhaps in the hospitals there they are not experienced in such injuries abu hamid drained the pepsi i just wanted to know the commander leaned forward his face close to abu hamids you should understand hamid that a man with his face and his hands on fire who does not panic does not eject until the right time that man is to be treated with caution what are you telling me abu hamids finger flicked at the scar hole on his cheek that major said hazan works now for air force intelligence that he has great influence i have performed a service for him i am his friend be careful hamid he told me today that i would be rewarded for what i did he himself signed the chit for my girl to come to the camp on his orders cars have been sent for me bills have been paid then you are indeed his friend the commander said softly he was a clever young man with a bachelors degree in physics from the hebrew university of jerusalem in the reserve of the israeli defence forces he held the rank of sergeant in civilian life he was a research scientist for a company specialising in the manufacture of military electrooptics he was said to have the most complete knowledge among all the reservists of the labyrinthine computer files held by military intelligence on palestinian personnel the computer failed to throw up any reference to the crows foot scar the failure told the sergeant that the man of the photokit likeness had not been in idf custody since the scar was acquired a disappointing start he was left with the computer and with thousands of idf and mil int photographs there were few concrete items in the information he had that would help him to reject material unlooked at a flight to syria told him that his subject would not be a member of the palestine liberation organisations force a man of force would never fly via damascus but the men had flaking allegiance a fighter who was now in the popular front or the domestic front or the struggle front could have been in force a few years before it would be a long slog with the green screen and the photograph bank the sergeant reckoned from the age of the subject and from the fact that he had been taken to simferopol for a platoon leaders course that it was possible he had been in beirut when the palestinians evacuated in the summer of there were photographs available from the days when the palestinians had trooped down to the docks and boarded the boats that would sail them to exile the photos were blown up from american newsreel coverage that had been purchased unedited by the israeli broadcasting corporation the sergeant put up every print onto a screen for magnification each photograph was studied meticulously for five days the photographs flashed in front of him in his room the blinds drawn over the windows a cone of light from the projector to the screen he had a dogged persistence after failures his squeal of triumph was heard in the adjacent rooms and corridors he had found a thin young man riding on the top of the cab of an open lorry a shorthaired young man with a thinly grown moustache a young man who had a rifle aloft in one hand and whose second hand was raised in the vvictory salute he saw the wound on the upper left cheek standing close to the screen a magnifying glass in his hand he found the lines of what the report called the crows foot back to the computer the number of the photograph fed in the search for cross reference information long moments of stillness and then the rush began popular front for the liberation of palestine of the six men shown in the photograph two had subsequently been identified one man in the photograph named after his capture in the security zone but later released when palestinians and lebanese shias were freed in exchange for three idf soldiers the sergeant cursed the second man who had subsequently been named captured a dinghy chased to the shore by a patrol boat a night gun battle on the beach close to nahariya lit by helicopter flares four infiltrators dead one captured link with popular front late in the night while the prison slept two army interrogators drove into the floodlit courtyard of the ramla gaol a convicted prisoner was roused from his cot taken to a room where no prison warder was permitted to be present the prisoner was shown the photograph he knew the man he remembered his name four days later an east german news magazine appeared the eighteenth page of the magazine showed a scrum of palestinian recruits struggling for the privilege of ripping a chicken to pieces one man in the photograph wore a khaffiyeh scarf around his throat where it had slipped when he bit into the feathered wing of the chicken the face was in tight focus while his friend poured the coffee the station officer peered down at the photograph his friend was zvi dan the photograph from the magazine page had been enlarged and the scar was clear to the naked eye youve done me damn well a name for chummy and a date and a place but we have nothing much else with which to link him apart from the beirut picture anything further can only be supposition zvi dans career as an infantry officer had been cut short years before when an exploding artillery shell on the golan heights had neatly severed his left leg immediately below the knee and only two days before the ceasefire had wound up the battles of yom kippur he had faced the prospect of civilian life or of finding military work that could be conducted away from the operational area he had made major military intelligence he specialised in the study of palestinian groups who were known to have firm links abroad and whose operations against israel were often far from his countrys frontiers i think that in london they are pretty concerned with this one i think theyll take all the supposition they can get then we should begin to play the jigsaw zvi dan worked from an office in the ministry of defence his quarters were apart from the main complex of buildings that stretched the length of kaplan his base was surrounded by a coiled fence of barbed wire and with additional armed guards on the gate he had access to mossad files and to shin bet interrogations of captured palestinians he read voraciously in the small circle where his name was known he was credited with supplying the information that had led to the arrest of a jordanian who intended to carry on board a swiss airliner two hand grenades for a hijacking attempt on the cyprusjordan leg of the flight he had supplied the lead that enabled the belgian police to raid a video arcade in a small town in the north of the country and arrest two palestinians and a belgian couple and uncover lbs of plastic explosive his warnings had led to the interception at sea of two yachts being used by palestinian infiltrators the casselardit and the ganda if he regarded these as little victories major zvi dan could and did count as catastrophic defeats the assault on the synagogue in istanbul turkish jews killed the slaughter at romes fiumicino airport killed and wounded the massacre at viennas schwechtat airport killed and wounded the station officer said ill put my pieces on the board the british ambassador in moscow insults a syrian diplomat practically with a loud hailer the entire diplomatic community looking on right in the syrians masters sitting room claims of syrian innocence in the el al bomb laughed to scorn in public total humiliation of syrians two our man in moscow is assassinated oblique stroke mugged in the crimea close to a military school where palestinians are trained three same evening a syrian air force plane lands at the airport next door to the school and flies on to damascus en route sending a message saying in effect mission achieved four our eyewitness at the shooting gets a clear view of chummy and from that we follow through to the evacuation from beirut in and a member of the pflp contingent the last piece i can put on the board is what ill call the dresden photograph that puts chummy at a camp outside damascus possibly seven eight days ago those are my pieces you want this abu hamid we want him even if we have to go to damascus to get him zvi dan laughed a quiet croak in his throat and the laugh brought on the hacking cough of the persistent smoker damascus would be easy damascus pretends it is an international city there are businessmen travelling to damascus and there are academics and there are archaeologists it is a city of millions of people in a city you can come shoulder to shoulder with a man you can use the knife or the silenced pistol or the explosive under the car he drives if it were damascus then i would already offer you my felicitations even my congratulations the scar is only an inch across so you have to be close to identify the man you want the girl who was killed she was one of ours the station officer said quietly dont worry about getting close well walk onto the bridge of his nose if we have to thats the sense of the messages i am being sent from london the coughing was stifled zvi dan beat his own chest there was the rustle of the packet the flash of the lighter the curl of the smoke the end of the nicotined finger stubbed at the dresden photograph look at them other than the man you want they are all raw recruits they are children who have joined the popular front and here they are participating in the first ceremony of induction there will have been a parade and there will have been a speech by a big man from the government it is what always happens they will have been in damascus for a few days only they will be moved on they will go to a field training camp where they will be taught not well the art of smallunit operations your man the man you want the older man amongst them he will travel with the children as their instructor possibly it is a reward for what he achieved in yalta they will go to a training camp with their instructor for perhaps half a year where would the camp be where it is impossible for you to be close shoulder to shoulder for a moment the face of zvi dan was lost in a haze of smoke in the beqaa valley oh thats grand said the station officer the bus goes right through the beqaa valley the valley is a fault it is a legacy of rock strata turbulence of many millennia ago the valley floor is some miles in length and never more than ten miles in width it is a slash between the mountains that dominate the mediterranean city of beirut and the mountains that overlook the hinterland city of damascus it is bordered in the north by the ancient roman and phoenician city of baalbeck and in the south by the dammed lake quaroon the sides of the valley deep cut with winter water gullies are bare and rock strewn good only for goats and hardy sheep the sides cannot be cultivated but the valley floor has the richest cropgrowing fields in all lebanon the litani river rising close to baalbeck bisects the valley running south to lake quaroon the valley floor is a trellis of irrigation canals not modern not efficient but able to offer life blood to the fields the best vines of lebanon the best fruit the best vegetables all come from the beqaa and the best hashish the history of the beqaa is one of murder conspiracy feuding and smuggling the people of the region whether they be christian or druze or shia muslim have a reputation for lawlessness and independence government authority has always taken second place in the minds of the feudal landlords and the peasant villagers times of course have not stood still in the beqaa the villagers are better armed each community now possesses rpg grenade launchers heavy d s h k m machine guns enough kalashnikovs to dish them out to the kids the villagers are well off by the standards of torn divided lebanon because when all else fails the hashish market bails them out the trade is across the rifts of politics and religion druze sells to shia who sells to christian who sells to syrian the beqaa now is a valley of pass papers and checkpoints shia checkpoints on the approaches to their villages druze checkpoints syrian army checkpoints on the main road from damascus to beirut and more on the side roads that lead to their barracks palestinian checkpoints on the approaches to their training camps they had reached the high spot behind them were the customs buildings and the missile site ahead of them the ground dun and grey shelved away into the valley the recruits were in two military lorries while abu hamid sat in the jeep driven by fawzi his liaison officer fawzi drove with enthusiasm exhilarated in his role as middle man between the popular front training camp and the officers of air force intelligence abu hamid had thought that any man would be sick in his gut at such a job but all the man cared for all that he talked about on the climb to the mountain pass and the descent beyond was the newfound opportunity for trade trade he called it televisions and video cassette players and electric refrigerators would come to the beqaa from beirut freshly grown hashish would come from the valley and fawzi could take back to the old souq in damascus as much as would cram into the covered back of his jeep to abu hamid the man was disgusting the man was a criminal he wondered how it was that major said hazan would permit such a man to play a part in the palestinian revolution but he had hardly listened to fawzi yes he had the babble from the man from his thick spittlelined lips but after a while he had paid him no attention thought only of margarethe abu hamid did not know how long it would be until he next saw margarethe he had not been told he fancied that if he put his hand under the vest below his tunic and rubbed his hand hard against the skin and that if he then put his hand against his nose then he would smell the sweet scent of his margarethe with other women shyness made him brutal it was so the first time with margarethe but she had slapped his face right cheek and then left cheek then come to him rolled him onto his back and loved him he did not know where a woman had learned to love with such wild beauty from that first time margarethe made him love her with all the lights switched on each time she stripped him each time she straddled him he could not comprehend why margarethe schultz worshipped the body of abu hamid who did not have the money for shoes he did not understand her dedication to the cause of a palestinian homeland did not understand the red army faction of which she claimed to be a member he had written to her on the last day of each month that he had been in simferopol and when she was naked she was beautiful to him what was wonderful was that she had waited for him waited for six months for his return they were coming down into the valley he could hear the protests of the brakes of the lorries behind him it is the hashish that gets the best price i buy it here i pay the major forty per cent of what i have paid i double the cost of my outgoings and that is the price i will get in damascus i dont know what charge is made by the man who sells it on from damascus when it gets to europe the price is fantastic it amazes me that people in europe will pay they passed through two checkpoints manned by syrian commandos they crossed the floor of the valley the road took them alongside a small village and there were women out in the fields hoeing the damp ground between the first early summer wheat crop they bumped off the road and followed a stone track for four or five miles much for abu hamid to see there were old bomb craters still with the scorched blackness that years of rain had not discoloured there was a tank regiment hull down in defensive position there was a network of slit trenches newly dug and lined with the brightness of corrugated iron there were areas that were marked by a single strand of barbed wire and the skull and crossbones sign designating minefields they crossed two army engineers bridges over irrigation ducts and then traversed a rolling plank bridge over the main flow of the litani river they skirted a formation of camouflagepainted pillboxes they were close to the far wall of the beqaa valley he saw the small tent camp ahead a dozen tents the camp nestled under the rising ground beyond he winced there was nowhere else that they could be heading is that the camp the disgust was rich in abu hamids voice you want orange groves and villas you should go and fight in the zionist state you will find all the orange groves and all the villas that you could wish for there when darkness had fallen over the yarmouq camp when the perimeter floodlights were reduced to small cones of light a car drove through the gates and to the administration building a runner was sent from the administration building to the hut where the commander had his quarters the commander was seen by the runner to talk briefly to the men in the car and then to get into the back seat two hours later the commander was dead shot once in the head and he was buried in a shallow grave beside the quneitra road beyond the airport beyond the headquarters of air force intelligence when questioned by senior officials of the popular front investigating the commanders disappearance the runner would be able to say in truth that the darkness prevented him from seeing the men inside the car that they did not identify themselves for major said hazan the commander had outlived his usefulness and he was a dangerous witness to a conspiracy and he knew the author of that conspiracy of abu hamid major said hazan had no doubt martins had come to the nineteenth floor he sat in an armchair with his papers on his lap he sat uncomfortably upright it was a strange habit of the director general that he conducted his meetings from soft seating never used the polished table and the straight chairs that were at the far end of the room on the rare occasions that he was summoned to the director generals office percy martins was never at ease the director general seemed not to notice percy martins read rapidly through the brief received from graham tork station officer in tel aviv so it is his conclusion that abu hamid has by now either travelled to the beqaa or is about to which makes it awkward for us in torks opinion rather an eccentric one in my view damascus would be tolerably straightforward the beqaa quite impossible the service doesnt believe in impossible percy martins sucked at his teeth with respect sir the beqaa is virtually an armed camp it is home for the syrian army at least one division of armour regiments of artillery units of commando forces its also home for a violently antiwestern shia muslim population in the villages and for the hezbollah party of god fanatics also for the units of islamic jihad who although small are strong enough to blast the americans out of beirut and for half a dozen or more extreme palestinian groupings the director general played with his pipe youre not addressing schoolchildren and youre missing the point percy youre providing me only with problems but let me quote sir winston churchill to you grass never grows under a gallows tree hit the terrorist in his safe haven and you destroy not only him but you do a greater damage to the morale of his comrades have we the location of this training camp not yet sir tork reckons his locals should be able to give it to him within a couple of weeks we need that location we need a target area are you considering requesting the israelis to mount an airstrike waste of time the director general waved his hand dismissively he had that habit he was only two years older than martins the habit had the effect of making the number three on the middle east desk seem halfwitted an airstrike tells the syrians nothing i want the man who tasked this abu hamid for his killing mission to know that well go to the ends of the earth to exact a specific revenge martins read the familiar signs the more he pointed out the objections the more annoyance he would cause on the other hand the less he objected the less cover he gave himself in the event of a foulup youd actually consider sending a team into the beqaa martins sometimes wondered whether the service activities were planned on a christmas present pencil sharpener globe for all the reasons i have suggested that tork has set out that is quite impossible perhaps you didnt hear me the first time thats not a word i care for get yourself down to hereford percy without invitation percy martins heaved himself up from the low armchair he strode round the room speak now or for ever hold thy peace he heard his own voice raised so i go and talk to the ministry and then to special air service and whats the first thing theyll say theyll say the scar on abu hamids face is an inch across theyll say how close do they have to get to identify a man with a oneinch scar on his face weve a witness and i dare say weve got a pair of binoculars martins hesitated our witness is a diplomat not a soldier sir in the words of your report when you met this young man id want him killed it seems to me that he would be prepared to learn to be a soldier a further point the witness not only saw the scar the witness saw abu hamid saw his stance how he moved saw him run to take a young man untrained into the beqaa on a covert operation sir are you quite serious when we had leila khaled popular front hijacker in ealing police station i argued against swapping her for our airline passengers held hostage in amman i was overruled when it was planned to fly a gang of provisional ira death merchants by royal air force plane to london for a cosy chat with government i argued against it i was overruled i was overruled then because i didnt have enough authority now i do and the masters are going to learn how long and how ruthless our arm can be and quite frankly i hope they shit themselves in the knowledge martins said ill go and talk to hereford youll do more than that youll get our witness down to albury dust the place out get him up to the mark no misunderstandings percy this is going to happen they hadnt told her how long she had to make the rooms ready nor how many people would be coming she did not know whether they would be there in a day or a week she had her old vacuum cleaner and a bucket of warm water with jeyes fluid and a mop and three ragged dusters and a window cleaner aerosol spray she had four sets of sheets ranged out in the frame in front of the aga stove in the kitchen it would be seven months since the house in the woods outside the surrey village of albury had been used she had been afraid that if the house were not used then it would be sold off and she and george would be moved on there was no time for georges lunch that day she had ordered him to fill each and every one of the coal hobs light each and every fire on the ground floor to split more logs to find the fault in the hot water boiler to go into guildford with her shopping list and to keep his brute of a dog off the floors she had washed agnes ferguson had seen it all what a book she could have written she had been housekeeper for the service safe house at albury for nineteen years they had given it into her care in lieu of a widows pension she had kept the safe house for eastern bloc defectors for agents returning from imprisonment abroad while they were debriefed for the preparation of men going into covert action overseas it had been a long and anxious winter and george not much company the telephone call had seemed to breathe new life new hope into her that her future was assured its preposterous no other word for it it has the sanction of the director general martins said grimly it makes no difference whose sanction it has it just isnt on the brigadier said too dangerous is that it its not our way to duck a challenge but nor is it our way to volunteer ourselves for a mission that has no chance of success understand me no chance in the mist outside the brick bungalow percy martinss car was parked beside the broad base of the clock tower when he had locked the door he had noted the names inscribed on the stone plaque under the clock face the fatal casualties amongst the men of the nd regiment special air service had he not been under orders he would most probably have agreed with the brigadier no chance of success ill report that back dont play clever games with me the brigadier said a hard man piercing greyblue eyes we have no experience of thebeqas valley no man in the sas has ever set foot in the beqaa valley it is and always has been outside our theatre of operation we are not talking about the radfan mountain ops of the sixties nor about oman in the seventies for both of those we had first hand experience to draw upon and we had a wilderness area to work through in the beqaa we have no experience and we have no wilderness it would take us months of reconnaissance and preparation before we could walk in there with any reasonable prospect of survival ill convey your message they keep their hostages in the beqaa the reason they are there is that their captors believe it the most secure area in lebanon for strangers the beqaa is a dangerous closed valley the stranger wont last long enough to pick his nose to be frank and it gives me no satisfaction to say so we wouldnt stand a prayer ill report that you cannot be of help but i can be of help the brigadier said i can tell you who will get you into the beqaa who might quite possibly even get you out percy martins felt the surge of excitement a name was given he wrote the name in his notebook and then he asked for permission to use a secure telephone the last light of the afternoon the sun was an orange orb away to his left and sliding it was a good time for him because the ground ahead was cooling and the haze that had distorted his vision was gone and his barrel was no longer warm his right eye peering into the scope ached that pain behind his eye stabbed at him the pain was nothing new to him but it was more frequent and more acute and that worried him the target was six hundred metres away of course he had not measured the ground in two days and one night he had not moved in his hide except to raise his hips the few inches that enabled him to urinate into a plastic bag he was good at measuring distance without his expertise at gauging a distance ahead of him then all his work would be useless the chart in his mind told him the rate of the drop in flight of a fired bullet he knew the figures by heart the difference in a drop between metres and metres was metres the difference in a drop between metres and metres was the height of a grown man but he knew the distance to his target his experience had made the calculation and he had adjusted his scope sight for that distance beyond the target away to the targets right was a small fire that had been lit by a shepherd he had watched the shepherd all day hoping that the shepherd would keep his flock close to the stream and far from the rock slope on which he had made his hide he was grateful to the shepherd for lighting the fire the fire smoked right to left the movement of the smoke enabled him to gauge the wind speed that would deflect his bullet another graph his estimate of the wind speed was five miles per hour his estimate of the deflection was eleven inches for a target that was six hundred metres away it amused him the way that sometimes the figures in his head were metric and sometimes they were yards and feet and inches and sometimes the thoughts in his mind were hebrew and sometimes they were english he reckoned that he was close now to the optimum moment and so the throb of the pain behind his right eye was relegated in importance he was old for work as a sniper he was years old and the balance was delicately poised between his expertise at gauging the distance to the target and the wind speed against the ache of a tired eye on a range he could shoot well inside a melonsized group at metres a mans head was wider than a melon that he was not on a range made little difference to him if he had been young perhaps he would have been knotted in tension and he would have cramp in his leg muscles he was not young he was quite relaxed and he had learned long ago to rotate his toes in his boots to beat the cramp he was not looking for a head shot his scope showed him where the hair lines crossed the upper arm of the target who was in profile to him he waited for the target to turn to face him he waited for the hair lines to cross on the upper torso of the target steady hands on the rifle no shake in the elbow that supported the rifle the target faced him was gesturing there was no caution from the target the target had no need for caution the target was standing on open ground that was four clear miles from the edge of the security zone four clear miles beyond the stop point of israeli patrols he knew that the target the man with the flowing beard and the old camouflage battledress was a commander of a unit of the hezbollah he knew no more about him he did not know why the man had been targeted that concerned him not at all he received his orders he carried them out he was only thankful that he still belonged was still wanted as a regular his finger slid slowly from against the trigger guard to curl around the curve of the trigger the hair lines were full on the chest of the target they wavered around the flash of a small gold pendant he knew the men of the hezbollah talked at length of the glory of martyrdom there was a wry cold smile on his dirtsmeared face crane fired the crack of a bullet the collapse of a man the scream of the crows taking flight the bleat of stam peding sheep the yelling of the men who had been with the target and the great silence the sun slipped the dusk gathered a grey blanket sliding over the valleys and water courses and rock outcrops and jebels of south lebanon shadows merging features losing substance there would be no search that was the advantage of firing in the late afternoon there could be no search in darkness and where to search none of the men who had stood with the commander of a unit of the hezbollah could have pointed out the source of the single shot in the black night canopied by stars crane walked with his rifle and his backpack homewards towards the security zone each time he fired each time he scored he believed that he prolonged his life as a regular he put off the day when life would mean little more than a seat at a pavement cafe on dizengoff in the darkness his strained right eye no longer throbbed the stabbing pain was gone at the edge of the security zone an armoured personnel carrier waited for him from a distance he shouted a password and when the response was yelled back at him he came forward the crew of the carrier were all youngsters all conscripts they stared in awe as crane slept in the back of the lurching pitching vehicle each one of the conscripts knew his name his reputation they saw the worn filthy boots and the torn trousers and the muddied camouflage tunic and the smeared face and the woollen cap into which had been inserted sprigs of thorn bush he was a legend to them at the camp on high ground outside the town of kiryat shmona two miles inside the border of the state of israel crane jumped easily from the tail board of the carrier no backward glance no thanks no small talk he was told that a helicopter was standing by to take him to tel aviv youve done well ill confess sir i had doubts at first im losing them thats what i like to hear percy i am tired of the rubbishing of the service by every newspaper in london im looking for a result we can be proud of the director general shrugged into his overcoat his briefcase was on the desk filled with the evenings reading his detective waited by the door id like to be in charge sir martins stuck his jaw forward youd what id like to run this show sirhere and in tel aviv he saw the director general pause take stock then jerk the coat into place i was thinking of fenner hasnt my experience sir id give it my best shot sir you could depend on me bit old arent you for running in the field its my show sir and i want it i want it badly the director general wrapped his scarf across his throat he pulled on his gloves what would i tell fenner that life doesnt end at fifty sir the director general laughed bloody good its yours percy get it in place young holt had been all day on the moor he came down the long straight road towards the village all the time he was coming down the hill he could see the front garden and the front door of the house that doubled as his parents home and his fathers surgery there was a car parked outside by the front gate it had been there for as long as he could see the house he had caught every shower of the day and the winds from the west had spurred him along he had seen deer and he had seen a dog fox and he fancied that he might have found the holt of an otter and he had decided that he would return to london end his indefinite compassionate leave the decision made the wet and the cold worthwhile impossible to have made the decision at home under his mothers watching eye he was coming fast down the hill looking for a bath looking for a mug of hot sugared tea he could see her face he could feel her arms round his neck he could hear her voice in the rain on the moor he had cried to her in the wind he had shouted to her he saw the front door open he saw his father come out and look up the road and discover him and wave to him the front garden was a picture daffodils and crocuses and the leaves sprouting on the shrub bushes and the path cleanly swept he reached the gate he saw his fathers wheelbarrow piled with winter debris and the fork and the secateurs and the broom leaning against the wheelbarrow as if the work had been disturbed been waiting ages for you holt theres a chap here whos driven down from london to collect you a mr martins percy martins i think he said it was as if ropes tightened on his wrists he saw her face felt her body heard her voice dont be childish holt decentseeming sort of chap his father said just a trifle impatient your mothers given him tea holt walked gingerly down the staircase the carpet had had so much use that he thought his mother would not even have offered it to oxfam most of the dull brass rods were loose there were three oil paintings on the wall above the stairs just decipherable as victorian military and all apparently smoked for years over a damp log fire in the early morning light the house looked in even worse a state than it did by night but he had had a good sleep and at least the sheets had been aired peeping through a door at the back of the hall was an elderly woman in a housecoat she had a headscarf over her hair and the sharp angles told him that she had slept in her curlers and not yet removed them good morning holt said he did his best to sound cheerful she told him that she was mrs ferguson that she kept house he hadnt seen her the night before it had been a fivehour drive from exmoor and when they arrived there was hardly a light on in the place and no food waiting and no sign of a welcoming drink even martins had been true to form hadnt talked all the way having muttered right at the start that he wasnt going to go off half cock that he would keep the mysteries until the morning better that way that was holts opinion he could be patient away behind closed doors he could hear the muffle of martinss voice on the telephone hell be having his breakfast in fifteen minutes mrs ferguson said she seemed to reproach him as if by coming downstairs he had caught her unprepared as if he should have stayed in his room until called holt prised open the bolts on the front door and slipped the security chain he could still hear martins on the telephone thirteen minutes until breakfast he had the impression that breakfast was like a parade the lock on the door was a new expensive chubb and he had seen the fresh alarm wiring at the windows he stood on the front steps he gazed around him the house was a tower at his back faded red surrey brick probably sixty or seventy years old with rounded corners topped by farcical battlements in front of him were lawns uncut since the previous autumn and daffodil swards and beds of daisies and rose bushes that had escaped a winter pruning there was a clatter of pigeons in flight from the oak and beech and sycamre trees that fringed the grass he heard the stampede escape of a squirrel in the overgrown rhododendrons that hid the curve of a shingle drive holt thought the garden could have been a paradise a dog was charging towards him heavy shouldered black and tan ears swept back a mouth of white teeth holt was good with dogs there had always been dogs at home he stood his ground he slapped his hand against his thigh welcoming he heard a bellow a yelling for the dog to stop stand stay come to heel the dog kept on coming stripping the distance across the grass holt recognised the markings and weight of the german rottweiler round the corner of the house came an elderly man built like his dog hobbling in pursuit and shouting his command and being ignored the dog reached holt the dog sat in front of him and licked holts hand the dog had dreamy pleasure in the wide mahogany eyes the man reached them he was panting you shouldnt be walking outside not when hers out damn bastard spiteful she can be he wasnt looking at the dog the wet of the dogs tongue lapped the back of holts hand shes a trained guard dog shes soft as a brush a lovely dog my names holt im george and youd best not be taking liberties with her vicious she can be holt was scratching under the dogs chin he could see the rank happiness in the eyes holt believed there must be method in the madness a dog that was loving and called vicious a garden that was beautiful and left to sink to ruin a house that was magnificent and nearly splendid but was obviously not cared for he could be patient but by god hed require some answers by the end breakfast holt the shout from the doorway he saw that martins wore corduroy trousers and a guernsey sweater and keep that beast under control george holt walked away he turned once briefly to see the dog watching him going as he went through the front door martins battered him across the shoulders with forced camaraderie sleep all right fine place you shouldnt just take yourself outside you were lucky that george was there to control that bloody animal word of warning about breakfast eat everything she takes it personally if you leave a crumb or a quarter of an inch of bacon rind straight after well talk business they took breakfast in a dining room that could have probably once had housed a fullsize billiard table but the flooring was linoleum and there were five small square tables each covered with a plastic cloth holt thought it was a civil service canteen and the food was right for a canteen and the coffee was worse martins said that the house had been bequeathed to the nation in and that since no one wanted it the service had been lumbered he said that it cost a small fortune to run and to heat he said that mrs ferguson was the widow of a special operations executive agent who had been parachuted into france just before the invasion captured and shot he said that george was a former serviceman wounded by mine shrapnel in the cyprus emergency and kept on by the service as caretaker gardener driver maintenance man holt wondered if jane had ever been in a place like this martins led the way across the hall and into a huge drawing room the dustcovers were piled in the centre of the carpet and the fire had not been cleared or laid again martins cursed he lifted the pile of dust sheets took them to the door flung them out at the fireplace he emptied the hod into the grate and then buried a fire lighter under the fresh coal and lit it when the smoke billowed across the room he cursed again and went back to the door and left it ajar typical of houses like this you have to leave a door open if you want a fire otherwise youre smoke gassed why the service has to put up with it defeats me i imagine youre pretty cut up about miss canning they were there the patient waiting was over martins was bent over the fire prodding with a grimed poker holt stood in the centre of the room and stared through the windows he could see the dog slouching disconsolately towards a rose bed then squatting ive done a fair amount of thinking while ive been at home you must have been devastated only natural i was at first but ive come to terms with it im going back to fco life is for living thats what janes mother said to me i dont quite follow you im going back to work im going to try to put yalta out of my m i n d martins was up from the fire and the poker was left across the grate shock in his eyes the colour flushing to his face your girl killed shot down in cold blood butchered in broad daylight and youre talking about life is for living i dont believe my ears dont sermonise me mr martins my feelings are in no way your business not anyones business but mine oh very nice hardly dead and youre talking about forgetting her abandoning her memory there was a waft of contempt in martinss voice and a tinge that holt saw of anxiety she was my girl i loved her and she is dead and to be forgotten youre an arrogant bastard mister martins what i said is that i intend to go back to work to go on with my life then young holt you are a selfish little creep if you brought me half way across england to this slum to insult me im merely astonished to hear this gutless crap from a young man who said of his girls killer id want him killed and what bloody option do i have thats more like it thats the question i wanted to hear martins smiled quickly what the hell can i do much better martins heaved the air down into his chest like a great weight had been lifted from him you had me rather worried for a minute young holt you had me wondering whether there was an ounce of spunk left in your body i dont see what more i can do for you holt said simply martins spoke fast as if unwilling to lose the moment you are of course a signatory to the official secrets act you are aware that such a signature places upon you an oath of silence on all matters concerned with the work of the service everything that i am about to tell you is covered by the terms of that act and violation by you of those terms would lead as night follows day to your appearing in closed court charged with offences under section one of the act just as if he were falling as if the ground opened under him as if he could not help himself what can i do far in the distance the dog was barking holt could see the leaping body and the snarling mouth and george waving a stick at shoulder height teasing the animal you can help the man who murdered your girl to an early grave the turmoil rocked in holts mind she had been the girl with whom he had planned to spend his youth and his middle years and the last of his life and you can assist your country in an act of vengeance there had been no mention of ben armitage no mention of an ambassador assassinated but then the arm twist was on him and armitage was not personal to him the turmoil blasting him he despised violence he despised janes killer but he had seen the eyes of the killer he had seen the work of the gun of the killer what are you asking of me that you join a team that will go into the beqaa valley in east lebanon that you identify abu hamid the murderer of your girl and then then he is shot dead and then we all just walk home you walk out and thats possible derision in holts voice staring up into martinss face into the smoke cloud of the fire if youve the courage who do i walk with and who fires the shot a man who is expert at crossing hostile territory a man who is expert at sniping one man so youre better off that way hed be better off alone but you are the only man who saw the target you have to go could it work martins waved at the billowing smoke we believe so im a bloody puppet and youre a crude sod when it comes to manipulation i knew i could depend on your help holt well have some coffee i dont have the chance to say no wed be disappointed if you did ill make the coffee hes a first class man that youll be travelling with quite excellent he goes by the name of noah crane catarracta is the latin word for waterfall cataract is what you have in your right eye it is an opacity of the crystalline lens of the eye at your age it is not at all surprising that you display the early stages of what we call the senile cataract to the ophthalmic surgeon he was simply another patient the examination was over after the expla nation a cheque would be written out at the reception desk he knew the man was from overseas he assumed that he was required for diagnosis a second opinion not for treatment the patient lay back in the padded examination chair he showed no emotion in the cataractaffected eye there is a hardening and shrinking at the heart of the lens which in time will lead to the disintegration of the lens the cataract itself will lead to a deterioration in your short sight now mr crane a cataract can be treated but regrettably there looks like being another complication they had been through the symptoms before the detail of the examination noah crane had laconically described the frequency of the headaches while the viewing power of the eye was stretched and the multiplication of bright lights in the distant dark he had said that he saw better at dusk the complication behind the cataract is and i would have to carry out a further examination to be certain that the retina of your right eye is probably diseased i dont beat about the bush with my patients disease of the retina negates the type of successful surgery that we can carry out to remedy the cataract how long do i have you have years of sight how long do i have with my sight as it is you have no time your sight is already deteriorating everyones is of course after a certain age mine is yours is without the problem of the retina i would say we could get you back to where you were a couple of years ago but we have the retina and that means your sight will gradually diminish i should have qualified that the affliction is purely in the right eye your left eye is in excellent shape do you work indoors outside then you should not be unduly pessimistic outside you will be using your long sight shortsightedness is not so important you should see a surgeon when you return home i understand that theres a place in houston but the american techniques of treatment are unproven you could spend a great deal of money mr crane a huge sum and have no guarantee of success the chair straightened to upright noah crane sat for a moment with his head bowed and his hands clasped together he could aim only with his right eye he could not tell the ophthalmic surgeon that although he worked outside it was short range vision that mattered to him was what his life depended on no long range vision was required to peer into the magnification of the scope sight he climbed out of the chair he walked out of the room so he knew he had asked and he had been told time was slipping from him in the street he felt the bitter cut of the wind the wind lashedfrom a side street into wimpole street he wore light trousers and a light shirt that was open at the neck and a light poplin anorak too many clothes for home in kiryat shmona at the base camp not enough clothes for london in spring in a small grip bag were all his possessions a change of clothes a wash bag and a photograph in a leather wallet of his mother and her sister and a small brown envelope no other possessions because everything else this man used was the property of the israeli defence force he walked across central london and then across the bridge to the railway station he had seen his mothers sister he had negotiated his price in the bare room on the third floor of century and the sight of his right eye was ebbing from him he had no more business in london he was ready to take the train the light was failing in the room the shadows leaping from the fire percy martins stood with his back to the flames crane being recruited was a master stroke youll learn holt that when the service wants something it gets it when the service wants a man it gets that man youre to be a team a twoman team neither of you can fulfil your task without the other crane cannot identify our target without you you cannot eliminate the assassin without crane two men with one aim thats the way it has to be holt was less than six feet from martins taking what heat he could that was diverted around the flanks of martinss legs he wondered why the man spoke as if lecturing to a full briefing room noah aaharon crane is years old i expect thats a relief eh no worries about keeping up with an old timer like that his father was a british soldier stationed in palestine at the outbreak of the second war married locally got himself killed in normandy by the time he was he had spent his childhood in israel and his adolescence in the uk he joined the nd battalion of the parachute regiment that was he served with the regiment in borneo and aden and in northern ireland he made it to sergeant and his records speak of a firstclass soldier but his mother died in and for reasons that are close to him crane left the british army flew to israel and joined up with what they call the golani brigade the file indicates that he had a sense of guilt at not having visited his mother who was jerusalem born and bred for many years during the last part of her life that a sense of blame took him back to her country as an infantry man he earned a glittering record after his induction into the idf he was with the golani at the retaking of mount hermon in he was in lebanon in he was a member of the assault squad on the old crusader castle of beaufort in he was good enough to be a regular he was hardened by combat experience but he seems to have next to no interest in promotion in fact it is difficult to locate what interests outside the i d f he does have his only living relative is his mothers sister living somewhere in north london he has never married he refuses leave there are men like that in our army every fighting machine throws them up they are difficult awkward men in time of war they are a godsend in time of peace they are arseholes for nuisance value im digressing after the capture from the palestinians of the beaufort castle twelfth century in origin but an excellent artillery spotting position a particularly bloody battle cranes unit was pushed north and east into the beqaa valley and he stayed there he stayed put he became a fixture for three years of israeli presence there some inspired staff man back at the defence ministry seemed to have it locked into his head that the beqas represents a hack door to damascus a way round the golan heights by the time that israel abandoned its positions and retreated noah crane had inquired as much knowledge of that valley as any man in the i d f it is our assessment that he alone can get into the beqaa do a job of work and get out is this sanctioned by government official secrets act holt sanctioned from on high you said difficult and awkward youll cope holt stood i never had a chance did i of course you didnt you have become holt an instrument of government policy and if i was to say i was frightened frightened you ought to be grateful it was the girl you were screwing that was shot holt id have thought youd have been jumping at the chance to get stuck in ill do it holt said dont make a big song and dance about it percy martins smiled i will go into the beqaa valley and i will identify a palestinian terrorist so that he can be killed with the sanction of my government we dont play fanfares round here and when i come back i will scrape my knuckles raw on the end of your nose a wider smile from percy martins you do just that late afternoon came and the crowds of the capitals workers were streaming towards the rail termini and the bus stops and the underground platforms it was the time of day when the director general usually slipped anonymously into the whitehall entrance of the cabinet office to take the discreet tunnel to downing street the prime minister read the list arson attempt on israeli tourist office fateh responsible failed assassination attempt on iraqi ambassador fateh responsible gun attack on el al bus with fatalities wadia haddad group responsible letter bomb sent to iraqi embassy source unknown iraqi arrested while carrying explosives and on way to ira linkup source unknown own goal as bomb explodes at hotel wadia haddad group responsible shooting of israeli ambassador abu nidal responsible arson at jewish club source unknown bomb explodes near bank leumi of israel source unknown bomb explodes near marks amp spencers main branch source unknown thwarted attempt to buy sophisticated military sabotage equipment p f l p general command responsible bomb explodes at jewishowned travel business source unknown interception of explosives courier abu nidal responsible attempt to place live bomb on el al jet liner syrian air force intelligence responsible its a truly sickening list thats just arab terrorism in london prime minister in the last several years on top of that we should add attacks on british nationals abroad the machine gun attack on the women and children of our servicemen in cyprus grenade attacks on hotels used by british tourists in greece thats a whole other list which ends with the deaths of the ambassador and miss canning sir sylvester armitage was a fine man a great servant of his country whose death should be avenged the prime minister hesitated the suggestion had been made but the decision was the prime ministers alone it can be done a small surgical operation into the beqaa valley yes it can be done how many men just two a jewish briton who is familiar with the ground skilled in covert work and a marksman he will travel with young holt who will identify the target so few the prime minister murmured would there be israeli assistance inside israel yes inside lebanon we would assume that also yes the director general stood at his full height avuncular and confident but it would be our show prime minister against the man who pulled the trigger on our ambassador indeed that very man we would be acting in the very theatre where others talk about acting we would not be scattering bombs over an international city in the hope they might find a target we would be going for one man with whom we have a known score to settle a marksman and a spotter the prime minister mused would they get out weve chosen the best possible soldier for the job the decision to be taken alone the memory of sitting in a country church hearing the tears of armitages granddaughter of watching a coffin carried along the aisle bedecked with spring flowers the memory of many outrages of television news clips of broken shop fronts of blood smears on inner london pavements of bodyguards crammed into armourplated limousines bring me his head the prime minister snapped the curtains were drawn the fire smouldered holt sat on a sofa the light in the room was low as two of the five bulbs in the ceiling formation were dead percy martins was saying the yanks cannot actually put this sort of operation together you dont believe me well ill tell you their special forces have an annual budget of over a billion dollars can you imagine that much money spent on one divisionsized unit no good though they have the delta force and the helicopter task force and the air force special operations wing but theyre no damned good theyre more interested in saucy cap badges and expenses do you know that when they wanted to drop a squad on a hijacked liner in the mediterranean the pentagon had to give permission for half the squad to leave united states territory and why because the squad was under investigation for fiddling expenses their kit doesnt work theyre too late on the scene the germans are fine up to a point but at mogadishu when they stormed an airliner it was britons who canopened the plane for them and chucked in the stun grenades when the italians have a problem they get on the phone pretty damn quick and call up help from us holt wondered how martins had ever made it into the secret intelligence service he thought hed be better employed running the social calendar for an exservicemens club when my director general was on the phone just now he was really chortling a dog with two bones is that all you care about showing that we can do a job well yes i do care about that so you can crow to the americans is that why im being chucked into lebanon youre not being chucked you volunteered in case we misunderstand each other young man martins was striding the carpet talking to the ceiling gloom and the cobwebs that were beyond the reach of mrs fergusons feather duster in case we dont follow each other let us be clear on something you have been fortunate enough to have been chosen to carry out an operation of infinitely greater importance to your countrys needs than anything you would have achieved in years of a career in the diplomatic service instead of a lifetime on your butt concocting reports that will have appeared better written and a month earlier in half of our daily newspapers you are going to do something you are going to achieve something about which you will be justly proud for the rest of your life there was the growl of a car engine there was the scrape of the tyres on gravel holt heard the bellow bark of the dog he stood and went to the window he pulled the curtain back he saw the taxi pull up under the front floodlighting that beamed off the porch roof the passenger must have passed his money inside the taxi because when he climbed from the back the taxi drove away it was obvious to him that he was looking at the man called noah crane he could be clearly seen in the light from the roof he was a fleshless man skin on bone physically nondescript rounded shoulders a cavern for a chest and spindly arms the wind flattened his cotton trousers and showed the narrow contours of his leg muscles cropped hair in a pepperpot mixture of brown and grey stubble and below were hollow cheeks leather tanned skin over a jutting thin jaw lay tight on a beaked nose holt watched as noah crane made no move towards the front door but gazed instead over the black shadow gardens assimilating his whereabouts the front door opened the dog came out fast and holt could hear george yelling for it to stay stop stand the dog went straight to crane holt heard george shout a warning that the dog could be evil the dog was on its back and crane crouched beside it the dog had its four saucer paws in the air and crane was scratching the soft hair of its stomach crane picked up his grip bag and came evenly not hurrying himself up the porch steps and the dog was licking his hand that was the truth for holt the dog recognised authority when he came away from the window holt realised that he was alone that martins had left the room gone to the hall to meet crane the dog had found the power and authority of the man it was the moment when young holt knew into what pit he had fallen how deep was the pit how steep were the sides it was the moment that young holt knew he stared at the face of a killer it was the moment that young holt knew the dangers the hazards of the beqaa he thought that crane was unlike any man he had seen before something easy and untroubled about the way that crane had walked up the old flagstone steps of the porch he remembered how he had mounted those steps himself in trepidation anxious to please fearful of what awaited him crane had come up the steps like a hangman like an untroubled executioner god but he was so frightened dont be childish holt the squeak of the swinging door the light flooding in from the hall holt id like you to meet noah crane martins said holt stood his ground incapable of moving he was taller than crane and he probably carried a stone and a half more in weight he felt he was a beef bullock under market examination crane looked at him head to toe holt wore a paor of wellcreased slacks and a clean white shirt and a tie and a quiet check sports jacket his shoes were cleaned he felt like a schoolboy going for a first job crane wore dirty running shoes his shirt was open three buttons from the neck expressionless eyes crane turned to percy martins martins stood beside him playing the cattle market auctioneer thats him thats young holt mr crane any military time no he hasnt been in the armed services any survival training theres nothing like that on his record any current fitness work not since he came back from moscow not that i know of any reason to take him other than the face he saw abu hamid mr crane thats why hes travelling any leverage put on him it was his girl friend who was killed he didnt need persuading any briefing given him on the beqaa i thought it best to wait until you joined us the accent was london not the sharp whip of east but more the whine of west london crane spoke to martins from the side of his mouth but all the time his eyes stayed locked on holt crane came close to holt close enough for holt to see the old mosquito scars under the hair on his cheeks close enough for holt to smell the burger sauce on his breath close enough for holt to feel the coldness of his eyes it came from down by the side of cranes thigh no backlift without warning a short arm punch with the closed fist up into holts solar plexus the fist pounded into holts jacket into his shirt into his vest into his stomach gasping for breath sinking towards the carpet holt was on his knees nothing personal crane said but your stomach wall is flab holt thought he was going to throw up his eyes were closed tight shut he could hear their voices if hes not fit hes useless to me on the way in useless on the way out well get him doing some exercises too right holt used the arm of a chair to push himself back to his feet he forced his hands away from his stomach he was swallowing to control the nausea he blinked to keep the tears from his eyes i dont apologise holt if i have a passenger then i dont succeed if i dont succeed youll be dead i just might be dead with you i wont be a passenger holt croaked major zvi dan waved the station officer to a chair pig hot in the room with the table fan burned out the walk from his car into the building and then the trek down the corridors had brought the first sweat drops to the station officers forehead im sorry but again they say they will not shit i explained that the request for reconsideration came from the director general of sis i knew what the answer would be thats the israeli way we make decisions and we stick with them the station officer bit at his lip i think i knew that would be the answer before they make you their errand boy have they any idea in london of what would be involved logistically in a helicopter pickup deep in the beqaa probably not then you should tell them the station officer reached for his notepad from his briefcase he took a ballpoint from his shirt pocket fire at me first what is involved in a pickup where there are no missiles where there is only small arms fire you will have stirred a hornets nest the moment the killing is made a similar situation last year we lost a phantom over the hills close to sidon we had a pilot on the ground with his electronics giving us his position by fixed wing and by cobra helicopters we put down a curtain of bombs and cannon fire around him through which no human being could move we did that for ninety minutes until it was dark phantoms coming in relays gunships overhead the whole time do i have to tell you how many aircraft how many copters that involved overhead we had a command aircraft the entire time when we had night cover we flew in a cobra to pick up the pilot with more cobras creating a sanitised corridor through which it could fly at the pickup there was no time to land the pilot had to reach for the landing skids hold onto them while he was lifted off and flown to safety that is whats involved when theres no missile umbrella theyll get it in london the station officer was writing grim faced but in the beqaa you are under the missile umbrella the beqaa is protected by the sa guideline for high altitude intruders by the s a gecko for medium altitude intruders by the sa gaskin for low level if you put a helicopter in when there is a state of high alert then you must also put in aircraft to protect it those aircraft in turn must be kept safe from the missiles for that degree of protection you have to be prepared to assault the missile sites in we destroyed the missile sites in the beqaa to achieve that we had to do the following we had to launch drones to fly where we thought the missiles were positioned the drones have reflectors that make them show on the radar like fullsized piloted aircraft when the syrians switched on their radar fully and prepared the missiles that was disclosed by the ec a converted boeing airliner and the ec hawkeye when we had exactly located the missile sites and had confused them with electronic jamming then we hit them from the air with the maverick missile and the walleye bomb that goes to the source of the missiles energy unit it was a big operation you follow me all that had to be done on top of all that we were also obliged to fight off the syrian interceptors it was quite a battle i hear you my friend that is what is involved that is what we have had to consider when you made a request for an airborne pickup in the beqaa no helicopter l i f t how could there be it is not even our operation then they have to walk out our marksman and your eye witness and the hornets nest stirred do you think in london that they appreciate the teeth of the beqaa too late whether they do or dont theyre committed from a drawer in his desk major zvi dan took a single platesized photograph he told the station officer that the small pale patches in the magnified heart of the photograph were the tents of what was believed to be a popular front training camp for raw recruits he went to his wall map and read off the coordinates for the position of the camp we believe that is where you will find your man it is a long way to walk to a long way to walk back from the station officer dropped his notebook back into his case he leaned over crane is your soldier he is seconded to you he is paid by you it is your operation the station officer thanked his friend for the photograph ill pass it on thank you tork i thought you should know immediately mr fenner theyll be on their own in lebanon they talked on a secure line henry fenner number two on the middle east desk at century and graham tork station officer in tel aviv ill pass it on but its not my concern arent you running this mr fenner i am not the old mans given it to percy martins is that a joke he must be ready for going out to grass i tell you frankly im not that sorry not after what youve told me and did you know that hereford turned it down flat for your ears mr anstruther agrees with me its a nonohoper my advice meant kindly is keep your distance if martins is going down the plug where he should have gone years ago make sure you dont go with him bye tork thank you mr fenner in his office in the embassy the station officer replaced his telephone what a wonderful world anstruther and fenner high fliers on the middle east desk giving him the nod and the wink he had met percy martins on his last journey to london thought he must have come out of the ark he thanked the good lord that he was posted abroad that he didnt go each morning to a desk at century he wondered if the young man holt knew the half of it and hoped to god that he did not it was the crisp snap voice that woke mrs ferguson she stirred in her bed her eyes clearing she peered at her alarm clock on the table beside her it was minutes past six oclock it was eight minutes before her alarm would ring she had good hearing she could hear the words at your age a fit soldier can do situps a minute you managed ten on your pushups a fit man can do you did eight on your squatthrusts you need to do you got to six she gathered her dressing gown around her shoulders stiffly levered herself off the bed she went to the window youll get fit and quick or youre a burden to me she saw holt wearing vest and underpants lying spreadeagled on the terrace his chest heaving mr crane was standing over him and holding a stop watch now you do sprints three times metres she half hid her face behind the curtain she saw holt attempt to sprint between the edge of the terrace and the nearest rose bed running like a drunk or a cripple but running not giving up i reckon round this lawn six times is a mile and a half if you do it in anything around eleven minutes thats excellent anything over sixteen minutes is not good enough get on with i t holt was still running by the time mrs ferguson had washed and dressed and applied the thin pencil of lipstick still on his feet still moving forward a light wind caught at the tent flaps and swayed them there were bell tents for the recruits from the tent area a clear track had been trodden to a single smaller tent and there was another path to the cooking area where a sheet of rusted corrugated iron nailed to four posts served as weather protection for the fire eight tents for the recruits and a smaller tent for abu hamid and for fawzi when he was there and the cooking area they were all in a tight group away from the tents and the cooking area thirty yards away was a stall with three sides of draped sacking that served as the latrine pit for the camp near to the tents for the recruits were airraid trenches that had been cut down through the topsoil and into the rock strata they had been dug deep approached by wooden slatted steps and covered over with tin to make a roof and then the displaced earth and stones in one last trench slit a door had been made to fit close against the heavy wood of the surrounds and in this trench were stored the strela groundtoair missiles that were a part of the camps defence system further away closer to the perimeter of the camp were three separate zpu mm antiaircraft multiple guns the inner perimeter of the camp was marked by a close coil of barbed wire on which had caught fragments of paper and cardboard and into which had been thrown the debris of old ammunition boxes and packing cases the outer perimeter was a ditch hewn out by bulldozers and with steep enough sides to hinder the progress of a tank to the west of the camp was the wall of the side of the beqaa to the north three miles away was a small syrian camp housing a company of regular commandos to the east was the full flat stretch of the width of the valley floor to the south was a shia muslim village the camp had been sited miles from the southern extremity of the beqaa at its nearest point the israeli border was miles from the camp it was considered a safe haven abu hamid hated the place hated the dirt and the filth and the smells of the camp he hated the recruits who were his responsibility he hated the flies in the day and the mosquitoes that came at dusk from the irrigation ditch beyond the perimeter and the rats that swarmed at night from the coiled wire he hated the food that was cooked dry under the corrugated iron roof and over the open wood fire he hated the relaxed calm of fawzi who was the syrian spy in place to watch over him he hated the boredom of the training routine most of all he hated the isolation of the camp he had requested of fawzi the necessary pass that would have enabled him to get to damascus to see his margarethe of course the requests were not refused nothing was ever refused by the syrians the requests were only diverted there was just the hinted promise that later everything would be possible for two weeks he had been a prisoner in two weeks he had not seen major said hazan nor had he seen any of the big men of the popular front of course he knew that the doctor the inspiration of the popular front could not travel into the valley could not expose himself that close to the territory of the zionist enemy but there were others that could have come others who could have demanded of the syrians the right of access to himself and to the new recruits the place was hell to him and there was a worm that ate at his confidence abu hamid had performed a service to the palestinian cause to the government of the syrian arab republic who were the sponsors of that cause the service was secret could not be spoken of that was the worm of course the recruits knew that he had taken part in the battles of in tyre and sidon and damour and in west beirut but the recruits too every last one of them had been inside one or more of those battles as young teenagers they had carried back the casualties carried forward the ammunition the young teenagers had been left behind in the rachidiye camp and the ein el helwe camp and the miye ou miye camp and the sabra and the chatila camps when the fighters had been given safe passage by foreign peacekeeping troops and sailed away the kids had stayed under the zionist occupation they showed him a degree of respect for having been to the military academy at simferopol and having passed out as top officer cadet only a degree of respect if only they had known when can we go to israel was their sole concern when can we fight the real war the recruits pleaded with abu hamid when can we show that we have no fear abu hamid had known men who had gone to israel fought the real war shown that they had no fear he had known them in the camps before the israeli invasion of lebanon in he had seen them go he had never seen one of them return one fact alone mitigated the hatred he felt for this filthy stinking camp it was a secret to his recruits but he had proved himself at simferopol and he would never be required to prove himself again it would never be demanded of him that he should go through the security zone into israel a very secret thought a thought that he would never share they were coming down the gentle lower slope of the valley wall the recruits were in a loose formation twenty ranks of three abreast and abu hamid played the part of a noncommissioned instructor at the military academy and strode at the side of them and shouted for the step to be maintained the recruits were singing with fervour an anthem of the popular front a song of killing and victory the anthem was of death was of battle but the valley was a place of peace from the elevation of the track looking out across the cultivated floor of the valley and across the sharp ridge lines of the irrigation ditches and the light sweep of the unsurfaced road that fed their camp abu hamid could see a scene of undamaged tranquillity there were women from the shia village pruning in the grove of olive trees more women bent amongst the marijuana crop there were men working between the lines of the vineyards more men shepherding flocks of sheep towards brighter pastures amongst the gullies in the rock scrub smoke spirals drifted into the air above the commandos camp he could hear birds singing he could see two jeep vehicles kicking up short dust storms as they approached the camp along the unsurfaced road they came down the hillside they reached the gate of the camp the gap in the coiled wire when the nearest of the jeeps was a hundred yards from the perimeter abu hamid gave his orders the rpg launchers to be returned after cleaning to the underground armoury the rifles to be cleaned and inspected the cooking for the midday meal to be started he waited at the entrance of the camp the first jeep ground to a stop in front of him the second jeep had pulled up fifty yards further down the track the engines were switched off both jeeps carried the red and white flashes of the military police of the syrian army on their dustcoated flanks he saw that the driver of the near jeep wore the white helmet of the military police he saw fawzi climb out from the passenger seat fawzi had been away for three days and three nights he saw the grin the expectant pleasure on fawzis face fawzi acknowledged abu hamid a casual waft of the hand then walked to the back of the jeep threw it open the woman was chicken trussed she was carried easily by fawzi from the back of the jeep her ankles below the length of the long hem of her skirt were bound many times with the sort of twine that is used to bind straw or hay for cattle fodder her wrists were handcuffed behind her back fawzi carried her over his shoulder she did not whimper she did not writhe abu hamid could not see her face which lay limp against the chest of fawzi she had no headscarf her long hair was dirtstreaked the pale soil of the beqaa smeared into the black tresses he saw the military policeman the driver stay in his seat light a cigarette he followed fawzi into the camp behind the unmoving legs of the woman the woman had no shoes and the soles of her feet were raw and bloodcaked abu hamids finger flicked at the scar well in his cheek beside the tents fawzi heaved the woman to the ground she fell hard on her hip and her shoulder no sound from her lips only the heave of her lungs to replace the breath punched from her body abu hamid swallowed the recruits were gathering forming a hesitant circle around fawzi and abu hamid and the woman fawzi was panting but silent preparing his speech abu hamid saw the face of the woman he thought that her nose was broken because of the twist of the point of her nose as if it were putty and could be moved easily sideways her eyes were closed perhaps she did not care to open them perhaps the bruising was too heavy for her to be able to open them there was dark vivid bruising on the soft sallow skin he could see that the buttons of her heavy blouse had been torn away he could see the sears on her throat and on the upper skin of her breasts abu hamid thought that she had been burned with cigarette butts he was struggling to suppress his vomit nausea this woman is leila galah began fawzi her parents live in nablus in the occupied territory she herself comes from the bourj el barajneh camp in beirut she is years old she left the occupied territory seven years ago to join the popular democratic front all this she has told us no one looked at fawzi every eye in the circle of recruits was fixed on the still body of the woman lying at fawzis feet also she has told us that for two years she has been an agent of the zionist enemy abu hamid heard the anger growl from his recruits he heard the sucked breath he saw the smile sweeping fawzis face he wondered if the woman heard her denunciation she has told us that she is a spy abu hamid had gone after the evacuation from beirut to the port of aden the capital city of the peoples republic of south yemen he and friends had once gone in a fishing boat out to sea beyond the sight of land and they had tossed over the side a sack of offal and entrails and when the sharks had closed on the bloodsoaked meat they had fired at them with their automatic rifles for sport he could remember the surging interest the relentless approach of the sharks to the meat and the blood and the skin the woman was the meat that she was a spy for israel was the blood scenting the water the recruits were the sharks of the scarletstreaming red sea from her own mouth she is an agent of the shin bet she has taken the shekels of the israeli security service she has betrayed her name the name of her father and of her mother she has betrayed her own people the palestinian people she has betrayed you the fighters and defenders of the palestinian revolution the circle was closing tightening the growl had become a scream abu hamid looked from the face of the woman to the faces of the recruits eyes ablaze mouths cracked with hate fists clenched tight and shafting the air in fury he saw himself walking across the street in front of the oreanda hotel of yalta and discarding the light anorak that covered the kalashnikov he saw himself gazing at the features of the girl as she came through the door that was held open for her by the man who was his target he saw himself raising the extended shoulder stock to fit hard against his collar bone he saw himself squeezing the trigger of the kalashnikov he thought he was going to vomit he saw the girl flying back lifted from her feet flailing against the body of the target and then the target going down he had felt no rage he had not felt the tempest emotion of the recruits he thought the woman was beautiful even with the bruises and the burns he saw the dignity of her quietness her silence in pain she was arrested by the agents of the military eight days ago she has been interrogated she has made a full confession of her criminal betrayal she has been sentenced by a tribunal she is to die because he wanted to be sick because he thought the woman was beautiful because the target was bound tight and not free to walk through the glass doors of the oreanda hotel because there was not the adrenalin excitement of the escape from the streets of yalta he knew the squeal of weakness in his body abu hamid shouted we will kill the spy pig the shout was the hiding of his weakness the baying for blood boiled around the woman the shout of abu hamid for the right to slaughter her the shouts of the recruits for the right to participate in the letting of blood fawzi stood now over the top of the trussed woman his straddled legs were over her hips the woman showed no fear the woman was a clinging fascination to abu hamid why did she not beg because she endangered you it will be you that carry out the sentence of the tribunal why did she not spit at her tormentors why did she not shriek in fear remember this you are here under the protection of syria you are safeguarded by the vigilance of the syrian security service there is no safety for traitors in the beqaa traitors will be rooted out destroyed inch by inch stamped foot by stamped foot the circle was closing on the trussed woman abu hamid gazed into her face for a moment he saw a flicker of animation from her eyes he saw the curl of her lips she stared back at him if it had been himself if it had been abu hamid tied at the ankles handcuffed at the wrists waiting for the lynch death would he have been able to show no fear abu hamid understood the power of syria over the recruits of the popular front a spy had been brought for them to revile to massacre just as the syrians had provided the chickens for those samel recruits to despoil at the yarmouq camp the power on syria mocked them made scum of them the means of their learning was a bound and handcuffed woman she stared back at abu hamid at last he saw the contempt in her eyes the sneer at her mouth abu hamid wrenched back the cocking arm of his kalashnikov into the contempt and sneer of the womans face he fired a full magazine he raked the body of the woman long after the life had been blitzed from her the gunfire boom had died died with the life of a woman branded a spy the barrel of the rifle hung limp against his thigh and his knee the body was a mess of blood and cloth and flesh the circle had grown had widened the recruits had seen the trance in which abu hamid had fired none had felt safe to stand close to the shooting he saw the tremble at fawzis jaw he walked away he left the circle and the syrian and the body of the woman he walked to the wire coil at the perimeter down the unmade track leaning on the bonnet of the second jeep was major said hazan major said hazan was clapping the palms of his hands applauding abu hamid turned away he walked to the far side of the camp the moment before he was lost behind a wall of tent canvas he looked back to where he had shot the woman he saw the bouncing shoulders and the leaping heads and he knew that the recruits danced on the bloody corpse of the woman who had been a spy for israel he went behind the tents and vomited until his stomach was empty until his throat burned he wiped his lips with the back of his hand then he went through the camp entrance gap and down the track he gasped the question to major said hazan why was she here the israelis always want to know what is the situation in the beqaa why my camp why the camp where i am chance nothing more than chance was she searching for me you should not acquire for yourself too great an importance you are as a flea on a dogs neck your bite has been felt but you cannot be found the voice of major said hazan steeled why did you not permit your young men to execute the spy it is my role to lead to lead by example abu hamid said a fine answer in a few days you will be brought to damascus he saw the smooth skin of major said hazans face wrinkle in the attempted warmth of a smile why did you choose me for yalta major i knew of you what did you know had you ever killed hamid before yalta he blurted i fought at bent jbail in i was young then i fought in i was at tyre and then at sidon and then at damour and then at beirut city many times answer the question i asked i have fought many times the question is so very simple had you ever killed abu hamid i have fought the israeli of course i have killed the israeli the calming voice the voice of endless patience had you looked into a mans eyes a man who is alive looked into his eyes and then killed him tell me abu hamid he could not control his stammer when you are fighting the israeli you cannot stand about look for a target it is necessary to use a great volume of fire into his eyes and then killed him if you are that close to the israeli you are dead seen the fear in his eyes because he has the certainty you will kill him once abu hamid whispered recall it for me the words in a rush a torrent flow when we had left beirut after we had evacuated we went to south yemen we were allowed to take out only one small bag and our rifle the great men of the arab world let us be humiliated after we had fought with sacrifice the battle of the whole arab world in south yemen an encouragement not a rebuke we were in a tent camp i had a transistor radio and one day my radio was taken i found the thief i went into his tent he was playing a cassette tape on my radio first he laughed at me i waited until he was crying yes until he was certain and then i shot him his hand was taken gripped between the stumps and the thumb he closed his eyes he felt the brush of the silk skin across his face he felt lips that had no moisture kiss his cheek i had heard of it it was why i chose you for a long time he watched the dust cloud spurting up from the back wheels of the jeep as it drove away the merchant had been through two road blocks of the syrian army he travelled the route every monday and saturday from beirut and returned by the same road to the capital every tuesday and sunday he was wellliked by the commando sentries the main trade of the merchant was in small electrical components anything from light bulbs and plugs to drums of flex wire to parts for the small generators that provided much of the power in those areas of the beqaa that were off the two main roads and distant from the main supply the merchant always offered the soldiers insignificant gifts crates of soft drinks throwaway lighters beside the windblown weatherblasted and cardboardmounted photograph of the sternfaced president of the syrian arab republic at the road blocks he had made his small talk offered his passes for cursory inspection and been waved on he was lighter in his load by two cartons of camel cigarettes the merchant drove south taking the straight main road the eastern side of the beqaa his car was a mercedes eleven years old and with kilometres on the clock the back seat had been torn out to provide him with additional carrying space for his wares he always drove slowly and would tell the sentries at the road blocks that he thought his motor was on the last legs and close to collapse he always made a joke of it the snail speed of the laden rustcoated mercedes was a familiar source of amusement by travelling slowly the merchant observed so much more he was south of the village of haouch el harime he was north of the small town of ghazze he slowed the car drove off the tarmac and came to stop on the hard shoulder he walked from his car to a small clump of olive trees he pulled down the zip of his trousers while he urinated he had the time to check that the old upturned bucket beside the tree in front of him had not been moved since the previous time that he had checked there was no need for him to check the hidden space under the bucket if the bucket had not been moved then no message had been left he shuddered if any man had watched him from a distance with the aid of binoculars they would have thought that he merely finished by shaking clear the remnant droplets he shuddered in sadness and in fear the merchant had known since his last journey back from the beqaa to beirut that an agent had been held the conversations at the road blocks had given him the bare information the unmoved bucket told him which agent had been taken the spy would not know the identity he assumed but the spy could have revealed the location of the dead letter box under interrogation he turned if any man watched him through the magnification of binoculars he would have seen the merchant pull back up the zip of his fly before shambling back to the mercedes he would not again break his journey by the clump of greening olive trees the merchant drove on through ghazze and took the winding road south of joub jannine that climbed the jabal aarbi hills until he came to the village of baaloul at the village he was welcomed like a hero because he brought a new magneto for the petrol driven pump of the communitys drinking well in the morning after talking late with the villagers after sleeping in the concrete block house of the head man he would go south again he would drop his own message beyond the town of qaraaoun and then swing first west and then north for his return to beirut the merchant was a man of middle age grossly overweight a man of moroccan origin and of the jewish faith a citizen of the state of israel and in the employ of the mossad in the house of the head man of the shia village of baaloul the merchant had slept poorly his mind could not escape from the vision of a tortured colleague of the fate of a captured agent major zvi dan said we cannot confirm that the recruits are at the camp nor that they are under the command of abu hamid you didnt tell me that you were trying to confirm it tork said we were trying to but sadly we did not succeed we had an agent in that region but the agent has been taken major zvi dan sighed as if this were a matter of personal grief you had someone in that camp we had an agent in the area thats insanity you may have alerted them blown the whole show we committed a valued trusted agent now lost dont shout at me s h i t you may have blown it zvi wrong the information requirements given to the agent were vague and covered various areas whatever those pigs beat out of her will not identify our target her you sent in a woman major zvi dan slammed his fist onto his desk spare me your british chivalry crap we are at war we use what we have old men women children what we have you miss the point the point being my friend you may make all your preparations you may crane may and the boy may walk into the beqaa take up a sniping position above the camp and find that your target isnt there perhaps never was there that is what i tried to save you that chance im sorry the station officer said softly for what that you lost your agent friend do not be sorry for me be sorry for her a human being taken by animals i will have lost a skirmish she will lose her life maybe already has london will be grateful the station officer said softly thatll be nice major zvi dan said but i dont want their gratitude what i want is that your people will very seriously weigh the risks before it is too late tell them so that they understand about real war im better than i was the sweat soaked into his tracksuit top cant you admit im improving your situps are average your pushups are average your squatthrusts are average and all the time youre yapping youre losing strength crane said youre still a passenger holt so work im fit and you havent the decency to admit it is that right too damn right youve such a bloody ego on your shoulders that you cant admit that im fit to walk with you i know your sort crane youre the sort that hasnt the bigness to admit that ive done well done well have you crane smiled grimly holt gazed up at the wall of the house he saw mrs fergusons face at the upper window she was always there when he was performing his morning exercise ritual when he went for his shower she would go down to the kitchen the start of every day i tell you what i think i think im a bloody sight fitter than you are christ that was stupid im sorry he said sagging back on the damp slabs wait there crane snapped the instruction he strode away into the house holt lay on his back the sweat was cooling on his skin his anger cooled too but he knew what had scratched him planning and logistics were between percy martins and crane they huddled in front of the living room fire they pored over the maps and over the inven tory of required equipment and over the aerial photographs never was holt asked for his opinion he was the bloody passenger he had not even been shown the aerial photographs of the camp he had not been lectured on the beqaa what he would find there he had not been told how they would go in he had most certainly not been told how they would get out george was standing a few yards from holt and watching him he had a sly smile as if there were some sport to be had the dog was sitting beside george quiet for once interested martins had followed george out of the house he was sniffing at the air as if that would tell him whether it would rain this day neither george nor martins had the time of day for holt something they thought bloody clever was being cooked holt stood he rocked his legs felt weak of course he was weak he had done the circuit of the situps pushups squatthrusts he had done the triple sprint he had done the endurance run he breathed deep he pulled the oxygen back into his body down into his lungs deep into his blood stream crane came through the french windows out onto the patio he carried an old rucksack and a set of bathroom scales he put the scales down and walked into the garden george was laughing quietly martins had the look of a headmaster who has to punish a boy caught smoking this hurts me more than it will you crane was in the rockery tugging loose the stones crane loaded stones into his rucksack when he had brought it to the scales holt saw that it weighed five and a half stones lbs crane swept the rucksack onto his shoulders you say that you are fitter than i am when we are in the beqaa this is what i carry and you will carry the same now we shall go six times round the lawn the endurance but you wont have the weight and i shall beat you i already apologised i dont hear you crane growled holt led the first time round he tried to run easily loosely he tried to save himself past the decaying summer house past the bare beech tree past the rose beds past the rhododendron jungle past the straggling holly hedge past the patio where george was smiling where martins was still looking pained all the time the pounding feet of crane behind him the second time round holt led the third time round holt led the third time round hurt him because he tried to increase his speed ten years since he had run competitively school sports and even then he hadnt cared for it stepping up the stride trying to break crane trying to open the gap legs hurting guts hurting lungs hurting and all the time the stamping tread of the man behind him and the bastard carried lbs weight on his back the fourth time round holt led as though they were held together by elastic when holt lengthened his stride crane stayed with him when holt slowed then crane stayed back the fourth time round and holt understood he was a plaything the fifth time round holt led his own breath coming in hurt surges his legs leaden his head rolling crane was behind him struggling more now but in touch no chance now of holt running him out survival was the game survival was keeping going survival was pride he could not win he knew the bastard would take him on the last circuit janes face was in his mind janes face back in his mind after being gone absent for days jane darling lovely jane jane whose body he had known jane who was going to share his life jane who was watching him jane who was now safe he was screaming why did you have to stand in front of the old fool couldnt hear his own voice could only hear the beat of cranes feet and the wheeze of his breath the sixth time round holt led he led at first he led past the summer house he led past the beech tree he led past the rose beds but crane was at his shoulder he led past the rhododendrons but crane was beside him only fractionally behind he saw cranes face he knew he had lost when he turned his jerking head to see the composure of cranes face past the holly hedge and he was following crane home his legs were jelly when he reached the patio crane was already unslinging the rucksack he lay on the grass beaten put those stones back where i found them crane said then go take a shower the dog was licking his face large and gentle strokes of the dogs tongue the patio was empty crane and martins and the grinning george had left young holt to his self pity to his picture of his girl he retched he had nothing to lose it was raining at first he could not lift the rucksack he crawled to the rockery dragging the dead weight behind him with the dog nuzzling at his ears he tipped the stones out of the rucksack onto the wild strawberry strands the dog followed him inside and he didnt care that the dog with muddied feet was not allowed in the house didnt give a damn holt stood at the door of the dining room martins and crane sat at a table at the far end of th room crane was wiping the perspiration from his neck with his napkin his voice was a stammer the weakness of it betraye him why mr crane why was that necessary so you get to understand my meaning of fitness what happens if i am not fit on the way in you slow me down because i have to travel at your speed on the way out if you are not fit i ditch you and if i ditch you youre dead or youre captured if youre captured youll wish you were dead martins said youre making a fool of yourself holt im not your son mister martins dont talk to me as if i were your poor bloody son watch your mouth and remember that i was a field operative for the service before you were born i wont get another show like this im going to make damn certain this one works so get a grip on yourself she was your girl and you never heard me say it would be a picnic and get that bloody dog out of here it was a miserable drive for holt he was relegated to the front seat with george at the wheel and taciturn martins and crane were in the back of the old volvo and behind them separated by stout wire mesh was the rottweiler george was disgruntled because martins had told him that the state of the car was a disgrace and had refused to leave until the sides had been hosed down and the floor mats shaken out and the ashtrays emptied martins was deep in his papers and crane slept beside him with the ease of a man who catches his rest where whenever he can find it george drove well as though it was the only thing he was good at and he concentrated on the road ahead holt was on his own again but then for eleven days he had effectively been on his own and he had given up the struggle to be party to the planning of the operation he could cope he was good at being alone had been since childhood childhood in a country general practitioners home with mum doubling as receptionistsecretary and nurse had dictated that there were long times during the school holidays when he was left to his own devices being alone was not being lonely not in holts book being alone being able to live in a personal capsule was fine by holt noah crane was another loner holt thought they should have had a rapport except that crane was too damned good at being alone to share even a common purpose it had been good last night in the drawing room after another awful mrs ferguson supper when martins had launched into a sermon about the long arm of vengeance and the moral evil of terrorism about those who have deeper convictions stronger wills greater determination will surely triumph about the satisfaction of going the other side of the hill to strike with a mailed fist high grade crap and crane had shown what he thought of it he closed his eyes and fell asleep they should have been friends young holt and old noah crane that they were not friends was a pity nothing more and hed get there sooner or later if it killed him he knew they were going to an army camp he didnt know more because he hadnt been told and by now he had stopped asking for a change it was a crisp and clean morning bright and fine a good morning for a walk on the wilderness wildness of exmoor even a good morning for sitting next to george who spoke not a word and sucked peppermints they went west across salisbury plain past the ancient hulks of stonehenge across the great open spaces that were crisscrossed with lank tracks past small stone villages with neat pubs and norman churches the first time in eleven days he had been away from the crumbling damp pile and the overgrown garden that was encircled by the ten foot high chainlink fence set along concrete posts thank god for it being away they came to the small bustling town of warminster and they followed the red painted signs towards the military camp they were checked at the gatehouse they were saluted as they drove through holt didnt turn to see but he fancied from the rustle of movement behind him that martins would have given the sentry an imperial wave of acknowledgement they pulled up outside a square red brick building they were escorted to an upper room that was filled with the warm smell of fresh coffee all except george they were in the military world friendly handshakes warm greetings there was a long heavy box on the floor half pushed under the table from which the coffee and biscuits were served the cups and saucers were back on the table three officers in smart pressed uniforms and polished boots and martins in a tweed suit and holt wearing his sports jacket and crane in the same trousers and the same poplin anorak that he had worn since he had arrived ready for business how many marksmen just one martins said mr crane is the marksman holt thought the soldiers had assumed that he holt was the marksman surprised they stared at crane another day that crane had not bothered to shave what weapon are you familiar with mr crane more weapons than youve handled crane said indifferent holt saw the glint in the officers eyes i see let me put it another way what sniper weapon are you most familiar with mr crane galil mm semiautomatic we think ours is better i dont need a sales pitch im using yours because thats what ive been told to use holt chuckled out loud involuntarily couldnt help himself then bit his lip to silence he wondered if the man had been born to whom crane could be civil martins said its a british show british equipment will be used holt reckoned he had the drift british equipment to be used and no one too sorry if after a successful snipe the british equipment could be left behind british ammunition cases a calling card for the syrians the case on the floor was pulled clear of the table holt saw the rifle lying on its side in a cutout bed of foam rubber the rifle was painted in green and brown shades of camouflage he saw the telescope sights snug in their own compartments for the officer it was a labour of love it is the parkerhale m bolt action detachable box magazine militarised bipod with provision for either swivel or cant adjustment it will travel with a x daylight scope sight and also the passive night vision job we reckon it in the right hands to have a hundred percent success ratio at a first shot hit at anything under yards but the rear aperture sight has the capability of up to yards whats the weight with one magazine full and the telescopic sight it comes out at a few ounces under fourteen pounds going far is it not your concern martins said far enough for the weight to matter crane said you want to fire it prefer to fire it than have lunch then youll want some kit right and i want kit for him crane jerked his thumb at holt then turned to him go and have the best shit and the best piss youve had all week and get back here smartish holt would have been gone ten minutes he came back into the room crane already wore camouflage battledress and his clothes were in a neat folded pile on the edge of the table crane tossed a tunic and trousers to holt pointed to a pair of boots and a pair of heavy khaki socks they walked for half an hour till they reached a place that satisfied crane out of the camp away up on the plain beyond the red flag flying a warning of live shooting they settled into beatendown bracken crane said that holt wasnt to talk wasnt to move hundreds of yards ahead of them across a shallow valley of young trees holt could just make out the barricade of sandbags and in front of it the humanshaped target five hours and thirtyfive minutes after they had taken their positions holt lying half a body length behind crane and a yard to his right the marksman fired one shot no word no warning that he was about to shoot holts legs were dead his bladder was full his mind was numbed they lay in the bracken a full ten minutes after the single shot then crane stood and walked away with the rifle on his shoulder like he had been out after wood pigeon or wild duck holt stumbled after him bent to massage the circulation back into his legs crane had his head down was walking into the wind the way you fidgeted we wouldnt have lasted an hour for gods sake i hardly moved tiardly isnt good enough not in the beqaa they were picked up by a waiting land rover and driven back into the camp by the time that holt and crane had peeled off their battledress the humanshaped target had been carried into the room holt saw the single bullet hole the hole was central upper chest a group formed two of the officers and crane and martins with an inventory sheet ticking off a list the talk was in a jargon shorthand which holt did not understand as he dressed he found that his eyes always strayed back to the single hole on the target a single killing shot god he could hardly tie his shoe laces and he was making a mess of knotting his tie he had his shirt buttons out of kilter as if at last it were serious as if every other thing since the steps of the oreanda hotel had been a cartoon for a comic paper grown men discussing in low voices the grained weight of specific bullets and the holding capacity of a bergen and night walking speeds and the quantity of compo rations required grown men talking through the logistics of a killing snipe that was bloody serious young holt the third officer stood beside him we let you loose for an hour then we went onto the hilltop above and had a look for you how far were you apart why we saw you pretty quick we never saw him was he far away pretty far holt lied it was a hell of a shot yards incredible you know in one week in belfast i once had seven hits all between and but i knew the weapon always used the same one i tell you to get a perfect hit with the first shot with a new weapon unbelievable perhaps he just likes killing people holt said dont we all my sweat is that all i get to blow away these days is pheasants i envy you i envy him more then youre out of your mind just trying to make conversation the officer smiled across the room the murmur of voices was uninterrupted holt caught occasional phrases descriptions something called a riflemans assault weapon something about low daynight signature something about standoff demolition something about minimal training something about a riflemans assault weapon being right for young holt but crane shook his head didnt look at holt just indicated that he wanted none of that for holt holts hands flickered uselessly at his tie the officer knelt in front of him and without fuss tied holts shoelaces youre fortunate to be with him marksmen are a rare breed they tend to survive wherever youre going whatever the opposition theyll regret that guy ever turned up good luck mr crane doesnt trust luck i hope you win im scared out of my mind the officer looked embarrassed finished with the shoelaces stood and smiled awkwardly when they went down the stairs out to the volvo george was holding the rottweiler back from the opened hatch of the car and three private soldiers under the supervision of the quartermaster sergeant were loading equipment wooden and cardboard boxes and two bergens when they had finished george had to rummage in the load to make a space for his dog martins signed three sheets on the quartermasters clipboard the officers waved them away waved to them until they were round the corner gone from sight out onto the main road george driving fast the dog snoring again youre off tomorrow holt martins said he didnt ask whether he could telephone his parents when he was back at the house tell them hed be away for a few days he didnt even ask what was a riflemans assault weapon and why it needed minimal training and why it was not right for young holt he thought about a young man from the far side of the world a young man of his own age a young man with a crows foot scar on his left upper cheek they drove in silence it was evening when they reached the house george was left to park the car unload the equipment exercise the dog martins hurried to the telephone crane said he was going to have a shower it was as if everybody had too much work on their hands to concern themselves with young holt so scared he could scream and starting the journey for the beqaa the next day everyone too busy holt sat in the living room turned the pages of a magazine didnt read the text didnt register the photographs he heard martins stamp into the room its too damned bad she is becoming quite impossi b l e he didnt take the cue didnt ask what was bad who was impossible too bitter to be feed man for percy marlinss little act she is cooking for a dinner in the village hall not for us we come second to the village hall social evening sometimes that woman goes too far i fancy a night out holt said a cabaret at the village hall thats a poor joke holt its all a pisspoor joke mr martins i fancy a night out now wait a minute alone dont worry mr martins i wont run away you can tell the horrible people who run you that young holt says youve done a hell of a good job in trapping him dont you understand its for your country he had drunk seven pints of best bitter he had drunk three whisky shorts he stood on the stage the comedian was long away the magician had packed and gone there was an untouched pint and another whisky on top of the piano the clock on the square tower of the village church that was across the road from the hall chimed the strokes of midnight he had given them his whole repertoire he had led them in his south pacific selection his presley impression his jim reeves collection he had them going with his choruses he had them clapping to the hammer thump of the pale young rector on the piano beside him he rocked on his feet his face was flushed he could hear the shouting and the cheering from the audience he understood his audience it was an audience that he recognised from his village at home they were the farm workers and their wives and the post office staff and their wives and the council workers and their wives and the builders and joiners and their wives because he had drunk too much he had pushed his way forward and climbed the steps to the stage after the magician had taken his bow he had offered himself when he had thought the evening was flattening out give us one more young un the shout from the back from the darkness beyond the footlights and the smoke haze the rector shrugged holt whispered in his ear holt sang wish me luck as you wave me goodbye with a cheer not a tear make it gay give me a smile i can keep all the while in my heart while im away till we meet once again you and i wish me luck as you wave me goodbye how many of them knew where the beqaa valley was how many of them had any idea what the popular front for the liberation of palestine was they joined in for the chorus wish me luck as you wave me goodbye cheerio here i go on my way wish me luck as you wave me goodbye holt was not aware of the spreading quiet his song his voice filled his head a young man saying his farewells heading for the beqaa with a marksman who could kill with a stateoftheart rifle at yards a young man who had been told he was going to the beqaa to have a man killed for his country did any of them care small safe people living small safe lives in a small safe community a lone voice and a piano desperate for tuning echoing through a tinroofed village hall in the english countryside wish me luck as you wave me goodbye wish me luck wish me luck wish me luck as the morning sun brilliant bright hugged the rim of the valley the jeep pulled away from the camp no heat yet in the air and abu hamid was cold in the passenger seat he did not know for how long he would be in damascus he had not been told he knew only that he was escaping from the camp and the firing range in the wadi cut into the hillside and that along with the possibility that he would have the chance to be with margarethe was sufficient to lift his spirits while they still crawled over the ruts and stone chips of the unsurfaced road he saw the cluster of dogs he knew at once he should have stood over them when they dug the grave slowly they passed the dogs there were six seven of them perhaps more there was no window on the side of the jeep he heard the snarling selfish anger of the dogs the dogs were pulling snapping tugging at the darkstained bundle beside him the driver grinned they drove on the fighting dogs were left in the dust thrown up by the wheels of the jeep they crossed the valley they were waved through the checkpoints they reached the fast tarmacadamed road to damascus what the wandering lawrence called a pearl in the morning sun is a vast archaeological treasure ground it is also the oldest continually inhabited city in the world the present population numbering are the successors of those who first settled south of the jebel esh sharoi east of the jebel khachine five thousand years ago damascus has seen the worship of pagan gods and of the roman jupiter damascus was the settling place of st paul and the budding spirit of christianity it was the centre of the world of islam it was a great city of the ottoman despots it was a fiefdom of european france now it is a bastard mixture of cultures on the broad frenchstyle boulevards of damascus walk the covert fundamentalists of the moslem faith discreet and quietliving jews sunnis ruling alawites from the northern coastline soviets from the east eyecatching prostitutes aping what they believe is the western way of provocation the regime which is bankrupt and sustained by loans from the oil rich gulf is headed by a man whose air force career was undistinguished who had levered himself to defence minister in time for the catastrophic defeat at the hands of israel in who had then climbed to president in time for the greater military disaster of yom kippur the regime lives on a foundation of terror and repression there are eight separate organisations responsible for internal and external security the security men are the new masters of modern damascus they and their regime are without mercy orders are issued for public hangings on the portable gallows in semiramis square orders for supporters of the muslim brotherhood to be brought by the lorry load to the centre of aleppo and executed by firing squad orders for islamic fundamentalists to be taken from the tadmor prison in palmyra to a trench dug by bulldozers and there to be buried alive orders sent to hama after the suppression of revolt for the killing of males over the age of ten orders for torture orders for murder mercy is a stranger in damascus today perhaps it was always so he knew enough of the geography of damascus to know that they had entered the southern district of abu rummaneh he was being taken to the air ministry complex they were approaching the avenue el mahdy the driver said nothing abu hamid was familiar enough with men such as his driver a palestinian learned in damascus that he could expect no warmth from a syrian not unless he had favours to offer he had never before been to the air ministry complex sprawling five storeys high he had had no reason to close to the air ministry abu hamid saw the secur ity presence on the pavements young men in street clothes lounged under the trees leant on the lamp posts sauntered beside the road all the young men carried kalashnikov rifles when he had first lived in damascus he had heard the rumours even out at the yarmouq camp he had heard the explosions in the night of roadside bombs detonated against six army lorries in different locations and so the rumours said had been killed a car bomb in the city centre and killed he understood why the security men lounged on the street corners leant against the lamp posts sauntered on the pavements there was a concrete chicane pass inside the gates of the air ministry abu hamid was dropped off in front of the gate he still had his leg in the jeep when the driver gunned the engine bastard he hopped clear he endured the suspicion of the sentries shining helmets immaculate uniforms he felt unclean from the dust of the beqaa he could smile as he was bodysearched if there were a car bomb at the air ministry then it would be the supercilious sentries at the gate that would catch the flying axles and radiator and gear housing he was escorted inside it had taken twentyfive minutes to establish that he was expected a new experience for abu hamid walking the scrubbed airy painted corridors and staircases of the air ministry the first time he had ever stepped inside such a place a new world to him at the end of a long corridor was a gate of steel bars guarded the gate was opened he was taken through the gate clanged shut behind him into an inner sanctum he could shiver he could wonder what was wanted of him a door subserviently knocked by his escort a uniformed clerk greeted abu hamid ushered him inside crossed to a door beyond a huge desk knocked a shout the space of the room emerged in front of him in all the years of his young life abu hamid had never seen such luxury he stared around him his eyes roved from the whispering hush of the air conditioning machine in the wall to the heavyweight softness of the leather sofa to the teak table to the sparkle of the decanter and glasses to the fitted pile carpet to the hifi cabinet to the dull true silver of the photograph frames could not help himself a child in a glittering treasure land he saw the welcome smile of major said hazan the major was far back in a tilted chair his polished shoes on the polished desk top the major was waving him inside waving with his stumped fist for him to cross the carpet pile in his dustladen boots abu hamid knew the man who sprawled in the depths of the sofa he knew the man only by a given code name he knew that the man was designated as the head of the military wing of the popular front he knew that the man was believed to be at least number three and possibly number two in the command ranking of the popular front he knew that the man had once himself opened a package sent from stockholm to the offices of the popular front in beirut that was many years before but many years did not restore a right arm taken off at the elbow nor three fingers amputated from the left fist nor smooth away the wounds of the shrapnel in his neck and jaw of course you know our brother you are welcome hamid i hear good things of what you are achieving with the young fighters i hear only good things of you he stared at them both in turn these veterans of the war against the state of israel and the scars of their war a ruined face a lost arm and a lost grip of fingers was that how he would end a face that his margarethe would shrink from hands that could not caress the white smooth skin of his margarethe come hamid sit down the door was closed behind him he sat on the edge of the sofa he felt the leather sink under him i have sad news for you hamid your commander in simferopol has gone to a martyrs resting place but he died in his uniform his life was lost in the service of palestine a car accident most sad we all grieve for his passing no expression was possible on the unlined skin of the majors face abu hamid saw no change in the eyes or at the mouth of the brother the understanding came as a fast shaft the commander and abu hamid and major said hazan had been the only persons directly involved in the shooting at yalta three persons now two persons i want two men hamid i want two of your best recruits abu hamid looked across the width of the sofa to the brother their eyes did not meet again he understood they were the proxies the palestinians he was learning sharply quickly what skills would the two men have abu hamids recruits were raw not yet expert in weapons or explosives courage commitment they will join others you will go back to the beqaa this morning you will choose the two men you will take them to the yarmouq tomorrow what is it hamid i can see your impatience anger is it or passion is it tomorrow hamid you will have the time to attend to your lady today the revolution has need of you your best men remember it will be done major holt had a sore head he walked half a pace behind martins and crane it was a part of the airport that was new to him he hadnt been to israel before nor had he been to south africa so he had never come this way it was the airport highsecurity corridor quarantined from ordinary flight passengers reserved for the two flights thought to be most greatly at risk from terrorist attack he had seen it on television of course but the sight of the police and the dogs and the heckler and koch machine pistols still startled him policemen patrolling and parading in front of him with attack dogs on short leashes with machine pistols held in readiness across their chests he wondered how long they would have how many fragments of seconds in which to beat off an attack he wondered how long it would take them to snap out of the musak swimming calm of the corridor how long to get the safety to off to get the finger from the guard to the trigger he wondered how they slept at night how they rested relaxed with their kids and if he found the man in the beqaa and crane shot him would that make their lives easier they settled into the chairs of the departure lounge the same departure lounge in which months before an alert el al security man carrying out the final personal baggage checks had been suspicious of a bag carried by a yearold irishwoman anne murphy when the security man emptied the bag he believed it still too heavy when he stripped up the bottom of the bag he found underneath three pounds of oily soft orangecoloured plastic explosive manufactured in czechoslovakia the potential of the explosive was equivalent to the simultaneous detonation of handgrenades the explosive the timer and the detonator had been supplied to a plumpfaced jordanian called nezar hindawi by senior officers of syrian air force intelligence it was intended that the pregnant miss murphy would be blown out of the sky along with all the passengers and crew that the disintegrating aircraft would crash in the mountains of austria that all evidence of guilt should be destroyed holts mind was dead to his surroundings his head ached from the excess of alcohol that he had consumed the night before but sitting in that same departure lounge should have made him think of those events in reprisal the government of the united kingdom had broken diplomatic relations with the syrian arab republic sir sylvester armitage had gone into the folklore of foreign and commonwealth with his booming bloody nonsense sir sylvester armitage had been targeted and miss jane canning had walked in front of him onto the steps of the oreanda hotel in yalta the beginning of this story was in this departure lounge leading to gate of terminal one months before holt sat with his chin on his chest and the throb in his temples crane sat and slept percy martins sat and pondered the final elusive clues of the days crossword a little before am in a deep grey dawn haze a british airways tristar slammed down onto the tyrescarred runway of the international airport east of tel aviv it was just days since a trio of british diplomats had boarded an aircraft at moscows vnukovo airport for a flight to the crimea in the same jeep with the same silent driver abu hamid escorted his two chosen recruits to the yarmouq camp both were years old all of the way back from damascus the previous day he had considered which of his sixty he should proposition mohammed was the most obvious choice because he was always the loudest to complain at the boredom of the training to harangue his fellow recruits of time wasted when they should have been carrying the war into the zionist state he would eat chew choke on his words the second ibrahim had been brought to abu hamids notice by the murmured accusation that he was a thief that he pilfered the paltry possessions of his fellow recruits well he could thieve to his content in the state of israel the choice had been made by abu hamid alone he had found fawzi gone when he had returned to the camp gone smuggling the bastard gone to organise the early summer cropping of the hashish fields to gather his cut from the merchants who traded in transistor radios and western liquor and fruit and vegetables out of the beqaa he had seen both men separately in his tent he had spoken to them of the glory of the struggle against israel and of the love of the palestinian people for the heroism of their fighters and of the money they would be paid when they returned both men separately had agreed easier for abu hamid than he could have dared expect the exhortation and the bribe good bedfellows working well together he had wondered if they were frightened if they dreamed of death he wondered if the one guessed that he had been chosen because he had made a bastard nuisance of himself in the tent camp the other because he was whispered to be a thief abu hamid cared not at all what they knew the jeep was stopped at the entrances to the yarmouq camp the sentries radioed to administration for an officer to come abu hamid whistled quietly to himself he had the statistic in his head their chance was one in a one in chance of his seeing them again it was the brother who came to the gate abu hamid saw the loose empty sleeve of the brothers jacket he told the brother the names of the two men that he had brought he watched as the brother peered inside the jeep at the two men weighing them the brother gave abu hamid two sealed envelopes then politely asked mohammed who was the boaster and ibrahim who was the thief to come with him he watched them go he watched the barrier lift for them fall after them he saw the camp swallow them he tore open the first envelope the form carried the heading of the central bank of syria it told him the number of an account in which the sum of american dollars had been lodged in his name his chortling laughter filled the front of the jeep abu hamid owned nothing he had no money no things even that were his own he felt his chest his lungs expand with the excitement his head sing he ripped open the second envelope a single sheet of paper a handwritten address he pushed the form of the central bank of syria into the breast pocket of his tunic and buttoned it down he thrust the address into the drivers face the driver shrugged started the engine turned the wheel when abu hamid looked back at the gate he could no longer see the backs of the brother or of mohammed and ibrahim he was driven into the centre of damascus the jeep driver seemed to pay no attention to traffic lights at stop or to pedestrian crossings away from the wide streets into the warren alleys of the old city past the great mosque past the colonnade of the roman builders past the marble christian shrine to john the baptist through the narrow roads weaving amongst the cymbal clashing sherbet sellers past the stalls of spices and intricate worked jewellery past the tables of the money changers past the dark recesses of the cafes inside the vast sprawl of the souq al hamadieh only military vehicles were allowed inside the tentacles of the souq lanes and only a military vehicle would have had the authority to force a way through the slow shuffling morass of shoppers traders he supposed he could have bought a street he thought he could have cleared a table of jewellery a shop window of stereo equipment a clothing store of suits he had in his tunic breast pocket a bank order form from the central bank of syria for ooo american dollars he could have bought flowers for margarethe champagne for margarethe he could take her to restaurants the best and order a feast of mezza and the burgol dish of sweet boiled crushed wheat and the yalanji dish of aubergines stuffed with rice and the sambosik dish of meat rissole in light pastry and unleavened bread and as much arrack as they could drink before they fell he could buy her what she wanted he could buy himself what he wanted he had been paid for the success at the oreanda in yalta the driver stopped he pointed he pointed down an alley too narrow for the vehicle he wrote on the paper beside the address a telephone number to call for transport back into the beqaa abu hamid ran shouldering pushing shoving his way through the throng he saw the opened door the stone steps he ran up the steps the wooden door faced him the handle turned the door swung well done sweet boy well done for finding me his margarethe in front of him her fair hair flopped to her shoulders her body sheathed in a dress of rich winecoloured brocade his margarethe standing in the heart of a quiet oasis in a room of cool air standing in the centre of a faded deep sinking carpet standing surrounded by hanging dark drapes and the heavy wood furniture intricately carved he thought it was the paradise that the old man of the mountains had spoken of the paradise of the assassins wasnt i good to find it wasnt i good to find such a place for us no questions in his mind no asking himself how a foreigner with only the handout crumbs from the table of the regime could find paradise quiet clean comfort amongst the alleys of the souq he was kissing her feeling the warm moisture of her lips scenting the hot skin of her neck clutching the gentle curves of her buttocks then her breasts the news was bursting in him he stood away from her he beamed in pride he pulled the form from the central bank of syria from his pocket a piece of paper read the paper he saw the moment of confusion then the spread of concentration then the drift of disbelief for what i t i s f i v e thousand dollars f o r m e for what for what i have done its a joke yes what have you done not a joke it is real it is for me it is the paper of the central bank of syria you have not done anything sweet boy you are a revolutionary soldier why is this given to you abu hamid stood his full height he looked up into the eyeline of margarethe schultz he said sternly for what i have done this is the reward of the syrian government she blinked she did not understand you have done nothing you came to syria you lived in a camp you went to the crimea you were one of many you came back now you are in a camp in lebanon what in that history is worth five thousand dollars it is payment for what i have done for the syrians sweet boy you are a fighter of the palestine revolution not an errand kid of the syrians you insult me i am not an errand kid hamid what did you do for the syrians she was close to him she stroked the hair of his neck hamid what did you do i cannot damn you what did you do dont make what it came in a blurted torrent in the crimea i killed the ambassador of britain i killed also one of his aides for that they pay you for that they reward me she stood straight contemptuous he saw the heave of her breasts under the brocade of her dress which is more important to you the revolution for palestine or dollars earned as a hireling he said meekly i was going to buy things for you good things i fuck you sweet boy because i believe in you i have found a purity of revolution he handed her the bank order for five thousand american dollars he watched as she made a pencil thin spiral of it as she took from the table a box of matches as she lit the flame as she burned the wealth he could barely dream of you are not a hireling sweet boy in the purity of fire is the strength of the struggle of the palestinian people she lifted her dress pulled it higher ever higher she showed him the spindle of her ankles and her knees and the whiteness of her thighs and the darkness of her groin and the width of her belly and the operation scar and the weight of her breasts she was naked under her dress she threw the dress behind her she took him to her bed she took the clothes from his body kneeling over him dominating she straddled his waist when he had entered her he told her of the woman who had been a spy the woman he had shot as he told her of the killing she pounded over him squealing later when he rested on the bed when she had gone to the bathroom to sluice between her legs he would reflect what her ardour for the clean struggle the pure revolution had cost him abu hamid lay on his side on the bed if an arab girl had burned five thousand american dollars he would have killed her he worshipped this european could not understand her her love of his revolution but could worship her and she had waited for him he thought she was a dream of pleasure her soft voice in his ear will they hunt you who the english whose ambassador you killed the israelis whose spy you killed in damascus in the beqaa how can they you will not be for ever in the beqaa you will take the battle of the palestinian revolution into israel if he told her of his fear then he would lose her he would be the assassin dismissed from paradise he lied his courage i believe in the inevitability of victory she kissed his throat and the hairs of his chest with her tongue she circled the crows foot scar on his upper left cheek he was a good looking boy blond sunbleached hair a wind tanned face the uniform looked well on him he wore jauntily the skyblue beret of a soldier on united nations duty and his shoulder flash denoted that he was a private soldier of norbat he was hendrik olaffson he was years old he was a nothing member of the norwegian battalion serving with the united nations interim force in lebanon he had been eight months with norbat in the north eastern sector of the u n i f i l command intellectually he was a nothing person militarily he was a nothing person to major said hazan he was a jewel only to major said hazan was hendrik olaffson any different to the thousands of private soldiers making up the u n i f i l force from france ireland ghana fiji and nepal men stationed in a buffer zone separating southern lebanon from northern israel at the norbat checkpoint on the rachaiya to hasbaiya road it was usual for the u n i f i l troopers to talk to the travellers as they searched the cars for explosives and weapons the common language of conversation was english and it was unusual for the troopers to find a traveller who spoke english as well as they did themselves from a first conversation four months earlier had come the promise of a small quantity of treated marijuana enough for one joint each for hendrik olaffson and the two soldiers who shared the next night sentry duty with him the traveller was regularly on that road the conversations were frequent the marijuana became plentiful in due course major said hazan who received a report each two weeks from the traveller had learned of the political views of hendrik olaffson one quiet day at the road block the traveller had heard the gushed hatreds of hendrik olaffson the hatreds were for jews the hatreds went far back beyond the life of hendrik olaffson to the early life of his father the grandfather of hendrik olaffson had been on the personal staff of major vidkun quisling puppet ruler of norway during the years of german occupation in the last days as the wehrmacht had retreated the grandfather of hendrik olaffson had taken his own life shot himself spared a post war tribunal the job of sentencing him the father of hendrik olaffson had been brought up as a despised fatherless child in oslo and had died young consumptive and without the will to live many years ago too many years for any stigma to survive on hendrik olaffsons record but the boy burned with what he believed to be the injustice that ruined his family all this had been vouchsafed to the arab traveller at the road block he drove a threeton bedford lorry painted white marked with the sign of unifil he drove the lorry from the lebanese side of the security zone that was patrolled by the idf and their surrogates the christian south lebanese army through the zone and into israel a u n i f i l lorry was not searched he drove the lorry from the norbat area to collect soldiers from his countrys contingent who had been enjoying four days rest and recreation in tel aviv on the way south in darkness close to herzilya which was a northern suburb of the coastal city hendrik olaffson dropped off the two recruits who had been selected by abu hamid they had travelled in the back of the lorry hidden behind packing cases of course hendrik olaffson was a jewel to major said hazan the major believed he had found the crack in his enemys armour a crack he could exploit when they ran from the road into the night when they watched the disappearing tail lights of the white lorry it was ibrahim who led mohammed who held the strap of the grip bag your man isnt the great communicator our man hasnt much to say for himself theyre an odd pair of birds the station officer said major zvi dan shrugged whether they can talk to each other is hardly important what matters is whether they listen to each other what is critical is that they have respect for each other when i saw them at the hotel yesterday and the day before the impression i had is hardly one of respect our mans very quiet like hes out of his depth and doesnt know how to get into shallow water crane speaks to him like he would to a child respect is difficult when the one has so little to contribute the station officer glanced down at his watch this percy martins will be here soon hes a crochety old wretch the word from london is that he was damn near on bended knee to the director to get this trip hes bringing crane and your young man that pleasure must still await you cranes sent him to the beach for a week and told him hed kick his arse if he got sunburn mr fenner is not coming to grace your mission with his presence staying in london sadly the station officer did not expand did not feel the need to explore the grubby departmental laundry with his friend the girl soldier who did the typing and filing in the outer office put her head around the door dark flowing hair sallow skin tight khaki blouse the station officer wondered how elderly crippled zvi dan attracted such talent martins has arrived she said languidly holt lay on the beach there was a hotel towel over his legs draped up to the swimming trunks he had bought at the hotel shop he wore a shirt with the sleeves down he checked the time every half an hour so that he could be certain that he kept to the schedule noah crane had given him half an hour with his skin exposed lying on his back half an hour with his skin covered lying on his back half an hour with his skin exposed lying on his stomach half an hour with his skin covered lying on his stomach it was the third morning he was settling to the routine the first morning he had been allowed to stay put in his bed the last two mornings his alarm call had gone off beside his head at breakfast was tea toast out onto the beach a lone figure working at situps pushups and squat thrusts and then repeated sprints and then the endurance run however bad the endurance run had been on the soft grass of the country house it was hells times worse on the dry sand of the beach exposure to the sun all morning then a salad and cold meat lunch and then the repetition of the exercises in the full heat and then recovery on the beach a final repeat of the exercises as the sun was dipping after that the time was his own thats what crane had said so young holt had stayed the daylight hours on the beach in front of the row of tower block hotels but he had started to walk the streets of tel aviv in the evenings after he had showered the sand and the sweat off his body before he was due to attend dinner with crane and martins he thought tel aviv ugly and fascinating perhaps there had never been time at the country house for him to consider what he would find there but nothing about it was as he had expected he had walked the length of the seafront promenade past and beyond the hotels past and beyond the fortified american embassy past the scorched grass of clore park he had tramped to the old arab town of yafo he had walked down ben yehuda past the small jewellery shops and the shops that sold antique arab furniture he had walked back on dizengoff past the plasticfronted pavement cafes he thought it was a country of beautiful children and a country of olive green uniforms and draped galil and uzi weapons that the state was not yet years old was apparent to holt from the ramshackle development of building fast and unlovely construction dusty dry streets unmended pavings peeling plaster on the squat blocks of apartments he thought he understood why build for the future when your country is targeted by long range scud missiles when your country is nine ten eleven minutes flying time away from hostile air bases when your country is flanked by enemy armies equipped with the most modern of tanks artillery and helicopters when he worked at his exercises when he walked the streets then his mind was occupied when he lay on his back or his stomach on the beach when he lay on his bed after supper then his mind swam with the character of noah crane he hated to think of the man he had tried with eagerness with humour with achievement to break into the shell defence of noah crane god had he failed i find the attitude of the israeli defence force quite incredible percy martins said not incredible entirely logical zvi dan said quietly this ground was all covered in my report mr martins the station officer repeated soothingly it is most certainly not logical that the israeli defence force will offer no facilities for extracting crane and holt mr martins if we wished to make an incursion into the beqaa we would do so it is you who wish to do so there has to be a plan for the extraction of these two men in the event of difficulties they have to be able to call by radio for help israeli lives mr martins will not be put at risk for a mission that is not ours then i will go higher in the chain than you major dan of course you are free to do so but may i offer you a warning mr martins create too many waves and theres a possibility that the cooperation already offered you will be reduced but you must decide for yourself dammit man would you turn your back on them would you see them die out there percy martins took the handkerchief from the breast pocket of his suit jacket it did not seem strange to him that he wore a suit of light green tweed plus matching waistcoat with the room temperature close to degrees fahrenheit it was one of perhaps six more or less indistinguishable suits that he always wore winter and spring and summer and autumn except on sundays there was a watch chain across the buttons of the waistcoat given him by his mother after his fathers death and the timepiece was more than sixty years old and kept good time if it was wound each morning he mopped the perspiration from his forehead he disapproved of the designer safari suit in which tork was dressed and he disapproved more of the lack of support he was getting from his colleague his career in the service had been a lifetime of struggle his response to all obstacles was to lower his head and raise his voice there was not one colleague in century who could level against him the accusation of subtlety i have to believe mr martins that the hazards of a mission into the beqaa were fully evaluated the station officer saw percy martins blanche he saw the tongue flick across the lips we must have backup the station officer had been long enough away from century to recognise the signs he felt as if he had eavesdropped a conversation on the upper floor of century naturally the israelis would jump to the bidding of the men from the secret intelligence service take it for granted that the israelis would be grateful to help in every possible way i think that what the major is trying to say mr martins is i know bloody well what hes trying to say hes trying to say that two men would be left to rot because the israeli defence force is not prepared to get off its backside and help major zvi dan said mr martins allow me to share with you two facts of life in this region first for years israel has pleaded with western governments to take action against international terrorism and for years we have been rebuffed now you are in our eyes a johnnycomelately and you expect after years of rejecting our advice that we will suddenly leap in the air at your conversion and applaud you we think of ourselves first ourselves second ourselves third it is what you have trained us to do second fact in lebanon in the last five years we have lost close to one thousand men killed if our population were translated to that of the united states then we would have lost more men killed in five years than died from enemy action in the whole of the vietnam war that was of double the duration if our population were that of the united kingdom then we would have lost killed some soldiers how many have you lost in northern ireland four hundred i think not how many were killed in the south atlantic not more mr martins had you lost servicemen in northern ireland in the south atlantic would you rush to involve your men in further adventures that would end in no advantage to your own country i think not mr martins percy martins sat straight backed in the event of a crisis the abandonment of those two men would be contemptible not as contemptible as the appeasement of terrorism that has for years been the policy of your government of the governments of the united states of france of germany of greece we have offered and already given considerable cooperation you should make the best of what you have there was the scrape of the chair under percy martins he was redfaced from the heat flushed from the putdown he stood turned on his heel no hand shakes no farewells he strode out of the room a long silence and then the major said before he leaves i should see noah crane the station officer reached for his hand clasped it shook it in thanks they took a bus through the snail slow raucous rush hour of the late afternoon she clung to him to avoid being pitched over in the jerking progress of the bus they raised eyes margarethe was the only woman on the bus and a white woman at that her arabic was uncertain good enough for her pith comment about the coming role of women in a socialist democracy to be heard good enough to check the blatancy of the gaze she was subjected to when her hands were held behind abu hamids neck she had been coy she had not told him where she was taking him it was three days after he had found her in the shaded room above the alley in the souq al hamadieh it was the first time in three days that he had left the room the first time in three days that he had dressed the first time in three days that he had moved more than a dozen paces from the dishevelled bed he was returning to the beqaa in the morning she released her hands from his neck she pecked at his cheek she horrified the men on the bus he loved her for it he kissed her he offended the passengers and gloated he showed in public for all to see his love for a woman for an infidel they stepped off the bus a dark wide street high walls to the sides of the dirt walkway along the road he did not know where they were she held his hand she led him briskly the gate was of thin iron sheet nailed to a frame too high for abu hamid to see over she pulled at a length of string that he had not seen and a bell clanked a long pause and the gate was scraped open she led him forward they passed through a gloomy courtyard she had no word for the old man who had pulled back the gate for her she walked as though she belonged they climbed a shallow flight of steps the door ahead was ajar through the doorway into a cool hallway on and down a dim lit corridor into a long room his shadow her shadow were spreadeagled away down the length of the room he saw the blurred shape of a robed woman coming towards him and the woman took the hands of margarethe in greeting and kissed her cheeks he saw the lines of tiny cot beds that were against the walls on both sides of the long room his vision of the room cleared he saw the cot beds he saw the sleeping heads of the children margarethe had slipped from his side she moved with the woman deep in whispered conversation margarethe using her flimsy arabic in short pidgin sentences they paused only in their talk to tuck down the sheets that covered the children to wipe perspiration from the brow of a child with a handkerchief he looked down on the faces of the nearest children took note of the gentle heave of their breathing of their peace from the far end of the room she summoned him without thinking he walked silently on the balls of his feet a child coughed the woman in the robe slid away from margarethe went to the child margarethe said it is where i work it is the new place that i work who are the children they are orphans he saw the robed woman lift the child from the cot and hug it against her chest to stifle the coughing fit why did you bring me they are the orphans of the palestine revolution he looked into her eyes tell me they are the future of palestine they were orphaned by the israelis or by the christian fascists or by the shia militias they are the children of the revolution do you understand what should i understand he saw the woman return the child to the cot bed and smooth the sheet across its body understand the truth the truth is these children these children lost their parents at the hand of the enemies of palestine these children are truth they have more truth than the baubles that can be bought with five thousand american dollars he closed his eyes he saw the flame crawling the length of the spiral of paper what do you want of me that you should not be corrupted he saw the radiance in her face he saw the adoration for the great struggle to which she was not bound by blood you want me dead he heard himself say the man that i love will not be a hireling who kills for five thousand american dollars you know what is israel the man that i love will have no fear of sacrifice to go to fight in israel is to go to die in israel the man that these children will love will have only a fear of cowardice to go to israel is to be slaughtered to be dragged dead in front of their photographers these are the children of the revolution they are the children of the fallen they must have fathers hamid their fathers must be the fighters in the struggle for palestine have i not done enough i want you to be worth my love and worth the love of these children she took his hand he felt the softness of her fingers on his she shamed him i promise what doyou promise sweet boy i promise that i will go to israel that i will kill jews she kissed his lips she held his hand and walked him again down the room past the long rows of sleeping children they settled to sleep in a grove of eucalyptus trees near to the north bank of the hayarkon river they were at the very edge of the tel aviv city mass they had eaten the last of their food on the move as they made their way through herzilya and ramat hasharon they had the map of the streets they would start early in the morning they had decided it would take them more than an hour and a half to walk from where they were to the bus station off levinsky on the far side of the city with the food gone the grip bag contained only the three kilos of plastic explosive plus the detonator and the wiring and the timer as they lay under the ripple rustle of the trees mohammed and ibrahim talked in whispers of what they would do with the money they would be paid what they would buy in the stores of damascus when they returned a light wind brought the scent of oleanders in bloom and the rumble of the lorry traffic in from the street they were sitting near to the door of the dormitory room their backs against the wall margarethe said when i am here i am at peace abu hamid said i have no knowledge of peace lying on her lap huddled against her breast was a girl child who had vomited milk on his shoulder his hand gently tapping its back was a boy child now quietened from crying they were in darkness the shaded nightlight was at the far end of the room when you were like them was there no peace he whispered there was no peace in the tent camps when i was like them there were only the camps for refugees for my people who had fled from the israeli but you had what they do not have you had the love of your mother who struggled to survive with a family in a tent what is the future of these little ones my sweet boy their future is to fight they have no other future what do you remember of when you were a child he grimaced i can remember the hunger i can remember the drills to get us to run fast to the ditches so we would be safe if their aircraft came she watched the boy childs fingers clutch and free and clutch again at the collar of abu hamids tunic she asked you surely do not regret being a fighter i do not regret it but i never had the chance to be otherwise so there are palestinians who have gone to the gulf and to saudi and to pakistan and to libya and they work for the people there i do not have that chance margarethe i can write only my name i can read a little very little i tell you that in honesty i cannot go to bahrain or tripoli to work as a clerk there is no employment for a clerk who can read very little there were not schools at the tent camps which taught reading and writing and making arithmetic we were taught about the israelis and we were shown how to run to the air raid shelters she saw the boy childs fingers grasping at his lips and his nose he made no attempt to push the boy childs fingers away and if we have not succeeded in our lifetimes in freeing our homeland from the israelis then these little ones also must be taught to be fighters we cannot turn our back on what has happened to us you said two hours ago that you had done enough do you try to make me ashamed you are a fighter that is why you have my love the boy childs fingers had found the small well hole of the crows foot scar there was a gurgle of pleasure he suppressed the memory of the stinging pain as the artillery shell shrapnel had nicked across his left upper cheek the memory of the last days of the retreating battle for west beirut it is all i know i know nothing of being a clerk major said hazan made up a rough bed of blankets on the leather sofa in his office then undressed when he had folded his clothes when he stood in his singlet and shorts he went to the japanese radio behind his desk and tuned to the vhf frequency of the israeli broadcasting corporation he smoked another cigarette he searched his way through the file on his desk the file that obsessed him he listened to the news broadcast in the english language it was a powerful radio it guaranteed good reception the radio in his opinion broadcast a news bulletin of irrelevant crap it said that orthodox jews in jeru salem had again been stoning bus shelters that carried advertisements showing women in bathing suits the pipe line feeding the negev irrigation system from the sea of galilee had closed down because of shortage of water the triumph of a rabbi who had come up with the solution of selfpropelled tractors to work on the golan heights during the fallow year when the commandment dictated that a farming jew should not work his fields the rate of inflation the public squabbling between prime minister and foreign minister new figures showing the decline of young people seeking a kibbutz life the performance of a tel aviv basketball team in new york but the bulletin pleased him if the recruits had been taken he would have heard it on the radio the ibc was always quick to report explosions arrests if they had been taken it would have been on the radio that evening he switched off the radio and lay on the sofa major said hazan laughed and the shiny skin on his face buckled in his mirth his own secret his own reason to laugh the secret of the timer was shared only between himself and the technician in the basement technical laboratory of the air force intelligence wing not shared with the brother of the popular front not shared with the cattle who had been brought from the beqaa the cattle believed the timer was set for minutes the cattle believed they would be off the bus at the latrun monastery and that the explosion would follow when they were legging it hard to ramalleh cross country into the occupied territories the setting of the timer was the secret he shared only with his technician when his laughter subsided he concentrated on the file the first page of the file showed in detail a plan of the layout of buildings of the defence ministry on kaplan major said hazan was half in love with the file he was in singlet and running shorts and track shoes and washing his stubbled face when the telephone rang in the bedroom he wiped his eyes water splattered on the tile floor the telephone yelled for him it was not yet a beard just a dark rash over his colouring face he picked up the telephone holt cranes gravel voice in holts ear get your clothes on get downstairs whats the panic were going out where travelling what do i need just yourself dressed for how long a few days for gods sake crane you could have told me last night youre wasting time get down he heard the purr of the telephone he slammed his receiver down he chucked on his trousers and a shirt holt steamed he had had dinner with the monosyllabic crane and percy martins crane had hardly spoken beyond asking for the salt to be passed him and sugar for his coffee martins had been bottling some private anger nobody had told holt anything he ran down the service stairs and strode into the hotel foyer up to crane who was standing by the glass front looking out bored onto the street will you start treating me like a bloody partner crane grinned at him come on they walked past the hotels taxi rank they walked all the way to the bus station crane had the decency to say that a walk would do holt good if he was missing this mornings workout crane set a fierce pace that was his way three times holt tried to batter his complaint into cranes ear three times he was ignored it was a dingy corner of the city noisy crowded dirty impoverished and this was the new bus station holt wondered what the old one had looked like sunday morning military travel day to holt it seemed that a full half of israels conscript army was on the move young men and young women all in uniform all with their kit most with their weapons rejoining their units after the weekend crane moved fluently through the crowds through the queues as though he belonged and holt trailed behind him there were buses to ashkelon and beer sheba and netanya and haifa and kiryat shmona and beat shean buses to all over the country buses to get the army back to work so what the hell happened if the enemy came marching in at a weekend holt caught crane grabbed his arm so where are we going jerusalem first why dont you tell me what were doing surprise is good for the human juices why dont we drive because i like going by bus when do we start being a partnership when i start telling you where youre going youll start messing your pants crane grinned shook himself free he pointed to a queue he told holt to stand there holt stood in the queue it stretched ahead of him he was wondering whether they would get two seats when the driver deigned to open the door of the single decker bus there were soldiers in front of him men women there was a woman with four small children two in her arms there was an elderly couple arguing briskly there were two young men there were two young men who looked moved seemed different holt could not say how they looked moved seemed different he was the stranger light chocolate skins but then the arabic jews had light chocolate skins long dank curly hair but then there were arabic jews of that age who would be in their last year of school or who had some exemption from the military nervous movements anxious glances over the shoulder snapped whispers to each other looking moving seeming different and then the queue started to move and the soldiers were surging and the woman was shouting for her stray children and the elderly couple were bickering away their lives alone in the queue holt saw two young men who looked moved seemed different he was a stranger he took nothing for granted he saw nothing as ordinary he watched he was edging forward he just knew that he would reach the steps into the bus the driver and crane would not be back with the tickets holt moved a little out of the queue so that he could watch for crane more easily so that he could shout to him to hurry he was only half a step out of the queue it gave him sight of one of the young men with his hand in a cheap grip bag fiddling he saw the frown of concentration on the forehead of one of the young men and he saw the strain of the other young man who bent close to his friend he saw that the two had their hands in the bag relief on their faces hands out of the bag he saw their hands clasp together as if a bond was sealed as if a mountain were climbed he was alone beside the bus alone he saw them the taller of them slipped away the shorter climbed the narrow steps onto the bus holt was looking for crane wretched man as if the man enjoyed making holt sweat holt saw the taller of the two young men standing at the ice cream kiosk the one moment frantic because of something in a grip bag the next moment buying ice cream crane walking unhurriedly back from the ticket booth holt waving for him to hurry he saw the taller man skipping across the road from the kiosk towards the bus the queue was formed alongside an allweather shelter a stout graffiticovered brick wall masked the windows of the bus from holt he was buggered if he were going to stand like an obedient dog waiting on crane holt was moving towards crane he felt the hot wind he heard the roar of the fire wind he was off his feet flying could not get his feet to the ground could not control his body mind arms moving above the road moving towards the ice cream kiosk he could see the kiosk he could see the taller man with the ice creams splattering across his chest he felt the snap cudgel blow of the bricks at the back of his legs he heard the thunder blast of the explosion holt careered into the taller man hit him full in the body smashed against the splattered ice cream cones eyes closed the knowledge of fire the certainty of calamity ears blasted ringing from the hammer strike of plastic explosive the body was under him the body of the taller man was writhing holt did not understand explosion fire demolition he knew all that he did understand that the taller man on whom he lay had wriggled clear of his belt a short double edged knife could not comprehend why the taller man on whom he lay held the double edged knife and slashed at him all so bloody mad mad that he had flown that he could not control his legs that debris lay around them that the taller man slashed at him with the bright blade of a knife the knife was at full arm stretch the taller man screamed in words that holt did not know he saw the knife closing on him he saw the old dirty running shoe he saw the knife part from the fist clatter away he saw the tail end swing of cranes kick holt blurted his friend took the bag he went to get an ice cream he tried to knife me the breath was crushed out of holts chest crane had smother dived onto him he was gasping for air he felt himself pushed aside rolled away and crane had twisted the taller man onto his stomach and hooked an arm behind the back held it denying the taller man any freedom of movement holt saw the spittle in the mouth of the taller man and heard the frothing words that he did not understand again the staccato explanation from holt there were two of them in the queue they had a bag one climbed onto the bus the other went for ice creams i was just picked up i was chucked across the road i hit him fell on him he pulled the knife on me bastard terrorist crane said a whistle in his teeth arab bastard terrorist holt looked into cranes face it was the eyes that held him merciless eyes as if the anger of crane had killed their life ruthless eyes he was shouting in arabic at you crane said crane moved fast holt left to fend for himself crane moving with the arab propelled in front of him by the arm lock and holt crawling to his feet and struggling to follow crane driving the arab forward as if his only concern was to get clear of the bus station holt thought he would be sick his foot kicked against a severed leg he stepped over the body trunk of the elderly woman who had been arguing with her elderly husband he recognised the shredded remnant of her dress his shoe slid in a river of blood slime and he careered sideways to avoid a young girl soldier who dragged herself across the road on her elbows and her knees and who tried with her hands to staunch the blood flow there was the cut of the screams in the air and the first shrill pulse of the sirens holt lurched staggered after crane and the arab they were going against the tide surge of shoppers shop keepers taxi drivers passengers from other queues who ran towards the smoking skeleton of the jerusalem bus a police car swung a corner tyres howling crane put himself into the road in front of it forced it to stop all so fast crane jabbering at the driver and his crew man and wrenching open the rear door and dragging the arab inside after him then reaching out to pull holt aboard the door slammed shut the police car reversed turned sped away holt smelled the fear scent of the arab who was squashed against him pressed between himself and crane tell me i did well crane nothing to boast about i did well you did what any israeli would have done nothing more nothing less they had left him in the corridor that led down to the cell block he had been there for more than three hours he was ignored he sat on a hard wooden bench and leaned exhausted back against the painted white brickwork of the corridor walls through all the three hours a procession of men passed up and down the corridor there were soldiers officers with badges of rank on their shoulders there were senior policemen in uniform there were investigators of the shin bet in casual civilian dress he was never spoken to he was brought no coffee no tea the heavy wooden door with the deep key setting and the small peep hole was left empty holt heard the questioning and he heard the thumping and the beating and he heard the screams and the whimpering of the arab the screams were occasional the whimpering was all the time holt could recognise the battering of the fists and the boots could find images for those sounds crane came out of the cell block holt stood i have to say mr crane that whatever was done at the bus station i do not approve of the torture of prisoners crane stared at holt there are five dead two of them children there are injured of whom eight are critical you win against these people by a rule of law not a rule of the jungle is the need for a rule of law taking you into the beqaa abu hamid in the beqaa is beyond the law this man is in the custody of the law neat and pathetic whether or not youll be alive in two weeks time may well have depended on the thrashing that arab shitface is getting right now how i fancy coffee how because weve kicked him and belted him and he talked to us abu hamid selected him for the mission he was a popular front recruit at a camp run by abu hamid considering the state of his hands hes drawn us a damn good layout of the camp and hes done us quite a good map of where the camp is fair exchange for handing out a thrashing dont you think knowing where to find abu hamid in the beqaa i just meant close it down holt i dont think i fancy walking into lebanon with you bleeding a damn great trail of your sensitivities i hear you holt said a police car drove them back to the bus station the building was beit sokolov on the far side of the road and down the hill on kaplan from the defence ministry complex the chief military spokesman was a barrelchested bustling man wearing his uniform well showing his para wings on his chest he strode into the briefing room he walked to the dais his entry quietened them he faced his audience they sat below him pencils and pens poised over the blank sheets of their notepads they were the military correspondents of the israeli broadcasting corporation and maariv and yediot and the jerusalem post and the bureau chiefs of the american and european broadcasting networks and the senior men of the foreign news agencies he checked around him he was satisfied there were no microphones to pick up his words gentlemen on a matter of the greatest importance to us a matter directly affecting the security of the state we demand your cooperation concerning the terrorist bomb explosion in the new central bus station this morning you will be handed our statement at the end of this informal briefing the statement will say that two members of the popular front for the liberation of palestine terrorist organisation were involved in the planting of the bomb and that both died in the explosion your reporters may in conversation with eye witnesses bring back stories of one terrorist being arrested and driven away from the scene of the explosion we demand that that information does not appear it is of the uttermost importance that the terrorist leaders who despatched these two men do not know that we are currently interrogating one survivor a matter of life and death gentlemen any attempt to smuggle information concerning this survivor past the censors out of the state will lead to prosecution and harshest penalties of the law questions the bureau chief of the columbia broadcasting systems drawled have we gotten involved in another bus ride coverup the military spokesman had anticipated the question four years before four arabs from the gaza strip had hijacked a crowded bus in southern israel and threatened to kill the passengers if palestinians were not released from israeli gaols the bus had been stopped and stormed two arabs had died in the military intervention two others had been seen being led away into the darkness at the side of the road by the shin bet in a field out of sight these two were bludgeoned to death senior officials of shin bet were subsequently granted immunity from prosecution and resigned the move is temporary there will be no coverup because the survivor is alive within a month he will be charged with murder and will appear in open court questions the senior tel avivbased reporter of the reuters news agency asked will we ever be told what it is that is a matter of life and death who can tell the briefing was concluded within fifteen minutes the ibc had broadcast the news that according to the military spokesman it had now been ascertained that two arabs thought to be the bombing team had died in the explosion because of the deformity of his features it was difficult for the other officers in the room to ascertain the feelings of major said hazan the major had pulled his chair away from his desk he was bent over his radio set listening intently as he had been for every one of the news broadcasts from israel that morning he switched off the radio he resumed the course of the meeting he knew the scale of the casualties he knew the fate of the two recruits he knew that the trail of evidence to the yarmouq camp on the outskirts of damascus was cut more martyrs for the folklore of the palestine revolution more casualties for the enemy that was israel the station officer rang major zvi dan immediately after the news broadcast i just want again to express my gratitude if they had known there was a survivor they would have moved the camp the contact would have been lost we have given you the chance we hope you can use it they had slept in a hostel for soldiers in transit no explanations from crane and holt was less bothered at the silences with each day he spent in the mans company he was into the rhythm of tagging along speaking when he was spoken to following cranes lead they had had fruit and cheese for breakfast he thought his beard was beginning to come slowly enough but starting to appear something more than just a laziness away from the razor when he had stood in front of the mirror when he had taken his turn at the wash basin when he had looked at himself then he had wondered how jane would have liked his beard only a short thought a thought that was cut before being answered because crane had been behind him and told him to put away his toothpaste told him to get used to life without a toothbrush no explanation just an instruction it beat him why they could not stay in a hotel when they had all the expense money available to pay for a suite at the hilton why they had to sleep in a hostel at eight shekels a night he had reflected his mind had cast back to the crimea journey to the field of the light brigade on which he would have walked with ben armitage ours not to reason why that was life with noah crane ours but to do and die pray god that was not life with noah crane when he had finished his breakfast crane stood and walked away from the table he wouldnt wait for holt to finish what he was eating holt stuffed two apples into his trouser pockets grabbed a slice of cheese and followed him out at a table in the hallway crane put down his bank notes and waited for his four shekels of change no tip they walked crane said that holt was missing his morning exercises so they wouldnt take a bus holt was used now to cranes stride his cracking pace they started from old jewish jerusalem with the walls of the old city behind them and the golden semi orb of the dome of the rock if he ever returned to london of course he would when he returned to london noone would believe he had been in jerusalem and never visited the old city never walked the route of the cross and he was fitter he could tell that he was beginning to match crane stride for stride away along wide streets under gently leaved trees over steep hills and into new jewish jerusalem through suburbs of villas constructed of clinically cut sand rock they were on the fringe of the city they climbed the last hill they were overtaken by the tourist coaches as they approached the memorial yad vashem holt crane said its where we remember the six million of our people that the hun slaughtered history makes man complacent doesnt get people forward take the irish dont give me university crap isaiah even unto them will i give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and daughters i will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off we do remember what happened to our people if we ever forget them then that will be the day that the same can happen to us i dont believe history tells us holt six million of our people went to the gas chambers and the furnaces they didnt fight they lay down because we remember what happened today we will always fight we will never lie down i dont want a debate im just telling you they went into the low ceilinged bunker that was the heart of the memorial they stood at the rail they looked down on the stone floor in which were carved out the names of the largest concentration camps further from the rail were fading wreaths and near to the back wall of rough cut lava rocks there burned a flame holt was the tourist he gazed around him as if he stared at the kremlin cupolas or the arches of the coliseum or the arc de triomphe or the statue of liberty he turned back to see if crane was ready to move on he saw the gleam of a tear rolling on noah cranes cheek he could not help himself he stared blatantly he read the names treblinka auschwitz dachau belsen lwowjanowska chetmno he stood behind crane so that he should no longer intrude into the privacy of his vigil abruptly crane swung away marched out into the sunlight they walked quickly crane leading holt following they walked through a garden parkland that was laid out in memory of theodor herzl the originator of the concept of a jewish state they went past the young sprouting trees and bank beds of flowers and down avenues of bright shrub bushes when they had crossed the parkland when they looked down the hillside holt saw the terraced rows of graves with their slab stone markers he stood on the high ground he left the neat chip stone paths to noah crane it was a personal pilgrimage for a long time he watched the slow lingering progress of crane amongst the graves holt brushed the flies from his forehead he was being given a lesson that he was aware of he thought that crane did nothing by chance at the far end of the graveyard noah crane looked up shouted to holt theyre all here holt the high and mighty and the unknowns men from the stern gang from the liberation war of sinai six days yom kippur netanyahu who led the raid to entebbe lebanon all the men whove given their lives for our state we value each one of them whether hes a hero like netanyahu whether hes a spotty faced truck driver who went over a mine in lebanon whatever happens to me in the beqaa theyll get me back here thats the best thing i know thats mawkish crane dont laugh at me this isnt a country thats going soft you know holt in the president of syrias office there is one painting one only the painting is of the battle of hattin you ever heard of that battle you with all your history course you havent at the battle of hattin the great saladin whipped the arse off the crusaders the president of syria aims to repeat the dose he aims to put us to the sword and the rest of us into the sea got it got it mr crane its not my intention to end up here holt glad to hear it mr crane so you just remember each damned little thing that i tell you each last damned little thing you do just as i say without question no hesitation cranes voice boomed on the hillside that way i might just avoid the need of them cutting a hole for me lets hope we can save them the trouble mr crane later towards the end of the morning with their kit they were dropped off at the start point chosen by noah crane they were going walking in samaria north from ramalleh towards nablus in the occupied territories via a scrambled telephone link percy martins reported progress to the director general from torks office in the tel aviv embassy he spoke directly to the nineteenth floor at century by protocol he should have talked to fenner he hoped fervently that fenner would hear he had bypassed him cranes taken the youngster for a few days into the occupied territories to get him thinking the right way used to the equipment used to the movement and then they go theyre going to be picked up near nablus theyll be taken to kiryat shmona rest up for a few hours then off what state is the eye witness holts in a good state hell do well how are they coming out theyre going to have to walk out havent you bent a few backs god knows ive tried but theyre going to have to walk out anything new we have a fix on a training camp that is being run by abu hamid we know exactly where to go for him the prime minister wants it for sylvester armitages memory i want it for jane cannings memory im relying on you martins martins hired hand third man on the desk first time running his own show said defiantly you can depend on us sir crane was on watch holt drowsed for holt the night march with the laden backpack was the most exhausting experience of his life theyre going prime minister within a week to bring me his head regrettably not on a salver but his head for all that the director general smiled hes terribly lucky who is prime minister this young man weve sent out there the eye witness exactly terribly lucky when so few people of his age have the chance afforded them of real adventure let us hope he appreciates his good fortune prime minister i have to tell you i would be less than honest if i did not i am already savouring the moment when i can recount this small epic to our friends in the states forgive me but they have a long road to walk if i do not have the head of this palestinian wretch then most certainly i will have another head its your plan and your advice im taking the director general smiled comfortably across the downing street sitting room it was a very fine calculation then prime minister and in a number of particulars it is finer still the prime minister was gathering papers the meeting was over his head or yours goodnight the second night out and they had not been walking more than an hour and a half and it was the third time that holt had fallen pulled over onto the rocks by the weight of his pack the moment he had lost his balance he heard the stones rumbling away on the hillside he could have cried in his frustration he could hear the venom of cranes swearing from in front abu hamid watched them coming he stood at the flap of his tent and studied the slow progress towards the camp of the girl who led the donkey and behind it the crawling jeep he could hear the soft cough of the jeeps engine as it idled at that distance even more than half a mile he knew that it was fawzis jeep she wore the floppy trousers of the shias and the short cotton skirt and the full loose blouse and the scarf tied tight over her head and then wrapped across her mouth to mask her face she dressed in the clothes of a village girl of the beqaa the jeep was a dozen paces behind her but she made no effort to quicken her pace or to move aside abu hamid sucked at a hardly ripe peach swirling his tongue over the coarse surface of the stone he knew that in the beqaa under the eye of the syrian army under the control of the syrian intelligence agencies nothing would happen by chance he knew that it would not be by chance that a girl walked a donkey along the track that led only to the tent camp and that the girl was followed by fawzis jeep she was young he was sure of that he could see the smooth regular flow of her slim hips the trousers and skirt could not hide the slender outline of the young body abu hamid took the peach stone from his mouth threw it high into the coiled wire of the perimeter fence he called for the recruits to come forward to break from their meal to get off their haunches make a formation he lined them up three untidy rows he turned to face the entrance to the camp now the jeep accelerated and swung past the girl the donkey shied and the girl held her course and seemed unaware of the jeep she was lost for a moment in the dust thrown up by the jeeps wheels and when she appeared again she still walked forward light step leading the donkey abu hamid saw that the donkey had a pair of old leather pannier bags slung down on its flanks with a swaggering step fawzi walked towards abu hamid his hands rose to grip abu hamids shoulders he kissed him on both cheeks abu hamid smelled the lotion that crept to his nostrils fawzi clapped his hands for attention played the big man for abu hamid it shamed the palestinian revolution that fawzi and his clumsy conceit should have control of the recruits of himself he watched the girl and the donkey approach the camp entrance fawzi had his back to the girl and the donkey as if their time had not yet come fawzi addressed the recruits fighters of the palestine revolution i have news for you of an epic attack by the popular front deep into enemy territory a commando force of the popular front has travelled to the heart of the zionist state and in so doing has disproved the claim of the zionists that their borders are secured the target was the principal bus terminus in tel aviv the attack was timed for last sunday morning at the moment when the maximum number of enemy soldiers would be boarding transport to return to their units the zionists of course have attempted to minimise the effectiveness of our commando strike by releasing ridiculously false figures of the casualties inflicted their lies will not deflect the truth fortyeight of their soldiers were killed more than a hundred were wounded the heroism of the commando knew no limitations they carried out our men an attack of greater pain to the enemy than the successful assault by hand grenade at the dung gate in jerusalem against a military parade fighters i said to you that the heroism of the commando knew no limitations i grovel in admiration at such heroism the plan of the attack allowed for the commando to place a bomb on the tel aviv to jerusalem bus the bomb was fitted with a timing device that would permit the commando to leave the bus en route with the bomb left under a seat that was not good enough fighters for this heroic commando they feared that after they had left the bus that there would be a small chance of the discovery of the bomb that would negate the attack such heroism fighters the commando was governed by total commitment to the cause of the palestine revolution they set the timer early they stayed with the bomb until it exploded by their selfless action they determined that there was no possibility of the bomb being discovered and rendered harmless for the success of the revolution they gave their own lives fighters the strike force of the commando came from this camp they were your brothers in arms fighters mohammed and ibrahim were of your blood they shared your hardships they shared your food they shared your tents they were given the chance to wage total war against the enemy against your enemy they did not fail the cause of the palestine revolution abu hamid stood numbed the man who was an incessant pain in the arse was now a hero the thief was now a martyr the girl with the donkey walked slowly through the entrance gap in the wire the recruits gazed awestruck at fawzi they had clung to each word he had spoken as if each man yearned for himself the admiration now settled on ibrahim and mohammed the girl now stood beside fawzi she held loosely in her hand a length of rope that was fastened to the bridle the donkey was old and patient fawzi looked to the girl with pleasure without great courage without great bravery the palestine revolution will not be won but we have the courage we have the bravery and so the victory of the revolution is inevitable look at her fighters look at her and rejoice in the courage and bravery of the revolution she is sixteen years old she is in the full flower of youth she has no ambition other than to give her life her breath her spirit to the revolution abu hamid stared at the girl he could not tell whether she heard fawzi her face was blank her eyes were dead he had seen men who habitually smoked the poppy or dragged on cigarettes made from the marijuana crop and their eyes too were dead their faces were without expression he could not say whether her love was for the revolution or whether it was for the poppy and the hashish fibre this girl is going alone to the security zone without the support of comrades with the help only of a fervent faith in the ultimate success of the revolution she is going into the security zone with her donkey the donkey is her friend the donkey has been with her since she was a child at her mothers breast in the bags carried by the donkey will be one hundred kilos of industrial dynamite do you understand me fighters this girl will go to the checkpoint at the entrance to the security zone where there are the israeli surrogates of the fascist south lebanese army and the israelis with their personnel carriers and the torturers of the shin bet when she is amongst them she will fire the explosives they will go to their hell she to her paradise his eyes never left the girl she was a wraith what abu hamid could see of her face was dry and pale he could not see fear he could not see boredom could it be real could a girl have such love of martyrdom that she would lead a donkey laden with explosives amongst the enemy that she would obliterate herself and her enemy he knew of the shia car bombers the heroes who had ploughed their vehicles into the american embassy and the french embassy and the marine camp in beirut he knew of the car bomb that had been driven against the walls of the shin bet headquarters in tyre during the enemys occupation of the city he knew that the cars approaching the security zone were treated with such suspicion that a better chance now existed for approaching close with a donkey or a mule or a pack horse could a girl have such little love of life she is an example to us all by seeing her by knowing of her we are honoured she visits you in order that you may be encouraged by the memory of her bravery when the time comes for you yourselves to go south and fight the enemy who denies you your rightful homeland show her your love show her your admiration abu hamid raised his fist in the air white knuckles the fist punching long live the palestine revolution the recruits shouted their answer echoed his words all glory to the martyrs of the palestine revolution the cheering soared strength to the enemies of the state of zion courage for the fighters whose cause is just the girl did not smile slowly she rolled her head so that she gazed flatly at each and every one of the recruits who yelled their support of her she turned she seemed to speak a word into the ear of the donkey she stood for a moment in profile to abu hamid he saw the bulge he saw the weight forward and low on her stomach he knew she was pregnant she led the donkey away and out of the camp the recruits cheered her all the way but she never looked back abu hamid dismissed the recruits and they stood silently at the camp gate as the girl and the donkey became small figures on the rough track fawzi beamed he walked to abu hamid she is to go through all the villages between here and the security zone it has a great effect on the villagers just as she has made a great impression on your men when she has made her attack a film of her will be shown on the television it is already made is she drugged you surprise me abu hamid she is a fighter she is like yourself fawzi drove away in his jeep he caught up the girl and her donkey before they reached the tarmac road when he strained his eyes abu hamid could see them a girl and a donkey and just behind them the jeep of the syrian army they worked hard at their training that morning no backchat only studied concentration they worked at the lesson of the platoon in attack on a hillside against a defended position with the support of calibre machine guns and rpg launchers that morning abu hamid did not find the need to repeat any part of his teaching holt drank his water it was a new discipline to him to ration himself he must have looked with obvious longing at his water bottle because he was aware of the smear of amusement at noah cranes mouth the merchant braked slowed his mercedes ahead of him down the straight road running from north to south under the east slope of the beqaa valley was a column of syrian army trucks the trucks more than a dozen of them he estimated had pulled across onto the hard shoulder of the road he came forward slowly always his way to pass a military convoy slowly so that he could see what the convoy carried and always better to go slowly past the syrian military with the window wound down the better to hear any shouted instructions they would only shout once they would shout and if their shout was ignored they would shoot there was a jeep stopped at the head of the convoy and he saw a very fat young lieutenant talking arm waving to another officer heh who was he menachem to laugh at the grossness of a young soldier the merchant weighed on the scales some nineteen stone he saw a young girl leading a donkey the girl and her donkey were at the far end of the convoy coming past it he drove onto the same hard shoulder he switched off his engine no one looked at him he listened but there was no shouted instruction the canvas roofing of the lorries had been rolled down he saw that they carried troops a dozen lorries could carry two companies of infantry the mental arithmetic was second nature to the merchant the troops crowded to the sides of the lorry and watched the girl and her donkey come alongside them move forward faintly he could hear the shouting voice of the gross young lieutenant who had gone from the side of the officer and now offered explanation to the soldiers as the girl led her donkey past each truck so the soldiers cheered her deep in his mind where the truth of his existence was hidden the merchant swore he recognised the signs and it would be two days before he was again in a position to make a drop a long time ago he had been offered a radio he had declined he had said he would not be able to learn how to use it and anyway he had known that a signal sent to israel was a signal sent also to the men of syrian intelligence he preferred the dead letter the bomber would be paraded through the beqaa the bomber would be used to jolt the commitment of the young he could see that the bomber was herself scarcely more than a child the merchant menachem saw his controller major zvi dan rarely never more than twice a year the last time smuggled by the idf through the night across the border he had talked to zvi dan about the bombers the bomber was just a slip of a girl he could piece together what zvi dan had told him late and over whisky about the bombers you know menny the irishbat found a car bomb in their sector abandoned they made it safe and then they looked to see why it was abandoned you know why menny it was abandoned because it had run out of petrol the merchant could remember how they had laughed hurting their stomachs laughing they are not all suicide people we had one who came up to the checkpoint and surrendered and said that the girl who was with him had already run away do you know with another menny the bastard syrians gave him a flak jacket to wear and they told him that way he would survive the explosion of his own car and in the car was more than kilos of explosive more recently they have taken to a remote firing the bomber goes to the checkpoint but the detonation is remote from a command signal from a man who is hidden perhaps a kilometre away that is because they know that not every recruit wishes to hurry to martyrdom we have learned menny that the bombers are not so much fanatics as simple disturbed kids there was one who was with child and did not dare face her father there was a boy who had quarrelled with his father and run away there was one whose father was accused by the syrian military of crimes and who volunteered to save his father from gaol believe me menny they are not all khomeini fanatics most are sick kids we know we have captured eleven of the last sixteen sent to the security zone i tell you what is the saddest thing they make a film of the kids and they show it on the television and they make great heroes of the kids there is a village in the security zone where live the parents of a boy who drove the car for one of the big beirut bombs and now it is like his home is a tourist attraction and his father is a celebrity and the kids picture is everywhere on the walls heh menny what sort of cretin takes a holiday in south lebanon only a jew if the discount is good more laughter more whisky a conversation of many months back there were times in the loneliness of his subterfuge life that the merchant doubted his own sanity there were times when his mind ached for a return to the buoyant carefree students on the campus in the negev desert he saw the girl leading the donkey zvi dan had told him that the men of syrian intelligence scoured the villages of the beqaa for kids who would drive a car bomb for kids who would lead a donkey bomb he thought that the girl and the donkey and the heavy bags slung on the rib cage of the beast were an abomination one day he would go back to his students on a day when there were no more donkey bombs no more car bombs menachem would go back to his lecture room whatever he saw whatever its importance he would not break his routine it would be two days before he could report the coming threat to a road block leading into the security zone she had passed the parked lorries he could hear the shuffle of her feet the clip of the donkeys hooves he saw the sweating lieutenant amble towards his jeep for the soldiers the parade was over he saw the face of the girl devoid of expression he shouted through his opened window god is great they were high above the village crane had pointed to it on his map aqraba holt watched through binoculars as the kids launched their rocks and molotovs at the troops it was like something he had seen on the television from northern ireland from their vantage point holt not daring to move for fear of cranes criticism they watched a daylong battle between the kids and the soldiers fought in a village square that was wreathed in tear smoke and in the alleys behind the mosque sometimes when the fight went against the soldiers holt heard cranes chuckle sometimes when the soldiers caught a youth and battered him with their rifle butts holt ground his teeth he heard the voice in the corridor and the clatter of feet martins tidied the newspaper he had been through yesterdays times and the herald tribune and that days jerusalem post read them all from cover to cover right down to the cost of a tenyear lease on a two bedroomed flat in west kensington to the discounts available in a jewellery stores winding up sale in paris to the price of a second hand subaru car in beer sheba he was nagged by frustration martins could recognise that he was the outsider he was an intrusion in the smooth dealings between tork station officer in tel aviv and his local contacts he tidied his paper he scraped out the debris from the bowl of his pipe into the saucer of the coffee cup that he had been given three hours before he ignored the no smoking sign stuck onto a window of the station officers room the door opened martins saw the station officer blink as the smoke caught his eyes sod him the station officer tugged in with him a shallow long wooden box olive green no greeting not as yet the station officers priority was to get to the window shove it open then to the air conditioner switch it off been able to occupy yourself the station officer asked curtly ive passed the time what have you brought a rifle martins tried to smile a present for the ayatollah and the mullahs i beg your pardon just a joke actually it is the rifle for crane we brought cranes rifle out from england rather a lot of paperwork it wasnt the rifle he wanted why didnt the bloody man say what he wanted he test fired the parker hale he didnt complain perhaps you never asked him what he wanted perhaps you just told him what he was getting the mans impossible just doesnt waste time arguing what he would have told you he wanted if he had been asked was a model pm from accuracy international small firm down in hampshire how did it get here israelis picked it up yesterday shipped it out in their dipcorps bag to save time avoid the export licence i collected it this morning martins puffed that makes me look a complete fool the station officer asked would you like some more coffee there are more important things than coffee if it has not escaped you i am in charge damn it man i didnt know you were smuggling a rifle out of the uk i dont know where holt and crane are i dont know when the jump off is i have not been given access to the latest intelligence on the camp unfortunate meaning youre going to have to live with it im a senior man in london tork and this is israel sorry decision taking is in cranes hands and stays there crane will decide on the jump off on the route he will make the decisions because he is going to be in the beqaa and we are not for which in all sincerity i thank god you and i are going to have to get one or two things straight the station officer glanced up heard the rasp in the voice he thought a man who wore a three piece suit in the heat of israel to be a fearful ass as i understand it mr martins you got the job were sent out here because there were no decisions to be taken sorry fenner told you that well youve got a nasty surprise coming to you control of this mission has been entrusted to me by the director general and i mean control and one more thing there is more to the work of the service than the analyses that you fill your day in writing ive read some of your stuff pages on the future of the coalition here eight pages on the prospect of a right wing backlash pages on future settlements on the west bank all the sort of crap that fenner wants the sort of gibberish that keeps anstruther h a p p y i am sorry if my material is too complex for you mr martins you can think of it as complex if you wish tork but youd better get it into your head that this mission into the beqaa is of infinitely greater importance to the interests of the united kingdom than the trivia with which you spend your days and if this goes wrong for your lack of cooperation ill have you gutted martins said the station officer peered down at him twice in the last week his wife had asked him whether they were not duty bound to invite mr martins out from london to their flat for dinner twice the station officer had told his wife to forget it leave the man to his hotel room the station officer fancied he could hear the boast chat in london on the upper floors of century problems why should there be problems difficulties difficulties only existed to be overcome a good show a super big show as if it was a gesture of defiance martins shovelled tobacco from his pouch and into the bowl of his pipe im going to be in kiryat shmona what for because im bloody well responsible once theyre over the frontier once theyve gone theres nothing you can do i have to be somewhere and thats where i mean to be said martins the station officer considered the alternative he thought of having him fretting in his office for the next week perhaps longer ill take you up rebecca was the personal assistant to the major she had been with him for more than two years major zvi dan liked to say when he introduced her that she was his eyes and his ears that she alone understood the mysteries of the now computerised filing system she was blessed also he claimed with an elephantine memory at the end of each working day he would share with her his thoughts his new found information and they would be stored electronically in the computer and mentally in her head rebecca sat in the front passenger seat of the pickup truck she was out of uniform she wore jeans and a blouse of brilliant orange first she had smoothed her nails with a manicure stick now she painted them purple fingers and toes rebecca was a fixture in major zvi dans life perhaps he relied too greatly on her on her memory and her organising skills she bullied him not that he complained other than to her face she made him go to the doctor at defence when his leg stump ached intolerably she forced him to eat when the work load bowed him down she came once a week to his bachelor flat high and overlooking the ramat gan quarter to collect his dirty clothes and take them to a launderette they had been parked at the side of the nablus to jenin road for a little more than an hour rebecca glanced up occasionally from her concentration to amuse herself at the growing anxiety of major zvi dan the major paced around the pickup he looked down at his watch he fingered the automatic pistol that was tucked into the belt of his slacks with binoculars he studied the pale rock strewn hills and the small terraced fields from which the stones had been lifted to make walls she heard the snort of major zvi dans exasperation when they had first stopped he had told her that within five minutes they would be making the rendezvous with crane and the english boy five minutes drifting into more than an hour he was cursing quietly he was staring up the road he was searching for the approach of two small and distant figures you should get something done about those eyes major she heard the voice she swung her head major zvi dan was rooted peering down the rough hill slope that fell from the road small rocks only low and hardy scrub bushes she watched the head of the major tilt and twist as he tried to find the source she could see no hiding place crane major zvi dan shouted get the hell up here the ground seemed to rise the figure seemed to materialise where there was dung grey rock there was a standing man you need to get them looked at major she laughed out loud move yourself holt a second figure appeared they stood together some fifteen yards from the road level with the pickup they were in uniform their skins were dirt smeared i am a busy man crane i have better things to do crane came forward you should meet holt major major zvi dan stared holt up and down hows he done acceptable is he good enough to go the first day hed have had us identified three times second day once third day once hes just been under your glasses for an hour that makes him acceptable get in the back the major said coldly rebecca watched she saw that crane carried his back pack easily like it was a part of his body along with the rifle with the elongated telescopic sight she saw that the younger man came more slowly as if the back pack were a burden as if he had never before carried an armalite rifle whats your time table crane shit and shower first long sleep tomorrow aerial photographs and maps pack the kit move tomorrow night she watched crane climb easily into the open back of the truck slinging his backpack ahead of him she saw the young man struggle to scramble aboard and get no help the mercedes was clean the merchant carried the code in his head in the darkness of early night before the stars were up the merchant had lifted the bonnet of the car and loosened a battery cable he was a little off the main road he was parked above the sparse lights of the village of qillaya it was a routine for him if he had been bounced by a syrian patrol or by a group of shia militia or by a band of the hezbollah then he would have had the explanation that his cars engine was broken that he could not put it right in the darkness he wrote his message a jumble of numerals on a scrap of paper he had to walk some fifty yards from the car to the angle of the road there was always danger in these moments on the approach to a dead letter drop he could take every precaution during his travelling during his halts but the moment of maximum danger was unavoidable if the dead letter drop was compromised he was gone he was breathing hard on the angle of the road was a rain ditch cut to prevent the tarmacadam surface being eroded during the spring floods when the higher snows melted in the ditch was a rusted holed petrol drum he left his messages in the drum he received his messages from the drum he was not more than yards from the u n i f i l zone there was a checkpoint of norbat yards down the main road he was eleven miles from the good fence the israeli frontier he was a few minutes walk a few minutes drive from the sanctuary of the norbat checkpoint from the safety of his countrys frontier it was always the worst time for him when he was within touch of sanctuary safety when he was short moments from turning his back on the checkpoint and the good fence and starting the drive back into the beqaa he had the paper in his hand the merchant bent over the drum searched for the hole into which he would place his coded report of the progress south through the valley of a girl with a donkey bomb the torch light flooded his face he thought he was losing his bowels he could see nothing behind around the blinding beam of the torch he waited for the shot the urine was driving from his bladder its zvi menny heh i am sorry the torch light went out the merchant stood his ground could see nothing there was an arm around his shoulder stifling the trembling of his body i think you pissed yourself heh i am truly sorry there was someone who had to see your face the merchant saw the shadow looming behind the shape of his friend but the shadow came no closer the merchant whispered couldnt you have used a night sight he wanted clear light on your face it was important for ten minutes the merchant and zvi dan sat by the rain ditch the merchant made his report in incisive detail zvi dan gave his instructions handed over the package the merchant went back to his car first he collected an old pair of slacks from the boot and quickly changed into them then he refastened the battery cable he drove back to the main road and then on to the village of yohmor where he would spend the night in the morning he would advise the elders of the village on the spare parts they needed to buy for the repair of their communal generator and how much those parts would cost holt started up in his chair he had been dozing he was brought back to life by the thud of the boots on the plank slats of the verandah god and was he lucky to have dozed percy martins was still in full flow and the station officer seemed to suffer from a private agony and the girl was reading a hebrew romance with a lurid cover the verandah was outside the officers canteen at the army base there were pots of flowers and a jungle of vine leaves overhead and there was coffee and cocacola to drink if anyone could be bothered to go inside to the counter to get it for himself the girl was reading the book and ignoring martins like jane had been able to do when they were in his or her london flat and he was watching the cricket on television the station officer hadnt quite the nerve to turn his back on the reminiscing martins was remem bering his time in cyprus spook on the staff of government house recommending his old strategies for application in the occupied territories holt looked behind him turned in his chair he could see that both the major and crane were still wet from face washing and he could see that it had been a fast job because there were still smears of dark camouflage cream under the ear lobes and down at the base of their throats crane said long day tomorrow h o l t martins said pleased youve returned from wherever major something id like sorted out i am informed i have to sleep in an hotel i would have thought you could put me up on camp major zvi dan said not possible the girl rebecca said do you like cocoa holt said ages since ive had it quite crane said get to your bed holt now the station officer said im off early in the morning back to tel aviv ill be gone before youve surfaced give it your best effort look forward to welcoming you back holt sergeant holt stood and shook the station officers hand a damp hand and a limp grip crane wandered off towards the counter in search of food percy martins drummed his fingers on the table i would like to discuss the matter of my accommodation further the girl rebecca was back in her book holt saw the mud dirt on the majors boots goodnight all holt said he went to the room they had allocated him a white painted cubicle with a bed and a table and a chair and three hangers on a nail behind the door he didnt bother to wash and he wasnt allowed to use toothpaste he peeled off his jogging shoes and his shirt and trousers he switched off the light flopped on the bed he had slept fourteen hours the night before and he was still tired the day had been divided in two there had been the kit part of the day and there had been the route planning part of the day he didnt think it was from choice he assumed it was from necessity but at least crane had talked to him at him down the corridor was cranes room and next door to that the kit was laid out for packing in the morning crane had talked to him at him when they were with the intelligence guys when they were looking at the aerial photographs that footprinted the beqaa he heard the knock at the door he didnt have the time to reply the door opened he saw the silhouette of the girl against the lit corridor he saw that she carried a mug steaming holt laughed out loud not the bloody cocoa she laughed back at him the curtains were thin and when she kicked the door shut behind her the floodlights outside streamed through he could see that she was laughing its the best thing to make you sleep youre very kind and you are going to lebanon tomorrow so you need to sleep she sat on the bed she wore a deep cut green blouse and a full skirt he thought her laughter was an effort he thought she had sad eyes and there were care lines on the edge of her mouth he took the mug from her held it in both hands sipped at the thick stirred cocoa he had not had cocoa since before he went to boarding school since his mother used to make it for him on cold winter evenings when he was a small boy holt tried to smile its supposed to be a secret me going into lebanon tomorrow my husband was in lebanon he went with the first push and then he went back again in the last year of our occupation after the first time he was a changed man he was very bitter when he came home to me before he went he used to play the saxophone in a small jazz band where we lived he never played after he came back he was an architect my husband there were many casualties in his unit tanks i used to wonder what an architect a saxophone player was doing driving a tank in lebanon my husband said that when the idf first went into lebanon they were welcomed by the shia people the people in the villages threw perfumed rice at the tanks by the time they left that first time they were hated by the same shias the mines were in the roads the snipers were in the trees he was called up again for lebanon in just before the retreat started the leaders the generals of course they didnt call it a retreat they called it a redeployment he used to write to me the letters were pitiful he used to say he would never go back again that he would go to prison rather than serve another tour in lebanon he used to say that the basic rule of survival was to assume the worst at every moment to shoot first lebanon brutalised him a week before he was due to come out from the second tour he wrote to me he wrote that they had painted on their tank the words when i die i will go to heaven i have already been through hell he was killed the day after he was shot by a village boy near joub jannine they knew it was a village boy because they caught him in their follow up search he was years old he was years old and through hate he shot my saxophone player my husband that is lebanon holt i am sorry it is the way of life for us we are jews we are condemned to a permanent perdition of warfare im sorry but my viewpoint is from a long way away im not trying to be an impertinent outsider but i think youve brought much of it on yourselves again im sorry but thats what i feel when you go into lebanon you will be part of us there is no escape from that you know my quarrel why i go ive been told your leaders your generals want a man killed they need you for assistance at the execution the man killed the girl i loved holt said he raised the cocoa mug to his mouth the cocoa spilled from his lips dribbled down onto his new found tan from the beach at tel aviv do you go into lebanon for the girl that you loved or for your leaders and your generals holt shook his head he said softly i dont know better you go for your girl did he love you your husband when he died he wrote in his letters that he loved me my girl she snapped at me the last words that she spoke we were quarrelling can you see what that means the last time we spoke the last memory i have of her is of argument thats a hell of a weight to carry close your eyes holt his back was against the pillow that was propped up against the wall his eyes closed he felt her movement on the bed he felt the softness of her lips on his cheek he felt the moisture of her lips on his mouth he felt the gentleness of her fingers on the bones of his shoulder my husband holt my saxophone player he used to write to me from lebanon that the feel of my mouth and my hands and my body was the only sanity that he knew with the palms of his hands he reached to the smooth angles where her cheeks came down to her throat he kissed her as if with desperation remember only her love holt make her love your talisman the memories were a rip tide walking with jane in the sunshine of spring on the moorland hills sitting with jane in the darkness of a london cinema lying with jane in the wet warmth of her bed his eyes were tight shut he moved aside in the bed he heard her peeling away her blouse pushing off her shoes dropping down her skirt he felt the lovely comfort of her against his body he cried out it doesnt help her cannot help her killing him until he is dead you have no rest her memory will only be torment love me holt love me as you would have loved her love me so that you can better remember her when you are in lebanon when he woke she was gone as if she had never been there as if he had dreamed of jane his eyes ached his forehead hurt crane had the maps in front of him and the aerial photographs an intelligence officer took crane through the photographs it was the close work that pained him caused him to blink but this close work was inescapable critical the pilotless drone had flown the previous day the delilah drone had flown from inside israel and taken a route north from metulla and over marjayoun in the security zone the drone had clipped the edge of the norbat sector and flown on at a height of feet towards yohmor by the time that it cleared lake qaraaoun at the southern end of the beqaa valley the camera set in the belly of the delilah was picturing the ground beneath the drones flight path had taken it along the western side of the valley over small villages over goat herds and the boys who minded them over women hoeing the weeds out of the stony fields in preparation for the planting of corn crops over the steep sloping tiled roofs of shia villages over syrian army positions over the main road running north east from khirbet qanafar to qabb elias over the small vineyards from which would come in the autumn the delectable bottles of cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir over the syrian headquarters garrison at chtaura across the beirut to damascus road and then east and then south along the bar elias to ghazze road and of course delilah a speck in a clear midday sky had passed over a tented camp that was surrounded by a fence of coiled barbed wire and a bulldozed ditch the drone had been seen by many people it had been seen by the boys with the goats and by the farming women and by the men sitting outside their village coffee houses and by bored syrian soldiers and by abu hamid as he lectured his class in the workings of the dshkm heavy antiaircraft machine gun and by fawzi as he negotiated a transaction with a headman and by a merchant who drove an old mercedes car seen by many people but unremarkable to all of them the drone flew twice a week it was accepted the photographs had been taken especially for the benefit of sergeant crane he studied each one with the help of a stereoscope it was the stereoscope that killed his eyes brought the throb to the deep recess where his retina was diseased had to use the stereoscope because that was the instrument that threw the flat vision of the photographs into a three dimensional reality crane spoke only rarely to the youngster he thought of him as the youngster he believed that he was not a nursemaid and his experience of handling novice troops had taught him that to talk too frequently was to confuse he expected that holt should listen and above all that he should watch noah crane did little by chance he demanded that holt should concentrate watch everything react on it remember it most times his conversation was with the intelligence officer he trusted the man the planning of the route required trust and the man had served him well most recently this gawky spiderlike intelligence officer had carried out the detail of the planning for the sniping of a hezbollah unit commander his care had earned the trust of noah crane they talked in the hebrew tongue crane had two maps on the table in front of him the one he marked bold lines for the route decisive crosses for the stop positions the other he left clean the intelligence officer gathered up the photographs noah crane folded the map that was not marked he spoke from the side of his mouth to holt staccato as if it were obvious see the way i fold it the way i fold it doesnt show which section interests me it concertinas out and i never put my fingers on it when were out there when were using it we will always use a pointer like a stick to indicate we never leave marks on the map finger marks so that if we are captured they dont know what our target was crane said matter of fact we dont talk about capture capture is not thinkable it is in case we lose the map he saw the youngster look away he led holt to the kit room the room beside his own he was a loner for years as a sniper he had taken responsibility for himself for his own skin noah crane had never gone after promotion he had shunned taking novice soldiers under his wing he didnt bloody well know how to raise the spirits of the youngster didnt bloody know he could see the youngster was scared witless standing close to him walking c lose to him but he didnt bloody well know how to breathe confidence into the youngster and it worried him he needed the youngster to begin well and how how to get the youngster doing it right that was an agony to noah crane a second agony to the pain behind the tiredness of his shooting eye holt was young enough to be noah cranes son and he had never fathered a son never brought up a son course he didnt know how to communicate with the youngster he had laid the kit out in the same way he always did two bergen packs nearest the door the kit stretching away youll know him wont you ill know him id skin you if we went that far and at the end you didnt know him mr crane i see him just about every hour of my waking life i see his face i see his movement i see him running theres no chance if hes there that i wont know him not personal i just had to be sure mr crane has it ever crossed your mind that i might not be sure of you you cheeky brat you know about nothing i know about plenty about the things normal people know im just weak about going into other folks back yards and killing people they dont do degree courses in that everything i do you copy you do everything i say and well make it back i hear you mr crane and is there something i can say what is it it would be great to see you smile and to hear you laugh would be quite marvellous crane scowled were taking more than we had on the warm up hike were taking what i can carry which means you have to manage with the same we are taking five days water which is lbs weight we are taking rations for five days we will have first aid and survival gear we will have a sniper rifle with day vision and night vision sights and we will have an armalite rifle with six magazines watch the way i pack your kit i wont pack it for you again its not easy for me you know having a green arse ill do my best mr crane too right you will cos i kick hard when the bergens were packed and the weapons had been cleaned one more time crane dressed in olive green military trousers and shirthe saw that holt watched the way he pulled the sleeves down and buttoned them hid the forearm skin he saw the way holt copied him as he threaded the hessian lengths of brown and yellow and black material into the rubber straps sewn into the uniform to break down the bodys outlines he saw that holt imitated him as he smeared the insect repellent cream on his face and throat but not on his forehead he could have explained that creams were never put on the forehead because the sweat would carry it into the eyes but he saw no point in explaining the youngster just had to watch copy imitate when holt was dressed he hoisted the bergen pack onto holts shoulders told him to walk around told him to get the feel of the pack that was half as heavy again as the one that holt had struggled with in the occupied territories six times round the room and then the adjustments that were necessary on the straps more adjustments for the waist belt and adjustments lor the sling strap of the armalite holt said why havent you given me a practice with the armalite because if our lives depend on you with the armalite then theyre not worth much i have to be able to fire it if it has to be fired then itll be me thats firing it youre just there to carry it crane reached out he took the wrist watch off holts arm for a moment he read the inscription on the back our dearest son st birthday mum and dad he felt a vandal he tore off the strap he looped a length of parachute cord through the slots knotted the ends with adhesive tape he fastened two morphine ampoules to the cord one each side of the watch he hooked the cord over holts neck saw the watch sink with the ampoules down under holts shirt front like he was dressing a kid for a party he tied a dull green netted cloth around holts forehead he stood back he looked holt up and down you wont get any better crane said he punched holt in the shoulder he made a rueful grin if they ever audition for the lead in the great communicator youd be a certainty mr crane you might even end with an oscar lets move he thought the youngster was great and he did not know how to tell him he thought that he was not alone he had seen the way percy martins looked at holt when holt didnt see him he thought they were both trying to reach the youngster and both failing both too bloody old crane said you wont have noticed holt but there is no magazine on the model pm long range its one shot only you dont get a chance to reload you have one chance one shot i have to get into a fiveinch circle at around a thousand yards with a first shot an only shot he saw the sincerity in holts eyes thats why they had to dig out the best man mr crane thank god they found him they went through the door holts own clothes and cranes were left folded in separate plastic bags each with a nametag loaded down by the bergens they walked down the j corridor out to the transport percy martins was talking to him pacing alongside holt he was following crane out into the sunshine and towards the mineproofed safari truck ill be here holt ill be at kiryat shmona and via tel aviv ill have secure communications with london everything that i can humanly do for you will be done rest assured on that he saw the girl standing on the verandah of the officers canteen she wore scarlet this morning he would like to have gone to her kissed her his thanks for what she had given to him she looked straight through him as though he were a stranger youre going to help to make the world a better and a safer place for decent folk young holt go in after that bastard and blow him away let them know that there are no safe havens no bolt holes that we can see them and reach them even when theyre the other side of the hill ill be waiting for you great mr martins he followed crane into the back of the safari the major gave him a hand up pulled him over the tail board god speed holt didnt hear any more the safari lurched forward martins stood in the road shouting silently waving as if it were important with the white plastic nose shield set as a bullseye in the centre of his sun red head and the light catching the watch chain across his waistcoat when he looked to the verandah the girl was sitting and her head was in her book he felt the sharp finger tap on his arm crane said forget it right now youve more to think of than some doeeyed fanny he didnt think any woman had ever loved noah crane he thought noah crane was in pain because of the way that his face was screwed up and his forehead was cut with lines the back of the safari was covered with a canvas roof and sides and the three of them sat as close as was possible to the drivers cab to other cars to people walking on the road they were unseen their own vision was through the open back the major and noah crane sat on the slatted seats facing inwards and holt was down on the floor between them and sitting on sandbags the sandbags covered the whole of the floor of the back of the safari holt understood they were there to cushion a mine explosion he smiled to himself did not show his black amusement to the others he had once read of a man who was shipwrecked and alone in a rubber dinghy and the man had said that the worst aspect of his day drift before rescue was when the sharks came under the dinghy and prodded the thin rubber base with their snouts he wondered which would be worst the snout of a tiger shark under his backside or the blast of a land mine great choice beautiful options he held the armalite rifle upright between his knees and he didnt even know how to maintain it how to strip it how to clean it he was young holt he was a young diplomat of third secretary grade all so wretchedly unreal they went through the village of metulla and through the back of the safari holt saw that almost immediately they drove past a border checkpoint and through a wide cut gap in a high wire fence crane reached out no preliminaries took the armalite and with fast hand movements cocked it holt heard the clatter as the escort sitting in front beside the driver armed his weapon welcome to our security zone holt the major seemed to smile and he creaked his leg as he shifted to take more easily a service pistol from the leather holster at his waist it is our buffer or protection strip at the fence we have our last line of defence to keep the swine out of our country at the fence we have the electronic beams body heat sensors tv camera fields mined areas but that is the last line we try to halt them the infiltrators here in the security zone you know we have around ninety attempts each month to get through the security zone but they dont get through the security zone is of the greatest importance to us we are indeed lucky holt that we have in the security zone several thousand armed men of the south lebanese army they are christians who were isolated down here when lebanon fragmented we pay them hugely much more than we pay our own soldiers and because they have to light for their own survival they protect us well the security zone holt is a place of enclaves apart from the christian enclaves there are groupings of shia muslim and islamic fundamentalist muslim and hezbollah muslim the shias and the fundamentalists and the hezbollah have in common a hatred of everything jewish and everything christian it makes for an interesting zone but we have cut our funerals the funerals of our soldiers were destroying our nation the sla now die on our behalf handsomely rewarded for their sacrifice our men are more precious to us than shekels we can pay the price they drove on over the lowered tail gate holt saw that they were climbing through a dry and barren landscape he saw road blocks that they sped through without checking he saw a subaru saloon with no identifying number plates parked on the hard shoulder and there were two men in civilian clothes sitting on the bonnet and one cradled a submachine gun on his lap and the other had a galil rifle slung from his shoulder the car was low on its suspension he presumed they were shin bet that the car was armour plated they passed the turning to khiam and holt saw the fences and watch towers of what seemed a prison camp they passed the turning to marjayoun which holt knew was the principal christian town in the zone they climbed the major and crane talked fast now in hebrew they talked over the top of holt as if he were not there and twice the major leaned over holt and tapped energetically with his finger at a piece of equipment on cranes belt harness it was the one piece of equipment that was not duplicated on his own belt harness the truck was slowing changing down through the gears there was the rocking motion of the vehicle as it pulled off the road and headed up to a steep incline on a rough track they lurched to a halt where you walk from holt the major said crane disarmed the armalite cleared it then handed it to holt he carried his bergen and his model pm to the tail board jumped down the major clumsily followed him holt lugged his bergen the length of the safari and swung himself off the end all three ran the few yards into a concrete and stone built observation post it was early afternoon it was sickeningly warm in the observation post as though the reinforced walls held the heat he sensed the tension immediately there were two soldiers and an officer there was a radio squawking with bursts of static and one of the soldiers sat by the radio with his earphones clamped on his head and held tight by his hands the other soldier and the officer raked with binoculars the ground ahead of their split vision port holes he saw the major speak to the officer saw the officer shake his head resume his watch holt came forward he placed himself at the officers shoulder he stared out the checkpoint was about a hundred yards down the road a chicane of concrete blocks positioned so that a vehicle must slow and zigzag to pass through the road stretched away winding and falling towards the green strip of the litani river bed the observation post was holt estimated a hundred feet above the road a great emptiness a silence stretching up the road that led north down at the checkpoint he could see that the soldiers all peered up the road some through binoculars some holding their hands flat against their foreheads to protect their eyes from the sun when do we go holt asked irritated because he was ignored when it is dark the major said all the time gazing up the road so why are we here so early because the transport has to be back before it is dark so what do we do now you wait because i have other things to consider holt flared why cant someone tell me leave it crane snapped he felt like stamping his foot furious and apparently powerless the officer had turned away from the vision slit he watched through and had gone with quick nervy movements to the table where the radio operator worked the officer pulled a cigarette from a packet beside the set lit it puffed energetically on it then offered a cigarette to him crane was looking at him sulkily he shook his head cigarettes were banned toothpaste was banned soap was banned crane had said that cigarettes and toothpaste and soap were all banned because they left a smell signature what the hell was a smell signature what sort of language was that smell signature he looked up it was on the end of his tongue to argue what difference it would make if he had one cigarette they had their backs to him he stared at the backs of the officer and the soldier and the major and crane hunched backs heads pressed against the wood surrounds of the vision slits he could see over cranes shoulder in the bright light of the afternoon he had to blink to make anything from the sunswept rocky ground and the narrow grey pencil line of the road the radio operator was scribbling then tearing the paper off his pad holding his arm outstretched for the officer to take the message he could see a girl leading a donkey the soldiers at the road block were running to take cover behind the blocks of the chicane and two men were crouched in the cover of their car back from the r o a d block unbelievable to holt the soldiers had taken cover because there was a girl a thousand yards down the road leading a donkey a girl and a beige brown donkey and this mans army was flat on its face a girl and a donkey something out of a sunday school lesson when he was still in short trousers a small boys idea of the holy land bright and sunny and yellow rock and a girl with a donkey the major spoke to crane crane shrugged nodded the major spoke to the officer the officer went to the radio took the earphones from the operator spoke briefly into the microphone a girl coming up the road and leading a donkey the only movement holt could see through the vision slit crane had gone to the back of the observation post was rooting in his kit holt saw two of the soldiers who had been behind the cement blocks were now scurrying bent low to get further back all unbelievable crane pushed holt aside wanted the whole of the vision slit to himself and he was jutting the barrel of the model pm through the slit for gods sake mr crane its a girl dont distract him the major said quietly so what in gods name is he doing be quiet please a girl with a donkey something sweet something pastoral crane slid a bullet into the loading port forward of the bolt arm settled the rifle into his shoulder what in bloody hell gives its a girl are you sighting your rifle cant you see its just a girl is this your idea of a test shot quiet the major hissed crane oblivious still its a bloody person its not just a target crane fired there was the rip echo of the report singing around the inside of the observation post holts eyes were closed involuntarily he heard the clatter of the ejected cartridge case landing he looked through the vision slit the donkey stood at the the side of the road beside the small rag bundle that was the girl holt looked at them looked from one to the other bloody well done so youve got your rifle sighted only an arab girl good target for sighting a rifle first class shooting crane reloaded the donkey had moved a pace away from the girls body it was chewing grass at the side of the road i didnt know it crane i didnt know you were a fucking animal crane breathed in hard holt saw his chest swell the rifle was vice steady crane breathed out checked holt watched the first squeeze on the trigger saw the finger whitening with the pressure of the second squeeze again the crash of the shot echoed in the confines of the observation post crane spurted out his remaining breath holt saw the orange flame holt saw the flame ball where the donkey had been there was a thunder rumbling there was a wind scorching his face at the vision slit the donkey had gone the girl had gone there was a crater in the road into which a big car could have fallen holt stared god and he felt so frightened he was naked because he knew nothing crane ejected the cartridge case his voice was a whisper a tide turn over shingle a light wind in an autumn copse did you watch me im just sorry for what i said as long as you watched me saw everything i did he had seen that cranes head never moved he had seen the breathing pattern he had seen the way cranes eyebrow and cheek bone merged into the tube of the telescopic sight he had seen the two stage squeeze on the trigger i saw everything that you did the major said you are in lebanon here holt nothing is as it seems they were given tea crane cleaned the rifle unfastened the bolt mechanism to pull the cloth through the barrel major zvi dan crouched beside holt i dont think and this is not criticism that you know anything of the military world im not sorry if you had been born an israeli you would have been in the army not my quarrel you may not think it your quarrel but when you walk from here when you walk away from our protection then every man and woman and child in the villages and towns of the beqaa would hate you if they knew of you would you believe me if i told you holt that in the beqaa they do not acknowledge the geneva conventions on the treatment of prisoners holt grimaced he liked the man i believe you i am so very serious it is a place without conventions there would be no officers to safeguard you your life would be worthless after the sport of torturing you holt said softly im scared enough no need to make it worse i do not try to frighten you i try only to stress that you should follow noah exactly follow him noah is a marksman he is a sniper do you know that in your own army for many years sniping was frowned on it was not quite right it was even dirty examine the job of the sniper he shoots first against an officer when does he shoot the officer he kills the officer when he goes for his morning defecation the officer is dead his men are leaderless and they dare not leave their trench for the call of nature they make their mess in their trench which is not good holt for their morale the sniper is hated by his enemy he is prized by his own forces who are behind him often they are far behind him where they cannot be of assistance to him it is a peculiar and particular man who fights far beyond help your mr crane who has never accepted a medal is peculiar and particular follow him holt sat on his backside as far as he could be from the vision slits for as long as he could avoid it he wanted to see no more of a battlefield where the enemy was a young girl and her arsenal was a donkey the aircraft was late the aircraft was at the end of its flying life at every stopover it required comprehensive maintenance testing the aircraft was elderly because that way the premiums paid to lloyds of london by middle east airlines for comprehensive insurance cover could be kept to a reasonable figure the aircraft landed from paris in the middle of the afternoon it had come in over the sea the view of beirut had been minimal in the heat haze he was heinrich gunter the passenger who was eager to be free of the passport queue in the bulletpocked airport terminal he was years old and this was the thirtyninth visit he had made to beirut since the shooting and shelling had started in he was a middlemanagement employee of the credit bank of zurich and he was personally responsible for the administration of many millions of united states dollars invested with his bank by wealthy quietliving lebanese entrepreneurs he was married with three children and he had told his wife that morning that beirut was fine if you had the right contacts made the correct arrangements he was expecting to be met he was not to know that the airport road had been closed for three hours that a rising of tension between men of the druze militia and of the shia amal militia had prevented his agent from getting to the airport to meet him he hurried away from the passport control he col lected his one suitcase that was adequate for a two day stay maximum he moved through the frequently j repaired glass doors at the airports main entrance he j could not see his agent after waiting for minutes heinrich gunter agreed j with a persistent taxi driver that he would pay the fare asked in hard currency he was told that the driver knew a safe way avoiding the area of tension to the hotel into which he was booked it was already a long day a row with his wife over his breakfast because he was going to beirut an argument at zurich airport because the swissair flight was overbooked and he was a late arrival drinks in the airport bar at charles de gaulle because middle east airlines was leaving late more drinks on the flight because he was going to beirut it had been a long day and he had been drinking and he took the taxi heinrich gunter never really saw what happened in the back seat of the taxi heinrich gunter lolled back the whisky miniatures of the paris airport and the middle east airlines first class cabin had taken a gentle and gradual toll by the time that his eyes opened the taxi had been waved down to the side of the road the back door had been wrenched open a hand had grabbed for the sleeve of his jacket the first thing he clearly saw was the barrel of a rifle half a dozen inches from his chest the first thing he felt was himself being propelled out of the car he lurched to the pavement he was grabbed under each arm and rushed down an alley way he had seen a flash of two slimly built young men each wearing a cotton imitation of a balaclava face mask each carrying a rifle in the alley a length of cloth was wrapped around his lace covering his eyes he was kicked hard in the leg the back of his head was cudgelled with the butt of a rifle there was no fight in heinrich gunter as he was dragged away he knew what had happened to him he was sobbing as his shoes scuffed the surface of the alley way he had not even shouted for help he knew he was beyond help fawzi showed his papers to the norbat sentry the papers identified him as a lebanese dentist he drove out of the u n i f i l sector the checking by the sentry of his car had not been thorough a thorough check would have discovered the dirtied overalls in which he had lain on the hillside a mile and a half from the road block it would also have discovered a powerful pair of east german binoculars had the car been stripped to its panels then the sentry would have unearthed the radio controlled command detonator that would have fired the explosives in the pannier bags slung against the donkeys sides he went fast angrily he had seen weeks of manipulation destroyed by a long range marksman he had failure to report to major said hazan he had seen the girl as a gem and her long triumphant journey had been ended several hundred yards short of her target fawzi could taste the humiliation percy martins wrote his occupation as government servant and the reason for his visit as vacation when he filled in the registration form at the guest house he had not been asked where he wanted to stay he had been driven from the army camp at kiryat shmona to the kibbutz kfar giladi he was not that disappointed he was greeted at the reception desk as a vi p his bag was carried he was treated with respect the guest house six stories high set in flowering gardens appealed to him he was given his key i was wondering he said to the raven haired raven eyebrowed receptionist would there be any fishing in these parts would one be able to hire a rod percy martins was nothing if not a pragmatist he understood that his marriage was in terminal collapse that his relationship with his son was as good as finished he could look clearheaded at his career twice passed over for promotion to deputy or in charge of the middle east desk but he was no longer wounded by setbacks he could cope with his home life he could live with what to other men would have been humiliation in the office he could endure the taciturn holt and the imperious israelis that is what he told himself he said to himself sod the lot of them he would bloody well go fishing i would have thought there would be some trout in those nice little streams running down from mount hermon now trout isnt what i usually go for im a pike man actually i dont suppose you know about pike if youre into trout then you would regard pike as something akin to vermin youll see what you can find out for me of course you will youre very kind with his key in his hand he trudged up the stairs to his second floor room he imagined himself ushering young holt into the director generals office and of standing quietly at the back of the room very well done indeed percy we are all proud of you he sat down on the bed he unbuttoned the front of his waistcoat he loosened his tie sod the lot of them he held his head in his hands unseen alone close to tears there was a crushed ball of paper on the pile carpet beside the chair of major said hazan it was the clean sheet of paper he had crumpled with all the strength of his fist when the telephone call had informed him that the girl and her bomb had not reached target he had given his instructions on the evening television news broadcast transmitted by the syrian state station a statement would be made by the girl she would talk of her commitment to a lebanon free of israeli terror and of her commitment to the syrian cause and the palestine revolution and then the news reader would give factual information of the heavy casualties inflicted on the idf and their surrogate sla by the sacrificial heroism of the girl the truth and this was clearly recognised by major said hazan was an irrelevance the northern boundary of the security zone was a closed area there would be no independent witnesses more of the arab world would believe the claim of the syrian state station than would believe the denial put out by the israeli broadcasting corporation the message would go on the airwaves that a young muslim girl of exemplary purity had given her life in the struggle against the zionist brutes she had been photographed with care by the camera her pregnancy would not be seen it was the estimate of major said hazan that a car bomb or a donkey bomb had more effect on the anxious sheiks and emirs and sultans of the oil wealthy gulf than any other lever for the extraction of funds great truth in the ancient arab proverb the enemy of my friend is my enemy the enemy of my enemy is my friend his country needed the funds of the gulf the route to those funds was through constant daring attacks against israel carried out by the young vanguard of the arab peoples the truth might be an irrelevance but he hated to know that the bomb had been stopped short of its target the crushed crumpled paper lay beside his feet he reached for the telephone there were some who came to his office who marvelled to find four telephones on the table beside his desk a joke had once been made that he had only two ears two hands a poor joke because his ears had been burned away leaving only stumps and the fingers of his right hand had been amputated one telephone gave him access by direct line to the desk of the brigadier general commanding air force intelligence a second telephone gave him scrambled communication with military headquarters at chtaura in the beqaa valley a third telephone gave him an outside line the fourth put him into the exchange system of air force intelligence he lifted the third telephone he dialled he spoke with silk is it you a thousand apologies i have been away and since i have been back just meetings more meetings too long away from you how was he my pet how was his spirit how was his resolution my pet you would lift the organ of the dead excellent i will see you my pet as soon as i can turn away this cursed load of work goodbye my pet there had been the knock at his door which caused him to ring off he loved to hear her guttural foreign voice he loved to linger with his thoughts on the smooth clean curves of her flesh he called for his visitor to enter major said hazan stretched out his left hand in greeting my brother you are most welcome for an hour he talked with this military commander of the popular front over the plans for an attack on the defence ministry complex in tel aviv that section which housed the rooms of the military intelligence wing was ringed in red ink they discussed the method of infiltration and leaned towards a seaborne landing and they pondered over the sort of man who might have the elan the resolution to lead such a mission after an hour major said hazan had quite overcome his sharp fury at the failure of the girl and her bomb at the checkpoint in the security zone far behind them far from sight came the dulled reports of the artillery and far ahead of them there was the brilliance of the flares bursting and then falling to spread their white light against the darkness holt tugged at the bergens straps wriggled for greater comfort they were outside the observation post crane said i told you not to look at them crane had his back to the flares and you havent told me what theyre for im not a bloody tourist guide why are they firing flares mr crane because youre looking at the flares youre losing the ability to see in darkness we have to pass through a chunk of norbat ground so we are putting flares up for illumination between norbat positions and where were walking were burning out their night vision equipment got it would have helped if you had told me in the first place piss off youngster lets get this show on the road then they hugged each other a brief moment arms around each other and the belt kit sticking into the others stomach and the weapons digging at each others rib cages and the weight of the bergen packs swaying them they were two shadows the stars were just up the moon would be over them at midnight an old moon in the last quarter they crossed the road beneath the observation post they headed into the darkness away from the road away from the slow falling flares they were gone from the safety of the security zone nothing in his mind except concentration on his fool fall and the faint shape walking in front of him nothing of jane who had been his love through his life before nor of the girl who had been his comfort the night before nor of the leaders and the generals nor of his country only the care of where he laid his boot and his watch on noah crane ahead it started as a casual conversation at the airfield south of kiryat shmona there was a hut where helicopter passengers could wait sit in comfortable rattan style chairs for their flight there was a steward dispensing orange juice there was a radio tuned in to the army station there were some pot flowers which had even been watered the pilot came into the hut to advise major zvi dan that there would be a short delay before he could lift off with the major and the majors assistant up to your ears the major asked the pilot knew zvi dan the pilot sometimes joked that he was a bus driver that zvi dan travelled more often from tel aviv to kiryat shmona than any grandmother in search of her grandchildren im down the queue for refuelling for maintenance checks ahead of us are the choppers going tomorrow because the pilot knew zvi dan he knew also that the major worked in military intelligence he could talk freely where big show up the road ive been out of touch zvi dan sipped at the plastic beaker of juice bombers are going up the road in the morning were down for rescue standby so were in the queue and whats new thats the old army motto hurry up and wait rebecca read her book almost at the end rapt attention theres to be a big chopper force on rescue standby its a difficult target theyre going for how so the beqaa not under the missile umbrella directly but the fringe area its not the missile thats the problem the targets just small and for small targets they have to line up more carefully all the usual gripes from the bombers whats the target the pilot leaned forward said quietly we were told that they had good interrogation of one of those shit pigs that did the bus station well youd know more of that than me that it was all hocus them both being killed seems they came out of a training camp in the beqaa thats where the bombers are going major zvi dan was rigid in his chair his orange juice had spilled on his tunic heh have i said something he saw the majors back going out through the door rebecca looked up grimaced she had not been listening she went back to her book major zvi dan anger mad pounded into the night he swung through the door of the airfields flight operations room he stomped to the chair of the flight operations officer he pulled the chair round swivelled it to face him i am major zvi dan military intelligence i am an officer with an a level category of priority on a classified matter of importance i demand an immediate takeoff for tel aviv he cowed the flight operations officer into submission he could barely believe it two men had started to walk towards the beqaa to walk towards a tent camp to identify a target to take out a terrorist and the air force were planning to beat them there by two days and scatter the ground with cluster bombs right hand and left hand light years apart why couldnt his bloody country put its bloody act together he stormed back into the hut he limped up and down the floor space pacing away his impatience the pilot came in you put a bomb under somebody major we have clearance for liftoff in ten minutes it was the same rhythm of advance that holt had learned during the hike in the occupied territories but that had been only rehearsal different now in the occupied territories crane had hissed curses at him when he kicked loose stones when he stood on dry wood when he stumbled and stampeded away small scree rock on his own now wasnt he had to make do without help not that he needed cursing when he scuffed a stone he wanted to punch himself in frustration each time holt knew that the pace that had been set was aimed to cover one mile in each hour it had been dark at six it would be light again at six they had moved off an hour after darkness they would reach their lup an hour before dawn he was unconsciously soaking up the jargon a lying up position had become lup ten hours on the move ten miles to cover stripped holt weighed pounds he carried a further pounds weight in his clothing his bergen and his belt in addition he was ferrying the model pm because crane had the armalite he remembered the race around the lawns of the house in england when he carried nothing when crane had a backpack full of stones christ there was a weight on his back on his hips on his arms the first hour he had kicked stones the second hour fewer they were in the third hour and he moved as crane had shown him his booted foot edged forward found the ground the ball of his foot rolled tested if the test was fine if the stone held fast then the weight followed it was the rhythm of each pace every footfall tested there was just the starlight for them to move under crane was fifteen yards in front it was holts job to follow cranes speed crane set the pace holt had to follow crane was an outline ahead of him blurred at the edges by the hessian tabs on his body shape and on the bulk of his bergen all the time he had to be within sight of crane because crane would not stop each few yards and turn to see if holt kept contact a week before before the hike into the occupied territories holt would not have credited that so much skill so much care would be involved in moving across ground at night it was indeed a rhythm it was the same rhythm from the moment they had crossed the road under the observation post headed away every minutes they stopped holt would see crane hold up his hand and then drift to the side off the line of march a few moments of listening looking into the darkness with crane and holt sitting back to back each covering a degree arc of vision no talking no whispering just the straining of the ears and the eyes in the occupied territories crane had told holt that they should always be low down when they were listening looking seeking for information that they were followed or that there was movement ahead of them crane had said that a dog or a cat had good vision at night because its low eye line permitted it to see most shapes against a skyline in silhouette in the short moments when they were stopped crane would check his map holding over it the lens of his beta light powered by tritium giving him the small glow that was hidden from view sufficient for him to see by during the third hour they crossed the litani river waist deep in fast water going off rocks and climbing back onto rocks so that they left no footprints in mud there were no roads and holt saw that crane avoided even rough tracks that could have been used by the villagers of qillaya that was across the river to the east or qotrani that was beyond the hill summit to the west it was strange to holt how much he could see with the help only of starlight something he had never thought to learn before he supposed the trail they took might have been made by wild animals perhaps an ibex herd perhaps the run of the low bellied hyrax perhaps the regular path of a scavenging hyena or a fox north of the narrow road between qillaya and qotrani in the fourth hour they were high above the litani traversing a steeply sloping rock face on the slope face they moved sideways crablike when they had to cross the upper lines of a side valley holt saw that crane immediately changed direction as soon as they had been outlined he had been told why they did not climb to the upper ridges of the hills crane had told him that the military were most likely to be on the high ground basic officer training was to seek out the greatest vantage point a hellish strain on holts leg muscles as he fought to hold his balance against the sway of the bergen weight when they crabbed on the sloping uneven ground by the fifth hour he was sagging down at the rp the rally points where they stopped for the few moments each half hour seemed to him to be drifting further apart he knew that was eyewash he knew he was feeling the exhaustion of the night march at the rps he sat against cranes shoulder and had to be elbowed hard in the ribs to remind him that the stop at the rp was not for recovery but for checking that the way ahead was clear that the way behind was not compromised he was halfway through the first night and there would be three nights of marching to get to the tent camp and then there would be the stampede march back god and he was tired and he was only halfway through the first night he could hear his chest heaving he could feel the gasping pant in his lungs silence from crane as though he were out for a stroll in the park bloody man rebecca drove from the sde dove airport on the north side of tel aviv across the city major zvi dan sat beside her still angry silent the streets were fully lit bright shop windows pavement crowds cafes packed the anger corroded him the old and the young strolling the streets examining the windows laughing and joking and singing and two men not quite a hundred miles to the north were struggling in the darkness through rivers over rock slopes further and deeper into the territory of the enemy the logic was gone from his mind blown away by his temper he wouldnt have said that he wanted the citizens of tel aviv to hot tail it to the synagogues and offer prayers nor that they should shut their mouths shut off their music tiptoe down dizengoff but it fuelled his anger to see so many who knew so little cared less she dropped him on kaplan outside the david gate of the ministry she said something to him about what time she would arrive in the morning but he didnt hear her he ran as fast as his imitation leg would allow him towards the barrier and the night sentries and he couldnt find his pass and his pass wasnt in his breastpocket and his pass was in his bloody hip pocket he could have been the prime minister could have been the chief of staff he would not have entered the david gate if he had not found his pass in his wallet in his hip pocket he was allowed through they didnt hurry themselves it was the way of sentries little men with power that they never scrambled themselves for a man who was hurrying he headed for the wing building occupied by the iaf staff and how his leg hurt him when he tried to run into the building another check on his pass up the stairs and into the access corridor used by night duty staff one more check on his pass along the corridor and into the fluorescent lit room that was the war management section of the israeli air force a big quiet room where the men and the women on duty spoke in soft whispers where the radios were turned down where the teleprinters purred out their paper messages a room flanked by huge wall maps and dominated in the centre by the operational console table it was from this room that the long range voice contact had been kept with the hercules transporters flying the slow lonely mission of rescue to entebbe and from this room also that the fs had been guided the thousands of miles to and from their strikes against the palestine liberation organisation headquarters in tunis and the iraqi nuclear osirak reactor outside baghdad those who worked in this room believed themselves to be an elite backup force to the elite arm of israels retaliatory strike capability those who worked in the room looked first with puzzlement then amusement at the hobbling army major making his entry it was a room of great calmness low key calmness was the strength of the men and women who supported the combat pilots major zvi dan had abandoned calmness he was dirty he was tired his hair was dishevelled all eyes were on him a girl officer wearing lieutenants insignia on her shoulder flaps glided from a chair to intercept him i need to see immediately the duty brigadier major zvi dan breathed hard in no condition not with the imitation leg in connection with what major in connection with a classified matter believe it or not major all of us who work in here have a degree of security clearance there was a tiny surf of laughter behind her she was a pretty girl auburn hair gathered high onto the crown of her head a tight battledress blouse a skirt that was almost a mini and short white socks carefully folded over please immediately arrange for me to see the duty brigadier he is sleeping then you must wake him up zvi dan growled regulations require t h a t zvi dan lowered over her young lady i was fighting for this godforgotten country before you were old enough to wipe your own tiny butt so spare me your regulations and go at once and wake him this last he bellowed at her and she did she spat dislike at him through her eyes first but she went and woke the duty brigadier he was in poor humour he was a tired pale man with grey uncombed hair and a lisp in his voice major i do eighteen hours on duty on a night shift during that time i take two hours rest my staff know that i am to be disturbed from that rest only on a matter of the highest importance what is that matter you have a strike tomorrow against a popular front camp in the beqaa located at longitude and latitude we have it has to be cancelled on whose say mine the strike was authorised by the chief of staff then he didnt know what he was doing tell me more major that camp must not be attacked what is it do we have prisoners there no the duty brigadier gazed shrewdly at major zvi dan as if his annoyance was gone as if now he were amused at the puzzle do we have a ground mission going in which the chief of staff does not know about there is a mission the chief of staff would not be aware of the fine detail to that camp there is a mission in progress against that camp an idf mission no fascinating so who can that be the americans the doughnut boys the british so the british have gone walking in the beqaa have they how many of them two two british are in the beqaa what have they gone to do to pick grapefruit there is nothing in this matter that should amuse you major zvi dan stared coldly for a long time into the face of the duty brigadier the coldness came from the freshness of his memory two men battleclad their heavyweight bergen packs their bearded dark creamed faces their killing weapons in liaison with our military intelligence section the british have two men walking into the beqaa to get above that camp to identify the assassin of their ambassador to the soviet union to shoot that man it is the policy of israel major the policy of the country that pays your wage to hit the source fount of terrorism from that camp an attack was launched against your country it is expected and demanded of us that we strike back you scatter a few bombs about you may inflict casualties you may not it is expected of us you will break up the camp you will destroy a real chance of the killing of a single man whose death is important send that attack tomorrow morning and you ensure that two days later a brave pair of men will arrive at their target position to find nothing to fire upon brigadier how many times do you kill the people you want killed for all the phantoms all the bomb weight thank you major which means that i shall wake the chief of the air staff where will you be he wrote on his notepad his extension number he tore the page off handed it to the duty brigadier all night i make no promises i merely pass the problem higher the quiet returned to the room all of them at their desks and their consoles and tables and maps watched with the duty brigadier the flapping swing door and heard the uneven diminishing footfall the girl officer asked what do we owe the british sir with their arms embargo their criticism of us the duty brigadier said the british were going to hang my brother in when he was in the irgun they reprieved him hours before he was to go to the hangman i was a small boy then the first people that i learned to hate were the british soldiers who had captured and tortured my brother and twenty years later i was a guest at their staff college the staff college of the royal air force we owe them only what is best for us and that decision mercifully is not mine in the small night hours major zvi dans head lay on his hands that were spread on his desk the telephone was close beside him and stayed silent the end of the seventh hour of the first night march the time of the fourteenth rest moment at a rally point above them aloft on the steep slope were the lights of the village of meidoun at the previous rally point crane had shown the marking of the village on the map used the beta light for holt to see it and then crane had shaken his head as though the place was bad news holt knew that already crane had broken one of his bible laws the bible according to the prophet crane stated that they should not pass within a thousand yards of a village but no damned option they had been moving on the slope below the village and above the litani where it ran fast in a narrow gorge they were sandwiched it was a bastard place and the rules were broken on the far side of the gorge holt could follow the movement of headlights snaking on the road going north to the west was a shia village below them was the rushing river to the east was the main military road holt heard a stone fall he heard a stone dislodged below him after the long silence of the walk in the night his hearing was clearer than he had ever known he froze crane beside him had half risen crane was now a bent statue there were the sounds of more stones slipping on the slope below crane showed holt the palm of his hand the gesture that he should not move there were the sounds of a young shrill whistling voice and then the sharp bark of a dog the whistling and the barking and the falling stones were closer cranes hand was on holts shoulder urging him down down until his face ate at the cool dust of the rock slope god was this where it ended not a third of the way in not eight miles from the jumpoff pray god that it didnt end because a village kid had gone after rabbits with his dog down to the scrub at the side of the litani river he tried to control the pace of his breathing breathing was another of the chapters of cranes bible everything was down to control of breathing keeping it regular keeping it smooth swallowing it down he smelled the boy first then he saw him the smell was of urine and animal fodder it was a fecund sweet smell no cigarette taste in his mouth nor the cloy of toothpaste nor the scent of soap on his face he could smell the boy clearly moments before he saw him at first the boy was a shadow shape the boy materialised as a wraith out of the darkness below but coming fast climbing easily on a steep pathway running down from the village to the river gorge it was the moment it could all end a shout would have been heard in the village a scream would have roused the village a fear yell would have brought the men of the village running scrambling for their weapons and there was the dog the dog was close to the heels of the boy skipping after him then stopping to sniff or lift a hind leg then catching the boy he knew that each village was an arsenal each village community would have automatic rifles and rocket propelled grenade launchers and machine guns he wondered if crane had his hand on the whipcord handle of his knife he could follow the line of the boys climb he saw that the boy with the dog at his heels would pass less than a dozen yards from them he tried to slow his breathing tried to master the battering heave of his heartbeat the boy was level with them no break in his pace the boy was unaware of them long seconds in the life of young holt didnt want to look didnt want to see had closed his eyes didnt want to know the moment of discovery if that were to be their fate if crane knifed the boy then the boy would be missed and searched for and when he was found then the trail of his killers would be tracked the rock that seemed to penetrate into the flesh of his groin grew sharper more cutting with each moment that he lay prone on it he was against cranes body and there was not the slightest flicker of movement his bladder seemed to have filled to aching point there was the first whisper of cramp behind his knee there was a dried leaf teasing at his nostril he wanted to pee wanted to jerk his leg straight wanted to sneeze and if he wet himself or moved his leg or sneezed then the mission was gone before it had begun he heard the growl of the dog the boy was above them going quickly the boy called for the dog to catch him holt fractionally opened his eyes the dog was two three yards from them the dog was thin as a rake brindle brown he reckoned and back on its haunches in defence and growling at crane the boy threw a stone and called louder for the dog the growl was a rumble of suspicion his bladder was bursting cramp pain spreading his sneeze rising the dog yelped the second stone thrown by the boy hit it square in the neck the boy raised his voice to shout for the dog to come he heard the sounds going away he heard the sounds of the boy and his dog dwindling away up the hillside path he lay on his face he felt only exhaustion he felt too tired to know relief he felt cranes hand on his shoulder pulling at him to get upright cranes mouth was at his ear a near silent whisper weve time to make up did i do all right that wasnt militia not soldiers just a kid that was nothing crane rose to his feet headed away holt let him go fifteen paces then took his own first step he remembered the words of the song mouthed them silently to himself wish me luck as you wave me goodbye wish me luck wish me luck wish me luck and he seemed to hear her voice dont be childish holt he thought that he hated himself he could have seen the boy knifed to death he had never seen the face of the boy he did not know the name of the boy he was totally ignorant of the boy and he could have cheered if crane had felt the need to slide his shortbladed knife into the stomach of the boy if crane had drawn the sharp steel across the throat of the boy if the boy had turned off the path if the boy had come to see why his dog growled then holt would have cheered the boys murder as if a sea change had passed through him as if he were no longer the man who had complained to noah crane about the torture of a palestinian he was dirtied in his soul he could remember like yesterday when he was ten years old three days past his tenth birthday and he had been walking with a holiday friend beside the river that ran close to his home he had found a fox with a hind leg held by the thin cutting wire of a rabbit snare there had been a blood smear around the wire a little above the joint of the hind leg of the dog fox where the wire had worked deep through the fur and skin below the wire the hind leg hung at a silly angle he had known and he was only three days past his tenth birthday that the dog fox was beyond saving because the leg was impossibly damaged and he could not have freed it anyway because the dog fox snarled its teeth at him and at his friend and would have bitten either of them if they had come close enough to release the other end of the wire from the hazel stump around which it was wound they had taken smoothed rocks from the river shore and they had thrown them at the fox until they had stunned it could approach it and with more stones they had battered the fox to death all the time that he had killed the fox he had cried out loud he could still remember how he had cried childlike in his bedroom that night and now he could have cheered if the boy had been knifed he followed crane more of the crane bible he kept his eyeline to the right of crane so that the moving shape was in the periphery of his vision crane had said that that way he would see better he was learning he was changing every late spring and every late autumn the ambassador of the united states entertained the prime minister of the united kingdom to dinner in the splendour of the official residence in londons regents park for those two evenings of the year the lights blazed the drink flowed the hospitality was warm it was the style of these two evenings that the prime minister would attend in the company of selected cabinet ministers with responsibilities particularly affecting relationships across the drain along with principal industrialists with commercial links to the united states on the american side a secretary of state would make the flight across the atlantic they were social occasions primarily but permitted the free exchange of ideas and views a warm damp night a fog rising from the parks grasslands the mist outside was thickened in the driveway by the exhaust fumes of the chauffeurdriven cars the night air was rich with good humour noisy with guests making their farewells the prime minister warmly shook the hand of the ambassador a wonderful evening as always a good night for a celebration prime minister below the steps the branch men surrounded the prime ministers car the lit interior beckoned there was the warble of the radio link in the police backup car if there was a weakness in the make up of the evening it was that the ambassador and the prime minister had sat at dinner at opposite ends of the table had barely exchanged words you have the advantage over me what is there in particular to celebrate an american triumph in the war against terrorism were very proud ive wanted to tell you all evening what triumph we have an air force base at vicenza in northern italy two nights ago our base security american personnel picked up a lebanese male on the perimeter fence he was in a hide and checking out the wire security with a pnv pocket scope sorry thats passive night vision our guys whipped him straight inside straight into the guard house the branch men fidgeted other guests stood respectfully out of earshot and in line to offer their thanks what do the italians say theres the beauty of it about now my colleague down in rome will be informing the italians that our captive is currently on a usaf transporter and heading stateside no messing this time but im jumping i havent got to the choice part the guest line grew the prime ministers driver switched off the engine of the rover the choice part is this t w a flight rome to athens in the spring of an explosion at feet takes a hunk out of the fuselage through which four passengers are sucked three of those four are american citizens the source of the explosion was under a seat occupied by a lebanese woman who had hidden the explosives before getting off in rome okay youre with me choice bit that woman boarded at cairo for the leg to rome she was seen off by a male tagged as palestinian we have his description we have his finger marks on the ticket stubs left at cairo t w a checkin we have him as the organiser and the woman just as the courier that man is one and the same as the joker on the fence at vicenza the prints match that bastard is up in a big bird right now prime minister hes going to andrews base then a tight little military cell thats why you can join me in celebration remarkable the prime minister said softly youll remember what the president said he said to these swines you can run but you cannot hide thats what were proving its the first time were able to put deeds to words make action out of talk we reckon this to be the turning point in the war against international terrorism youre not cold prime minister not cold its the first time this has happened and its the first time that counts sam leads the way sam is first in thats our celebration a fine stroke of luck the prime minister said distantly in this game you earn your luck look weve known for a year this man was in and out of lebanon in damascus or in the beqaa valley we went through all the military evaluations about getting a force into the beqaa to drop him there cant be done no way the beqaa would swallow a marine division that was our best advice and even if we got in wed never get out youre very well informed secondhand my number three here was in beirut previously we would have faced the risk of prisoners being paraded through damascus hell of a mess going into lebanon wasnt on thats diversion its being the first that matters prime minister not at your expense of course but were feeling very comfortable at this moment very bullish you see what really matters is not just confronting these people its putting them into court assassination is small beer when set against the full rigour of a court of law the prime minister smiled congratulation and walked away down the steps to the car the engine coughed the doors slammed shut the car pulled away trailed by the backup the prime ministers age showed the tiredness of office and responsibility there was a long sigh of weariness inform my office to have the director general stand by ill be calling him from downing street as soon as i get there the prime minister sagged back in the seat the branch man in the front passenger seat relayed the instruction what have you to do the private secretary asked quietly i just have to cancel something nothing for you to worry about he had been dreaming of the fish he would catch in the sleeping recesses of his mind was the recollection of the conversation he had had in the guest house bar with a tractor driver from the kibbutz kfar giladi not a fast river to fish in but a fish farm pond not flies nor lures for bait but worms from a compost heap and to hell with tradition percy martins dreamed of tight lines until the bell exploded in his ear like a big rainbow jumping he groped he found the light he lifted the telephone martins is that a secure line no d g here god good evening sir good morning percy our friends where are they gone can you reach them no why not martins sat straight up in his bed because sir they have no ah telephone as it is they are carrying in excess of eighty pounds weight i would hazard sir that you or i could barely lift eighty pounds weight let alone walk a long way with it thank you percy thats all the detail i need just confirm for me that youve some means of communicating with them in case you wanted them back in a hurry thats not on sir in fact its quite out of the question weve no means at all thank you percy keep up the good work and goodbye martins replaced the telephone he switched off his light he could not find again for his mind the pleasure of an arching rod he thought of two men struggling through the night moving further from safety and he was damned pleased those two men carried no radio transmitterreceiver were beyond recall slowly like a cat beside a fireplace that is minutely disturbed major zvi dan opened his eyes he looked from just above his hands across the room the girl rebecca sat on the one easy chair in the room a new book was in her hands message she shook her head he grimaced there is nothing more i can do if i go higher then i antagonise you have to wait coffee he moved his hand declined they would not be drinking coffee noah crane and holt who were heading towards the beqaa if they hit the tent camp i quit if they bomb that camp theyll have my resignation she looked at him curiously why does it matter to you because because major zvi dan rubbed hard to clear his eyes of sleep he coughed at the phlegm in his throat because because of that boy because of holt he shouldnt be there he is not equipped to be there it would be a crime if we screwed up their effort he let his head fall back to his hands his eyes closed beside him the telephone stayed silent prime minister they cannot be recalled because they have no radio transmitterreceiver each of them without a radio transmitterreceiver is carrying in excess of eighty pounds weight i would hazard that you or i could barely lift eighty pounds weight let alone walk across country with it the prime minister sat in a thick dressing gown before the dead fire in the private sitting room the director general had lit his pipe was careless of the smoke clouds he gusted around the small room they are not carrying a radio because a radio and reserve batteries would have increased each mans weight burden by at least pounds in addition radio transmissions however carefully disguised alert an enemy am i permitted to ask you what has undermined your enthusiasm for this mission the prime minister fumbled for words stumbled in tiredness the conversation with the american ambassador was reported the prime minister slumped in the chair i want them called back and you cannot have what you want four oclock in the morning the chimes of big ben carried on the squalling wind bending around the great quiet buildings of whitehall i was talked into something that i should never have allowed myself to accept we are an independent country we are not beholden to the opinions of the united states of america i was beguiled into something idiotic by you you told me that then you would claim my head the director general had no fear of the head of government a wintry smile would it be your head you are nervous for thats impertinent prime minister it would distress me to think that the sole reason for your authorising this mission was to enable you to brag to our cousins over the water you have made me a hostage to what to the fortune the fate of these two men think of ill think if they are captured think if they are paraded through damascus think what the syrian regime can make of that think of the humiliation for us the director general stabbed the air with his pipe item you listen to me this is nothing to do with point scoring over our american allies with boasting to the oval office listen to me your ambassador was assassinated that would be enough enough to justify much more destructive a response than this mission but miss jane canning was one of mine miss jane canning too was murdered i do not tolerate the murder of one of mine the arm of my vengeance reaches to the other side of the hill reaches to the throat of a wretched man who was stupid enough to murder miss jane canning do you hear me prime minister he towered above the prime minister he glowered into the face of the prime minister he sucked at his pipe he reached for his matches how soon will i know whether it is abu hamids head that is on a salver whether it is my head or yours the director general chuckled three or four days he let himself out the prime minister thought the door closing on his back was like the awakening from a nightmare exactly an hour before dawn they reached the first lying up position the lup had been chosen by crane from the aerial photographs the photographs of this stretch of upper ground high over the litani and the village of yohmor had shown no sign of troop tracks nor of grazing herds there was a mass of large jagged wind and snowfractured rocks they went past the lup moved on another two hundred yards and then looped back in a cautious circle according to cranes bible the way to make certain that they were not followed amongst the rocks crane helped holt to ease off the bergen for an hour they sat back to back alert listening and watching crane whispered i suppose you think youve earned some sleep holt was too tired to punch him too exhausted to laugh the dawn came fast a spreading wash of grey over the rough ridges of jabal bir ed dahr a new morning in lebanon abu hamid stretched spat onto the dirt floor beside his ramp bed and shook himself awake the light knifed through the poorly fastened join in the tent flaps he glanced across the short interior saw that fawzis bed had not been slept on there was never any explanation of fawzis coming and going abu hamid spat again then untied the strings that held the flaps together he yawned arcing his head back he had slept for seven hours and was still exhausted he had slept but not rested because his mind had turmoiled through the night scattering thoughts with the drive of an old engine his mind had clanked with memories spread out over many years of his life the sun beat into the tent his opening the flaps was a signal for the flies to begin their daily persecution from under his bed he took his personal roll of lavatory paper he had so little in the world that was his own he valued his personal lavatory paper so greatly he set off for the latrine the fire was alight in the cooking area there was the rich smell of a slowly simmering meat stew and the dry aroma of cooking bread he had chosen well with their cook a good boy who earned his absence from the firing range and from the daylong exercises out on the hill slopes and the wadis he might make every last one of them a fighter except the cook the cook would never be a fighter against israel but not one of the other recruits would prepare goat stew like this boy he deserved to be left to forage for wood to snare rabbits to dig out a cold store to go to the village to buy vegetables he walked by the cooking area he dipped a finger into the slowbubbling whirlpool of the pot he bowed his head he made a play of his satisfaction and the cook inclined his head with a wide grin to take the compliment there was a line of recruits waiting outside the latrines screen from yards away abu hamid could hear the howl of the flies his memories were of what he had been told of the times long past the times before he had been born of his grandfather who had been a corn merchant sufficiently successful to have owned a villa near to the sea in jaffa the town that was now called yafo by the zionists and which had been swallowed in the spread of tel aviv from the time he was a small child he had been told of his grandfathers home in what was now israel his father had told him that the building was now a restaurant serving italian food in his family there had been no photographs of the house but he had been told that the rooms led off a small courtyard that in the times long past had been shaded with a trellis of vines he had told his father once years back that he would one day set foot in that house he would stand in that courtyard or he would die on the route to that house his father had shrugged muttered the words if god wills and kissed his cheek as he had gone away to the ranks of the popular front his inherited memory told him that his grandfather and his grandmother and his father and his mother and his uncles and his aunts had been put out of their homes in jaffa in when the war had gone against the arab armies the house of his grandfather was left behind the grain storage warehouse in the docks had been forsaken and was plundered to feed the flood of jewish settlers arriving from europe abu hamid arrived at the line waiting to use the latrine he went to the front of the line he stood at the head and he yelled for the recruit inside to stir himself and get out his grandfather and the tribe that he led had settled in a refugee camp on the hills above jericho in the winter of he had learned of the hunger and cold and lack of shelter in the camp on the west bank of the jordan river of the lack of funds from the government of the boy king hussein of the lack of materials provided by the fledgling relief organisations his parents had been married in jaffa little more than children his father had worked for his grandfather in the accounts office of the business but their own first children had not been born until they had reached the damp cold of the refugee camp he had been told that he had been born in in a tent that his mother had nearly died of pneumonia after his birth the recruit came out of the latrine the smell billowed with him as if released from behind the screen he took a deep breath hurried inside he squatted over the pit he held his breath he clutched the roll of soft yellow paper the first memories were of the refugee camp of the fierce heat of the summers when the sun spread down from clear skies onto the dust and the rock of the hillside the chill and rain and winds of winter when the pathways of the camp were river races and the cesspool drains overflowed and there was no school for the kids and no place for them outside the wire on the edges of the camp there was a memory that was clear of the fighting on the hills above the camp when he was seven years old and the sight of the jordanian troops in retreat and the billowing dust clouds of the israeli tanks and half tracks in pursuit sharp memories now of his grandfather leading his tribe a further step away from the house that was now an italian restaurant they had joined the refugee swarm his feet blistered and his belly swollen in hunger that had crossed the allenby bridge over the river jordan under the guns of the israelis and climbed to new tents in a new camp on the outskirts of the city of amman there was the gleam of two pin heads of brightness two ruby red lights beaming at him the lights were in the shadow fold of the screen where it reached the ground around the pit he knew what he saw but he peered with fascination compulsion down at the lights until he saw the yellowed stumps of the bared teeth and the grey needles of the whiskers a rat the breath burned out of his body he had to gulp again for air foul air within the screen he watched the rat he prayed the rat would not go behind him where he would not be able to see whether it came closer to the dropped trousers at his ankles he picked at the scar well on his face he was afraid of the beady eyes of the rat with his trousers at his ankles he did not have the freedom to kick out at the rat he remembered the school in the camp called wahdat he could remember the encouragement of the blond haired teacher from switzerland and the care of the lady from france who ran a clinic in wahdat he could remember the day that the tanks of hussein had battered into wahdat he was ten years old his memory was quite clear he could picture in his mind the tortoise shapes of the tanks grinding into wahdat blasting at the school house which was built of concrete and therefore defended by the palestinian fighters hammering at the clinic because that too was defended as a fortress they were palestinians they were arabs they were the citizen families of wahdat their enemy was not the israelis their enemy was the army of an arab king he moved slowly he thought that a sudden movement might startle the rat provoke it they were memories that had denied him rest when he had slept in his tent ten years old and a refugee again his grandfather did not lead the tribe out of the wahdat camp his grandfather was buried in a shallow grave on the edge of the camp one amongst many his father led the exodus of the family away from amman the ten year old boy was of an age to know the glory of the struggle as fought by the popular front of doctor george habbash the popular front had brought the aircraft of the imperialist enemies to the desert landing strip at gakhanna they had brought to jordan the airliners of the americans and the british and the swiss a boy of ten years could understand the success of the popular front in capturing airliners of enemies but a boy of ten years did not understand that such a capture could be regarded as a legitimate provocation by the king of jordan justification for terminating the state within a state the palestinian autonomy inside the kingdom his grandfather was dead his grandmother was blinded the family tribe was again destitute again uprooted abu hamid was pale faced when he emerged from the latrine he left the rat to eye the next man he walked away towards the perimeter fence sucking in the clean air and it was the same each morning each morning he thought he would be sick throw up in front of the recruits when he came out of the latrine memories of the family settling in another tent on the edge of the rachadiye camp outside the lebanese coastal city of tyre the family tribe was a rolling stone tumbling from a tent at jericho to a tent at amman to a tent at tyre by the time he was aged by the timethat abu hamid took the oath of the popular front his unseeing grandmother had died it was the end of he knew all the events of that year he knew of the martyrdom of the comrades who had captured the savoy hotel in tel aviv and given their lives at cost to the enemy he knew of the heroism of the commando who had killed and wounded nearly a hundred enemy with his bomb in the cafe by zion square in jerusalem he knew of the men who had captured the opec conference and turned the eyes of the world on the suffering of the palestinian people he gazed out over the quiet hillside beyond the perimeter fence he watched the stillness he listened to the silence so great a stillness so great a silence as if the possibility of warfare did not exist his memories told him of the dispersal of his family tribe he did not know where were his uncles and his aunts his cousins his nephews and his nieces he knew that his brother two years older than himself had died fighting the israelis in at sidon he knew that his sister had been wounded at damour that same bitter summer he knew that his parents were besieged by the shia militia in the camp at rachadiye he walked slowly along the perimeter fence he saw the rat holes and the paper rubbish caught on the coiled wire since he had joined the popular front twelve years ago he had suffered the dream the dream was to walk the street in jaffa until he came to the house that was now an italian restaurant the dream was to put out of his grandfathers house those who had made a home into a restaurant put them out on the street and there bayonet them the dream was to take the hands of his father and mother and to lead them from rachadiye to jaffa and to take them to the house that had been his grandfathers and to give them the key and to tell them that what was rightfully theirs was theirs once more the dream was in his mind as he walked the fence when he had the dream he had strength the girl had given him the strength to dream of the house in jaffa the girl had taken the promise from him the promise to go to israel the promise to kill jews as if he had never wavered margarethe had fashioned the courage lor him to dream of walking on the street in jaffa he saw her in the badly lit dormitory for the orphans he was jolted from his thoughts he had stumbled against the rail post that marked the entrance to an air raid bunker abu hamid looked at the filled sleeping bag at the bottom of the steps he saw the black hair that was the crown of a head peeping from the bag his anger flashed he thought a recruit was hiding in the bunker to avoid duties he scratched up a handful of small stones threw them down on the head he heard the oath he watched the convulsive movement he saw fawzis face he almost laughed whatever his own instinctive anger had been was nothing set against the disturbed fury of the syrian officer i thought you were a malingerer abu hamid said i did not think to find our political liaison hiding in an air raid bunker that stuffs in my eye you sleep better there than in a bed are you a fool or are you still asleep are you telling me that if i dont take my sleeping bag into a bunker then i am a fool fawzi wriggled his shoulders clear of the bag he was shouting up from the dank dark of the bottom of the steps i was back late last night i walked into this place like it was a hotel on the beirut corniche try getting out of your bed in the night hero and try checking your sentries try counting how many are asleep i walked in here if i had been an enemy you would have been dead abu hamid sneered i thought we were under the protection of the omnipotent forces of the army of the syrian arab republic do you think so little of that protection that you sleep in a bunker when i sleep in this camp now that i am back with you i will sleep in a bunker until until what until the air raid what air raid then you are a fool abu hamid you are stupid give me the breadth of your wisdom even a fool knows there will be an air raid six days ago a bomb was exploded at the bus station in tel aviv a fool knows that each time there is a major attack inside israel that they retaliate with their aircraft or has abu hamid forgotten we have not yet had the air raid but do not think the israeli sleeps he never sleeps the israeli will bomb us the israeli has to find a target i do not want to be woken to the sound of you idiots trying to launch strelas trying to fire the dshkms i want to be able merely to crawl a few metres into the depths of a bunker should they strike our camp until they have bombed only an idiot would choose to sleep in a tent the fight was gone from abu hamid he asked quietly why our camp they died both of them they were not interrogated i am just careful because i am careful i will live to be an old man it is my intention to die in my bed abu hamid he saw the surprise cloud fast across the face of the old man on the steps of the oreanda hotel he saw the shock spread into the eyes of the girl who walked in front of him he could not know whether he was marked whether he was identified he trembled if we hide in holes in the ground we show them our fear fawzi rolled his bag climbed the steps belched and that to me is a small matter then you are a coward then i am a survivor abu hamid gazed into the clearness of the skies he saw an eagle wheel high on a thermal draft he saw the peace of the valley the telephone rang rebecca reached for the receiver she wrote on her notepad she never spoke she put down the telephone the chief of the air staff will see you in his office immediately she said and for loves sake tidy yourself so they both died brave boys they died in the cause of freedom the arab traveller shrugged he leaned against the wall of sandbags the marijuana had been passed a package hidden in rolled newspaper for circulation amongst the norbat platoon the traveller and hendrik olaffson talked quietly the other troops manning the unifil post were engaged in searching vehicles they talked without being overheard from our positien we were able to see the girl who came with the bomb on her donkey yesterday she had not come through our check she must have skirted us and gone across country but we could see her getting towards the sla and israeli block i tell you this friend they were waiting for her that is certain even before she came within sight they had moved their people back behind the fortifications as soon as she appeared when she was hundreds of metres away they were all behind cover for certain they were waiting for her ready for her a sweet child of courage hendrik olaffson murmured they had a marksman in position we worked it out afterwards they shot her at a range of at least one thousand metres one bullet one firing she went down then one more shot to detonate the donkey it was incredible shooting you are observant friend more i have more to tell you tell me last night just after dusk the israelis fired many flares to the west of our ops there was no artillery just flares now that is not usual for them yes often it is flares and then artillery but this time only the flares the traveller gestured with his hands i am just a humble traveller of the road while you friend are a trained and educated soldier what does the firing of the flares tell you the young norwegian leaned forward he did not say that the explanation offered for the firing of the flares was the opinion of his company commander a regular officer with the rank of captain and fourteen years in the military he gave it as his own they blinded our equipment if they believe there is an incursion of the palestinians or the hezbollah then they would also have fired shells they made useless our night viewing my assumption they acted to prevent us seeing what they were doing why should they do that my assumption again they were passing through the norbat area i offer you something else during the night no transport left the checkpoint for israel so there is no indication that men coming from lebanon were awaited and then taken back to israel i believe that the israelis were inserting a squad into lebanon you believe that i am certain of that friend you are a great help to the cause of freedom after he had drank the dregs of a mug of thick sweetened tea the traveller waved his farewell the marijuana was dispersed among the norbat men at the checkpoint hungrily broken down for sale onwards amongst those men of the battalion who needed the treated weed to make bearable service with unifil hendrik olaffson was becoming by the standards of a private soldier in the norwegian army a wealthy young man there was money in excess flowing inside norbat there were only occasional four day visits to tel aviv and more frequent evening visits to northern israel for the soldiers to spend their wages he kept his money norwegian bank notes hidden in a slit in the base of his kitbag he had neither a sense of guilt nor any fear of discovery thats him you are certain it is the one against the sandbags no doubts i am certain for three days the two men from shin bet had escorted the tall arab teenager ibrahim from vantage point to vantage point on the extremes and slightly into the u n i f i l sector controlled by norbat the shin bet men were both fluent arab speakers both armed with uzi submachine guns all the time one of them was linked by handcuffs to ibrahim they were a kilometre and a half from the norbat checkpoint on rough raised ground and across a valley from the sandbagged position it was of no surprise to the shin bet men that the teenager was eager to cooperate in their investigation it was their experience that the fervour of an attacking commando was quickly dissipated by the despair brought on by capture the interrogators who had beaten kicked punched the initial information out of ibrahim had been replaced days before they had done their work they were not a part of the new scene around the teenager in his early statements between the screams of course ibrahim had told the interrogators how he and mohammed had reached israel had told them of the u n i f i l lorry for the last three days aided by high powered zeiss binoculars the two shin bet men and their prisoner had scoured through the magnifying lenses for the driver of the u n i f i l lorry the binoculars showed a well built and pleasant faced young soldier with a shock of fair hair streaming from below a jauntily worn blue beret absolutely certain that is the one who drove the lorry to tel aviv they praised the teenager they made him believe they were his friends they made a pretence to him that his future might lie other than in a maximum security wing of the ramla gaol they led him back into the security zone they drove him into israel with his head masked by a blanket when they had returned to their base reported their findings a second team was infiltrated forward to maintain surveillance from a distance on the norwegian soldier i gather that last night dan you went barging into air operations demanding that a mission be cancelled correct sir the chief of air staff looked coolly at major zvi dan i assume this was not a flippant request it is critical that the mission be cancelled they fly in ten minutes criminal unless i am given reason for cancellation you have one minute dan major zvi dan looked at the face of his watch he waited for the second hand to climb to the vertical first a raid on the camp from which the bus station bombers were launched will tell the popular front military command that at least one of their men has been raptured and successfully interrogated which would lead to the dispersal of the camp second such a dispersal would mean the disappearance of abu hamid the popular front commander at the camp third last night a twoman team left israel to walk into the beqaa with the specific and only task of sniping abu hamid who was the murderer with syrian connivance of the british ambassador in the soviet union fourth the team is british and our country needs friends where it can find them if we foul that mission we hardly have great britain in our palm fifth a planned snipe offers a greater guarantee of taking out a known and effective terrorist whereas an airstrike may kill some secondgrade recruits but offers no certainty of success sixth i would hate two very brave men one a jew to walk into that danger for nothing he paused the second hand of his watch crawled again to the vertical he breathed in deeply the chief of the air staff reached for his telephone lifted it waited for a moment for it to be answered he glanced at the major his smile wintry the tasking of callsign sierra delta the target should be the second option the telephone was replaced thank you sir you should not thank me you should thank your own major general last week i attended a briefing given by our head of intelligence in his address he referred back to what he had said at the time of the synagogue massacre in istanbul where jewish lives were taken by the abu nidal group at the time he said and he repeated it for us you cannot lash out blindly this is not a war of days weeks even months those responsible will be pursued to the ends of the earth but we must have a clear address before we act then act we will i appreciated what he said you have an address you have a name i pray to god that you can deliver to that address major zvi dan ducked his head in acknowledgement he walked out of the office he felt a huge exhaustion sweeping over him holt lay in the rock cleft and slept he was huddled tight a foetus in the womb his knees up and as close to his chest as the bulky shapes on his belt would allow the sun was rising close to its zenith but he had discarded none of his clothes nor his chukka boots a lightweight blanket was laid over him he was too tired to dream he lay in the black abyss of sleep from a short distance the fact that two men rested up in the rock cleft could not have been spotted neither could it have been seen from the air as this small gap in the yellowed rock was covered by a drape of olive green scrim netting his bergen pack was beside his shoulder he was not allowed to sleep against it for fear that his body weight could damage the contents holt woke when crane shook his shoulder there was the moment when he did not know where he was there were the few seconds of slow understanding not in his bed in the doctors house on exmoor not in his bed in the london flat not in his bed in the moscow apartment not in his bed in the tel aviv hotel cranes hand was relentless on his shoulder urging him awake because they were trapped under the scrim net the fumes of the hexamine solid fuel cubes permeated to his nostrils the fumes told holt where he was the first time in the hike in the occupied territories that he had known the hexamine stench under the scrim netting he had nearly gagged he heard the bubbling of the water time for a brew up youngster he saw the two tea bags cavorting in the boiling water how long have i been out i let you have two hours you looked like you needed two hours i can do the same as you no chance crane dismissed him they spoke in low whispers each time crane spoke holt had to lean towards him to understand what he said crane passed him the canteen and began to anoint himself with the mosquito cream holt drank fast from the scorching tea burned the soft tissue on the inside of his mouth gulped while he was smearing the cream on to his skin surfaces crane was tracking with his binoculars backwards and forwards searching over the ground below them around them clear so far holt handed back the canteen i want to pee where do i go you dont just go for a walk where you roll on your side you undo your flies and you piss simple then i have to sleep on it and sit on it then you get to learn to piss when its dark before we settle and before we move off thats when you piss and thats when you crap like i showed you and wake me in an hour and dont do anything stupid just do what ive told you if ive had two hours sleep you can have two you think ill sleep two hours knowing youre watching my back crane was gone blanket over his head curled into a ball breathing regular the low growl of a snore god and it was blessed uncomfortable in the cleft he must have been dead tired to be able to sleep on those rocks and a separate ache was in every inch of his side in his shoulder and in his ribs and in his hip and in his thigh before before he had known what it was to walk through a night and to get to a lying up position for the day he would have thought that night was the enemy and daytime was the ally not any more night was the friend darkness was the accomplice at night and in darkness he could melt into the shadows he was on his feet and able to move daylight was the bastard in daylight he was trapped down into the cleft of two rocks and he couldnt stand and he couldnt walk the cover was waist high and if he stood or he walked then he would be seen for a long time he looked across the few inches at crane christ wouldnt he have liked to have woken him talked to him not half a chance of that just time for a few words in the moments between sleeping and sentry duty and another few words before moving off and another few words before lying up for duylight it was a bastard and he watched the calm heave of cranes breathing first job of the day cranes bible holt laid out the six magazines for the armalite which were carried between them only five were loaded holts job was to change the thirty rounds of ammunition from one magazine to another so that each time he carried out the manoeuvre a different magazine would be left empty cranes bible said that magazines left full led to the weakening of the spring cranes text said that most firing failures were in fact magazine failures the first time in the occupied territories it had taken holt close to an hour to reload the rounds now he was going at twice that pace second job of the day clean with dry cloth and graphite grease the outside surfaces of the armalite and the model pm cranes text said that cleaning oil should never be used because it would leave a smoke signature of burned off oil in the firing heat he checked that the condoms were tightly fastened over the barrels of the two weapons he was painfully hungry might have sold his mother for a bar of chocolate well pawned her for sure cranes bible said no sweets to suck because when you sucked sweets you also bit them and when you bit them you made such a noise in your head that you knocked out your hearing no boiled sweets he had had a biscuit and a piece of cream cheese before going to sleep they would have their main meal at the end of the afternoon crane had said the old goat had said it would be a proper bloody feast crane had said that it was a good thing to be hungry that hunger bred alertness he heard them a long way off he thought he could hear the aircraft from a hell of a long way off because he was so hungry through the squares of the scrim net he thought he could see the silver shapes leading the run of the vapour trails flying south to north it was strangely disconcerting to him to know that israeli aircraft were overhead flying free while young holt was down on his backside in the cleft in the rock he watched the trails until they were gone from sight he had the binoculars he looked down on the village of yohmor he could see the men moving listlessly between the houses and the coffee shop in the centre of the village he could see children scampering down to the litani river to swim and dive between the rock cleft and the river he could see a lad herding sheep tough little blighters and surefooted scrambling towards a small plateau where water must be held or where there must be a spring because there was green on the handkerchief of level ground beyond yohmor higher up the far valley was the winding road it was the dirt cloud that he noticed first and then the rumble of the engines travelled across the valley to him six tank transporters each loaded and a couple of lorries and a couple of jeeps through the glasses he studied the tanks with the glasses he could see the unit markings on the turrets he had never seen tanks before not the oton main battle tank jobs he saw the long lean barrels of the tanks holt seemed to crush himself down against the rock base of the cleft over the battlefield had flown two pairs of multi million pound strike aircraft across the battlefield were being hauled six tank monsters they were the bloody currency of the battlefield holt wasnt holt was just ordinary holt didnt even know how to fire a damned armalite crane slept holt hadnt known anyone who could sleep as easily as crane before right the man kicked and he stirred right the man snored but he slept crane coughed guttural he turned from his side to ins back and then shook himself coughed again holt would speak to him about that crane moved onto his other side have to speak to the prophet crane about making so much noise coughing holt would enjoy that hed enjoy it because he could pull a suitably aggrieved lace and say in all seriousness that cranes coughing was putting the mission in jeopardy so still holt not moving holt grabbing to halt his breathing not daring to move not daring to breathe cranes heel had moved the stones holt watched the snake emerge from its disturbed hole crane had been lying on the stones and hidden under the stones had been the snake holt had a knife in his belt he had the binoculars in his hand cranes body rolled if crane sagged again on to his back then he would lie on the snake holt had had all the books when he was a kid holt knew his snakes there were snakes on exmoor kids always knew about snakes sawscaled viper echis carinatus vicious a killer common all over north africa the middle east across to the subcontinent the snake slithered slowly over the rock at the small of cranes back god dont let him roll god dont let the old goat cough the snake was a little less than two feet long it was sandy brown with pale blotches and mahogany brown markings holt saw the flicker of the snakes mouth he thought crane slept deeply he thought that if he called to him to wake that he would start in a sudden movement he couldnt lean across to him couldnt hold him as he woke him because to lean forward would mean to cover the snake with his body the damn thing settled the bloody thing stopped moving sunshine filtering through the scrim net two warm stones for the snake holt thought the snakes head the snakes mouth were four or perhaps five inches from the small of cranes back couldnt go for his knife to go for his knife was to twist his body to unhook the clasp that secured the knife handle to draw the knife out of the canvas sheath three movements before the critical movement the strike against the neck of the snake couldnt use his knife crane grunted holt saw the muscle tighten under the light fabric of cranes trousers the old goat readying himself to roll the prophet winding himself up to change position the bible according to crane when youve got something to do do it when youve got to act stop pissing about holt looked at his hand quite surprised him his hand was steady shouldnt have been should have been shaking his hand was firm do it stop pissing about the snakes head was over a stone he marked the spot in his mind the spot was an inch from the snakes head one chance for holt like the one chance that crane would have when he fired his hand was a blur the binoculars were a haze of movement he felt the bridge of the binoculars bite against the inch thick body of the snake all the power he had in him driving against the thickness of the snake at a point an inch behind the snakes head the body and the tail of the snake were thrashing against his arm curling on his wrist cold and smoothed dry the mouth of the snake was striking against the plastic covering of the binocular lenses he saw the spittle fluid on the plastic when the movements had lessened when the body and the tail no longer coiled his arm he took his knife from his belt and sawed off the head of the snake at the place where it was held against the stone by the bridge of the binoculars the head fell away with his knife blade holt urged the head down between the stones he was trembling he saw the blade flash in front of his eyes he could not hold the blade still his hands were beginning to shake his eyes were misted holt heard the growl whisper can i move now you can move what was it sawscaled viper i can move you can get into a dance routine if you want to cranes head emerged from under the blanket steadily he looked around him holt saw that when crane focused on the snakes body sawn to a stump that he bit at his lip holt moved the stones with the tip of his knife blade exposed the snakes head and the bite on cranes lip was tighter do you fancy a brew youngster holt nodded youngster dont let anyone ever tell you that you arent all right when they had eaten when they had wiped clean their canteens and stowed them again in their belt pouches crane talked his voice was always a whisper low pitched there were times that holt interjected his questions and in the excitement of the communication he lost control of the pitch in his chords and then crane would silently wag a finger to show his disapproval but the disapproval was no longer the put down it was as if young holt had proved himself in cranes eyes they sat back to back with the food eaten the daytime sleeping was finished their heads were close mouth to ear in close proximity the debris of the food wrapping had been collected by holt and put into the plastic bag reserved for rubbish it would be dark in an hour when it was dark they would wait a further hour to acclimatise their eyes and ears to the night then they would move off crane faced down into the gorge and watched the main road leading into the beqaa at their next lying up position they would be overlooking the valley holts attention was on the steep slopes above and to the west looking into the sun that would soon clip the summits on the jabal niha and the jabal el barouk that were six thousand feet above sea level they were for holt moments of deep happiness mostly he listened mostly crane talked whispered crane talked of sniper skills and survival skills and of map reading skills and of evasion skills he took holt through the route of the coming night march his finger hovering over but never touching the map he showed him the next lup and he showed him then the track they would follow for the third of the night marches and where they would make the final lup on the ground above the tent camp he showed him by which way they would skirt the high village above the valley of khirbet qanafar how they would be sandwiched between khirbet qanafar and the twin village of kafraiya he showed him where above them on the jabal el barouk was positioned the sensitive syrian listening and radar post he showed holt on the map from where he would shoot with the sun behind him with the sun in the eyes of those in the camp happiness for holt because he had won acceptance he was trusted and you want him dead mr crane just a soldier being paid to do what im told being paid a hell of a lot a chicken shit price for what im doing im not being paid holt said your problem youngster i saw your room back at base camp i couldnt see what youd spend your money on crane smiled expressionless but there was a sharp glint in his eyes too long to tell you about a curtain fell in that moment then cranes face moved holt saw the flicker of regret he thought a scalpel had nudged a root nerve have you ever been paid before to kill a man just taken my army pay have you killed many men mr crane youngster i dont notch them up i do what im paid to do i try to be good at what im paid for doing is it a few men is it a lot of men that youve killed sort of between the two youngster holt watched him watched the way he casually cleaned the dirt out from behind his nails then abandoned that began to use a toothpick in his mouth is it different killing a man in battlefield conditions to killing a man that youve stalked marked out to me no do you think about the man youre going to kill at long range do you wonder about him about whether hes guilty or hes innocent not a lot it would worry me sick lets hope you never have to worry yourself look at you youre privileged youre educated youre smart people like you dont get involved in this sort of dirt this time i have most times people like you pay jerks to get these things done got me but dont you feel anything i kind of cover my feelings that way they dont get to spit in your face whats your future mr crane again the quiet smile whats yours youngster holt was watching a bird like an eagle soar towards the summits above him a beautiful magnificent bird he thought it must be from the family of eagles no flap of the wings just the drifting glide of power freedom he grinned i suppose we get out of here or i wouldnt have come i dont buy one way tickets i came and i aim to leave ill go back to england then i have to make the big decision of where the next move is i can stay in foreign and commonwealth as if nothing had ever happened as if jane canning hadnt existed or i can quit i could walk out on them i could teach go into business now i dont know where i came from is rough wild country its at peace nothing ever happens down there in our village if they knew i was in lebanon well half of them wouldnt know where it was youre lucky to have options crane said whats your future im getting old for this rubbish the bird was brilliant against the fall of the sun the light in the gorge behind him was greying the bird was the size of the lofty buzzards that he knew from exmoor what does an old sniper do in his retirement sits at the pavement cafes on dizengoff listens to all the talk and has nothing to say you cant boast about my work my work never existed an old sniper in retirement youngster is a lonely bastard come to england crane snorted where i live youd like that leave it holt he persisted it would be fantastic for you he smiled as he planned cranes retirement you could work for the water people a bailiff on the salmon runs you could be a gamekeeper its a huge park area they need rangers for t h a t youre all right youngster but not all right enough to organise me youll have the money to set yourself up you could buy the moneys spoken for he searched for the bird couldnt find the damned thing his eyes raked the crest of the hill he looked into the sun he cursed eternal damnation in noah cranes bible was to look directly into light self inflicted blindness crane said its a difficult walk tonight youngster its where we can hit syrian regular army patrols or hezbollah or just shia village trash tonight it starts to get serious i hear you mr crane there was the start of a blister coming on his left heel holt didnt mention it nor did he speak of the sores coming on his shoulders from the bergen straps he started to change the rounds in the magazines for the armalite later when it was fully dark he would move away from the rock cleft and squat down and then he would learn to wipe his backside with a smooth stone bloody well looking forward to that wasnt he the deal was struck in the hallway of the house not that heinrich gunter knew of this transaction heinrich gunter banker from europe with a fine apartment and a salary and pension scheme to match lay tightly bound on the cellar floor below the hallway he knew he was in a cellar because almost as soon as he had been brought in from the street he had been bustled down a stairway he was still blindfolded his wrists were securely tied behind his back there was lashed rope biting into the skin of his ankles he had lost his spectacles when he had been hauled out of the taxi his tongue could run on the chipped edge of his broken tooth behind the swelling of his bruised lip in the hallway of the house gunter was sold on there was a gentle irony that amongst the men who regarded the united states of america as the great satan the currency of the transaction should be american dollars cash for american dollars the swiss banker became the property not of the freelancing adventurers who had kidnapped him but of the party of god the hezbollah the money was passed in a satchel hands were shaken kisses exchanged within a few minutes the time taken to swill a bottle of flat warm pepsicola the cellar had been opened and gunter lifted without ceremony or consideration up the steps into the street down into the boot of a car he was in darkness in terror half choking on the exhaust fumes because the information provided by the traveller moved raw and unprocessed by any other intelligence officer direct to the desk of major said hazan the call that he made gave him pure satisfaction in the syrian arab republic of today there are many competing intelligence agencies that of course was the intention of the president that they should compete that each should derive pleasure from a coup it is the belief of the president that competing powers deny any single agency too great an influence too considerable an apparatus might threaten the stability of the presidents regime but the president had been a pilot and in the syrian arab republic of today the intelligence gathering organisation of the air force ranks supreme major said hazan used his second telephone this telephone was the one with a scrambler device and gave him a secure line to the military headquarters at chtaura on the west side of the beqaa the interception of the girl with the donkey leads us to believe that the enemy has an agent free in the beqaa also that this agent has frequent communications with a controller an especial vigilance is required he drew deeply on his cigarette he smoked only american marlboro that were brought to him free of charge by the toad fawzi major said hazan thought of him as no better than a reptile to be squashed under foot because he had never faced combat he brought major said hazan cigarettes and much more in return for his licence to move backwards and forwards between beirut the beqaa and damascus the toad was a kept man as much a harlot as his own foreign sweet pet we also have reason to believe that some hours ago the enemy infiltrated a group from a checkpoint north west of marjayoun into the norbat area between the villages of blat and kaoukaba it is to be presumed that this group has gone through the norbat sector and will be moving towards the beqaa maximum effort is to be given to the interception of this group in front of him the desk was clear his papers and most particularly the plan of the defence ministry on kaplan in tel aviv were locked away in his safe his evening was free for his sweet pet the good fingers of his left hand toyed with the clip fastening of the leather box he thought the pendant the sapphire jewel and the diamond gems would be beautiful on the whiteness of her throat the pendant had cost him nothing there were many merchants in damascus who sought the favour of major said hazan i would stress that both these matters have the highest priority we shall be watching for results he saw nothing strange nothing remotely amusing in the fact that he handed down instructions for action to a full brigadier of the army major said hazan was air force intelligence if the spy were caught and the incursion group intercepted it would be the triumph of major said hazan if they were not caught it would be the failure of headquarters in the beqaa now for his sweet pet the only woman who did not stare at him did not flinch they came back by truck abu hamid was the first off the tail board as the chief instructor he had the right to wash first he was filthy the dust caked his face his uniform denims were smeared black from handling the collapsed beams that had caught fire he had seen the results of air raids in tyre sidon damour and in west beirut but that had been years before many years since he had stood in a line of men manhandling the sharp debris of fallen concrete many years since he had helped to manoeuvre the heavy chains of the cranes that alone could lift whole precast floors that had fallen in the blast of the high explosive they had been ten miles to the north they had tunnelled into a ruin in the village of majdel aanjar once the building had been a hotel until that morning the building had been the sleeping quarters of a unit of the popular struggle front they had been amongst many digging at the rubble gently pulling out the bodies there had been squads of the army with heavy lifting equipment there had been the local people there had been men of the democratic front and the abu moussa faction and from saiiqa those from the democratic front and the abu moussa faction and saiiqa had been trucked in as much to help in the recovery of the casualties as to witness the damage done by the air strike of the enemy when they had finished when the light was failing abu hamid had called his own recruits together forcefully lectured them on the barbarity of the zionist oppressors told them that their time would come when they would be privileged to strike back he was heading for his tent he was shouting for the cook to bring him warm water he was intent on dragging off his clothes he rounded one of the bell tents he saw fawzi sitting in front of the flaps of his own lent abu hamid said from what i saw you could have been sleeping in the bunker and you would not have been saved fawzi said tonight i sleep in our tent the zionist gesture has been made it was horrific pieces of people we are lucky that our comrades martyred themselves or it would have been us abu hamid said we are the more determined we will never give up our struggle tell that to them in damascus tell them yourself hero there is transport coming for you in the morning inside his tent abu hamid stripped off his filthy clothes he stood naked the galvanised bucket of warm water was brought into his tent he thought of the orphan children he thought of the mutilated bodies he could not believe that he had ever hesitated through fear he thought of his grandfathers home he thought of the blood that would gush from a bayonet wound i dont have any feelings for him holt said for who crane helped him to ease the weight of the bergen high onto his shoulders for abu hamid i dont loathe him and i dont feel pity for him better that way if im going to help to kill him then i should feel something feelings get in the way of efficiency crane said they moved out there was a faint light from the stars to guide them it was the boast of the technicians who worked in the small fortified listening post astride the top of the third highest peak of the hermon range that they could eavesdrop the telephone call by the president of syria from his office in damascus to his mother telling her when he would call to take a cup of lemonscented tea with her the listening post of prefabricated cabins and heavy stone fort circles was feet above sea level in the yom kippur it had been captured the girl technicians had been raped slaughtered the boy technicians had been mutilated tortured murdered on the last day of the fighting after a battle of intense ferocity the listening post had been recaptured the listening post was of immense strategic and tactical value to the military machine of israel beneath its antennae was the most sophisticated electronic intelligence gathering and signals equipment manufactured in the united states of america and in the states own factories the listening post was situated some miles from damascus and some miles from chtaura on the western side of the beqaa alley the hermon range marked the north eastern extremity of israelite conquests under the leadership of moses and joshua the eyes of moses the ears of joshua that was how the presentday technicians regarded their steepling antennae towers concreted into the bed rock of the mountain top the problem lay not with the interception of telephone and radio messages from damascus to military headquarters at chtaura more in the analysis and evaluation carried on far behind the lines inside the state of israel of the mass twoway traffic in full flow untreated data swarmed from damascus and the beqaa to the radials of the antennae before the computers of the defence ministry on kaplan attempted to make sense from the jargon of coded radio messages scrambled telephone conversations some communications received by the eyes of moses and the ears of joshua were more complicated in their deciphering than others a telephone call from damascus to chtaura via a scrambled link offered small scope for interpretation but radio messages fanning out from chtaura to battalionsized commando units stationed at rachaiya and qaraaoun and aitanit gave easier work to the computers the orders coming from chtaura to rachaiya and qaraaoun and aitanit made plain to the local commanders that their origin was damascus the orders were acted upon that night patrols were intensified road blocks were strengthened it had been the intention of major zvi dan to work late in his office to delve into the small hillock of paper that had built up on his desk while he had been in kiryat shmona behind him was a wasted day he had failed to beat off the lethargy that had clamped down on him after the tension of his early morning battle to have the airstrike diverted he was slow with his work but he would work through the night and then return to kiryat shmona in the morning the girl rebecca had gone home sometimes when she was gone he felt as crippled by her absence as he was crippled by the loss of his leg he read for the third time the evaluation by the central intelligence agency newly arrived of a preliminary debrief of a palestinian captured in northern italy israel for so long had stood alone in the front line of the war against international terrorism that it amused him to notice how the western nations were now queuing to demonstrate their virility he could remember the carping response of those same nations when the iaf had intercepted a libyan registered gulfstream executive jet en route from tripoli to damascus intelligence had believed abu nidal to be aboard the previous month the jackals of abu nidal had killed and wounded civilians at the checkin counters at the airports of rome and vienna those western countries had issued their sanctimonious disapproval because the intelligence had been ill founded he could recall numerous instances of public criticism from the government of the united kingdom for israeli retaliatory strikes yet now they had men slogging into the beqaa of course it had been bluff he would never have resigned of course he would just have gone back to his desk and started to work again had the jets hit the tent camp he knew no life other than the life of defending his country had he been a christian and he had many friends who were christians then he would have said that that was the cross he had to bear he wondered if the americans had the guts to stand in the front line he thought of the thousands tens of thousands of american citizens living abroad who would be placed at risk when a palestinian went on trial in washington went to death row went to interminable lawyers conferences went to the electric chair there was a light knock on his door he started he had been far away he was handed a folded single sheet of teleprinter paper the door closed he read the paper he felt it like a blow to his stomach like the blast that had carried away his leg he reached for his telephone he dialled hello this is zvi you should come to my office straightaway he heard the station officer wavering there were people for dinner could it wait until tomorrow it is not a matter for the telephone and you should come here immediately men from the shin bet watched the norwegian leave his company headquarters he was clearly visible to them through the scope of the night sight they saw that he had changed from his uniform fatigues into civilian dress in a white tshirt and pale yellow slacks the young man showed up well in the green wash of the lens they watched him with three others climb into a unifilmarked jeep and head south towards the israeli border the car took side lanes to skirt syrian army road blocks on the highway leaving beirut from a post that was jammed sturdily through the top gap in the front window flew the flag of hezbollah on a white cloth had been painted the word allah but the second had been transformed to the shape of a kalashnikov rifle the car used a rutted deserted road and climbed twisted towards the mountains to the east the station officer read the teleprinter sheet at home the local wine had been flowing free his suit jacket was on the back of the chair he took off his tie loosened his collar s h i t he did not concern himself with the demand for especial vigilance for a spy in the beqaa he read over and over the order for maximum attention is to be given to the interception of this group so bloody soon for crane it would be natural to assume that the enemy is alert major zvi dan hesitated but he has holt and the boys green i shall have to tell them in century tell them also that there is nothing you can do nothing we can do it would be two hours before the station officer returned sobered to his guests his message sent in code from his embassy office reported the probability based on intercepted syrian army transmissions that the mission of noah crane and holt was compromised he thought that he had made a fool of himself at the fish pond the first fish was exciting the second fish was interesting the following fish were simply boring if he had not pulled out the pelletfattened trout then they would have used a net for the job but time had been killed and it had been made plain to him that he was denied access to the intelligence section at the kiryat shmona base and that news whatever it might be would reach tel aviv first he had taken a bath he had put on a clean shirt and retrieved his trousers pressed from under the mattress of his bed percy martins had smoothed his hair with his pair of brushes dinner in the dining room trout of course a half a bottle of white avdat to rinse away the tang of the artificially fed rainbow before dinner and after dinner he had tried to ring the station officer no answer from his direct line at the embassy no help from the switchboard inconceivable to him that the station officer would not have left a contact number at the embassys switchboard but the operator denied there was such a number he walked to the bar he could read the conspiracy those bastards at century in league with that supercilious creep tork a mile off they had shut him out actually it was criminal the way that a man of his dedication to the service and his experience was treated the service was changing the recruitment of creatures like fenner and anstruther and their promotion over him that showed how much the service had veered off course good work he had put in over the long years of his time in the service he had had his coups and damn all recognition he reckoned that his coups their full extent had been kept from the director general if the director general only knew the half of it percy martins would have been running the middle east desk long since sitting in anstruthers chair kicking the arse off fenner he would have bet half of his pension that the director general had never been told that he had crowned his amman posting with as near as dammit a prediction that the popular front were about to launch a hijack fiesta in his three years in cyprus he had actually gone to his opposite number at the american shop warned him of the personal danger to the ambassador all there in his report he bet the director general had never been told certainly never been reminded when the ambassador had been shot dead first categoric and specific news of the israeli nuke programme out of dimona that had been his climax on a tel aviv tour he hadnt had the credit the credit had gone to the yanks god and he had made sacrifices for the service sacrifices that started with his marriage followed with his son he hadnt complained not when he was given his postings not when his wife had said she wasnt going married accompanied not when his son had grown up treating him like an unwanted stranger a record of total disappointment at home and he had never once let it show hadnt let his work suffer holt and crane into the beqaa percy martinss last big one by jesus he would not let the last big one go unnoticed on the nineteenth floor of century he had a good record nothing to be ashamed of and less recognition for it than the man who sat behind the reception desk at century meanwhile he was stuck in a kibbutz where there was no fishing where there was no access to a damn good mission going into lebanon of course he should have insisted that there was proper preparation of the ground rules before he ever left london and no damned support from the station officer the station officers balls would be a decent enough target when he made it back to century he had signed his bill should have had a full bottle of avdat but he had never gone over the top with expenses he had strolled to the bar percy martins had never been able to understand why so many hotels dictated that drinking should be carried out in semidarkness and to the accompaniment of loudspeaker music there were americans in the shadows from the airconditioned bus that had arrived in the afternoon he preferred solitude to them blue rinse check trousers and damn loud voices for both sexes the americans had all the tables except one two men sat at the table and bloody miserable they seemed to martins because in front of each of them was a tall glass of fresh pressed orange juice not young and not old the two men obvously israelis one wore an old leather jacket scarred at the cuffs and elbows the other wore a bleach scrubbed denim jacket they were not talking they looked straight ahead and there were the young scandinavians he knew they were scandinavians impossible language they were speaking like english taped and played backwards and drinking and loud all that martins associated with scandinavians there were four of them he had the choice between several loud american women and their husbands the teetotal israelis and four merry scandinavians they were at the bar they were ordering another round he assumed them to be unifil at the bar he nodded to them made his presence known then ordered himself a beer he had drunk half his beer not made contact when t he young man closest to him lurched backwards on the punchline of a joke stumbled against martins elbow while he was sipping spilled a mouthful down the laundered shirt it was the beginning of the conversation handkerchiefs out apologies first in norwegian and then english when martins had spoken introductions he learned that the young man who had jogged him was hendrik he learned that hendrik was with unifils norbat he learned that hendrik and his friends were allowed one evening a week in kiryat shmona he was rather pleased a stained shirt was a cheap price to pay for introductions a replacement beer was called for by hendrik you are english mr martin martins yes i am english cheers here for holiday you could say i am here for a holiday hendrik for us it is not a holiday you understand no holiday in south lebanon what does an englishman find for a holiday in kiryat shmona just looking around just general interest your glass is empty you must allow me martins clicked his fingers for the barman had he looked behind him he would have seen that the two glasses of orange juice remained untouched that the israelis leaned forward faces set in concentration four beers for the soldiers a whisky and water for martins so how do you like it here hendrik serving with the united nations are you a jew the young mans face close to his own most certainly not the jews treat us like filth they have so great an arrogance they make many problems for us ah yes is that so his whisky was less than half drunk but the barman had reached for it prompted by one of the soldiers the glass was refilled thats most civil of you you were saying hendrik i was saying that the jews make many problems for us not only for you my boy martins said quietly the first trace of a slur in his speech every day they violate the authority of the united nations is that so every single day they come into the u n i f i l area indeed do they indeed they come in and they make trouble but it is us who have to mend the damage absolutely there was an appealing candour to the young man martins thought compared to his own callow son miserable little brat without a polite word for his father thats very decent of you the whisky glass was gone again percy martins felt the warm careless glow in his body theyve always made trouble the jews since way back since before you were born my boy part of their nature now dont get me wrong im not an antisemite never have been but by god they tax my patience they always have done damn difficult people to do business with when you need cooperation business or holiday martins leaned forward avuncular confiding a little more business than holiday what sort of business martins swayed careful my boy over your young head he seldom drank in london a pint in the pub or a quick scotch when he slipped out of century in the evening to get some fish and chips or a takeaway pizza before going back to work late he kept no alcohol at home if he left alcohol in the house it would be drunk by his wife or by the boy when he was home from college but this was a first class young man with a good reading of events a very level headed young man god why did they have to have that bloody music and why did those bloody americans have to address each other as though they were in the next state like last night sorry my boy what was last night they sent an infiltration team through our lines martins reeled back how did you know about that he was close to losing his footing he hung on the edge of the bar they sent an infiltration team through last night martins shouted i bloody heard you dont repeat yourself i asked you a question how did you bloody know what happened last night he was not aware that his raised voice had quietened the americans he did not see the man behind him the one who wore the leather jacket slide from his chair go fast for the door why do you shout because i want an answer my boy to what an answer how you knew about an infiltration team moving off last night does it concern you your answer i want it his vision was blurred he could not register the curious concentrated interest of the boy hendrik an englishman on holiday why does an infiltration concern him it bloody well concerns me how you knew you are drunk mister in front of him the young man turned away as if no longer interested martins caught at the white tshirt spun him round how did you know about the infiltration last night take your hands off me how did you know there was quick movement as though the norwegians were suddenly bored with the elderly briton martinss shout still hung in the air as they pushed past him away from the bar out through the swing door the music played was ragtime the man sitting at the table behind abandoned the two orange juices hurried out through the door to drag his colleague off the telephone there was the sound of the u n i f i l transport roaring to life in the car park what did he say hendrik that pissed fart hendrik olaffson drove heh thanks for pulling the asshole off me what was it about he spoke slowly he was english he said he was a tourist but he did not dress like a tourist and there is no tourism here that is the first then the second he went stupid when i said that the israelis had infiltrated through our sector last night he said how did you know about an infiltration team last night those were his words a voice from the darkness in the back of the jeep hendrik is it possible that the british have pushed an infiltration group through our sector going north into the beqaa it would be madness madness yes but worth much weed hendrik they were laughing full of good humour they were waved through the checkpoint at metulla in the foyer of the guest house of the kibbutz kfar giladi the receptionist passed the man who wore the frayed leather jacket her guest book her finger pointed to the name and the signature of percy martins british passport government servant they were moving on an animal track he thought it could be a goat track there were wild goat loose on exmoor and holt knew their smell he reckoned it was a regular track it was the fifth hour of the night march and the old moon was up in the last quarter which was the best time for night infiltration according to cranes bible maximum safe light for them to move under and it was a hell of a job for holt to follow the track would have been impossible for him if he had not had the guiding wraith of crane ahead damned if he could figure how crane could have been able to identify the animal track from the highup aerial photographs the fifth hour and the march was now going well two hours back it had not been good they had scampered across the tarmac road in their path a bad bit the road because they had had to lie up for quarter of an hour before moving into the open and in the waiting holt had felt the fear pangs gone now the fear gone because the road was behind them and below them the hillside was steep and much of the time holt walked crab style going sideways because that was the easiest way with the weight of the bergen the bergen should have been easier he was a gallon of water down ten pounds weight down didnt seem to make any difference he was feeling good and the blister hadnt worsened and he thought he could live with the sores under the backpack straps he was the son of a professional man he had been to private school he was a graduate in modern history he had been accepted via the fast stream into the foreign and commonwealth office and no bloody way any of that had fitted him for crab walking along a hillside in south lebanon no bloody way it would help him if the blister on his heel burst if the sores on his shoulders went raw he thought he was beginning to move by instinct he thought he was getting into the rhythm of the march he tried to think of his girl so hard to see his girl in his mind because his mind was taken up with footfall and lying up positions and water rations and watching and following crane up ahead the old goat on an old goat track hard to think of jane it seemed to him like a betrayal of her memory of his reason for being there she was just a flicker in his mind like the bulb going in a striplight the good times with jane they didnt have anything to do with changing the ammunition twice a day in the magazines nor with squatting in the lee of a rock after dark using smooth stones to wipe his backside nor with cleaning his teeth with a pick because paste left a smell signature nor with carrying a model fm long range sniper rifle that gave one chance one shot he could feel his jane she could be against his skin like the pain of the pack straps was against his skin like the heel of his right chukka boot was against his skin he could feel her but he could not see her each time he tried to see her then he reckoned it was the girl rebecca that he saw he didnt know whether crane had quickened his pace or whether he himself was slowing feeling janes body against his skin seeing rebeccas body against his skin that was a bastard like he was selling his jane short he was struggling to keep pace with crane he was struggling to see the soft face lips throat eyes of his girls he kicked the stone the track was not more than foot wide there was a sloping black abyss to his right his left hand was held out to steady himself against the rock slope soaring above him he had gone straight through the stone he had not paused he had not tested the ground under his leading foot he had begun to move by instinct the loose stone rolled the stone slid off the track the stone seemed to laugh at him the stone fell from the track and bounced below and disturbed more stones more stones falling and bouncing and being disturbed he stood statue still the vertigo seemed to pull at him as if trying to topple the weight of the bergen pack down into the abyss after the tumbling stones snap out of it holt get a grip holt no room in his mind for his girl any girl no room for pack strap sores nor heel blisters get yourself bloody well together holt he jerked his foot forward he rolled the sole of his boot on the ground of the track ahead tested it eased onto it first stone he had kicked all night crane hadnt stopped for him cranes shadow shape was smaller moving away all the time the echoing beat of the stones skipping plummeting racing below him he was into his stride again when the flare went up a thump from below and behind a white light point soaring cranes bible trip wire ground level flare freeze into tree shape and sink ever so slow high level flare drop face down like theres no tomorrow the moment before the flare burst into brilliance holt was on his face on his stomach on his knees the flare when it burst seemed to struggle against gravity it hung high a wash of growing light on the hillside the epicentre was behind him but he could sense the light bathing his hands and the outline of his body and his back and niggling into his eyes he lay quite still ahead of him he could see the exposed soles of cranes boots the flare fell died there was a hiss from crane holt saw the fast movement of cranes arm urging him forward he was half upright and crane was moving he was trying to push back the weight of the bergen holding him down and the weight of the model pm and the weight of his belt kit crane gone blackness where there had been light should have bloody closed his eyes shouldnt have let the light into his eyes the second flare was fired holt dropped eyes closed now squeezed tight trying to do what crane had told him trying to follow verse and chapter of cranes bible nothing over his ears his hearing was sharp uncluttered he heard the voices below no bloody idea how far below voices but no words when the light no longer hurt his eyes he looked ahead the flare was about to ground the path ahead was clear he could not see crane there were two more flares there were bursts of machine gun fire against the hillside the strike of the tracer red rounds on the hillside seemed to holt to have no pattern like it was random firing he had grown to know the jargon he reckoned it was prophylactic firing he wondered to hell whether they had thermal imagery sights whether they had passive night goggles there was movement below him he thought he heard the sounds of men moving in the darkness scrambling on the slopes he could hear the voices again christ he was alone his decision alone to move or to stay frozen his decision whether to reckon he was invisible to the men below so that he could move whether the firing had been to flush him out into the view of the ti sights and the pn goggles hellishly alone he could not crawl if he crawled he would make the noise of an elephant if he were to move he had to get to his feet he had to walk upright slowly weighing each step he lay on his face he thought of how greatly he depended on the taciturn goading that he had from crane he pulled himself up he listened to the voices and the movements on the hillside the thought in his mind was of being alone on the hillside of being discovered of being apart at that moment from noah crane the aloneness drove him forward there was no more shooting there were no more flares the voices faded the footfalls died he tried to remember how far it would be to the next halt position he tried to recall the map that crane had shown him before they had moved off they were now in the sixth hour holt had not taken much notice of the map didnt have to because he had crane to lead him alone holt resumed his night march it might have been five minutes later it might have been half an hour he found crane sitting astride the animal track he could have kissed him crane whispered syrian regular army patrol holt spoke into cranes ear routine theyre not usually out at night usually tucked up holding their peckers why would they have been out youre the educated one youngster were they waiting for us you went to university holt hissed tell me just not certain that one kicked stone was it but waiting are we blown holt saw in the fragile moonlight cranes smile without humour theyre behind us theres only one sensible way to go they moved off he was unaware of his shoulder sores and of his heel blister holt was aware only of each single individual footfall they bypassed the sleeping village of aitanit and the silent village of bab maraa they climbed high to avoid the village of saghbine where dogs broke the quiet of the night below him to the east was the moondraped flatness of the floor of the beqaa valley holt thought of the valley as a noose in front of him below him in brilliant sunshine lay the valley he could see right across to the greyblue climb of the far wall in the soft haze it was hard for him to make out cleancut features in the wall behind the rising ground were the jebels that marked the line of the border between lebanon and syria with difficulty he could make out the far distant bulk of the hermon range holt and crane had reached the lying up position in darkness and holt had taken the first guard watch so that he had taken his turn to wrap himself in the lightweight blanket and tried to sleep under the scrim net while the dawn was spreading from the far away hill slopes crane must have let him sleep on beyond his hour they were above the village of saghbine crane had set his lup in an outcrop of weathered shapeless rock over which the scrim net had been draped holt knew that cranes bible decreed that they should never make a hiding place in isolated obvious cover but there was a scalped barrenness about the terrain around them the nearest similar outcrop would have been he estimated and he found it difficult to make such estimates over this ground at least a hundred yards from their position lying among the rocks in the filtered shade of the scrim netting he felt the nakedness of their hiding place it seemed impossible to him that they should not be seen should an enemy scour the hillside with binoculars but crane slept and snored and grunted like a man for whom danger did not exist there was mom between these rocks under the scrim netting for the two of them only if they were pressed against each other their valley wall on which jutted the occasional rock outcrop shelved away to the floor he could see that the rock of the sides gave way to good soil at the bottom the fields were neatly laid out delineated by the differing crops the valley walls were yellowed browned the valley floor was a series of green shades and holt could make out the flow of the litani winding meandering in the middle of the valley and he could see also the straight cut ditches that carried the irrigating life run of water from the river into the fields he played a game to himself and tried to make out the produce of the handkerchief fields he could see the posts supporting the vines that were just beginning to show their spring shoots and the cutback trees of the fruit orchards and the hoedbetween lines of the grain crop and the more powerful thrusting traces of the marijuana plants and the white streamers of the plastic tunnels under which the lettuces flourished holt thought that luxury was a warm bath and a razor and a tube of toothpaste what few trees there were pine or cypress were in small clumps on the valley floor he reckoned the village of saghbine was about a mile away below them the village was clear enough through the binoculars but it was hard for him to make out the individual buildings when he relied only on his eyesight he was interested in the village because in his imagination he exchanged the village houses for the aerial photograph he had seen of the camp and he tried to imagine how it would be when they came to lie up a thousand yards from the camp terrifyingly open if the camp had been where saghbine was if they had had to manoeuvre to within a thousand yards of saghbine and rest up through long daylight hours he couldnt see how it could be done and crane snoring and nestling against him just slept slept like tomorrow was another day another problem the village was a sprawled mess of concrete block homes and older stone buildings with a mosque and minaret tower in the centre the high pitched chanted summons to prayer from the minaret tower reached him fancy a brew crane had an eye open snoring one moment thinking of tea the next holt thought that crane might just turn over and give up the ghost if the crop failed in assam and sri lanka wouldnt mind done the magazines done them whats new place is like the grave crane stretched himself full length holt heard his joints crack then youre a danger to me youngster how come because youngster when you start thinking the beqaa is quiet as the grave then thats the time you start to get careless i just said the place was pretty peaceful which it is crane took the binoculars tea was going to have to wait holt bridled and crane didnt give a damn crane started by looking south pretty peaceful eh that what i heard back where you kicked the stone last night where they fired the flares theres troops out there pretty blind if you didnt see them but theyre there his head turned his gaze moved north theres a kiddie with some sheep or didnt you see him hes a mile back not much more hes about four hundred feet below us hell be watching for hyena because hes got lambs with him if he sees anything that adds up to hyena then hell yell bet your backside again the twist of the head crane peered down at the village gang of guys going into the mosque for a knees down or didnt you see them theyre in fatigues or didnt you see that theyll be hezbollah or didnt you know that if the troops find a trail if that kiddie spots you when you go to scratch your arse then the god menll be up here too damn right i hear you mr crane so dont go giving me crap about it being quiet it looked quiet looked heh watch the kiddie crane passed the binoculars to holt he gestured where holt should look to himself holt cursed when the boy and the sheep were pointed out he saw them could have kicked himself the boy with the sheep wore flopping duncoloured trousers and he had a grey blanket over his shoulders and the sheep and the lambs were dirty brownwhite with black faces he hadnt seen them wouldnt have seen them without the prompting im sorry doesnt help you youngster waking up is what helps holt watched the boy with the sheep it was as if he were dancing to the music of a flute private dancing because the boy was sure that he was not watched the boy tripped in the air and his arms circled above his head skipping from foot to foot bowing to something imaginary crane whispered if he stops his act if he starts running then i get the shits do i piss you off youngster holt grinned why should you do that ill give you a lecture the troops back there they hate you the kiddie with the sheep he hates you the guys in the mosque they hate you out here im the only one on your side dont get a clever idea that somehow because youre a brit because youre not yank and not jew that the troops and the kiddie dont hate you our problem was before we came here in that we never worked out just how much theyd hate us when they started to mess with us we kicked their arses we blew up their houses we carted their guys away to prison camps they hate us pretty deep theyre dangerous because theyve this martyr crap stuck in their skulls arent afraid of biting on a round fight them and youre in a no win you kill them and youve sent them to the garden of paradise which they dont object to they go in hard kill em and more come there are more queuing up to get to that garden they made our life a threeyear misery for sinners when we were in the beqaa they sniped us they mined us they never let go of us bombing them is the same as recruiting them and they dont fight by your nice rules when im in the beqaa i forget everything every last thing that i learned about hearts and minds when i was in the british paras treat each last one like hes an enemy like he wants your throat thats what i learned here dont ever hesitate just kill because they have no fear the girl with the donkey she had no f e a r do you have fear mr crane only when ive got you hanging on my tail telling me its all peaceful the chanting from the minaret had stopped in the fields work was resuming holt could see the women with their hoes forks spades shovels crane grabbed the binoculars from holt he gazed down at the approach road into saghbine he seemed to smile there was a billow of dust on the road crane passed the binoculars back to holt holt saw the car with the dust streaming from its wheels dont ever forget what that car looks like why because i say dont ever forget that car the car was an ancient mercedes holt thought it not much less than a miracle that it still moved the panels were rusty ochre the front wing looked to have been in an argument there were white smears of filler in the roof he could see packing cases in the back that the seats behind the driver had been stripped out at his angle he could not see the face of the driver only the width of his gut i see the car about time you learned how to make a brew get on with it the phone trilled on major zvi dans desk rebecca picked it up she listened she passed it to him she saw the annoyance because he liked to be told first who was calling him dan here what name percy martins yes i am aware of the presence of percy martins at kfar giladi what do you mean is he sensitive no i will merely confirm that he is sensitive but also that his role in israel cannot be regarded as the legitimate business of the shin bet i dont believe you you have to be joking i had a flight for this evening but ill drive listen listen everything to do with that man is sensitive three hours he replaced the telephone his head sank into his hands rebecca looked at him is it bad unbelievable as though the wound were personal to major zvi dan is it bad for the young man the roof is falling in on him midmorning and percy martins lay in the bed in his darkened room he had bawled out the woman who had come to clean and change his bedclothes sent her packing he had ignored his wakeup call there was a drumbeat behind his temples he knew there was a calamity in the air couldnt place the source of it he seemed to think that if he got up and washed and shaved and dressed then he would get to the bottom of the catastrophe and he didnt want to he shirked the discovery while he remained in his room while he lay in his pyjamas he was unaware that a man from shin bet sat on a chair beside the staircase where he could look down the corridor watch the door of percy martinss room a quiet morning in the n o r b a t sector the troops had checked and searched only four cars and two cartloads of market produce in the previous three hours the sun was sprawled in the skies a lethargy hung over the road block shimmer burnished up from the roadway two of the norwegians dozed in the oven area under the tin roof that topped their sandbagged position a third played patience at the lightweight table beside the entrance to the position hendrik olaffson smartly turned out in a freshly laundered uniform carried his nato selfloading rifle easily on the bend of his elbow he stared up the road he watched the bend he waited to see if the traveller would come to visit he realised they had taken a diversion the driver of the jeep turned frequently to give the l ace of abu hamid a sharp glance as though he was the possessor of a private joke the driver had few teeth a grin for abu hamid to see and foul breath seeping through the gaps above and below the few there were abu hamid was not familiar enough with damascus to know where they went he would not ask why they had taken a diversion from the usual roads they used to get from the beirut road across the city to air force headquarters would not give the bastard the satisfaction they were in narrow streets abu hamid thought the driver a lunatic he had the belt on and that had been a sign of fear and he knew that he would be ignored if he asked the bastard to go more slowly or to pay heed to the pedestrians and cyclists he would just give the bastard pleasure if he told him to pay attention to the traffic signs in surges that shook abu hamid lurched him forward against the belt the jeep hammered down narrow streets scattered women with their shopping bags grazed a cart drawn by a ragged thin horse they came into a square the square seemed overhung squashed in by the buildings around it was a dark square because the buildings were tall and cut out the sun abu hamid thought that only at the middle of the day would the sun fall into the cobbled centre of the square there were balconies at many levels of the surrounding buildings with washing suspended from them and the stucco facades were peeled raw he felt the tug at his sleeve he realised the driver had slowed he saw the squinted amusement in the drivers eyes the driver jabbed with the nicotined tip of his finger showed abu hamid that he should look to the centre of the square he was not prepared he retched choked he tried to swallow down the bile that pitched into his mouth there were three men suspended from the gallows beam it was late morning there was the bustle of traffic and the cries of the hawkers and the shouts of the traders and there were three men hanging from three ropes from the scaffold their heads were hooded their arms were pinioned behind their backs their ankles were tied with rope he knew they were men because under the long white robes in which they were draped he could see the ends of their trousers and he could see also that they wore mens shoes there was no movement in the three bodies because no freshness of wind could enter the confines of the square fastened to the robes on each man was a large black painted sign the driver split his face in a delighted grin you like it who are they can you not read who are they they are iraqis what did they do who knows what they did they were accused of jeopardising state security to the israeli enemy they are iraqis they let off bombs in damascus they killed many people the jeep idled past the rough cut fresh wood gallows abu hamid stared he saw that the shoe lace of one man was undone that his shoe was all but falling from his foot a fast flash thought for abu hamid he saw a man in terror crouched on the floor of a cell he heard the tramp of feet in a passageway he felt the shame of a man who was to be taken out to be hanged in a public square and whose fingers would not allow the small dignity of retying his shoe lace that is what i heard that they set bombs in the city the government says they are agents of israel who am i to say they are not they were hanged at dawn you like to see it the driver chuckled abu hamid saw the stains at the groin of each man abu hamid nodded dumbly it is good the driver said it is not often that they hang the enemies of the state where we can see them it should be more often the driver slammed his foot down onto the clutch went up through his gears he hit the horn they went fast out of the square within a few minutes they were back into the system of wide boulevards that were the public face of damascus they were heading for the air ministry headquarters did major said hazan give orders that i was to be brought this way that i was to see them abu hamid saw the black tooth gaps and the yellowed stumps and he heard the cackle of the drivers mirth ourselves we are not sure of him the brother said he has proven himself we are not certain of his determination major said hazan wriggled in his chair he fancied he could still feel the sharpness of her nails in the skin at the small of his back the skin on his back and down over his buttocks was of an especial sensitivity because it was from there that the surgeons had taken the live tissue for grafting onto the uncovered flesh of his face he was the top student in simferopol and in the military academy he showed us the extent of his determination the brother shrugged it was many years since the popular front had been able to take decisions for themselves if you are certain it is what i have decided major said hazan went to the door of his office in the outer office he saw the young palestinian sitting with his head drooped he thought the young man seemed tired he made his pretence of a welcoming smile he waved abu hamid into his office you had a good journey hamid i had a good journey abu hamid muttered you saw the sights of damascus i saw the hanged bodies major said hazan stretched out his arms rolled his shoulders we are like an old city hamid with enemies at every gate but if we are ruthless in our struggle our enemies will never scale our walls nor force our gates please hamid be seated major said hazan took from a cabinet refrigerator a chilled bottle of fruit juice and poured it for abu hamid he went back to his desk he took from a drawer the plan of the defence ministry on kaplan and spread it over the surface of the desk with the heel of the hand that had no fingers he smoothed the plan flat you are a fortunate young man hamid you have been chosen ahead of others you have been chosen to strike a great blow for your p e o p l e the brother said we ask you to lead an attack into israel major said hazan watched the young mans jaw tremble he saw that the soles of his boots fretted on the pile of the carpet there was a syrup in the voice of major said hazan you hesitate hamid of course you hesitate you wonder to yourself are your shoulders sufficiently broad to carry the weight of such responsibility your immediate concern is whether you have the competence to carry out a mission of this importance hamid because you hesitate there might be others who would take such hesitation as a mark of cowardice not i hamid it is i who have faith in you i could not believe that you have less courage than a girl child who would walk against her enemy with a donkey and with explosives he saw abu hamids eyes waver stray to the brother i would refuse to believe that you had less courage than had mohammed and ibrahim chosen by yourself for the glory of carrying a bomb onto the jerusalem b u s he saw that the young man now held his head in his hands look at me hamid look at my face i carry the scars of being in the front line of the struggle against israel i would not be amongst those who might say that because you hesitate you do not have the courage to follow where i lead he saw abu hamids head rise he held him eye to eye i know hamid that the money draft of the central bank of syria has never been cashed i know too that in the presence of the orphans of the palestine revolution you pledged your loyalty to the struggle he saw abu hamids eyes gape open he saw the confusion spread because i know everything of you i have chosen you we ask you to lead an assault against the defence ministry of the zionist state the brother said you would go from here to the bed of your girl you are the modern day inheritor of the mantle of the assassins hamid you are honoured amongst your equals you are loved by the weak and the young and the aged who cannot fight but who stand behind you who pray for you we have to have your answer hamid the brother said you would go from the bed of your girl from the perfume of her body there is a clear choice hamid either you are worthy of the love of your people or you are branded a coward you would not prove me wrong hamid i who have trusted you major said hazan saw the trance in the eyes of abu hamid he knew that he had won he wondered why the shit scared bastard took so long to clear away his hesitation it did not concern him that abu hamid would be shit scared when he led his squad against the defence ministry in tel aviv no way out no escape then a rat under a boot and the rat would fight the rat would claw and bite for survival shit scared was desperate shit scared was good he thought the boy would fight well i will abu hamid said it was over major said hazan said that the brother could take abu hamid for an initial planning briefing that he should stay the night in damascus that he should return to the camp in the beqaa and choose ten men who would accompany him into israel major said hazan turned briskly back to his desk i have work he said curtly he had eaten only bread in the last hours he had drunk only water he was moved in the black boot of a car his eyes hidden in darkness by the hood every few hours he spoke no arabic so he did not understand the low voices of his captors heinrich gunter trussed strapped blind had long since ceased to concern himself with the outside world the world beyond the boot of a car and the basement of a building he no longer thought of his wife and his children nor the actions of his government nor the position that his bank would have taken if his hands had been free if his tie had still been around his throat collar he would have attempted to end his life he knew enough to recognise that he was the classic kidnap victim he was the man who had disregarded the warnings who had thought that he had arranged the safe passage into the city rolling painfully in the boot of the car gunter knew the pit depths of despair he could think of no corner into which he could crawl in his mind where he would find comfort he could think of no power to help him into the coarse material of the hood he sobbed his tears he had seen on the television back at home the photographs of the men held hostage cheerful smiling faces from family snapshots and company archives of journalists and business men and priests and academics he had also seen the photographs of those few who had returned from captivity haunted men whose cheeks had sunk and whose eyes were buried in dark sockets the rare few who had been brought out to freedom but gunter no longer cared about the many who were held or the few who had been freed he did not believe in the possibility of freedom he believed only in the blessing of death in the middle of the day when the car had halted bumped off a road he was given food the hood was lifted an inch or two bread was fed to him given him in small pieces each piece replaced when he had chewed and swallowed he had no idea where he might be what part of lebanon he was in and it did not seem to him to matter holt played the chef it had been a bit of a joke between them that holt had been allowed to plan the menu for the main meal of the day his gut ached with hunger more of cranes bible the bible said it was good to be hungry if you were hungry you werent drowsy if you were drowsy you were halfway to being ambushed crane sat under the scrim netting with his legs folded and his back straight and the binoculars at his face holt was on his hands and knees over the hexamine tablets heating in their frame and on the frame the canteen of water boiled cranes bible said that the hexamine tablets were the only source of fire they could use anything else would give off a smoke signature and a smell signature two tablets the size of the firelighter pieces that his mother used at home to get the sitting room logs alight they were going to have a hell of a good meal had to be a good meal god alone knew where they would be in hours time overlooking the camp thats where they should be all through tomorrow watching for abu hamid on the binoculars cranes plan said they should go for a dusk shot holt couldnt imagine having much room for stewing up a meal or much appetite for it when the time was getting close for action with the model pm so a good meal that afternoon a long rummage round the bergen for the ration packs all that was choice and best in the sachets holt heard the low whistle between cranes teeth he looked he saw crane had the binoculars away from his lace that his lower lip was bitten white by his upper teeth crane saw holts attention relaxed his mouth returned the binoculars to his eyes holt looked away it wasnt the first time nor the second nor the third that holt could recall the sight of screwed up pain on cranes forehead in cranes eyes at cranes mouth he looked away he didnt want to look into cranes face because he was afraid it was the best menu he could manage not a prawn cocktail or marinated mackerel for hors doeuvre but a sachet of izotonic powder mixed with water to give a lemontasting vitamin boost not a bisque or a consomme for the soup course but a short and stubby stick of peperone to chew not steak and chips or lamb cutlets for entree but the boiling water into the plastic sac that held the dehydrated chicken and rice flakes not a strawberry flan or a sherry trifle for dessert but a granola cereal bar that seemed to explode and expand and bulge the mouth full not coffee to wash it down but a brew with a teabag and a piece of chewing gum to wind up the feast that added up holt reckoned to a hell of a meal he had the powder ready mixed he had the peperone laid out he had the granolas ready when he had mixed the chicken and rice they could get stuck in while the water heated for the tea bags holt looked up he saw cranes head bowed his eyes closed tight shouldnt have bloody looked dinner is served mr crane he saw the face snap back to life saw crane grin as if there was no problem brilliantly done young holt they ate holt was learning from watching crane the izotonic drained and the sachet held upside down over the mouth for the drips and the peperone lingeringly held on the tongue for the spice taste and the fingers wiping the remnants of the chicken and rice from the sides of the canteen the tea drunk whats your problem mr crane crane twisted his head as if he were caught on the wrong foot ive got no problem give it to me being in fucking lebanon is that a problem if youve got a problem then ive a right to know crane snarled being here with you thats enough of a problem mr crane we are together and you are in pain it seems to me you have a pain in your eyes get the canteens cleaned get the rubbish stowed if you have a problem with your eyes then i have to help crane was close to him holt saw the anger in his face how are you going to help holt shook his head i dont know but i what do i need eyes for for everything to shoot crap kid i need eyes to shoot i need eyes that can put me into five inches at a thousand yards what is it with your eyes crane slumped back he rubbed the back of his hand across his eyes like he was trying to gouge something out of them disease of the retina can you shoot i shot at the road block you had two hits at the road block i dont know why truly okay i had two hits but she wasnt going anywhere i suppose it didnt matter perhaps thats why i had the hits is that why you took the job for the money for treatment theres a place in houston they have a one in five success rate thats one more than anywhere else its my shooting eye youngster mr crane if you cant shoot then whats going to happen holt looked into cranes right eye he saw the blood red veins creeping towards the iris bet your life holt ill shoot one last time holt wiped out the canteens he cleared up the rubbish and put it in the plastic bag he rubbed down the model pm and the armalite he changed the ammunition rounds in the magazines he felt the light had gone out he smeared insect repellent cream onto his cheeks and his throat and onto the backs of his hands he felt that he had been tricked he took off his boots and peeled down his socks so that he could renew the plasters across his blister they had given him a man who was over the hill he let a glucose tablet dissolve in his mouth he had gone into the beqaa with a marksman whose sight was failing that was a good laugh its worse isnt it worse than its been before crane nodded inside the perimeter of the base camp at kiryat shmona in a position far removed from the sight of the camps main gate were the prefabricated offices used by the shin bet in previous times the principal occupation of the israeli internal security apparatus had been to watch over the arab population of the west bank of the jordan river since the invasion of lebanon in the main thrust of shin bet work had been in the northern frontier and the security zone building had not kept pace with the development of the new and onerous duties it was as if the prefabricated sectionalised buildings represented a pious hope that the diversion of resources to matters affecting lebanon was merely temporary a hope only the men of the shin bet found their resources absorbed by the fierce thirst for violence and revenge among the shia villagers of the security zone and the countryside to the north there was no sign that the crowded offices in the base camp would in the near future be emptying major zvi dan had left rebecca outside left her to sit in the afternoon sunshine on a concrete step he was in a cubbyhole of a room with three officials of the shin bet he brooded miserably that in their temporary quarters they had failed to install a halfway decent coffee machine he was hellishly tired from the drive out of tel aviv so that is the situation major concerning the norwegian soldier and the situation concerning the briton martins martins is mine the case of private olaffson is a very delicate matter i dont know what you do while he is in the u n i f i l area we have no jurisdiction over him and the u n i f i l command will not respond favourably to a request that he be interrogated the senior shin bet man tidied his papers together this olaffson he drove the two popular front bombers to tel aviv confirmed he knew their mission probably not but he would have to have assumed that they were heading towards a terrorist target then private olaffson will have to discover at first hand what is a terrorist target major zvi dan was passed the report compiled by the two agents who had tailed olaffson to the guest house of the kibbutz kfar giladi who had sat in the bar who had listened to the conversation between the norwegian soldier and a member of the british secret intelligence service he read fast he winced martins i will deal with friend you are a warrior of the cause of freedom i only tell you what i heard repeat it for me friend he said how did you know about an infiltration team moving off last night that was what he said hendrik olaffson spelled it out he spoke slowly he gave time for the traveller to write the words on a sheet of paper the traveller put away his paper he took the hands of the young man and he kissed him on each cheek it is worth something it is worth much the traveller said we will show you our gratitude when he had gone the four soldiers at the checkpoint huddled together they talked about quantity they talked of the monies that could be charged for the quantity of hashish that would be supplied as a matter of gratitude far away across the valley invisible amongst scrub bushes a photographer bent over the camera on which was mounted a mm lens and carefully extracted a roll of film martins had made himself a prisoner in his room he had not drawn the curtains back through the centre gap he had seen the start of the day and the middle of the day and then the end of the day it was dark now and he had abandoned his unmade bed and sat crosslegged on the floor his back against the furthest wall from the door he knew they would come for him he wore his suit trousers and his shirt and his socks and he had not shaved though he had eaten nothing during the day he felt no hunger he was cocooned in pity for himself when there came the knock at the door he flinched not the chambermaids inquiring tap but the thump of a closed fist on the door panel he didnt reply he watched as the door crashed open and as the man whose shoulder had been against it lurched into the room the man wore a leather jacket scuffed at the wrist and the elbows he knew the man from somewhere his jaded memory could not tell him from where there was another man framed in the doorway slowly martins pushed himself upright there were no words necessary martins went to his disturbed bed and bent to find his shoes he wondered if they knew yet at century he wondered how many of them would be celebrating his fall from grace he walked to the door as they moved into the corridor the man who wore the leather jacket laid his hand on the sleeve of martinss shirt and he shook it away there was one of the men ahead of him and one behind he walked free of them he felt a great tiredness a great sadness they went out into the fresh air onto the fire escape martins understood if he had been the man in the leather jacket he would have done the same he was driven to the base camp at kiryat shmona there was a standard procedure used he had ducked into the back seat of the car and been waved across towards the far door he knew the door would have a locking device the man with the leather jacket sat beside him he thought that this was the way a traitor or a dangerous criminal or a sex offender would be dealt with he stared straight ahead of him he shook his head when the man in the leather jacket offered him a cigarette once in the camp he was taken into a small bare room he sat at a table he stared across the surface of the table at major zvi dan two men sitting on hard chairs separated from each other by a narrow plastictopped table he heard the door close behind him martins thought he had never stared into eyes so filled with contempt are we to be taped of course i dont think thats really appropriate mr martins in your position you should not presume to tell me what is appropriate i should not be treated as an enemy agent he felt the confidence slowly ebbing back to him he sat straighter in his chair that is how we view you thats preposterous major zvi dan spoke very quietly he spoke as though he were nervous that he might lose control of his temper you have behaved like an enemy agent you have endangered lives rubbish i was merely foolish i drank too much you endangered the lives of holt and noah crane and at the very least you put their mission at risk quite ludicrous i was drunk men get drunk i was indiscreet it happens whatever i said would have been gobbledygook to that scandinavian he wouldnt have understood a word of it you passed information of vital importance to the enemy the enemy martins snorted your sense of the theatrical does you credit major i was talking merely to a private soldier of the norbat to an agent of the enemy there was the appearance on major zvi dans face that he thought he was talking to an idiot a retarded creature he spelled out each word a bomb exploded in the central bus station in tel aviv you may remember holt and crane will not have forgotten two terrorists were responsible the terrorists travelled into israel via the beqaa valley in lebanon dont give me a yesterdays newspaper lecture in lebanon they were brought through the unifil sector through the security zone across the border hidden in united nations transport so your private soldier drove that transport god the breath seeped from percy martins your private soldier to whom you confided the existence of an infiltration team is an agent of the enemy christ martins slumped he felt the looseness in his bowels a feebleness in his legs i dont suppose he didnt understand it is our belief that the information you provided him with is already en route to damascus martins said you cannot know that with great deliberation major zvi dan lifted from the floor a brown paper envelope from the envelope he spread out on the table a series of photographs his finger settled on one and he pushed it towards martins martins saw the back of the head of the unifil private soldier he saw a man leaning forward to kiss the cheek of olaffson it is how they show their gratitude major zvi dan said i couldnt have had any idea martins said you were drunk you knew nothing the savage reply what can i do if you are not too proud to pray you can pray you came here in your naivete to play a game of political chess you came here to further your career now all you can do is to pray for the lives of the men you have criminally endangered will you tell them in london that they sent an idiot here maybe they are all idiots in london maybe they all seek to play games what do you propose to do with me you will be confined in the camp area where you can do no further damage and afterwards afterwards you will live with your shame what have i done you have confirmed to the syrians that there is a mission you have told the syrians of british interest in that mission if the syrians can make an equation between the mission and the killings at yalta then they will know the target they will remove the target from view and also they will ambush your man and my man if the syrians make the equation then the mission is lost our men are lost martins murmured god i am so sorry pray that the syrians are as idiotic as you are myself i do not think it likely there was the scratching of major zvi dans chair as he stood up the door opened the two men led martins away to confinement his head sagging they had studied the map they had covered the trail they would use and the position of the rally points how long tonight eight hours and then the camp in eight hours we should be above the camp youngster how are the eyes just stick to worrying about yourself whether youll recognise the target i dont need your worry you should come back with me mr crane afterwards back to england you talk too much holt ive done nothing in my life if id done everything youve done in your life theres nothing id want more than to go away bury myself live on the moor walk beside the rivers know the peace of where i live i havent earned that peace mr crane you have is it that good there crane asked you could walk free the animals are free the people are free the light and the air are wonderful no rifles no fighter bombers no bloody minefields you deserve that peace mr crane will you think about it might just they had the bergens high on their backs holt let crane get fifteen yards ahead then moved out after him the start of the last night march as a matter of routine major said hazan received in the early evening a report covering the previous hour period as prepared by army headquarters at chtaura he read every detail of the report as he always did far down in the list he read that a patrol in position west and south of the beqaa village of aitanit had fired flares in response to unidentified movement further west of them the report stated that a followup search in daylight centred on an animal track but had failed to provide evidence that would justify further sweep searches of the area the major went to his wall map he put a redheaded pin into the map over the area of the u n i f i l sector through which it had been reported that an infiltration had been made he drove in another redheaded pin at the point of the unconfirmed contact with the patrol he stood back he extended a line from the infiltration point to the supposed contact they were going north the shortest possible route into the foothills on the west side of the beqaa in the valley marked on his map were the camps of different syrian army concentrations and in addition the camps of the popular front the democratic popular front the abu moussa faction the saiiqa group the popular struggle front there were also the villages used by the hezbollah and the houses occupied by the men of islamic jihad there were the communities that played host to the revolutionary guards who had sat in the beqaa unmoving after their despatch from iran in all indicated on his map there were locations that could prove of interest to an infiltration team of the enemy at the moment he was helpless but he was a man of patience in the camp the cooks fire guttered the cook thought that in the morning he would use the last of his wood to prepare the breakfast that he would spend the morning scavenging for more it was a crisp sharp night the heat of the day had dissipated into the rocky slopes in the night there was a fresh wind that caught at the sweat that ran in rivers on the throat and chest of young holt the pace of the night march was no greater and no less than it had been on the two previous nights but he sweated as he thought like a pig the pace of the night march remained give or take a few yards or a few minutes at one mile in one hour the going should have been easier because each man was lighter from the consumption of water close to a half of the water had been used but still he sweated in the cool of the night march he felt as if along with the perspiration the strength oozed from his body when they reached there when they were on the high ground overlooking the tent camp holt thought he would be reduced to a wrung out rag there were no more kicked stones there were no cracked twig branches there was no scuffling through sun crisped leaves each step was concentration each short checked stride was care crane was a shape ahead of him it was a blurred shape that only came to life at the rally points when crane stopped and squatted and holt reached him to slump beside him they did not speak at the first rally points of the night they sat and allowed their leg muscles to soften and holt let his mind wander from the concentration and care and exhaustion of the march there were no words no whispers because holt did not have to be told that they were now deep behind the lines it was all in his head it had all been told him and was remembered they were moving north on the hill slopes between the valley floor and the peaks of the jabal al barouk on the jabal al barouk was a stateoftheart sovietbuilt complex of radar dishes and antennae manned by the syrian air force sensitive country the dishes and antennae were protected from surprise attack scattered round the air defence and signals listening equipment would be according to cranes bible text the gs divisional level surveillance radars operating from kw power packs and with a twelve kilometre competence to detect personnel and a kilometre range for seeing the movement of vehicles moving on the slopes above the valley and below the installations on the summit of jabal al barouk crane led holt in darted spurts as a sailor would tack before the wind they changed the angle of their progress every fifty sixty yards as if by that manoeuvre crane believed he could throw the attention of a drowsing ground surveillance radar screen operator of course it would have been faster to have moved lower down onto the gentler slopes of the valley sides but crane had explained at the last lying up position that further behind the syrian positions the risk increased of blundering into mine fields of drifting into the wadis where the antipersonnel mines would be set around the heavy pressure antiarmour concentrations that night on the marches between the rally points holt learned much he learned of the methods of evasion from the dishes of ground surveillance radar and of the way in which the cover of the terrain could be used to prevent discovery of their progress at the hands of thermal imagery equipment he learned of the hazard of a low flying aircraft droning above them without even navigation lights when crane had plotted the aircrafts path and scuttled to get clear of its flight line in case it carried infrared targetting screens they moved on holt could not assess the threat he could only remember the warnings that had been given him in a gravel whisper before they had left the lying up position they lurched from rally point to rally point the exhaustion spread through holts legs through his back through his shoulders his recovery in the short breaks at the rally points became steadily less restorative he understood why the exhaustion seeped through him he was helpless he was led on and on by a man with disease clawing at the retina of his right eye he was with a marksman who had taken a contract in order to finance a one in five chance operation to reverse the decline in the sight of the shooting eye he himself was blind his kings good eye was done for and he had to live with it in the first part of that nights march up to the first rally point he had felt a bursting anger towards crane the anger was gone knocked away by the tiredness in his legs the soreness of his feet he felt a sort of sympathy but it was bloody pointless feeling sympathy for crane sympathy was no salve for the disease in the retina they went west and high to bypass the village of ain zebde they would climb to avoid the village town of khirbet qanafar beyond the glow of khirbet qanafar two and a half miles ahead they would come down the hill slope until they overlooked the tent camp it was late into the evening the city was a mysterious place of flickering headlights and of candlethrown shadows another power cut in damascus the cutting of the electricity supplies was more frequent that month a cut that would last five hours and there was nothing remarkable in that the traffic moved through a wraith like haze of exhaust fumes the cafes were lit by the wavering flames of the candles abu hamid saw that few of the cafes had lanterns lit there was a shortage of oil for the power station also a shortage of paraffin lor the public his mind was bent by the weight of detail forced upon him by the brother through the afternoon through the rvening he had listened and attempted to absorb the attack plan against the defence ministry on kaplan as described to him by the brother he had been allowed to write nothing down everything he had been told had to be committed to memory he knew the numbers of the men involved he knew the fire power they would carry he knew the harbour from cyprus out of which he would sail he knew the times of the tide changes that would dictate the time of sailing he knew the speed at which the coastal tramp ship would travel he knew of the diversionary tactic that had been planned to draw away the patrolling missile boats he knew of the two closed vans that sympathisers would drive to the shore line at palmahim south of tel aviv he knew of the driving time from the shore line to the buildings on kaplan he knew of the defences of the ministry complex through the cacophony of the horns through the darkened traffic lights through the swirling crowds of the souq the jeep pressed its way towards the alley the jeep shuddered to a halt the headlights lit a drover who flailed at the back of a horse that refused to pull further a cart laden with vegetables from the way the horse refused to ground its left front hoof abu hamid thought the horse to be lame the jeep driver was shouting at the drover the drover was shouting at his horse he slipped open his door he slammed the door shut after him he was gone into the night into the flow of the crowds he was no longer the palestinian who had been chosen to sail onto the beach at palmahim which was south of the city of tel aviv he was no longer the man on whose forehead the spot of the martyr had been painted he could have turned he could have cut into the narrow lanes he could have fled he was a moth the alley was the lamp the woman was the light when he knocked at the door she opened it to him she wore the loose dress of an arab woman he saw the soft whiteness of the skin on her throat he saw the curved fullness of her breasts and of her hips he saw the hands that reached for his face in welcome she was margarethe anneliese schultz at wiesbaden in the federal republic of germany in the computerised records section of the bundesamt fur verfassungsschutz the printout directly relating to her history biography and activities would on a continuous roll of paper stretch to inches that part of the federal internal security office devoted in its work to the destruction of urban guerrilla movements inside the state was indeed familiar with margarethe anneliese schultz she was now years of age she had been born the only daughter of a pastor serving a small community a few kilometres to the north of munich as an only daughter she had been a spoilt and privileged child early in her life she had learned the art of winning her way either by tantrums or by sweet smiles within the budget of her parents household her every whim had been granted excellent grades in her final school examinations led to her admission as a student of social sciences to the free university of west berlin her father had a married cousin living in the city her father had believed that it would be a good thing for the young girl to continue her education away from home while at the same time remaining under the eye of the family it had been the summer of when margarethe anneliese schultz had left home with her two suitcases to take a train to frankfurt and another train to west berlin that late summer the federal republic recovered from the excesses brought on by victory in the world cup soccer tournament and awaited the death of a judge shot dead at his front door and the death of holger meins from selfinflicted starvation and the sentencing of ulrike meinhof from the day they waved their goodbye as the long distance express train pulled away from the platform at munichs hauptbahnhof doktor and frau schultz had not set eyes on their beloved daughter one letter only had been received by them written a week after her arrival in west berlin margarethe anneliese schultz had within a month of her arrival in west berlin dropped out of her course dropped into underground cover she had been recruited into a cell of a red army faction that sought to revive the drive of armed insurrection on behalf of an oppressed proletariat as first initiated by ulrike meinhof and andreas baader and jancarl raspe and gudrun ensslin and holger meins in a world of heady excitement she became a part of the small core of revolutionaries living in sympathisers apartments stretching her legs

freedom of the founding fathers and mothers of the movement there was a week when despair became a plague a lufthansa holiday jet hijacked to mogadishu in the african state of somalia was retaken by the intervention of the grenzschutz gruppe neun the principal imprisoned activists hanged or shot themselves in their cells the movement sagged under the failure of action and the loss of the star participants margarethe anneliese schultz her face on the wanted posters her name on the charge sheet of a federal court her future likely to be years behind bars drove into switzerland took a train to italy bought an airline ticket to damascus she threw off the cause of the bovine proletariat of her homeland she embraced the cause of the palestinian people she was careful with her favours she dispensed them only where they could be of advantage to her she had sought out a protector a man of such influence that she would not be repatriated to the maximum security womens prisons of west germany he was a repulsive bastard the major in syrian air force intelligence but he had influence she warmed his bed she worked hard to please him in obedience to the wishes of major said hazan she had many months before given herself to a young palestinian fighter of the popular front the pendant hung at her neck the pendant was a sapphire held by a fastening crescent of diamonds the pendant hung at her neck from a gold chain of close fine links he heard the words the drooled words slipping from the rebuilt mouth of major said hazan in the presence of the orphans of the palestine revolution you pledged your loyalty to the struggle he heard the words that had been used to taunt him the chain that supported the pendant lay on the smooth skin of her throat she was kissing his mouth and the lobes of his ears she told him of her love the flatness of her stomach undulated against his groin the warmth of her breasts drifted through the cotton of his shirt abu hamid standing just inside the room leaning hack against the closed door hearing the muffled i aucous sounds of the souq knew that he would kill the girl he had loved he was calm he felt no fear it was not as it had been when the woman who was a spy for the israelis had gazed back in contempt into his face it was as it had been when he had gone to seek out the man who had stolen his transistor radio it was as it had been when he had eased himself up from the bench outside the oreanda hotel when he had walked filtering between the traffic towards the hotel steps as it had been when he had raised the assault rifle to confront the old man and the young woman pushing through the glass swing doors major said hazan had played with him as a child the toy that had won him had been the breasts and the cleft of margarethe schultz he held her in his arms he smelled the cleanness of her hair and the dry pleasure of her body i love you brave boy as you love him abu hamid murmured from the pit of his throat i love you for your courage brave boy she arched her head upwards she stretched to kiss his forehead her neck was pulled taut the pendant seemed to him to dance on her skin and the candlelight caught the kingfisher brilliance of the sapphire and flashed upon the wealth of the diamonds as you love him he held the back of her head in his left hand the fingers tight into the looseness of her hair he held the back of her neck in his right hand the fingers twined into the slender strength of the chain i love only you brave boy she had not looked into his face she had not seen his eyes she had not seen the smile curve at his lips he thought of her cheeks against the reconstructed atrocity that was the face of major said hazan he thought of the fingerless hand groping to the smoothness of the skin of her thighs the fingers of his left hand that were tight in her hair jerked margarethe schultzs head back he saw the shock sweep into her eyes with his right hand he tore the pendant from her throat snapping the chain clasp on her neck he bent her head down so that it was lower than the level of his waist so that she could see only his feet in front of her between her bare feet between his boots he dropped the pendant he stamped on the sapphire on the diamonds of the crescent he thought of how she had shamed him from taking money how she had burnt the letter from the central bank of syria she had taken a pendant of sapphire and diamonds she had taken the body of major said hazan he ground with his heel into the carpet he heard the wincing gasp of her breath as he moved his foot aside forced her head lower so that she could see the shattered pendant she had taken the love of abu hamid she had taken his pledge that he would go into israel take the war into israel take his death into israel when he pulled her head up when she could look into his face she spat she snarled you are scum you are not even a good fuck not even as good as him he saw her eyes bulging towards him he saw the blue sheen at her lips he saw her fingers scrabble to hold his wrists he saw her tongue jumping from her mouth when he let go of her throat when she slid to the carpet he crouched over her he could hear the choking of his tears he lay across her he could feel the wetness of her skin where his tears fell percy martins was on his bed it was hours since he had walked around the bare room he had only had to walk round once to understand the nature of his confinement behind the curtains over the windows he had found the metal bars he had noted that there was no light through the keyhole of the door he had heard the coughing of a man in the corridor he was on his bed he was close to sleep when he was roused into alertness by the muffle of voices behind the door he heard the rasp of the turning key he sat upright on his bed it was the girl zvi dans assistant rebecca she carried a mug of tea he could see that it was freshly made that it steamed in her hand she passed him the mug thats uncommonly civil of you it is nothing why i thought you had been kicked i thought they were queuing to kick you again there were plenty of them in line to kick you people like to kick a fool when a fool is down martins drank the tea scalded the roof of his mouth kicking you does not help holt he gazed into her face i suppose its stupid to ask but there hasnt been any news there could only be news from the syrian radio we are monitoring their transmissions there has been nothing on their radio martins slumped back onto his bed the waiting its so bloody awful waiting for news of catastrophe and for the inevitability of disgrace what are your feelings for holt hes one of the finest young men ive ever met and i never got round to telling him she turned away went out through the door he heard the key turn he lay in the darkness and sipped at the hot sweetness of the tea with three men to escort him heinrich gunter stumbled tripped through the darkness over the rough ground on the slope of the hillside he was handcuffed to one man he had been given back his shoes but they rubbed and calloused his feet and it was more years than he could remember since he had last worn lace up shoes without socks he had been given back his shoes but they had retained his shirt and his suit jacket and his trousers he wore his vest and his underpants that now smelled and over his shoulder was draped a coarse cloth blanket where they had left the car his photograph had been taken all very quick and he had hardly been aware of the process the hood had been snatched up from over his face the light had blasted him time for him to identify the gun barrel that had been the sharp pain under his chin and the face mask of the one who held a camera level with his eyes two workings of the camera and the flash and the hood retrieving the darkness and falling the taking of his photograph had disturbed him as if the photograph brought him back towards a world that he understood a world of ransom demands and bribery and of newspaper headlines and radio bulletins and of the government in bonn and of the helplessness of the world that he knew the taking of the photograph had forced his mind to his family his wife and his children and his home forced him to think of his wife sitting numb in their home and of th dazed confusion of his children it was easier for him when he was in their world not his own when he lived the existence of his captors their world was the gun barrel and the handcuffs taking a hooded hostage across the rough sloping ground below the jabal al barouk crane froze holt behind him had taken three more steps before he registered cranes stillness crane held the palm of his hand outstretched fingers splayed behind his back so that holt could see the warning to stop it was the fifth hour of the night march holt was dead on his feet the moon falling into the last quarter threw a silver light on them crane very slowly sunk to his knees and haunches a gentle movement taking an age to go down holt followed him the bergen straps cut into his shoulders pure blessed relief to sink low and not to have to jar the bergen on his back crane turned his head his hand flicked the gesture for holt to come forward holt sensed the anxiety growing in his body when crane had first stopped he had been walking as an automaton no care other than not to disturb a loose stone or tread on a dried branch gone from him the sole concentration on his footfall he came forward he strained his eyes into the greyblack stillness ahead he saw nothing he found that his hands were locked tight on the stock of the model pm and the bloody thing was not even loaded and the flash eliminator at the end of the barrel was still covered with the dirtstained condom hell of a great deal of use young holt would be in defending the position he was close to crane crouched as he moved close enough for crane to reach back and with strength force him lower crane had him down pushed holt so that he lay full length on the narrow track holt heard the stone roll ahead of them a terrible quiet was in him the breath stifled in his throat a stone was kicked ahead of him they shared the path so bloody near to the tent camp and they shared the track crane was reaching for his belt hand moving at glacier speed they shared the bloody path all the tracks in south lebanon all the trails running on the hill slopes of the west side of the beqaa and they by god shared it holt breathed out tried to control himself tried not to pant he heard the voices clear as if they were beside him words that he did not understand a foreign language but a message of anger he could see nothing but the voices carried in the night quiet a guttural accent speaking english seeking communication i cannot see i cannot know what i hit more careful but i cannot see holt heard the impact of a kick he heard the gasp muffled then the sob i cannot see to walk a noise ahead as if a weight were dragged and new voices arabic urging greater pace holt did not understand the words knew the meaning crane had the pocket night sight to his eye he rarely used it cranes bible said that reliance on a night sight was dangerous hard to switch back and forth between a night sight and natural night vision they were making as much noise ahead as holt had conjured up on the first of the night march tests in the occupied territories so bloody long ago back in the time before history books holt thought the man who complained who could not see might be german or austrian or swiss german there was a stampede of stones away from the path and the sound of another kicking and the sound of another whimper he thought they were moving faster he thought the noises moved away holt waited on crane he heard the call of a hyena above he heard the barking of a dog behind and below from among the village lights of ain zebde he waited on crane methodically as was his way crane replaced the pocket night sight in the pouch on his belt its a european crane whispered whats a european doing god didnt you learn adding at school there are three hoods with a european prisoner on our track a european with a bag over his head who cannot see where hes going with arabs that adds to the movement of a hostage a hostage holt repeated the word seemed to be in awe of the word moving a hostage on my bloody route a savageness in cranes whisper what do we do keep going have to why have to because youngster we have a schedule we have an appointment we have to move behind them and move at their pace i dont have the time to lie up and im better keeping them in sight im better knowing where they are a hostage thats what i said definitely a hostage hes tied to one of them hes got a european accent hes short of trousers just a blanket over him were in an area of syrian control so they move him at night theyll be from islamic jihad or hezbollah they dont trust the shit syrians any more than i do dont kick any bloody stone youngster carefully with so much care holt pushed himself upright he stood all the time he could hear the fading sounds of movement ahead he let crane move off get the fifteen paces in front he struggled to ease the pressure of the straps on his shoulder best foot forward on a shared path he could not help himself he should have concentrated solely on each footfall there should have been nothing else in his mind no chaff no clutter nothing other than the weight of the ball of his foot testing for the loose stone for the dried branch for the crisped leaf the chaff and the clutter in his mind were the thoughts of love and vengeance he had told his girl his jane canning who was the personal assistant to the military attache that he loved her a long time ago he had told his girl that he loved her his girl was ashes he did not even know where the parents of his girl had scattered her ashes too distant from them to know whether they had taken her ashes to a sea shore or taken them to a heathland of heather flowers or taken them to the serenity of a woodland his girl was ashes gone dust earth so many things that he could remember of her meeting in the canteen at the school of east european and slavonic studies and thinking she was stunning waiting for her when she was late and the tryst was the pavement outside the odeon cinema in leicester square and hoping to god that she hadnt stood him up coming to her own bachelor girl flat with a bunch of freesias and a bottle of beaujolais and wondering whether he would get back to his own place before the end of the weekend holding her and kissing her when she had told him that she had landed moscow for a posting and wasnt it marvellous because he was headed there in a few weeks time and cursing that for those few weeks he would be without her and she would be without him scowling at her because she had put him down for ever and ever amen in the corridor of the oreanda hotel in yalta dont be childish holt he had told his minder his mr martins who worked the middle east desk of the secret intelligence service that he wanted vengeance bloody light years ago he would know the man that they called abu hamid the moment that he could focus the lenses of the binoculars upon him no doubt he had seen the man they called abu hamid for nine ten seconds he didnt believe he would ever forget the face and the crows foot scar bloody light years ago he had wanted vengeance he had told martins that he wanted the eye and the tooth both he thought that his desire for vengeance was sapped he thought that he had simply never had the guts to walk away from mr martins in england to walk away from mr crane in israel he thought that he was on the west slopes of the beqaa because he had never had the guts to turn his back on something as primitive as vengeance he thought that he would in no way benefit from the sniping of abu hamid he knew that nothing would change for jane nor for her parents either even if they would ever know and would anything change for him id want him killed they were at the seventh rally point of the night it was where crane had told him they would spend the few minutes of rest an exact man was crane each rally point reached on time the perfect instrument of vengeance holt huddled against crane the wind caught at the sweat running on his body and chilled him can i talk whisper youngster where are they ahead perhaps a quarter of a mile and its a hostage what i reckon holt swallowed hard he caught at the sleeve of cranes tunic shirt hes more valuable riddles youngster a hostage is more valuable than sniping abu hamid you know what youre saying there is more value in bringing back a hostage alive than in leaving abu hamid dead behind us i didnt hear that crane tugged his sleeve clear to bring back a hostage alive that is a genuine act of mercy then youre forgetting something youngster i am not forgetting a fellow human being in danger forgetting something big what is bigger than rescuing a man from that sort of hell your promise thats what youre forgetting a hostage is alive a hostage is an innocent crane turned away his voice was soft and cut the edge of the night wind i gave my word youngster i dont play skittles with a promise a hostage is worth saving is abu hamid worth killing i gave my promise pity you dont see that thats important they arent worth it the people whove got your promise time to move a hostages freedom is worth more than your promise i said it was time to move holt stood if i ever get out of this ill hate you mr crane for abandoning a hostage if you ever get out of this youngster itll be because of my promise just stop pissing in the wind crane searched the ground ahead with the pocket night sight they moved off the gap between them materialised holt could hear the distant sounds ahead of the progress of a hostage and his captors to the east of them below them was the village town of khirbet qanafar they went quiet traversing the slope side of the valley wall when they next stopped they would be at the lying up position overlooking the tent camp in the village town of khirbet qanafar the merchant lay on a rope bed and snored away the night hours many years before when he had first forsaken his lecture classes at beer sheba and moved into his clandestine life in lebanon he had found sleep hard to come by he had felt the persistent fear of discovery no longer he slept well covered by a blanket that he fancied had come from the headmans own bed beside the chair on which were laid his outer clothes the merchant had spread out two plastic bags of the sort that were used to carry agricultural fertiliser on these empty bags he had laid all the working parts of the pump engine that brought up water from one of khirbet qanafars three irrigation wells he had dismantled the pump engine during the late afternoon and early evening then he had eaten with the headman and the headmans sons in the morning after he had woken and washed and fed he would begin to reassemble the pump engine he knew the reassembly would take him many hours perhaps most of the day he knew that in the dusk of the following day he would still be at khirbet q a n a f a r it was all as he had planned it crane would snipe at dusk he slept easily he was in position as he had been told to be but how much longer how many more years could a university lecturer play the part of a merchant in spare parts for electrical engines and sleep in the bed of an enemy when he felt the softness of her body turn to cold abu hamid rose to his feet the candle had gone but the electricity supply was restored and light was thrown into the room from the alley way she lay at his feet only an awkwardness about the tilt of her throat and the lie of her head he went to the window he edged the thin curtains aside he saw the jeep parked at the end of the alley there was the auburn glow of the drivers cigarette he had been briefed on the plan for the attack against the defence ministry on kaplan they asked him for his life and for the lives of the men who would travel with him of course they would watch over him he lay on her bed he smelled the perfume of the sheets and the pillows he remembered the small groping hands of the boy child she had placed with gentleness on his shoulder heinrich gunter was pushed down onto his hands and his knees as he propelled himself forward over the rough rock floor he sensed the damp mustiness of the cave all according to cranes bible they moved through the lying up position then doubled back to circle it they settled away below them were the lights of the camp and the chugging drive of the generator carried up to their high ground flooding it with gold light the dawn slipped over the rim of the far valley wall it was as if the valley exploded in brilliance with the low beams of the suns thrust catching the lines and colours of the beqaa at dawn at a few minutes before tx oclock the valley was a place of quiet beauty the sun caught the clean geometric lines of the irrigation channels it flowed over the delicate green shades of the early growth of barley and wheat it bathed the rough strength of the grey yellow rock outcrops it glinted on the red tile roofs of khirbet qanafar it shone on the corrugated iron roofs of a commando camp the sun laced onto the windscreen of a travelling car the sun pushed down long shadows from the bodies of a flock of sheep driven by a child towards the uplands of the valley to the plateau where it would be cooler when the sun was high the sun burnished the scrubbed whiteness of a flag that carried in its centre an outline of the zionist state that was overpainted with crossed rifles with fixed bayonets and the sun striking out gave a shape to the conical tents of the camp the camp was no surprise it was familiar from the aerial photographs there was the wire perimeter there was the antitank ditch there was the cluster of large sleeping tents there was the latrine screen there were the holes in the ground of the air raid pits and of the armoury there was the tent of the commander set aside there was the roof above the cooking area the generator had been switched off at the first surge of daylight as if light were only needed as a protection against the dangers of the night a complete silence at the tent camp the only movement was the turn and wheel and casual stamp of the sentry at the entrance to the camp and the hustling of the cook as he revived the fire after the night and the drift towards the sun orb of the wavering smoke column and the flag fluttering out the emblem of the popular front above the camp at a place where the steeper sides of the valley wall flattened out to offer a more gentle slope to the floor of the beqaa the ancient ice age movements had left a gougedout overhang of rock the space under the lip of the protruding rock was shallow not more than three feet deep but the overhang ran some ten feet in length the overhang was unremarkable in the half mile or so to either side of this particular formation there were another nine similar devastations of the general line of the ground fall the overhang of rock was the place chosen by crane for the final lying up position crane asleep holt on watch the sun lifted clear of the jabal aarbi on the east side of the beqaa it was extraordinary for holt how fast the cleanness of the light began to diffuse into haze the sun was climbing he tugged his watch out from under his tunic top checked the time crane was sleeping well like he needed to sleep he would liked to have left crane to sleep longer to have the chance to rest the eye and to bring back strength into his muscles and calm into his mind the watch was the taskmaster he would be chewed out if he allowed crane to sleep beyond his allotted time he touched cranes shoulder since they had reached the lying up position he had slept for an hour and crane had slept for an hour but the sun was now up and the camp was stirring he could not think when they would next sleep crane awoke god and did he do it easily for holt it was a miracle of the world crane waking a fast rub of the eye half of a stifled yawn a vicious scratch at the armpit a scowl and a grin and crane was awake there were small figures moving from the tents there was the first tinkle of a transistor radio playing music and travelling against the wind did you sleep all right i slept fine whats moving starting to be shitshowershave time down there you know mr crane its fantastic us being here them being there i mean its what you said would happen but until i was here perhaps i didnt ever quite believe it you think too much youngster thats the problem of education hows the eye worry about yourself holt heard the pitch of cranes voice drop he saw him turn away cranes tongue was rolling inside his cheeks like he was cleaning his teeth with his tongue like the action was a toothpaste substitute what else is moving a boy over there with sheep there holt pointed to his right through the scrim net that masked them bit of traffic on the road nothing else when do i start looking the binoculars were in cranes bergen crane shook his head think about it youngster wheres the sun the suns straight into us you put the glasses up and youll risk burning your eyes out and youll risk a lens flash neithers clever you dont do any looking till the suns a hell of a lot higher patience youngster mr crane yeah mr crane what happened to the hostage there was a tremor of annoyance across crane mouth whats it to you i just wanted to know are you going to make a thing about it are you going to puke over me what happened to him crane whispered theres a cave a quarter of a mile back thats where they went we passed about hundred yards higher id say its where theyre going to hold him sometimes its beirut where they hold them sometimes its out in the beqa would be better in beirut wont be a hotel out here mr crane yeah when weve sniped when were heading back no nothing we can do you want to get home or you want to die i you want to go home you walk right past the cave you want to die you call for tea and scones sorry youngster holt hung his head his words were a murmur the wind in the scrim netting seems dreadful to leave him heh alexander the great came through here nebuchadnezzar was here the romans had a go at it there were the crusaders and the turks and the frenc and the yanks and the syrians and my people had a try at it everyones had a go at civilising this place and lebanon saw them all off thats just fact thats not education and its fact that you cant change things holt not on your little educated own you cant change a damned thing forget him its rotten to turn our backs on him crane looked for a moment keenly at holt didnt speak he untied the laces of his boots then pulled the laces tighter through the eyes and made a double bow from a pouch in the bergen he took a strip of chewing gum he lifted the armalite onto his lap holt watched him crane had his face against the netting and his eyes roved across the vista in front down towards the camp cranes hand settled on holts shoulder youll be all right youngster holt gagged what are you doing scouting going to find myself a hide further down you said that where wed be lying up would be yards i want six hundred crane said is it the eye i just want six hundred cant you do it at a thousand leave it holt close to a snarl holt shook his head didnt believe it according to cranes bible there should be no movement by daylight according to cranes text not even an idiot tried to move across open ground after dawn before dusk according to cranes chapter the team never split according to cranes verse a thousand yards was best for the sniper he couldnt argue he stared at crane it was as if his fear wide eyed softened crane im not gone long an hour may be a little more in an hour you start to use the glasses theyre all shit down there they cant see their assholes right now on my own just myself a buzzard overhead wont see me i find the place at yards and im back you spot the bastard for me we mark him we follow him we get to know him late afternoon suns going down suns behind us suns into them thats when i move again one shot at i stay put you stay put till its dark i come back for you and we move out got it youngster got it mr crane there was a reed in holts voice like he was a child afraid to be alone the scrim netting was slowly lifted and then crane was gone there was a crag boulder to the right of the overhang and holt saw the shape of crane his outline broken by the camouflage tabs reach the boulder he did not see him afterwards holt screwed his eyes tight he peered down onto the desolate and featureless ground between himself and the tent camp and he could not find a movement he could not credit that noah crane on that landscape had vanished fawzi blinked in the sunlight he stretched he yawned he pulled his trouser belt tighter he had slept well heavily the smile came to his face he had much to be cheerful about he was casting aside the sleep he was basking in the sunlight and the memory of the previous evening last years harvest well stored and well dried leaves and well packed much to smile about because there were five packages in the locked rear of his jeep and each package weighed kilos and each kilo was top quality the posting in the valley as liaison officer to the recruits camp had this one salvation constant access to the old and new marijuana crop he had done well in the weeks that he had spent setting up the camp and then introducing it to these boys of the popular front his money was in dollars cash dollars bank notes for dollars an understanding could be negotiated with the customs officials at the airport his dollars in cash less the price of the understanding could be carried in his hip pocket and in his wallet to the cities of rome and paris and athens they were the holy cities he would make his pilgrimage to when the creep hamid had gone with the chosen ten to damascus for the final preparation before the flight to cyprus and the sea journey to the shoreline of israel much to be cheerful about and the most cheering matter for lieutenant fawzi was that this would be his last day and his last night in the suffocating tedium of the beqaa there was a queue of recruits waiting to be served by the cook he ordered an omelette three eggs he said that he wanted coffee he went back to his tent pulled out a chair from inside waited for his food to be brought to him the smoke pungent from the dew damp wood played across his nostrils he held the binoculars as crane had taught him his thumb and his forefinger gripped the far end of each lens and the outstretched palms of his hands shielded the polished glass from the sun holt had stopped looking for crane he lay on his stomach quite still only allowing his head to move fractionally as he raked over the faces of the magnified figures moving lethargically between the tents he had covered the line in front of the cooking area and the line in front of the latrine screen he had followed the men as they emerged from their tents until they ducked back into them he could not believe that he had looked with the power of the binoculars into the face of abu hamid and had not known him he had seen no man with a crows foot scar on his cheek he had seen no man walk with the rolling gait of abu hamid crossing the street in front of the oreanda hotel he could remember the long sitting wait on the hard bench in the corridor leading to the cell block of the police station in tel aviv he could remember the beating given freely to the bomber what if the man had lied what if the man had lied to save his skin from the fists and the boots the doubts crawled in him what if he had travelled to the beqaa and abu hamid was not at the camp what if he had travelled to the beqaa and could not recognise abu hamid for the fourth time he started his search at the southern perimeter wire of the camp and traversed north searching for the face and doubting he had laid her body on the bed he covered her body with the sheet and then the bed cover he pulled the sheet high enough to obscure the bruising at her throat he had taken a flower from the vase by the window a rose he laid the flower on the bed cover across her breast he closed the door behind him he walked down the steep steps and out into the noise and crush of the alley he walked very straight he walked with the purpose of a young commander who had accepted a mission of leading an assault squad against the defence ministry on kaplan abu hamid climbed into the passenger seat of the jeep holt set the binoculars down on the rock dirt beside his hands the valley shimmered in the heat below him the sun burned a whiteness from the tent tops and flickered at those strands of the wire that were not rusted nothing wrong with the binoculars he had seen the dart of the rats at the bottom of the wire he was learning the life of the camp the men were sitting in a half circle swatting off the flies watching a hugely fat young man demonstrate the stripping down and the reassembling of a machine gun he could not see all of their faces not at this moment but he had checked each of the faces before they had sat down and he had checked the face of the uniformed instructor it had been a desperation to see if there was a crows foot scar on the left upper cheek of the instructor a last throw the cook was on his knees blowing at the fire only the cook and a sentry at the entrance to the camp and a man asleep in a chair by his tent were not involved in the class session he had come so far with crane three nights march a squashedin lifetime and abu hamid was not there his head and his body ached and his whole heart sank in despair major zvi dan went into the hushed badlylit room that housed the communications centre he closed the door gently behind him it was a world where no voice was raised where none of the men or women in uniform moved other than at a studied pace the room was an empire of electronics there was the purr of the teleprinters and the greenwash screens of the visual display units and the faint whisper of the recording equipment because of the nature of events because crane and holt had walked into the beqaa transmissions from the syrian military that were intercepted by the antennae of hermon would be relayed to the communications centre at kiryat shmona in a lowered voice he asked the communications captain if there was any information he should have there was nothing major zvi dan tore a sheet from the small notepad that he carried in his tunic breast pocket on the paper was written the figures identifying an ultra high frequency radio channel he asked that from the middle of the day that frequency should be continuously monitored still he watched the camp he played through in his mind what crane would say to him how he would reply definitely hes not there maybe hes a bit changed if he was there id know him if he had a beard id know him nothing further to look for at the camp the men were at the machine gun still three at a time practising what they had learned mr crane would have been disgusted the fire in the cooking area was out and the cook fellow was washing stainless steel dishes and the sentry walked backwards and forwards across the road track to the camp looking as though he were asleep the camp had nothing for him with the binoculars he tried to find crane couldnt find him just as he could not find the man hed come so far to see killed holt was desolated he had never been so alone if there is no one else to whom you will communicate your information then you have to wait the traveller settled deeper into the comfort of the armchair the outer office was cool pleasantly furn ished he had walnuts in a bag their shells already cracked my information is only for major said hazan the clerk did not trouble to hide his contempt the man stank was dressed like a peasant his shoes had brought the street dirt onto the carpet he has gone to a meeting i do not have a time for his return then i shall wait the pieces of walnut shell flaked to the carpet the traveller made no attempt to retrieve them he chewed happily on the crisp interior holt saw the dust plume spitting from behind the wheels of the jeep he reached for the binoculars he saw the markings above the jeeps engine presumably syrian army he saw that a single passenger sat beside the driver his sight became a blur holts head slashed sideways away from the road view away from the jeep the magnified vision leaped from the roadway to the camp from the tents to the camp entrance from the sentry to the cook the cook had come out of the camp he had skirted the wire the cook now climbed the slope on the west side of the camp holt could see that he was scavenging in the hugeness of the binoculars tunnel vision the cook seemed about to step into the overhang of rock holt could see that he whistled to himself he watched him smile pleased because he had found a length of dried wood he watched him tuck the length of wood under his arm and climb again he watched him slowly and unhurried hunting for more wood and climbing the slope holt did not know where noah crane hid at the entrance to the camp abu hamid jumped clear of the jeep and strode through the gap in the wire the jeep reversed away he saw fawzis lesson he thought that fawzi would have messed his trousers if he had ever been called on to fire a heavy machine gun in combat his throat was dry he walked to the cooking area he saw the dead fire no coffee warming high on the hill slope above the camp he saw the cook foraging for wood the vision of the binoculars roved the cook had an armful of wood so much now that he had wavered twice as if uncertain whether more was needed the open falling ground was devoid of cover except for longdead trees lying strewn and ossified the sun had burnt the bark from them the deep clumsilydug ditch refuse bags and the sheets of discarded newspaper trapped on the coiled wire the men were all sitting bored and listless no longer attentive to the gesturing officer in front of his class the new arrival the new man in the camp walked to stand behind the sitting instructor listened for a few moments turned away the binoculars followed him something in the stride something in the bearing the twin eyepieces were rammed against holts eyebrows and cheekbones he had seen the right side of the face he had seen the full of the face he had seen the short curled hair at the back of the head the new man now seemed to walk aimlessly a tent floated in front of him holt swore the man reappeared doubling back smoking left side of the face holt could hardly hold the binoculars steady breath coming in pants hands trembling he gulped the air down into his lungs he forced the air down into his throat breathing as a sniper would winning control of his body cranes bible breathing critical he saw the mans left hand raised to his face he saw the finger peck at a place on the left cheek he saw the hand drop holt saw the crows foot scar the breath shuddered out of his chest the vision of the binoculars bounced the tunnel of sight bounced fell he had seen the crows foot scar the shadow pit of the well of the scar four lines of the scar spreading away from the dark centre the cook the cook still coming up the hill bending here and there for a piece of wood carefree abu hamid seen beside the other men in the camp holt thought abu hamid was taller than he had remembered him and thinner and his hair was longer and falling to the olive green collar of his fatigue top all doubt was gone he felt a huge surge of exhilaration and he recognised it a sudden sharper stronger fright but noah crane and young holt had done it they had walked into the bloody awful beqaa valley and they had found him they had him at close quarters had traced him behind the lines on the other side of the hill and where the hell was noah crane the cook the cook had set down his gathered bundle and come higher he would collect another armful and then go back for the first the cook meandered on the hill side searching abu hamid abu hamid walked amongst the tents to holt he seemed a man without purpose sometimes he would insinuate himself close to the officer who lectured the young soldiers sometimes he would turn and walk away as if the lecture bored him he flitted he was aimless holt in his mind saw jane and the ambassador he saw the blood rivers on the steps of the hotel he saw the white pallor of death on her face on his face he wondered if there was indeed a sweetness in revenge or whether it would merely be a substitute saccharine dose he knew the excitement at the discovery of abu hamid he could not imagine whether he would find pleasure fruit satisfaction in abu hamid dead he had never hurt a human being in his life not even at school not even in a playground fight no answers the cook as if struck by an electric shock the cook jerked backwards scattering the branches of wood behind him crane appearing seeming to thrust himself up from under the feet of the cook holt saw everything the tunnel of his binoculars was filled with the cook trying to heave himself backwards with crane rising and groping and grasping for him the cook screamed a shrill carrying scream the scream winnowed over the hillside the scream was clear to holt who was four hundred yards from the cook to the tent camp that was six hundred yards from the cook holt heard the rising cadence of the scream he saw the flash of the blade he saw the body of crane merge with the body of the cook he heard the scream cut snuffed out fawzis words had been lost the recruits had first stiffened swung then jacknifed to their feet they had seen the cook on the hillside seen him try to twist away break into flight they had seen the assailant they had heard the death of the scream abu hamid charged from in front of his own tent towards the class towards the dshkm heavy machine gun holt lay on his stomach pressing his body as far as he could back into the recess of the rock overhang he saw the brightness of the blade and he saw the cook crumple to his knees then slide to his face he realised at once the enormity of it their cover was gone he was hiding but crane had no hiding place he thought the cook might even have stepped on crane he thought the cook had been close enough to crane to have actually put his boot onto the back of cranes camouflaged head or the back of cranes camouflaged body holt watched crane the hugeness of the tunnel vision seemed to give him an intimacy with crane who was four hundred yards further down the hillside he believed he could see the turmoil of decision in cranes features crane looked back down the hillside down the slope towards the tent camp holt followed his eye line flashed the tunnel view of the binoculars towards the tent camp the recruits were streaming towards the entrance between the coiled wire back to crane holt saw the hands of noah crane fumbling at his waist then he saw him crouch sharp movements now decision taken mind made crane back onto his feet holt saw that he no longer wore his belt he peered again to be sure crane no longer carried his belt on his waist according to cranes bible the belt was never taken from the body not to sleep not to defecate crane no longer wore his belt crane had his back to holt he gazed up high onto the hillside as if his eyeline was a half a mile higher than the rock overhang as if his eyeline was far to the south holt heard cranes shout cranes hands were at his mouth cupped to amplify his shout crane bellowed towards a place on the hillside holt thought that crane shouted in hebrew that he called a warning crane started to run at an angle on the hillside more understanding but then a child could have understood they were young the pursuers they were fast on the hillside they were swarming amongst the rock outcrops over the broken ground he was taking them away his warning was a deception he was leading them away from holt there was the first ranging burst from the machine gun three four rounds there was the first red light of a sighting tracer bullet holt could not take his vision his magnified gaze away from crane the pursuers teenagers half the age of crane must gain would gain on the quarry a second burst a second flailing flight of tracer holt could no longer see cranes face could see only the heaving shake of his back as he ran away from holt ran for his life holt saw the puff pecks of the bullets striking rock and scree and stone crane sagged he stumbled he fell he rose again out aloud abu hamid shouted his triumph three four round bursts of mm ammunition aimed bursts from a tripod muzzle velocity nine hundred yards a second he had seen his target go down rise again collapse rise again he had his hit holt saw crane go forward he seemed to hobble he was ducking and weaving as he went but slower each step deeper into pain he understood the vixens loyalty to her cub a scarred world weary bitchy old vixen giving life to a wetbehind theears cub the gunfire had stopped no more shooting holt could see that the pursuers were now too close to crane to make it either safe or necessary to fire again the pursuers bounded over the diminishing ground hunted down their man he heard crane shout again make another pretence at a warning to phantom men in a position ahead of him holt saw the cave mouth holt saw the first head shoulders appear at the mouth of the cave the mouth of the cave was a hundred yards ahead of cranes line it was the edge of holts vision it was the place that was half masked from him four men came out of the caves mouth one man wore only the grey whiteness of underpants upon the pink whiteness of his body chaos on the hillside chaos for crane who was wounded chaos for three men of the hezbollah who were discovered and flushed out chaos for a hostage prisoner the three men ran the hostage prisoner stood alone the gap between crane and his pursuers narrowed holt watched crane was engulfed he let the binoculars fall from his eyes his head drooped down into the dirt floor of the rock overhang the tears misted his eyes ran bitter to his lips crane was dragged down the hillside the hostage prisoner was escorted after him a moment when the lights seemed to go out when hope was lost the argument was ferocious i wounded him my shooting my boys captured him i should take him youve work here abu hamid and lieutenant fawzi face to face it was us who caught him me who will take the jew you want to take the credit from us you have men to choose you have a mission to perform you will stay so that you will take the credit so that you can prepare your mission in the hand of fawzi was the dog tag ripped from the neck of the prisoner kept safe in fawzis hand just as the prisoner would be safe in fawzis possession i should take him to damascus i order you to stay here you will perform your duty fawzi walked away he went to the knot of recruits that had gathered round the prisoner he shouldered aside the man kicking the prisoner he thought that by now they would all have had their turn with the boot he saw the blood seeping from the knee of the prisoner he saw the mouth twisted to stifle an agony he told the recruits that the prisoner should not again be kicked he went to his tent he knew enough of the english language that was common between them to receive the garbled thanks of the hostage prisoner he sat at the table that was set between his bed and the bed used by abu hamid he switched on the battery power for the radio he waited when the lights glowed when he had transmission power he broadcast his success to damascus holt watched the body of the cook was carried down the hillside on a stretcher made of rifle slings and the wood he had been collecting and along with the body was the armalite rifle that crane had carried a second search party had scoured the cave and brought down to the camp boxes of food and weapons and bedding holt saw all that he was undisturbed the recruits of the popular front had no interest in that part of the hillside where holt lay under the rock overhang and the screen of scrim netting holt watched the camp he could see crane lying prone on the earth he could see the blood on his legs he could see the rifles that covered cranes every pain spasm they had not found cranes belt the belt lay amongst the rocks deep amongst them at the place where crane had begun his decoy flight holt tried to memorise the place tried to recall each detail of cranes movement so that he could remember that exact place where crane had crouched to conceal his belt major said hazan swivelled his chair so that his back was to the traveller so that he faced the wall map he studied the two redheaded pins that he had set into his map it was major said hazans style to repeat each piece of information given him so that there should be no possible error no missed inflection no false interpretation and the information came from an englishman an englishman of middle years staying at the guest house of the kibbutz kfar giladi and he said how did you know about the infiltration last night that is what he said and that last night that was the night that olaffson said the israelis had fired flares to blind the night equipment that is correct major he spoke to himself he ignored the traveller he stared at the redheaded pin that marked the unsubstantiated interception why are the british going into the beqaa the traveller shrugged fragments of walnut tumbled from his clothes to the white pile of the carpet a wretch such as i major how could i know he needed to think he required moments of contemplation major said hazan was denied the moments a sharp tap at the door a bustling entrance from his clerk a sheet of paper handed to him he studied it he seemed no longer to see the traveller he reached for a telephone he demanded that the jew prisoner be brought to damascus by air force helicopter he demanded that the jew prisoner be brought to the custody of air force intelligence to win his demands he invoked the authority and the fear of that authority of that building in which he worked major zvi dan rocked on his feet he stood in the middle of the communications centre he held loose in his hand the report of the intercepted traffic for the third time he read the message as if in the frequency of the reading he might find a straw no comfort nothing to cling to intercept transmission time hours local traffic originated pflp training camp nr khirbet qanafar beqaa traffic destination afi hq damascus code n d series afi message israeli serviceman car rying identification of noah crane rel j e w i d no captured while on surveillance of camp wounded in same operation link uncertain frg national heinrich gunter hostage freed unhurt search of area into which crane fleeing failed to find remainder of i n f i l tration party request eye bring to damascus signed fawzi l t no comfort no straw each reading worse than the last the communications officer came quietly to his side he asked the frequency we are to monitor we are still to monitor it yes major zvi dan said he went outside he went into the bright sunlight midday and the sun swirling off the dust of the parade area and off the tin roofing of the huts and off the armour plate of the personnel carriers from the troops quarters he heard the cheerful playing of music from the forces station he passed beside the verandah outside the canteen he knew that rebecca watched him but he could not bring himself to speak to her his face would have told her he was familiar with disaster his work often travelled in tandem with catastrophe many times he had known the pain and the catastrophe of losing a field agent the hurt was never more manageable for being familiar he went into the building block he walked to the sentry who lolled in his chair outside the door he gestured for the door to be opened percy martins sat on the bed major zvi dan saw the dulled scowl of martinss welcome he passed the sheet of paper to the englishman he let the englishman hold the sheet of paper as if for authenticity then he translated line by line from the hebrew god you had the right to know holt what about holt he is alone what can we do for him he is beyond our reach hes just a boy then he should never have been sent can he not be helped if it were crane who were free if it were holt who was taken then there is perhaps something we could do for crane something but he would have to do much for himself i doubt if it works on the other side of the coin percy martinss hands covered his face his voice was muffled through the thickness of his fingers is it because of what i did i have no means of knowing what will they do to crane torture him will he talk how would you respond to torture skilled torture mr martins put on your shoes please where are you taking me there was a cold rueful smile on major zvi dans face london will want to know what has happened they will want to set in train whatever machinery they can to minimise the damage he took martins to an office with a secure telephone he dialled for him the number of the station officer at the embassy in tel aviv in a dust storm the helicopter of the syrian air force took off from beside the camp the power of the rotors thrashing for lift buffeted the tents scattered the refuse that clung to the coiled wire on the perimeter heinrich gunter now wore the tunic and trousers of a recruit of the popular front clothes he had been given explanations none he could not comprehend how his escape from his captors had come about he thought his freedom had been gained by the man who lay on the floor of the helicopter the man was dressed in military clothes that were indented with camouflage tabs and his leg was badly wounded and noone had attempted to dress the wound and he was handcuffed to the bulkhead and he was covered by the handgun of the syrian officer who had boarded the helicopter at the camp he saw that the man he believed had brought about his freedom bit hard at his bottom lip as though he were suffused in pain as if he would not show his captor his pain as if he refused to cry out gasp through the portholes of the gazelle helicopter gunter saw laid out beneath him the bright and tranquil breadth of the beqaa valley they clapped the men and the boys and the women from behind their face scarves trilled their appreciation there was the drone of the working generator there was the splash of water lifted from great depths and now free to run in the dug channels the merchant grinned and bowed to receive the congratulations the merchant was asked by the headman of khirbet qanafar to take food at his table to share the midday meal he was pleased to accept he fancied he could smell the cooking of partridge he was pleased to accept because it suited him to stay at the village town of khirbet qanafar until last light the merchant had heard the shooting perhaps two miles north up the valley news came that a jew had been captured that a hostage prisoner had been freed only one man captured in his long years in lebanon he was practised in deceit he could guard his emotions he would be honoured to take food with the headman and with the headmans sons he had done it as he thought crane would have done it when the sun was behind him at last holt crawled out of the fragile cover of the net and down the hillside he thought that he had been moving for a little more than an hour flat on his stomach stomach ground against the earth and sunscorched rock he had gone the four hundred yards from the lying up position to the place where crane had killed the cook the blood was there the blood reinforced the truth the truth was the capture and the throwing through the hatch door of the military helicopter of noah crane he could hear the shouting and the triumph from the camp singing and the yelling of slogans voices competing one with another then he found cranes belt it was wedged down between two small rocks and half buried by a trailing network of undergrowth crane had left his belt on purpose cranes bible do nothing without a reason slowly with great care each movement weighed and considered young holt began the stomach crawl back towards the lying up position and the heat shimmered over him and the sun burned through the cotton of his tunic top as crane himself would have done it it was two oclock in the afternoon it was that part of the daytime during which the valley slept low on the beqaa where the litani river and the irrigation channels made the shades of green only the butterflies moved hovering between flowers that part of the day when the men had slid off to their homes and their women to the coolness of their houses and the children had gathered under the shadespreading trees the soldiers in their nearby temporary barracks had taken to their sleeping cots the shepherd boys dozed their flocks had tucked in their legs and knelt and panted a great sloth blanketed the valley at two oclock in the afternoon holt managed to reach his lying up position again he lay under the scrim net and he gasped down the warm air he heaved to draw the strength down into his lungs he felt the sweat running on his body he drank water until his belly his bladder could take no more he had no shortage of water he had the water from cranes pack he had no shortage of food because he had cranes food as he dragged the air down into his chest as he poured the water down his throat he could lie outstretched under the rock overhang because he had also cranes place he had cranes water food and his place he was alone when he had rested a little when he had drunk heavily he turned to cranes belt he opened each pouch in turn two pouches holding litre water bottles one pouch holding a single days emergency dehydrated rations one pouch holding two of the spare magazines for the armalite rifle one pouch holding the survival kit matches candle flint magnifying glass needles and thread fish hooks and line compass beta light flexi saw capsules of sedative and antibiotic and antihistamine surgical blades plasters and butterfly sutures and a condom one scabbard pouch the knife was in the cook one small pouch holding five rounds for the model pm he took the pouch from the belt clipped it to his own belt he anticipated that there was only one pouch that mattered to him it was days ago nights before that he had identified the one pouch on cranes belt that was not duplicated on his own perhaps he was nervous of intruding into a secrecy that was particular to noah crane he did not doubt that it was this last pouch the largest on cranes belt that crane had meant for him holt opened the flap and drew out the rectangular green painted metal cased box he saw the switches and the dials there were signs directions printed on the box in english he read his lips moved the words croaked in his throat property of the armed forces of the united states of america his eyes flitted search air rescue beacon mark v he strained to read in the dappled shadow of the scrim netting the smaller printed information three second bleep pattern can guide to metres to last days extend aerial for maximum effect power switch red spot green s p o t holt shivered in the heat he trembled he understood the beacon device was the last ditch defence it was for a cockup and because crane didnt talk about cockups then he didnt talk about it the beacon had been left to him by crane he saw that the switch could go to the green spot or to the red spot and he didnt know to which frequency they would be locked and he didnt know what the range was and he didnt know how the bleep transmission would be affected by the mountain and valley terrain but it had been left for him by his mentor wait on wait on holt no bloody stupid ideas about crying in the sand and switching to green spot or to red spot and sitting on his backside offering up prayers he was stuck between the training camp in the valley and the commando camp further up the valley and the armed men of the village town of khirbet qanafar all that below him and above him there were the troops guarding the surveillance installations on the jabal el barouk wait on holt he wondered whether the leaving of the beacon was meant as a means of escape or whether it was meant as an encouragement he repacked the pouch he found a space for it just on his own belt an encouragement he turned heaved his body round he lifted his binoculars he had seen that abu hamid had not boarded the helicopter he had watched abu hamid into his tent the camp was now in siesta just the sentry at the entrance on the move and that rarely he awaits you major you are to be congratulated fawzi for which major i thank you tell me what happened fawzi sat forward in the chair he had the attention of major said hazan of the onceburned eyes and the oncescorched ears i was taking a class through the detail of the assembly and stripping of a dshkm machine gun the camp cook was on the hill above the camp collecting wood for the fire on which he cooks i think he must have stumbled on this crane he shouted he had a chance to shout before he was stabbed to death by the jew his shout alerted us immediately i took over the machine gun and when the jew started to flee i began firing i have to confess major that at first i was not successful but in moments i had the range i achieved a disabling hit the moment i had done that and seen that the jew no longer had the capacity to run i organised the capture party i led a group of the popular front recruits onto the hillside and we captured the jew he was not in a condition to resist it was well done fawzi i was carrying out my duty major and the hostage heinrich gunter fawzi shrugged i can only give you what is an opinion major i think that our finding him was chance i cannot see a connection between the jew and a hostage and the hostage has given no sign of any link between them i believe that the flight of the jew happened to take him towards a cave where the hostage was held i believe that in fear the hezbollah or the islamic jihad simply abandoned their hostage and much equipment besides but it is good for us regaining the hostage it is very good indeed in the power play of diplomacy at the moment when our nation is confronted with the lies of the west european nations that we are a state which sponsors terrorism it is a beautiful thing that we are able to deliver this heinrich gunter to his ambassador quite excellent but it is the jew that matters fawzi warmed t o me in the direction of his flight from his actions he tried to warn the others in his infiltration group of danger major said hazan clapped together his mutilated hands closer to the security zone we block them the orders have been given so he awaits me so much to concern major said hazan he had the evidence of an infiltration he had an unconfirmed interception he had the report of the conversation of an englishman at kiryat shmona he had the detail of the capture of the jew named crane on the hillside above the tent camp occupied by the recruits of the popular front major said hazan stood in front of his mirror he tugged down the jacket of his uniform he straightened his tie he smoothed back the few hairs left on his scalp i have bad news prime minister the director general stood in the centre of the room his pipe was in his pocket the prime minister had been in a full meeting of the cabinet a note had been carried in the discussion on the plight of the inner cities had been shelved the prime minister had come out the prime minister was at the window staring down at the spring bursting garden lebanon the voice was a murmur you will remember that we sent two men in we sent an expert in covert infiltration who was also an accomplished marksman and we sent the young diplomat who was the eyewitness of course i remember we have lost the marksman the marksman has been captured alive by the syrians and taken by helicopter to damascus it was the voice of a bell tolling this is neither more nor less than i expected the diplomat has not been held and i wanted it called off you said prime minister that the diplomat was fortunate to have the chance of real adventure he has that chance now where did it happen in the target area holt thats his name isnt it the diplomat can he get out frankly no the director general said curtly they were at the target and they had not fired if they had succeeded at the target we would have known of it there is no information the prime minister twisted venom in the eyes a spit in the words you have made a fool of me i will be ridiculed in the chancelleries of europe in washington this government will be badly damaged you dont concern yourself of course with such matters prime minister my concern at present is for the safety of young holt and it is for the life of noah crane and if your mr holt is captured or killed as seems most probable will you still blather to me about vengeance will you send another clandestine team to lebanon it was utterly preposterous indeed it was criminally stupid recriminations prime minister regrettably do not help them and what does help them pray sadly nothing that i know of i will keep you informed prime minister when he had gone the room was silent the prime minister paced beyond the closed window the wind whipped the dust on horse guards and bent the trees in the walled garden the clouds scurried low the lights were dull in the room and the face of holt was unknown the prime ministers lips pursed in angry concentration but no effort could conjure up the face of the boy in such danger nor of the assassin abu hamid nor of the far away terrain of the beqaa the prime minister lifted a telephone asked for the cabinet secretary in his downing street office the prime minister said briskly a covert mission in lebanon has failed i want the foreign secretary here at two i want his principal middle east people with him the prime minister paused and i would like you to draw up a list of names three four if you prefer for us to consider as replacements for the director general casualties what do you mean are there casualties my dear man we are dealing with a diplomatic catastrophe not a train derailment the prime minister went to lunch soup and wholemeal bread and a glass of fresh orange juice a working lunch with close advisers and the agenda involved future government initiatives to encourage industrial investment in scotland he ate his food cold holt did not dare light the hexamine tablets to heat the water the packet told him that the dehydrated flakes were intended as a beef goulash he poured cold water into the packet and stirred it to a dark porridge with his finger he ate as much as he could as much as he could without vomiting he drank a pint of water he checked his watch he measured the passing of the afternoon he tried not to think of noah crane when he had eaten and when he had drunk when he had stifled the hunger pain and the pain of isolation holt took the condom from the barrel of the model pm meticulously stage by stage he started to clean the rifle with the graphite grease from his vantage point as he wiped the working parts of the rifle he gazed down onto the tent camp he reckoned the siesta would soon be finished he reckoned they would emerge soon as crane would have done it holt couldnt help himself couldnt wipe away the thoughts of crane tried and failed in a dungeon in a basement in a cell the interrogators howling at him the blows raining on him he wondered if he would have the time the time to wait until he was ready until the sun started to slide in the late afternoon he said my name is noah crane my idf serial is the kick heaved him across the tiled floor my name is noah crane the army boot again into the kidney area at the small of his back my idf serial is the army boot stamped onto the knuckle of his hand his eyes were closed they had gone with their gloved fists for his eyes first his eyes were puffed shut his leg where the mm round had taken away the flesh tissue and the bone at the knee no longer hurt him too much hurt from the fresher wounds he was not handcuffed and his legs were not tied yet he was too weak too exhausted to protect himself he lay on his side he tried to curl himself forward into his sleeping position but that was no protection because they could then kick the back of his head the back of his neck the small of his back the base of his spine he knew that there were four of them in the room he knew they were high in the building because strong light filtered through the dropped v e n e t i a n blinds he knew that in the room were two men who wore the uniforms and arm markings of sergeants in the air force he knew that also in the room was the lieutenant who had brought him from the beqaa he knew that these three men were not the ones that mattered the one who did matter wore the uniform of a major the man sat on a hard wooden chair against the wall and ground his spent cigarettes on the tiles the face of the man had been rebuilt before his eyes had closed he had seen the smooth baby skin of the major who asked the questions in quiet and cultured english mr crane you are being your own enemy my name is noah crane you need attention for your leg the doctors and the nurses and the surgeons are waiting my idf serial is you have to tell me what was the tasking of your mission into the beqaa my name is noah crane you have to tell me what was the object of your mission my idf serial is mr crane by your own hand with your own knife you murdered a poor cook boy you are not a prisoner of war mr crane to us you are a common criminal do you know mr crane what is the fate of common criminals convicted of the murder of innocents my name is noah crane we have in our criminal code mr crane an instrument of execution in our native tongue we call that instrument the khazuk sadly i do not have present with me such an instrument to show you it is mr crane a sharp pointed staff that is driven down into the body of the condemned to our judges the khazuk is a deterrent it is the decision of the executioner into which part of the body he drives the khazuk the result is the same it is simply the timing of death that is at variance my idf serial is he heard the rustle of the cigarette packet he heard the click of the lighter he stiffened his muscles he could not protect himself it was the signal when the major lit a cigarette and leaned back and inhaled then the boots flew the lieutenant kicked hardest crane gasped the lieutenant kicked as if his promotion depended on it he wanted to cry heavy toe caps belting at his shoulders and his back and his spine mr crane i think you are a racist i think you believe that because you are a jew and i am an arab you are superior to me i think you believe that i am foolish my name is noah crane would you like me to demonstrate to you mr crane that i am not foolish my idf serial is the boots in again the kicking and the stamping and the hands going for his short cut hair and dragging up his head so that his face could be kicked he thought he was falling falling in a pit dark sides black bottom he thought of holt white light on a hillside white light of a bullet path over a hillside falling tumbling helpless and he thought of the face of holt the face of the youngster a thousand yards and getting into five inches god the pain god the pain in the bone at the end of his spine and the pain was blackness darkness the pain riddled through him and he was falling backwards down he felt a calmness he felt a peace through the battery of the boots a hillside rose flowers and oleander bushes and watered cyclamen he heard the singing of the rabbis prayers he heard the rattle crash of the volley he heard the beauty of the bugle playing he walked on the slope of mount herzl he was a stranger amongst the men from kiryat shmona who had come south to the cemetery and the rabbi in army fatigues and the chief of staff in starched uniform it was the bottom of the pit it was the end of the darkness the blackness it was sunlight on the slopes of mount herzl mr crane because i have to demonstrate to you that i am not foolish answer me when you were infiltrated through the norbat sector there was an englishman staying at the guest house of the kibbutz kfar giladi why was the infiltration the concern of the englishman he forced open his eyes his vision was narrowed by the swelling at his cheeks his eyebrows he hesitated my name is noah crane when you were infiltrated you travelled with an englishman mr crane who is the englishman why is an englishman involved in the infiltration he stared at the constructed face at the pink underskin there was no challenge in his voice my idf serial is he pushed himself up the pain flooded inside him he knelt in front of the major he gazed into the face he was losing he had reacted he thought of holt the clean young face of holt he thought he loved the boy he thought he should have been the father of the boy and he asked the boy for a thousand yards and he asked the boy to shoot into five inches diameter he felt the wash of despair mr crane in me rests a decision the decision that is mine is whether you go from here to a military prison to await some exchange or whether you go from here to the el masr gaol to await the convenience of the executioner and the khazuk mr crane why is an englishman concerned in an infiltration why were you on surveillance on the hillside above the camp of the popular front recruits he whispered hoarsely my name is noah crane as if they were the only men in the room as though the tormentors had evaporated the major with his surgeons face the marksman with his slashed puffed bleeding face why are the english concerned with this camp help me mr crane because i am trying to understand what is particular what is important about this camp the major shook his head his laugh tinkled he used his hands how could he have been so blind the major beamed his pleasure at crane a low voice as if he confided in the wretch who knelt in front of him abu hamid my idf serial is he saw the pleasure in the peculiar wideapart eyes of major said hazan he saw the satisfaction curl the mouth that was lipless you know the name of abu hamid mr crane my name is noah crane abu hamid is the commander of the camp where the popular front recruits are undergoing training abu hamid is the slayer of a british official abu hamid is like a toy to me again the major laughed you thought me a fool you mistook me mr crane my idf serial is you are boring me mr crane i have what i require i have the target for your infiltration you may take it mr crane that from this moment the target is taken out of the reach of your english plan he seemed to see holt he seemed to see the jutting barrel of model pm noah crane lurched to his feet the weight gave at his wounded knee he fell forward he cannoned down onto the sitting major he saw the throat he saw the grafted skin above the knotted tie below the stubbed smooth chin his hands found the throat his hands locked on the throat he seemed to see the corridor aperture of the telescopic sight and the wavering of the crosshairs on the chest of a sallow skinned dark haired man who was marked by a crows foot scar on his left upper cheek he clung to the throat he felt the blows of the lieutenant he felt the scrabbling fingers of the sergeants he heard the shortening gasps of breath he seemed to know the gentle two stage squeeze on the trigger of the model pm there was the sunlight shafting between the water green trees on mt herzl there was the ripple of the singing there was the floating of the flowers there was the love of his people and there was holts love he squeezed they could not pull him back he could hear their shouts he could feel their hammered blows he clung to the throat the man no longer fought him he saw the pinkness of the face dissolve washed to pale grey blue he saw the pistol in the hand of the lieutenant noah crane seemed to hear the youngster holt fire the foreign secretary slammed down his hand onto the mahogany polished table top it was a theatrical gesture but he was not ashamed of it one of his aides took a shorthand note for posterity his two senior advisers on the middle eastern desk at fco shuffled their hands he knew they were having an affair an affair albeit adulterous between an assistant secretary and a deputy assistant secretary between two hoursaweek aides was a regrettable but supportable nuisance lebanon the beqaa was totally unsupportable it was the end of the world i do not understand how this could have happened the prime minister drew doodle faces on a pad and kept silent the foreign secretary warmed only at this moment of failure am i for the first time informed of a clandestine adventure into lebanon at no stage was i consulted but for the record ill tell you what my advice would have been forget it thats what youd have been told my opinion was not asked for and where do we find ourselves we sent in two operatives one is now captured and presumably pouring his heart out in damascus the other untrained will be blundering around in the beqaa a headless chicken with capture inevitable prime minister have you any remote idea of the damage that will be done to british interests in the middle east and in the gulf when crane and holt are paraded in open court in damascus years of hard economic endeavour years of patient diplomacy will have been undone by this folly it goes without saying that i shall be forced to consider my position as a member of her majestys government it stood a good chance of success the prime minister said bleakly ah success success is different success is all important but we do not have success we have instead a mission so illprepared that even the basement of the white house would have blinked at it if the brute had been killed if prime minister if but one is captured and the other is certain of capture it is a disaster and a perfectly avoidable disaster had you chosen to confide in your colleagues we had to show our strength the strength of the free world against terrorism your concept of strength is different to mine i cannot see that i can be of further help to you the foreign secretary pushed back his chair he swept his papers and his map of lebanon into the mouth of his attache case he stood then get out the prime minister said if all you can offer is the threat of your resignation just go the aide who took the record wrote furiously then slapped shut his notepad buried it in an inner pocket the foreign secretary led out his team for a long time the prime minister sat bent at the table digesting the loneliness of the room and no comforting face only the prayer that the young man holt was running running hard from that godforsaken place that was the beqaa as crane would have done it everything that holt could remember the light was going down below him the shadows of the tents lengthened he saw the first figures emerging from the tents as if in the coming coolness their rest time was complete he shared the rock overhang with a small lizard the reptile showed no fear of him he thought there was a cheerfulness about the lizard as he would have said there was a cheerfulness about the chaffinches and the robins that came to the lichencovered bird table on the lawn of his parents home he had cleaned the rifle he had pulled the x cloth through the barrel pulling from the bolt end according to cranes bible because to pull from the muzzle end was to risk damaging to a fractional extent the precision of the rifling he had pulled back the bipod legs and adjusted them so that each was calibrated to the same length he edged the antiflash extension to the barrel out through the scrim netting he took from cranes bergen a plastic water bottle and pushed the bottle out under the netting and then tipped its mouth so that the water ran onto the rock and dirt that was below the muzzle he saw the dribble of the water and the colouring of the ground according to cranes bible wet ground under a muzzle reduced the chance of a dust puff at the moment of firing when the bullet and the gases burst from the barrel a dust puff youngster can give away the firing position as crane would have done it he had a degree in modern history and his special subject was when oliver cromwell was lord protector of the commonwealth he was an entry into the foreign and commonwealth office through the diplomatic service fast stream he was a third secretary with particular interest in the political development and sociological movements inside the union of soviet socialist republics he was on his belly and watched by a lizard and under a rock overhang on the other side of the hill he was considering whether he could put a mm remington mag bullet into a five inch diameter target at a thousand yards holt saw the tent flap move he reached for his binoculars holt saw abu hamid step clear of the dark opening of the tent he watched abu hamid yawn and stretch and spit he looked for the length of the shadows he tugged his watch up from under his shirt holt thought that the sun was still too high that he must wait for a minimum of another half an hour zvi dan said from what weve pickcd up on the monitoring theyve lifted crane to damascus martins asked will you get him back in an exchange alive if he is alive not for months years and then only if we have a jewel to trade we dont have such a jewel dead if they have killed him they extract a high price the last time we sent them back a swarm of prisoners we had in return three coffins in one was the wrong body the other two were filled with stones does that answer your question from the bed martins looked up at major zvi dan nothing on holt they havent caught him we would have heard they know crane was not alone they have set blocks further south nearer to the border thank you i appreciate your telling me it is too late to be angry major zvi dan said abu hamid had not slept he had lain on the camp bed and had watched the radio the radio would tell him what fate awaited him he thought that the radio would have told if they had found the body of margarethe schultz he could see her in his mind and he could see on her breast the crimson flash of the flower that he had laid there he felt no guilt he thought that what he had done was justified he thought that what they would do to him would also be justified of course he would not be arrested of course he would not go to the el masr gaol of course he would not be driven to a small square at dawn and be dropped from a gallows beam what they would do to him what would be justified was that they would send him ashore on the beaches of israel in his spider handwriting on a food carton he had written the names of the ten he walked through the camp he sought out each of the ten they were those who would stand at his side they were those who would protect him he would never be taken he heard the first bickering argument flare behind him one had not been chosen one had been chosen the imbeciles did not even know for what they were or were not chosen but already the argument when he had spoken to the ten men he drifted towards the cooking area and gave encouragement to the pressed volunteer who would prepare their food and he kicked more wood onto the fire and spluttered in the surge of smoke it was a bargain jane was no part of the bargain nor was his country the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland the bargain was with crane for his being taken and for the freeing of the hostage prisoner that he would fire a sniper rifle for the first time in his life try to get into five inches diameter at a thousand yards no longer had anything to do with vengeance or patriotism he would fire for noah crane miserable old goat he would use the rifle for crane who had a disease in the retina of his shooting eye he would not walk away from noah crane he saw the smoke surge up from the fire he watched the smoke climb and then curve where the wind took it with the compass from his belt he could estimate that he would be firing on a line east south east he followed the smoke trail he matched the trail to his compass this was the crucial calculation if he made the wrong calculation then he would betray the memory of noah crane he reckoned that the trail of the smoke was moving east north east burrowing down into his recollection of figures that he had once been told he dragged out the figures showing a bullets deviation with wind blowing at ten miles an hour at a deflection of degrees at yards the wind deflection would push the bullet a matter of five feet and two and a half inches off course but at yards the wind deflection would be four feet and a quarter of an inch and at yards the wind deflection would be six feet and seven inches crane had said that the lying up position was a thousand yards from the centre of the camp if crane had it wrong was yards too long then holt would shoot inches wide if crane had it wrong was yards too short then holt would shoot inches wide it was the difference between a killing shot and a wounding shot and a shot that missed altogether the target had to be still and not about to move to cover one thousand yards the bullet would need two seconds of time if the target took one step in that two seconds god miss the distance of a thousand yards had to be exact because that was what the sights would be set to if in reality the distance was yards then the bullet would reach its target inches too high if in reality it was yards then the bullet would drop to a target point inches too low all of these minute calculations had to be correct if any were wrong he would be breaking his bargain holt grinned at the lizard the lizard was his only friend he checked that his safety was on he eased back the greased bolt he gazed for a moment at the bullet that lay in the palm of his hand he thrust the bullet into the breach of the model pm then drove the bolt handle forward he had seen two of the recruits fighting teeth and boots and fists he could remember the queues that he used to see outside the gum store in simferopol men and women queued outside the g u m in simferopol without knowing what they were queuing for two of his recruits were fighting and more were arguing and they could not know for what the ten had been chosen they sidled around him those ten that he had selected inside the ten were four to whom he had assigned responsibility as squad leaders at the camp two of the other six were considered to be proficient soldiers on an all round evaluation there was one who had scored five consecutive hits in training with the rpg there was one who played with wires and the forces of electricity and who understood the workings of a radio there was one whose twin brother had been killed by the israelis in he would fight hard there was one who would make abu hamid laugh and who could write in hebrew and in english and speak the jewish tongue perhaps they thought they were going to be sent to simferopol he waved for them to sit it was the centre of the camp it was between the cooking area and the first line of the bell tents he had prepared what he was going to say in simferopol the russian instructors had always said that a commander should prepare his statement of orders and tactics the low sun was warm on his shoulders on the back of his neck the sun that was soon to dip into dusk behind the great escarpment of the jabal el barouk he was a changeling no longer the graduate and the diplomat holt was the technician he had no love in his heart he had no hate in his mind the fine cross hairs of the schmidt and bender pm x telescopic sight did not flicker over the back of a sitting living breathing human being the cross hairs lay upon a target he had no thought of his girl no thought of his dead ambassador his thoughts were on the time of a bullet in flight and the angle of wind deflection and the distance between the lying up position and the centre of the tent camp as measured by crane from his aerial photographs with his thumb holt drew back the safety none who had known him before would have recognised the changeling at that moment not his parents not the men and women at fco not the staffers who had been his colleagues in moscow not jane certainly not jane canning he held the stock forward just behind the bipod with his left hand the butt was pulled hard into his shoulder his right eye was locked against the circle of the sight his index finger searched for the trigger guard and inside the guard to the trigger he took a long singing breath forced the air into his lungs as noah crane would have done it it will be a mission that will bring anguish to our enemy it will bring pride to our people each one of you of us has known the cruelty of our enemy we are honoured to have the chance to strike a blow at that enemy he saw the glow in their eyes he saw the fervour in their faces he felt the swelling pleasure that he was their leader half the breath heaved out trigger squeeze to first stage wish me luck as you wave me goodbye cheerio here i go on my way wish me luck as you wave me goodbye he hummed the breath was pressing for release in his throat the cross hairs were steady he squeezed holt fired the path of a bullet in the beqaa our target is tel aviv he seemed to rise up he seemed to be lifted from his haunches and then punched forward there was a force that drove him abu hamid fell bursting blood against the body of the recruit who had scored five consecutive hits with the rpg and against the recruit who understood the workings of a radio abu hamid fell and he did not move the economic subcommittee of the cabinet had ended it was a full fifteen minutes since the secretary had slipped silently into the room and laid the message form beside the prime ministers papers the chairman of the subcommittee the chancellor was neatly packing away his papers at the far end of the table youll forgive the presumption prime minister but you are displaying a certain cheerfulness that i can hardly put down to our business of the last two hours that obvious harry very obvious prime minister the prime minister leaned back there was a comfortable smile the meeting hushed the prime minister said one of the hardest features of my office is to exercise real power to exercise real influence i try often enough and i rarely succeed but this time you have succeeded the chancellor was adept at the unsubtle prompt can you say the prime minister glanced down at the cryptic handwritten message not yours not mine but abu hamids on the salver youll keep this to yourselves of course when ben armitage was shot dead in yalta and an aide also died we let a lie be known that the murderer was a local criminal we knew in fact that the killer was a member of the palestinian popular front i put in hand an intelligence operation that located the killer in the beqaa valley of east lebanon i took the decision not lightly to send a covert team into the beqau valley in that a precisely calculated vengeance should be wrought upon this murderer it would be the clearest indication to his syrian masters that we will never be attacked with impunity last night gentlemen at dusk that vengeance was exacted thats first class prime minister ill not deny that i agonised over the decision over the consequences of failure for which of course i would have taken the blame but if you venture nothing then you win nothing this government our government has shown that we are in the forefront of the war against international terrorism you are to be most warmly congratulated prime minister thank you i accept your congratulations with pleasure and later when i telephone him i anticipate receiving the congratulations of the president of the united states we are not a nation of boasters gentlemen i like to think we are a nation of quiet achievers its been a good meeting thank you harry major said hazan was buried with full military honours in that section of the military cemetery reserved for air force officers who had died in the service of the syrian arab republic there was a large turnout of dignitaries and senior ranking officers the cause of death as announced in the damascus morning newspapers was given as heart failure brought on by the ravages of an old war wound bravely borne amongst those who carried the coffin to the deep cut grave was fawzi he wore a new uniform for the occasion and the uniform carried the insignia of a captain and the brigadier who headed air force intelligence and who was the pallbearer immediately ahead of fawzi had told the young man that in the circumstances he was right to have shot the jew and no doubt the brave major had been so severely injured in his throat that the jews very first assault was fatal after the service after the mourners had dispersed after the band and the honour guard had been bussed away the brigadier walked with captain fawzi to a distant part of the cemetery where the cypress trees shaded the closelymown lawns the brigadier offered fawzi a job in his department and offered him also the task of finding a replacement leader for a seaborne mission against the defence ministry on kaplan when they had finished they walked back towards the cars and the brigadier linked his arm to fawzis elbow tell me who shot hazans boy in shame i do not know the name of holt was not known the secret of holt had died with the locking of cranes fingers on the windpipe of major said hazan with the blasting away of cranes life by the makharov pistol fired at point blank range come in percy for gods sake man you look dead beat didnt get to bed last night sir and had to be at the airport at five its been a first class show the director general beamed and waved martins to a chair and he shouted through to his outer office for coffee and he lifted a half bottle of cognac from his desk leg drawer thank you sir i tell you this when i heard that the sniper chap had been caught i thought it was all over for us martins eased back in the chair the personal assistant handed him coffee in cup and saucer and the director general topped up the coffee with cognac he seemed not to feel his age nor his tiredness well a fair amount of work had gone into preparing young holt i thought from the start from the time i had him down in the country that this couldnt be a man and boy operation that they had to go in as equals i put holt through a pretty tough induction toned him up so that he would be just about as able to operate on his own as in tandem and it paid off and you had damn all help at the far end more cognac martins reached forward with his cup he was a good deal surprised there was no shake in his hand he drank he felt the glow beneath his stubblecovered cheeks it had been a conscious decision not to shave he was straight in from the front line couldnt put it better sir damn all help i had to insist lay down the law that we should have a hot extraction programme after the snipe didnt win me any friends but i had my way i arranged for them to carry in a sarbie beacon and i cudgelled the locals into putting a receiver into the transport of an agent they had operating in the beqaa that was the first thing i made them do when they got windy about the chopper backup in the first place so holt fired knew enough to have avoided detection then he laid up until darkness then he moved off i had predicted that such a long range shooting would create total confusion in hamids camp not much of an idea where the shot had come from holt moved off after dark and when he was well clear he activated the bleep the car driven by this mossad fellow their agent picked him up im the last one not to give credit where credit is due the agent did his part well used his lights and his horn to attract holt took him on board and drove like hell for the border the cognac was coursing he felt the dampness in the socks he should have changed on the aircraft the director general sat on his desk hunched forward an eager audience so far so good but of course the syrians had picked up the bleep and were reacting and they had road blocks between holt and the safety of the u n i f i l sector and the security zone i really lost my rag sir i was in their communications area and i just demanded that a helicopter be sent made the air quite blue sir they were jabbering about missile umbrellas all that sort of rubbish but i won the day well in the end they sent up a helicopter they located the car about three miles short of the road blocks quite a short run thing they lifted out holt and the agent ive no complaints about the way they managed that thats the short of it sir remarkable percy thank you sir from the leather box on the table the director general passed martins a cigar and lit one himself the smoke fogged the room youll take the weekend off go and get yourself an ugly big pike youll be back here on monday morning your ears only for the time being for your information mr anstruther informs me he is seeking fame and fortune in the commodities market in the city mr fenner is returning to cambridge an academic future as from monday morning percy you will head the middle east desk thats very good of you sir the director general swung his legs down to the carpet and holt percy peculiar young man sir not the easiest to handle of course hes been under strain havent we all he was pretty insistent that i drop him at paddington station on my way in from the airport ive got the number where hell be for the next few days hes gone home ive got something for you sir something of a souvenir martins led the director general through to the outer office behind the coat stand in the corner next to the door was the model pm long range he wanted the sling that would be enough to remind him of crane he said that was the sniper sir martins laid the gun immaculately clean on the table in the corner of the director generals office good of you percy the department will be proud of the trophy after percy martins had gone probably in search of bait from a fishmonger the director general stood at the window of his high office and he traversed the sky line and his eye was hard against the sight circle and he aimed at the flags that flew from the corporation tower blocks across the river and he followed the flight of a gull he thought the boy was as the prime minister had said lucky to have had the opportunity he thought he would have given an eye tooth to have had the opportunity to fire that rifle in the service of his country he would take it to downing street in the early evening just the thing to cap a damn good show he asked his personal assistant to warn the cabinet secretary to alert security that he would be coming over at six oclock and would have a rifle with him together major zvi dan and rebecca cleared the barracks room at kiryat shmona that had been the home of noah crane they needed only one black plastic dustbin bag into the bag went the second pair of boots the two sets of old uniforms the underwear and the socks and the pyjamas the few items of civilian clothing there was a letter from a clinic in houston there were a few old newspapers all went into the bag until it bulged the intercepts from hermon had told major zvi dan that crane would never again use the contents of the bag he knotted the top of the bag rebecca said did we win anything major zvi dan muttered we lost a man who was without price not anything we lost an agent menny can never go back perhaps he also was beyond price the british won they won only vanity only conceit didnt holt at least win if you had asked him i doubt he would have told you that he had won anything that was of value to him rebecca carried the bag and major zvi dan hobbled behind her she took the bag to the corner of the camp where the rubbish of the troops was burned with his finger major zvi dan made a hole in the bag exposed the paper and with his lighter set fire to the bag a team of army engineers was set to work to dismantle the bell tents they worked stripped to the waist in the midday heat the recruits were not there to help them they had in the morning been taken by bus to the yarmouq camp outside damascus high on the hillside above the work party was a small and unnoticed rock overhang under the overhang hidden in shadow undiscovered lay two bergens and on top of one pack was a carefully folded square of scrim netting and on top of the other pack was a single used cartridge case beyond the camp perimeter wire was a cairn of sun in the darkness he walked on the moor away below him distant and separated from him by the black void were the lights of cars moving on the roads between dulverton and exford and hawkridge and withypool and liscombe and winsford the moor was his as the beqaa had been his and cranes he walked silently in this wilderness each footfall tested and for company he had the deer herds and the hunting foxes and the rooting badgers and the sheep that had been freed from the pens in the valley and allowed to wander in search of the new summer grass of the higher ground he walked until the dawn light seeped onto the royal purple expanse of the moor and when it was time for him to settle into his lying up position then he came down from the moor and took the road to the stone house that was the home of his mother and father in the early morning he packed a bag and he told his mother that he was going back to work and he asked his father to drive him to the railway station at tiverton junction his father gazed into the secret and unexplaining eyes of his son are you all right holt im all right its the others who have been hurt bleached stones the cairn marked the grave of a young man who had given himself the n a m e of abu hamid who had been a fighter for a refugee people who had been a foreign cadet at the military academy at sim feropol who had once been frightened of death who had a crows foot scar on his cheek the depth of the grave the weight of the stones were reckoned to be proof against the hyenas who would come to scavenge the camp site once the army engineers had lifted the tents onto their lorries and driven away
