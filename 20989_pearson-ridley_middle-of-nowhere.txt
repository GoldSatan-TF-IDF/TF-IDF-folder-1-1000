ridley pearson middle of nowhere prologue behind her the garage door groaned shut a combination of hairraising squealsmetal on metal and the tight quickened shudders of rollers traveling slightly off track the garage openers bulb was burned out leaving only the yellow glare of car headlights on a selftimer sharp shadows stretched across the tools and garden hoses that cluttered the walls the room smelled of burning rubber hot motor oil and lawn fertilizerslightly sickening a light rain struck the garage roof percussively moving around the parked car maria sanchezs body reflected the late hourhunched shoulders stiff legs she wanted a bath some sleepytime tea and the amy tan novel that awaited her she felt the weight of her sidearm in her purse as she adjusted its strap on her shoulder when out on active duty she wore it holstered at her side but the last four hours of her day had been paperwork and she had transferred the gun to her bag at least another four to go if she were to get even partly caught up but no more on that night she had clocked out amy tan owned the rest of her waking hours she closed the side door to the garage and stepped into darkness the light alongside the back door hadnt come on which surprised her since it worked off a sensor that should have automatically switched it on at sunset it must have been burned out also just like the one in the garage god she wanted that bath something moved behind her a cop learned the difference between the elements and human beings this was not wind not the elements it was human movement her right hand dropped and reached for a weapon she now remembered wasnt thereher terror mounted the crook of a mans elbow choked her windpipe next came a hard kidney punch sanchezs handbag slipped to the wet grass she tried to respond as shed been trainedas a police officer to compartmentalize and set aside her terror she drove back her elbow sharply and bent forward driving her butt into the man behind her the attempt did nothing to loosen the grip of that chokehold instead the defensive move put more pressure on her own throat increasing the pain restricting the blood flow she stomped down hard hoping to connect with an instep shatter it she could smell beer and sour sweat and it was these smells that increased her fear then another kidney punch sanchez felt herself sag her resistance dwindle she hadnt put up much of a fight but now she knew she was going to lose it she suddenly feared for her life her reaction was swift and intense she forced herself up managing to headbutt a chin or a forehead the viselike hold on her neck slackened she felt the warmth of blood surge toward her brain briefly relief she tried once again to rock forward and this time break the grip for good but now the grip intensified this guy meant business he cursed and jerked his locked hold on her neck first right and then sharply left she heard her own bones go like twigs snapping and then cold a brutal unforgiving chill racing through her body in seconds all sensation of her body was gone she sank toward the mud and her face fell into the muck raspy breathing from above and behind her and then even it disappeared overwhelmed by a whining in her ears and that desperate cold that finally consumed her chapter the night air a grim mixture of wind and slanting rain hit boldts face like needles seattle was a police beat where the weather could and did compromise a crime scene often in a matter of minutes on the advice of bernie lofgrin and his forensic teamthe scientific identification division or sidthe department had issued foul weather directives for all first officers the first patrol person to arrive on the scene regulations now required plastic tarps and oversized umbrellas as mandatory equipment for the trunk of every cruiser but mistakes were still made and that night seemed ripe for them as boldt hurried up the homes short pouredcement driveway he faced the garage behind and to the left of the house a basketball hoop and paintchipped backboard faced the street boldt ignored the garage for the time being his attention instead focused on the sid van parked there in the drive of all the divisions sid should have understood the importance of protecting evidence should have respected the departments attitude toward parking on private property and yet there was the sid step van inexplicably parked in the victims driveway one expected the occasional procedural error from the medical examiners chuck wagon even tolerated it when as had happened earlier that night an ambulance had been required to carry away a victim and so had likely parked in the drive but as the collectors and keepers of evidence sid had no excuse for parking in a crime scene driveway for any reason some sid tech had wanted to avoid the rain that was all and that wasnt good enough the infraction incited boldts temper and in a rare display of emotion he exploded at the first sid tech he encountered he ordered the van relocated to the street privately boldt blamed the blue flu spds first sickout by its officers in the history of the department the flu had so overwhelmed morale that it now apparently offered even civilian employeeslike those who peopled sidan excuse to turn in shoddy rushed work he wondered what chance law enforcement had if the fivedayold sickout continued he also feared the consequences shoddy work wasnt the only outcome of the fluofficers including boldt had been threatened by anonymous calls lines were being drawn violence bubbled beneath the surface a firstdegree burglary indicated an assault in this case a broken neck and the probable rape of sanchez a cop boldt felt the urgency of the situationthis case needed to clear before the press had a chance to run with it before the press became fixated on the vulnerability of a police department weakened by the flu already on the job detective bobbie gaynes offered boldt and the investigation a ray of hope because of the flu and a lotterylike caseassignment strategy that had the depleted rankslieutenants and above mostly accepting whatever cases dispatch threw at themthis crime scene belonged to neither boldt nor gaynes but to lieutenant daphne matthews whose official posting was that of staff psychologist boldt expected matthews on the scene momentarily even looked forward to it they worked well together a woman in her early thirties who regularly altered her looks for the fun of it the diminutive gaynes currently wore her hair cut short and colored a dark red the heavy rimmed black geek glasses and light makeup created a style that was a cross between hip urban single woman and computer programmer which actually went a fair distance to describing her personality as well gaynes lived for computer chat rooms these days her prompt arrival on the scene came as no surprise boldt had personally brought gaynes to homicide following her stellar work on a serial killer case some years earlier before that she had worked special assaultssex crimes as her fellow officers called it with the sanchez crime scene initially reported as a burglaryassault rape couldnt be ruled out gaynes was a good detective to have on hand boldt kept expecting the press the lights the questions they would need answers immediately you knew maria sanchez didnt you gaynes asked i know her personally boldt corrected yes i only meant boldt interrupted she sat the kids a few times he added the kids loved her violent crimes against fellow police officers held special significance for anyone carrying a badge all crimes were not investigated equallya fact of life members of the immediate police family deserved and received special attention maria sanchez would be no exception daphne matthews arrived and checked in with boldt and gaynes as lead matthews handed out the assignments boldt deferred to hera reversal of their usual roles boldt thought of daphne as a thoroughbred dark lean fit and strikingly handsome his system always ran a little quicker when in her presence in part out of necessity she possessed both a facile mind and a trained eye technically it was her case but they would all three work the crime scene together a civilian employee at first a decade earlier matthews had undertaken the sixweek academy training so that she now carried not just a title but a badge rank and weapon she assigned boldt the secondfloor crime scene where the victim had been discovered with gaynes to assist she would interview the first officer and speak to the sid team leader even though maria had been whisked away in an ambulance the importance and power of the crime scene preoccupied boldt as he approached the bed room out on the street the first of the press arrived there would be more howd we find her boldt asked gaynes he felt surrounded by women liz daphne gaynes his own capers captain sheila hill even his little sarah he felt isolated but not alone actually far more comfortable surrounded by these women than by a bunch of cartalking sportscrazed men who commented on every chest that passed he wondered why of the seventeen detectives and two hundred uniformed patrol officers remaining on the job some eighty percent were women why when the going got tough did the men quit and the women stay behind maybe it would be the topic of one of his guest lectures over at the u boldt felt time getting away from him he hoped for a clean crime scene and good evidencesomething obvious that pointed to a suspect he might as well be asking for a miracle and he knew it gaynes answered house has a silent alarm installed security company telephoned the home when the alarm tripped then responded in person finding the place locked then finally contacted us because theyre not allowed to kick a door all told it took about forty minutes before our officers arrived nice response time boldt snapped sarcastically first officer was ling patrolman he kept the security guys out made the necessary calls and did a pretty fair job of protecting the integrity of the scene boldt said matthews and i will visit the hospital on our way home see how shes doing we not only want this one cleared we need it cleared a cop assaulted in the middle of the blue flu press will have a heyday got it gaynes confirmed the bedroom where detective maria sanchez had been discovered naked and tied to the bed still smelled of sweat and fear sanchezs shoes clothes and undergarments lay strewn across the pale carpet gray blouse and dark pants heaped together to the left of the bed underwear up on the foot of the bed which remained made but rumpled the womans bra lay up by the pillow an sid tech was working the adjoining bathroom for evidence and prints boldt studied the layout carefully snapping on a pair of latex gloves almost unconsciously he circled the bed carefully like a photographer planning a shoot no evidence of fluids he observed other than the blood on the pillow not much of it the ligatures gaynes inquired pointing to the head of the bed boldt noticed the two bootlaces tied to each side of the headboard he glanced back down to the floor and the anklehigh blackleathersoled shoes missing their laces his stomach turned the scene was confused it didnt feel right to him ling cut the shoelaces himself before the ambulance arrived gaynes explained both laces had been cut with a sharp knife though remained knotted where they had been tied to the bed photos the sid tech answered from the reverberating bathroom we shot a good series on her closeups of the ligatures boldt inquired loudly cant say for sure you want it on the list please boldt answered now at the head of the bed studying one of the cut shoelaces himself hed had a case earlier in the week involving rape and a young girl bound by shoelaces the similarities were obvious he regretted that a serial rapist was the last thing anyone neededand most likely the first thing the press would suspect done the tech answered from the bathroom boldt glanced around tied the wrists but not the ankles his earlier rape had been tied by all limbs the similarities suddenly lessened a copy cat boldt wondered the leanne carmichael rape had made the news gaynes replied as if it were a test they worked this way togetherpupil and student i caught that too and i could almost buy it if the bed were more of a mess but a woman left with her legs untied the bed covers should be a mess boyfriend lover we want this wrapped and cleared boldt reminded her the department was grossly understaffed because of the flu and they each had too many cases to handle a socalled black hole an unsolved casewould incite the media and make trouble for everyone concernedmaria sanchez most of all she deserved closure youre looking a little sick lieutenant feeling that way gaynes standing on the opposite side of the bed from boldt said on special assaults i worked dozens of rapes lt unlike detective john lamoia who out of habit addressed boldt by his former rank of sergeant gaynes at least paid boldt the respect of his current promotion though called him not by name but by his ranks initials maybe in one out of ten the clothes are still in one piece usually torn to shit no fluids listen if the stains arent in the middle of the bed where you expect them then you find them on the pillow or the bedspread or the vics underwear but a clean scene you ask me this is date rape look at those clothes not a button missing spread out in a line for christs sake boldt studied a large dust ring on the dresser a television had been removed a small gray electronics device bearing a set of wireless headphones lay in a heap to the side of the same dresser he picked the headphones up in his gloved hands gaynes said you use em so the spouse can sleep while you watch the tube she was single boldt reminded a visitor maybe gaynes said date rape she repeated with more certainty guy ties her up and gets too aggressive accidentally snaps her spine and takes off the television he asked his former protege stole it to cover up it was him make it look like someone broke in the papers have been filled with stories about all the breakins since the flu hit studying the headphones boldt said maybe she just appreciated music or maybe she subscribed to the cable music channels he pointed to the stack of recent best sellers on sanchezs bedside end table boldt walked around the bed with a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach he and gaynes traded places police ballet since the advent of the flu reports of robberies and burglaries were up exponentially well want to check our sheets he suggested see if this fits any patterns got it she replied she lifted the top book off the end table an amy tan novel bookmarked with a receipt dated two days ago and shes a hundred and seventy pages into it and were in the midst of a flu boldt pointed out not like she has a lot of fun time maybe six seven hours a night at home max so she didnt watch much television boldt concluded which means youre probably right about the cable music a hundred and seventy pages in two nights you think shes been entertaining a lover she asked rhetorically sounds more like insomnia ask around the house about current boyfriends im telling you a rapist wouldnt undress her like this lt he tears her clothes off its rage not courtship and if he goes to the trouble to tie her up he rapes her hard or fires juice all over the place were not seeing real good evidence here she hollered to the sid tech whats that bathroom like its light the tech fired back my guess the guy wasnt in here at all boldt migrated over to check the windowsall lockedso he didnt have to look at the bed while gaynes talked so calmly about raping and beating and masturbating sex crimesspecial assaultsconditioned a detective in ways even a homicide investigator had a difficult time understanding he looked out the window to where light from the house played on the small patch of backyard and the separate garage her underwears clean gaynes reported sos the bra this looks like someone she knew and using shoe laces to tie her a necktie maybe a belt something handy and fast whats the guy do ask her to lie still while he unlaces her hush puppies and ties her wrists maybe her neck was already broken boldt suggested maybe she wasnt going anywhere then why tie her up at all gaynes asked confusing the issue an uneasy silence settled between them not a black hole he pleaded gaynes continued cautiously and thats another thing the trauma supposedly occurred after she was tied to the bed is that the general consensus is that what were thinking here thats whats logical right he ties her up to keep her still goes for oral sex or something yanks her head a little too hard and snaps her neck in the process something like that but he doesnt tie her ankles she said skeptically boldts only mental image was of the other case little leanne carmichael thirteen years old the crotch of her pants cut away her legs tied open a dark basement i worked a rapekidnapping earlier in the week he tied up the girl with shoelaces carmichael she said the case remained open continued to make a lot of noise well want the sid lab to make comparisons the same knots anything connecting the two crimes the lab sure she agreed but not the media so make the request that they do it quietly he said true enough someone must have finally been moving the sid van for headlights spread across the wet backyard boldt didnt like what he saw there im going outside to look around boldt said its nasty out there the sid tech cautioned from the bathroom check her boots and meet me outside he told gaynes she cupped her hands to the window peering into the backyard she knew boldt well now he reminded his voice urgent got it she said nasty gaynes tugged the goretex hood over her head boldt made a similar move with the collar of his green oilskin he switched on a flashlight borrowed from a patrolmanone of the ones with six dcell batteries insideenough weight to club a skull to pulp the flashlights second function hunched over he and gaynes approached a disturbed area of mud in the backyard they walked single file electing to avoid the wellworn route leading from the separate garage to the houses back door this is where he intercepted her gaynes suggested dropping to one knee looks like a possibility boldt said but theres no sign of dragging her shoes show mud the tech bagged them black leather jacket presumably hers had a partial shoe print on the chest a set of keys and a garage clicker in the pockets she added and yes ill have the shoe print typed if possible anticipating the request gaynes poked a raised rib of mud and grass with her gloved finger its recent enough boldt kneeled beside her the flashlight illuminating the disturbance the grass looked like a rug scrunched up on a hardwood floor boldt tore some grass loose and sealed it into an evidence bag for lab comparison he lived for such workhis lifeblood he heard more chaos around in front of the house more press more pressure gaynes said i can see sanchez stumbling upon him unexpectedly surprising him a struggle and she goes down from behind them daphne spoke at first its a matter of survival for him get her to shut up and get the hell out of here but then theres a change something primitive takes over primal its about dominance now about her struggling and him overpowering her he finds he gets off on it he wants more than to simply subdue her he has to possess her youre buying the burglary boldt asked peering up at her into the rain the flashlight following even in the rain daphne matthews looked good help me out daphne said shoelaces on both wrists same as carmichael my thirteenyearold rape victim but not the ankles gaynes said not the ankles boldt agreed meaning it for daphne this was a jigsaw with three players picking at pieces the burglary is intended to mislead us daphne asked weve got a crime scene with two mos boldt said a burglar a rapist neither fits perfectly why gaynes announced weve either got ourselves a twisted burglar or a greedy rapist she tugged on her hood a trickle of water slid down her cheek and dripped off her chin knowing full well it would be his next request she asked you want sid to work this site its a start boldt agreed daphne said leanne carmichael was raped theres no medical evidence yet that sanchez was and if she wasnt then youve got yourself a couple of contradictions boldt suggested i dont want contradictions i want a suspect i want to clear this before it gets out of control daphne sounded unusually nervous she wasnt used to leading a highprofile case the flu had caught up to her as well boldt shined the light over toward the garage she parked in the garage and headed for the back door she either ran into this guy or he was out here waiting daphne interrupted i want to assign a guard outside her hospital room he said lt youre right but who we gonna get to do it a frustrated gaynes asked the blue flu had taken four out of every five officers off the force notify hospital security lets move her to a private room away from a stair entrance well require checkin at the nurses desk some guy realizes he hit a woman cop and maybe he decides he doesnt want any witnesses or maybe its a boyfriend and the same thing goes i want her under protection got it boldt felt the pressure of the investigation thena sixth sense for a black hole and a case that wouldnt clear he knew from the look in her eye that daphne sensed this as well contradictions he said yes she agreed not this case okay she pleaded well each have six more cases on our desks by the time we get back boldt reminded gaynes chimed in and then our phonesll start ringing and dispatch will dish out another couple each we need the sickout over with boldt said dream on lt theyre firmly entrenched daphne saw her investigation headed for a black hole with sanchez gone she said were down to sixteen investigators leftdetective or higher boldt felt sick inside a thirteenyearold raped a policewoman paralyzed a burglar on the loose the public was certain to panic the emergency communication centers lines would be crippled with hundreds of bogus reports and sightings seventeen detectives had become sixteen the press is going to screw us on this one gaynes whispered this is fuel to their fire yes agreed boldt thats just what we dont want he had come here hoping for evidence perhaps the contradictions were the place to start they didnt offer him much daphne remained angry about the flu its a fellow officer theyve got to come back on the job now its time to circle the wagons i wouldnt count on it boldt and gaynes said nearly in unison chapter what exactly did sanchezs doctor say daphne matthews moved fluidly like a dancer she set the pace climbing the hospital fire stairs faster than boldt might have liked sanchezs room was on the fourth floor boldt was relieved to be able to tell her that the rape kit had come back negative he had made the call to the hospital while daphne was reporting back to headquarters where a reduced overworked staff attempted to cope with a growing number of reported crimes is there any eye movement limb movement what exactly did the doc say she asked he didnt answer right away preoccupied with thoughts of the threatening phone calls hed received in the last few days and what to do about the risk they posed to his family liz his wife was not easily moved out of her home daphne asked whats this about your knowing sanchez personally i know her boldt confirmed she lost her sister and her sisters two kids to a traffic fatality that sanchez daphne exclaimed interrupting the same i thought she transferred out when she graduated she did but only for a few months after which we met at a couple crime scenes she met liz and the kids at one of phils baseball games phil shoswitz had been boldts immediate superior for nearly a decade currently he was captain of crimes against property offered to sit the kids i suggested offduty uniform work paid considerably better only to find my foot in my mouth she wanted to be around the kids it had nothing to do with money she babysat sarah and miles daphne asked incredulously i know boldt said understanding her concern over such financial fraternization but it wasnt for any favors it wasnt for promotion consideration it was simply that miles and sarah were the same ages as her niece and nephew had been and she wanted the contact it didnt last all that long but ive got to tell you the kids loved her liz will be crushed when she hears slightly winded from the climb he added this should never happen to any officer but in particular this should have never ever have happened to maria shes a great person youre a great person daphne said she added reluctantly you and lizfor taking her in like that boldt stopped his ascent as did she it wasnt all sweet and innocent between them they shared a past rarely discussed they hugged the steel rail as a flurry of white and green hospital uniforms blurred past their eyes met and briefly an energy passed between them that they both felt liz and i he repeated echoing her but from his lips it sounded more like a statement right color rose in daphnes long elegant neck boldt took the lead daphne followed up the stairs and into the busy hall eye movement he whispered before opening the door to sanchezs hospital room this was the information she had originally sought from him and he chose his timing intentionally for the woman in question now lay on the other side of this door she apparently has some eye movement daphne nodded solemnly boldt swung open the door its your case he reminded your lead as she passed him she whispered i know that a fogged plastic tube inserted through a surgical hole at the base of her throat supplied maria sanchezs oxygen her torso was held fast by a white plastic brace that was itself connected to the bed frame preventing movement of any kind too many tubes to count a modern medusa blinking lights and flashing green numbers in black boxes on rolling stands of stainless steel a bag of intravenous fluids drip drip drip a blue plastic clip over her index finger ticking out her pulse and measuring her blood oxygen the glare of tube lighting the hum of machinery and the disturbingly symmetrical rhythm of her computercontrolled breaths boldts throat constricted his chest seized in a cramp this wasnt just a woman lying there she was also a police officer a friend family liz had once lain in just such a bed he knew the things they could do to a person in here he had seen lizs roommate being wheeled out and she had never been wheeled back in the thought of liz returned him to his concern over the threatening phone calls he didnt trust where this flu was headed he wanted out of that room maria sanchezs bloodshot eyes showed through small slits and boldt could detect slight movement in them as she tracked their entry into the room boldt recalled her on the couch with his two kids sitting up laughing goodnight moon in her lap he could envision her hugging his children with two arms that worked but it was that laugh of hers he remembered her time with his kids had helped in her recovery from grief she had learned to laugh again in his house to live and now this officer maria sanchez daphne said seeing boldt struggle im daphne matthews the department psychologist you know lieutenant boldthomicide matthews is lead on your assault boldt managed to say im playing watson he had wanted to inject humor hed failed again he realized he had spent too many hours in hospital rooms of late there should be quotas he thought he foresaw pain and hardship in that bed time waiting for eighteen months of cancer treatment his family had suffered now they still waited hoping lizs remission held the waiting hurt most of all sanchez would feel the full force of it his voice broke as he said im sorry for your situation maria daphne offered we dont pretend to know what youre going through but we are going to put away whoevers responsible she added were told the doctors plan some experimental surgery and that the prognosis is good be strong maria were pulling for you the whole department boldt said adding whats left of it the patient blinked once at first it appeared to be a reflex nothing more but it drew their attention boldt carefully chose his words weve been over to the scene just now your house maria looks a lot like you interrupted a burglary stereo gear and at least one tv appear to be missing well need for you to confirm as much of this as possibleas soon as youre able daphne added the report is sketchy at best boldt said when youre better well work on this one together okay his attempt at positive thinking sounded hollow and fell flat boldt didnt know quite how to act so he decided to just stick to business were pursuing this as a firstdegree burglary i guess we just wanted to say it goes without saying that were not sitting on this one that the flu isnt going to delay this in any way matthews got the callthe leadand thats a good thing were going to chase down this offender and lock him up guaranteed we need you maria daphne encouraged her youre going to pull out of this another blink a tear slithered from her eye down her pale cheek and cascaded to the pillowcase when her eyelids opened again fully sanchezs dark pupils were lodged to the left of her eye sockets maria boldt inquired the eye movement obvious he checked with daphne were watching your eyes daphne stated firmly to the woman are you trying to signal us maria she asked for boldt the air in the room suddenly seemed absolutely still the sounds of the machinery seemed louder he felt cold chilled to the bone another blink reflex or intentional her pupils faced right oh my god he mumbled letting it slip he glanced toward the door and the freedom it offered right is yes left is no is that correct daphne inquired the woman closed her fluttering lids with great difficulty when her eyes reopened her pupils remained locked to the right daphne met eyes with boldt her excitement obvious were going to ask you some questions daphne suggested tentatively okay the eyelids sank shut as they reopened a crack the pupils faced left her answer a solid no her eyes fluttered shut and remained so boldt felt a wave of relief shes too tired boldt said indicating to daphne they should leave the room daphne nodded but wouldnt let it go you go ahead and rest maria well be back when youre up to it she followed boldt into the hall he assisted the rooms oversized door to shut as quietly as possible medicated daphne said fatigue plays into it too but chances are its as much her unwillingness to confront and relive the assault and the associated trauma as anything else shes terrified boldt said relieved to be out of the room and she has every right to be he added you see that dont you you didnt have to be in such a hurry to leave yes i did he argued she can answer questions lou we can build a list of questions and she can answer them we can interview the victim you realize that boldt complained you dont have to sound so excited about it you know whats wrong with you daphne asked she crossed her arms indignantly against the artificial chill of the hallway its all wrong with me boldt answered feeling a chill himself that had nothing to do with thermostats her this place motioning back toward the room he said a pair of eyes daffy its all thats left of her chapter its a difficult situation boldt said so talk me through it is it the strike or this case his wife liz asked both he answered the sanchez assault was nearly twentyfour hours old no arrests no suspects he feared a black hole the boldt kitchen confirmed the laws of chaos a study in the science of randomly placed objects dinner food dishes pots and pans plastic toys scattered as an obstacle course a high chair a booster seat stained dish rags something sticky had been spilled by the pantry door a path of mud and pebbles led from the back porch despite the door mat boldt stood at the sink elbow deep in dishwater by nine oclock they typically would have had the kitchen cleaned upwith or without each others helpbut their daughter sarahs upset stomach had kept them busy these past several hours with both kids finally asleep husband and wife tackled the cleanup wish that dog would stop does it ever shut up maybe they wouldnt have bought an attack dog if you guys hadnt gone on strike liz teased boldt groaned she was trying to make light of it but it struck a nerve its not a strike its a sickout he corrected her liz policed the countertops and the kitchen table which looked as if a food fight had taken place boldt watched her in the reflection of the window above the sink in his opinion she still needed about twenty pounds the cancer had won that as well as her hair most of her hair had returned but not the weight and the hair looked wrong because she had always worn it longer than that boldt wrestled with the carrots burned onto the bottom of the saucepan that dog just wouldnt stop if boldt hadnt been a cop he might have called one liz brushed against him as she shook crumbs out of a rag he enjoyed the contact any contact at all anything to remind him of her presence so whats bugging you she asked adding quickly besides our neighbors dog the flu i realize its complicated a new sports stadium had gone over budget the mayor instituted costsaving measures the new police chief cut overtime pay for detectives and at the same time restricted offduty work for uniforms because one offduty cop had embarrassed the department but it has messed up everything he said listen i hate to see you like this she offered maybe its worth thinking about how much you personally can do about any of it but thats the point it gets worse every day now phil and the other captains are effecting a slowdown doing just enough work to get by which isnt enough of course its their way of supporting the sickout but if youre working as hard as always what more can you ask of yourself thanks he said sincerely is there anything positive to focus on forever liz spiritually determined he answered homicides bathroom stays cleaner than ive ever seen it the coffee lounge no longer stinks of burned grounds precious little all you can do is pray he interrupted he didnt need to hear this right now she grimaced not what i was going to say she said he apologized but she walked away and went about the cleanup he didnt mention that the eerie emptiness of the fifth floor the vacant halls and office cubicles reminded him more of a school in the midst of a fire drill than a homicide squad the hallways and offices of crimes against persons required bodies to occupy themlike suits in a storefront window boldt caught sight of himself in the windows glass and was troubled by the growing exhaustion that hung beneath his eyes the extra caseload brought on by the sickout meant fourteen hour work days investigators in any department accepted whatever case was handed them vice narcotics burglary it didnt matter he glanced up again the window fogged by steam offered only a blurred image but he could still see his face he could still pass for late thirties midthirties in low light in truth forty had come and gone a few years ago these days he was making an effort no more neckties bearing catsup stains no more permanent wrinkles in his khakis a single comment from liz about how the rundownprofessor look adds ten years had cleaned up his act since then hed looked like a new man the burn came out of the bottom of the pan but his elbow ached you know ill be supportive liz said now tossing the wet wash rag into the sink but lou please try to see that it stays outside the family im afraid for you for us she didnt need to complete the sentence those threatening phone calls of the past few nights were on both their minds as if on cue the phone rang liz looked over at her husband they had talked about just letting it ring to allow the machine to pick up but liz instinctively lifted the receiver from its cradle and held it out to him boldt dried his hands and accepted the phone liz pushed through the swinging door and into the family room hello boldt said into the phone for a moment he believed whoever had called might have hung up but life these days just wasnt ever that simple hello he repeated he heard music not a voice his stomach turned another threat pop musica womans plaintive voice hello he repeated a third time at first he took it as wallpaperbackground musicand waited for a voice but then he listened more clearly it was shawn colvin a recording artist he admired whose lyrics now gripped his chest get on out of this house the anguished voice cried out in song boldt understood though too late it wasnt a threat but a warning the best explanation for why he ripped the phone from the kitchen wall was that hed forgotten to let go of the receiver as he ran into the family room to alert liz failed to let go until he heard the explosion of breaking glass from the other side of the swinging door at that instant both the cop and the husband and the father in him warred over his having locked up his handgun in a closet safe in the bedroomfamily policy whenever he crossed the threshold into their home he burst through the swinging door his wifes screams ringing in his ears he heard a car racing away at high speed liz lay on the floor in a sea of broken glass she wasnt moving no he hollered lunging across the room toward his fallen wife he heard one of the kids wake up crying liz had a strange mixture of fear and confusion in her eyes he would not soon forget that look it seemed to contain an element of blame he reached out to her and rolled her onto her back her forearms bled her face was scratched though not cut badly she mumbled incoherently at first shhh he whispered back at her i thought it was a bomb she mumbled underneath her lay a brick it had been painted policemans blue chapter feeling a touch of the flu coming on i hope mac krishevski asked boldt shoved the man back into the living room kicked the krishevski front door closed and removed his gun from his own holster setting the piece down by a bowling trophy alongside a fauxmarble lamp made out of formed plastic the gesture made it clear to krishevski that no weapons were to be involved beyond that there were no promises made lieutenant a cocky but concerned krishevski queried harold mac krishevski reminded boldt more of the mans irish mother than his polish father though hed never met either the capillaries in his cheeks had exploded into a frenzied maze of red spider webs his nose with its sticky moonlike surface fixed to his face like a dried autumnal gourd his rusty hair awkwardly combed forward to hide the acreage of baldness failed miserably in this purpose so that in strong overhead light the shadows that were cast down onto his scalp looked like cat scratches his teeth belonged to a heavy smoker his plentiful chins to an overeater or beer drinker a man in his early fifties he wore his perma nent press shirt unbuttoned at the collar a threadbare undershirt attempting to contain escaping chest hair you want an appointment krishevski suggested attempting to sound in control but clearly under the effect of boldts fixed stare you gotta call ahead my wife dove onto this thinking it was a bomb boldt tossed the blue brick into the center of the room she cut her arms on the broken glass we just got back from having her sewn up boldt believed that as president of the police officers guild krishevski bore the responsibility not only for the walkout but also for the blue brick teenage vandalism krishevski said its amazing how the kids go wild when there are fewer officers on the beat boldt took issue with krishevskis confident grin and steelyeyed glint the man looked like a trained watchdog the room smelled of stale tobacco garlic and booze and the combination turned boldts stomach krishevski had taken unwarranted pot shots at boldt and his departments handling of evidence in the runup to guild elections two years earlier all in a blatant attempt to portray homicide as an ivorytower department in need of an overhaul an attempt to keep boldt from receiving the lateral transfer back to his old squad krishevskis complaints had fallen short of outright accusation but had crossed acceptable lines in point of fact their troubled history went back twenty years to a time when boldt had been selected for advancement and krishevski had not the sores from those wounds remained boldt had little doubt that the blue brick had been ordered by this man little doubt that his own selection as target had been as much personal vendetta as union strategy the police officers guild had been organized in the late fifties to represent officers in contract negotiation and to provide legal representation for any officer who required it the guild represented all personnel below the rank of lieutenant accounting for the majority of spds twelve hundred officers the administrative ranks of lieutenant captain and above less than one hundred in numberwere represented by a separate management team effectively separating uniforms from the whitecollar jobs membership in the guild was theoretically voluntary but nearly every uniformed officer belonged as well as most of the detectives its elected officials came out of its own ranks of active officers as the elected president of the guild mac krishevski senior sergeant in spds property room was guild spokesmanits public voice and point man boldt among others not only blamed krishevski for allowing if not encouraging the first illegal strike in the departments historydespite the mans claims otherwise but also for permanently tarnishing the badge and the publics view of law enforcement you being president of the chapter boldt said im holding you responsible for what happened to my wife tonight now wait a second krishevski complained boldt boiled if you dont control your fellow striking officers if you dont bring those responsible forward for disciplineto set a proper examplethen in effect youre condoning what happened tonight if thats the case then id prepare myself for certain consequences are you threatening me lieutenant boldt calmed outwardly though internally he continued to churn he said clinically im asking for your assistance in querying guild members for any knowledge of my wifes assault im asking you to make this right no matter what the history between us im not responsible for this absenteeism lieutenant im simply a dog on a runner back and forth between the blue and the brass right boldt said sarcastically hed heard it all before the move to restrict overtime and prohibit offduty employment opportunities for our officers was viewed by certain individuals within the department as intrusive and destructive and is apparently the driving force behind this current situation this absenteeism boldt said that the papers and courts are calling a strike im in constant contact with both the chiefs and the mayors office as im sure youre aware as chapter president im forced to put my own personal feelings aside and to represent the majority opinion of my constituency i do not condone tossing a brick through a window and im sorry for your wifes injuries and any upset this may have caused you and your family but the brick could just have easily been from an angry neighbor am i right someone pissed off over the flu improperly associating you with the sickout the public understands so little of our inner workings it was true though boldt was loath to admit it his neighbors acquisition of an attack dog was proof enough of the publics current perception of safety all im saying isif you start a war you had better be prepared to fight it krishevskis eyes hardened i seriously doubt that the current absenteeism had anything to do with your wifes incident a blue brick the reports of slashed tires coincidence boldt asked an angry public krishevski repeated boldt did not appreciate the mans slight grin you brought my family into this for that youll be sorry another threat you know what i think krishevski i think you enjoy all the attention the cameras the headlines seeing your name in print but the sad truth is youre misusing the trust of your fellow officersthis entire cityfor your own personal gain boldt picked up the brick off the carpet and placed it on a small end table he retrieved his gun and returned it to its holster sticks and stones mr krishevski he intentionally left out the mans rank be careful what you ask for krishevskis tension and anger surfaced in his now menacing voice dangerous ground lieutenant a threat boldt fired back mimicking the man control the troops krishevski bring in whoever was responsible or you and anyone else connected to this will be facing charges im trembling all over boldt pulled the front door shut with a bang that carried throughout the peaceful neighborhood he hurried toward the car anxious to return home and be with his family krishevski was a wild card boldt knew there was no telling if the threats would stop with blue bricks chapter cathy kawamoto ignored the deep low rumble that had become such a commonplace sound it could be anything from a passing truck to the garage door opening or closing she wasnt alarmed kawamotos basement home office felt unusually warm and she was uncomfortable shed heard the phone ring just a minute earlier but as was her habit she allowed the machine upstairs to pick up rather than interrupt her work her thin fingers danced across the computer keyboard the translation coming effortlessly now when the screen briefly went dark she saw herself reflected in its nonreflective glass jet black hair almond eyes with tight folds of skin that instantly labeled her japanese then another page of text appeared and cathy kawamoto returned to her work sometimes the translations were of textbooks or technical documents but her favorites were the american and canadian romance novels that within a few months would populate the tokyo subways read intently by commuting women at times the torrid love stories became so compelling that she found herself carried away the low rumble stopped and then started again cathy paused in her work this time the sound seemed suddenly close perhaps it wasnt simply that the basement was warm perhaps it was nerves but then again the rental house was always full of strange noises especially when her sister was home a flight attendant for alaska air kira came and went at all hours for days at a time on an unpredictable schedule that cathy could neither understand nor attempt to track footsteps overhead at first cathy simply glanced up toward the floor joists wondering what kira had forgotten this timeshe had left the house only a few minutes earlier rushing off somewhere yelling down into the basement that she was borrowing the car if that was all right she hadnt waited for an answer late again cathy translated another sentence her unbridled passion sought escape before another squeak in the overhead floorboards once again attracted her attention this time it didnt sound like her sister her sister didnt move that slowly not ever especially not when she was late and she was always late a third careful step overheard a mixture of curiosity and fear unsettled her the telephones inuse light indicated the phone was busy cathy felt relief wash over her it was her sister after all clearly she had returned home to make a phone call cathy sat back down at the computer but she couldnt concentrate something just didnt feel right she felt restless with it a fire smoldering inside her her fingers hesitated above the keys her eyes drift ing over to the telephones inuse light it continued to flash when the footsteps started up again left to right directly overhead the pit in her stomach became a stone the kitchen phone was a wall phone not a wireless walkaround how could it be in use at the same time someone was walking around the stairs signaled both the direction of movement and the fact that the person up there was heavier than either she or her sister they normally didnt make noise she thought about calling out just shouting whos up there but she was afraid of giving herself away letting the intruder know she was at home she was now allowing herself to think there could be an intruder the previous nights late news report began to cloud her thoughts a policewoman had been attacked in her own home a policewoman she lifted the phones receiver to eavesdrop she heard no oneonly the hissing silence of an open line ominous and frightful hello she tested in a whisper no one answered cathy kawamoto fought back panic she quietly climbed the basement stairs she could hear her unannounced visitor ascend the stairs directly overhead the footfalls were strangely tentative cautious and she could only conclude that someone was trying hard not to be heard she climbed and reached the kitchen first looking to the phone to see if by some chance it was off the hook it was in place and her alarm heightened she could see now that her sisters purse was not hanging by its strap over the ladderback kitchen chair in its usual place kira was not at home she felt a tightness in her chest she desperately wanted to announce herself but this was tempered by her recollection of the policewoman news she wasnt going to volunteer herself on the other hand she had trouble thinking of herself as a victim other people ended up on the evening news not her other peoples lives went to hell in a handbasket this couldnt be happening to her hello she finally called out softly unable to bear it any longer kira with her inquiry the noises upstairs stopped cathy moved involuntarily toward the staircase a decision she would find so difficult to explain later on she reached the top of the stairs adrenaline surging through her system she glanced down the hall back down the stairs she felt cornered and yet exposed the stairs suddenly seemed so incredibly long no sounds whatsoever panic seeped in and took hold she attempted to run but instead she froze with fear the assault on the news had been of a single woman living in a relatively affluent community what if this was a pattern her mouth fell open to scream no sound came out her chest now fully paralyzed by fright where the intruder came from she wasnt sure he seemed to materialize in front of hera blur of dark color and tremendous speed she felt an aching blow in the center of her chest right where that knot had been she flew through the air limbs flailing down to the open stairs landing on her back she slid and tumbled head over heels her skull catching the wooden treads and feeling like someone was clubbing her pain owned her a thick haze consumed her and drew her down toward unconsciousness she hit hard on the landing that same dark shape flew over her he grazed the wall her crotch ran warm with pee the shooting pain would not release her her fear was unforgiving a cold impenetrable darkness devoid of light and sound please god no was cathy kawamotos last conscious thought chapter whos this said the sorrylooking trashtalking white kid with the shaved head and a dragon tattoo under his left ear boldt wasnt used to anyone elses interrogation rooms the north precinct had a brickandmortar quality that reminded boldt of a converted ice house when in fact it had formerly been an elementary school daphne had joined him not only because she was vital to any interrogation but because some of the answers if forthcoming pertained directly to her case maria sanchez boldt stared at the kids handcuffs knowing these were just the first domino in a long chain of lost freedoms he saw no need to explain himself to the suspect to dignify the questions of a confessed rapist but daphnes assessment was clearly different for she answered the kid immediately this is the detective who discovered leanne carmichael in the basement where you left her alone malnourished a hole cut into the crotch of her pants through which you repeatedly raped her the man who untied the shoelaces from her wrists and ankles the man who dealt with the urine and defecation before the ambulance arrived who dealt with the frozeneyed terror of a little girl who went out to pick up the barbecued chicken and never came home ruby slippers went out a long time ago honey the kid said eyes and lips shiny wet he wore a small silver ring pierced through his left eyebrow daphne wondered if leanne carmichael might recall that ring boldt edged closer to the table where the kid sat an ominous aura about himhis rage barely concealed the kid wanted to pretend he wasnt bothered by the man but his glassy eyes flicked in boldts direction repeatedly like a nervous driver checking the rearview mirror daphne continued this is the man who would like you alone for a few minutes the handcuffs off one on one we discussed it on the way over he wont get that chance of course but he takes solace in the fact that hes been on the force long enough to know everybody and anybody long enough to know which of the arrests in lockup enjoy the services of other men solace in the fact that youll be raped night after night anally orallyraped until you bleed raped until you cant swallow even a sip of water youll be sent to the infirmary where the male nurses will know what you did to little leanneand theyll make sure you get proper treatment at which point of course youll be sent back into the jails population for another trip down honeymoon lane and this is all before you get to the big house where you will spend the remainder of your natural lifenot likely to be too long given that child rapists tend to have a short life spanbehind bars the suspect said nothing daphne had a way of reaching out to her clients shed knocked the wind out of him knocked the glib comments out as well boldt leaned his arms against the table so that he craned over the suspect face to face he dropped two fivebyseven glossies in front of the kid both showed a womans wrists bound with knotted shoelaces he said last tuesday night he waited we have a pretty good idea where you were but wed like some confirmation the suspect tried to pretend he didnt care about boldt but the attempt failed he finally broke off eye contact and glanced down at the photos these that girl these are tuesday night boldt answered the kid squinted tuesday he shuffled the photos back and forth you found her saturday i watched from across the street did you know that boldt reared back and raised his hand lou daphne stopped him perhaps with that one blow boldt might have killed the kid whatever the case she saved him a review with her reprimand boldt repeated tuesday night you want to identify the location for us what is this shit about tuesday he said having difficulty with the pictures given the handcuffs boldt asked where were you last tuesday night tuesday night the kid repeated some light spark ing across his freakish eyes mariners night game preseason it went extra innings junior pounded one down the thirdbase foul line in the twelfth and drove in the winning run you have the ticket stub boldt asked quickly were you with anyone can you put a time on it time i need a time and a place for you on tuesday night boldt said i need you to write it all down not happening boldt slapped the table so loudly that even matthews jumped the kid looked good and frightened boldt placed four more photos on the table take a good look boldt pointed out what the lab had showed him only a few hours earlier shoelaces knots tuesday night knots he pointed out the other two photosnot giving him sanchezs name you going to deny it studying the photos closely the kid said so you already know it wasnt me who done these is that right i dont know anything about these until and unless you tell me educated guessesive got a few of those expert opinionsnever a shortage there not in government work but witnesses i think im looking at him the hell you are youve got to write it down and try starting with the truth little leanne carmichael then tuesday night i was at the ball game the kid interrupted pointing to the photos he said you can see right here this wasnt me these are granny knots they can pull out i use square knots made it to first class in the scouts you were at carmichael he reminded boldt who wanted nothing to do with that horrific image tied with square knots check it out youll see im right he repeated tuesday night was the ballgame boldt glanced over at daphne she said to the kid write it down why should i the kid protested youre only gonna screw me you say i did something tuesday night what another girl sure i did it there you happy now she explained calmly you care because on tuesday he made mistakes because this one will go into your column and its a loose job a lousy job a middleaged woman a cop which shoves it hook line and sinker into maximum securitys f wing twentythreehour lockup no chance of early parole you want to grow old there old the kid asked sarcastically like your age or something he eyed her and looked repulsed not interested boldt slammed his weight against the table smacking the kid in the chest and tipping him back in his chair so that his head struck the concrete block wall with pronounced contact boldt said slipped sorry about that he came around the tablethe kid shied and he violently stood that chair back up driving the kids chest into the edge of the table for a second time there boldt said thats better write it down daphne told the suspect as she took boldt by the elbow and pulled him to her side they didnt need the arrest going south because of abuse she needed to get him out of there the kid picked up the pen and aimed it and the pad of paper at daphne you write down that youll go lightly on me if i help you with that girl because that other one it wasnt mine wasnt me this bitch cop no way granny knots fucking things never hold she turned the pad around yet again last chance if we step away from this who do you think will give you another one the kid hunched forward and started to write standing by boldts chevy daphne kept to her thoughts youre mad boldt offered my pushing him around surprised more like something john would do he shouldnt have spoken to you that way weve heard worse she reminded im losing the edge he suggested is that what youre saying he didnt do sanchez she stated thats all that matters you believe that he said a little surprised yes so do i he added almost a whisper a shudder passing through him oh god he mumbled yes i know what you mean she headed down the line of parked cars to her honda his pager sounded another firstdegree burglary just his luck chapter minor injuries lt nothing to worry about gaynes informed boldt the same could be said about lizs injuries but boldt wasnt buying it all came down to perspective worry he did behind gaynes emts closed up the back of a private ambulance vics name is cathy kawamoto single lives alone sound familiar boldt didnt want this didnt need it not another they were attending their second burglaryassault in as many days gaynes had drawn lead on the case courtesy of the blue flu and dispatchs current lottery system of assigning the first available detective who answered his or her phone he told her about the interrogation about losing the connection between carmichael and sanchez so we clear one she said and the other heads for a black hole do not say that boldt scolded gaynes suggested he head inside while she caught back up to the ambulance driver for a final word boldt seized the chance to see the crime scene for himself a burglary assault committed in the middle of the day technically a violent crime minor injuries or not the blue flu was lending the criminal element courage while the cats away the mice do play bright sunshine broke loose from behind quickly moving dark clouds the wind steady and warm summer struggled to be rid of spring boldt struggled to be rid of the sanchez crime scene he didnt want one influencing the other but it proved almost inescapable what he wanted was some good solid evidence something valuable something to kick this thing in the butt and help get someone behind bars before another before the press descended like locusts before the looming black hole of sanchezs unsolved case widened what do we have he asked sharply of the first officer a young woman who judging by her crisp uniform and pronounced nervousness was more than likely one of the police academy trainees temporarily promoted to patrol her quickfooted effort to keep pace with him and a strained voice that cracked when attempting a reply belied the stiff shoulders and confident chin this stopgap action taken by the chief to maintain a patrollevel presence on the streets had been written up in the press and condemned in the public safety coffee lounges if a minimum number of uniforms could not be mobilized the governor had threatened or promised depending which side of the argument one took national guard troops and curfewspolitical disaster for the mayor but socalled freshies had no place behind the wheel of a cruiser or as first officer at any crime scene much less on an as sault for all his experience and wisdom this new chief was out of his mind single female ive got that he said impatience nibbled at the center of his chest he needed some basic information but he longed to be left alone with the crime scene living with a sister who stays here every couple weeks didnt have that boldt admitted the scene exterior doors all found locked he interrupted youre sure this information registered in boldt for the back door of the sanchez home had been left unlocked she placed the nineoneone call so maybe she locked up security system the home has one yes but apparently the answering machine was engaged keeping the line open she remembers the indicator light on the downstairs phone the guy must have had a tape recorder on it sending out a single beep every five seconds so the machine kept recording and didnt hang up tricky stuff lieutenant smarter than just snipping the line which instantly sounds the alarm with the primary line engaged the security system couldnt dial out gives him time to get inside and bust up the alarms speaker so it never did dial out boldt said not that were aware of no boldt noted yet another contradiction to the sanchez scene sanchezs home security system had dialed the providernot that it had done her any good kawamotos had been prevented from doing so what else do we know boldt questioned her personal property reported missing vics name is cathy kawamoto banged up a little but ive got that already how bout a description he felt like an instructor now slipping out of his primary role freshies needed so damn much help chief was out of his mind female japanesebrit early thirties book translator the woman skipped along rushing her thoughts like a kid trying to avoid the cracks in the sidewalk working out of a home office in the basement thought she heard something upstairs investigates takes a blow to the chest at the top of the stairs goes down hard evidence of anything sexual he asked still trying to keep sanchez out of his head no sir not to your knowledge he corrected not to my knowledge she agreed no clothes torn off anything like that nothing like that lieutenant ligatures tied up in any way he inquired negative which stairs he asked returning to her earlier statement she told him whats the extent of the personal property loss looks like he may have been after a pc a cable box and a thirtyseven inch but thats just the bedroom who knows what else he had in mind he didnt lift any of it at the sanchez scene despite the assault the burglary had gone through perhaps that pointed to timing perhaps it pointed to yet another inconsistency he wanted evidence a shoe print to compare to the one lifted off sanchezs coat a knot to compare to the shoelaces found bound to her wrists something anything no sir the suspect apparently fled immediately following the assault good work boldt offered he felt distracted by his concern for liz and the kids suddenly wondering if they were safe at the jamersons where they were staying temporarily until liz and he could figure out how much danger they were actually in what if the blue fluers meant for the families to suffer he wondered hows your wife sir the recruit inquired in a moment of uncanny timing if you dont mind my asking this one was looking for immediate promotion to answer truthfully his wife was upset angry though not necessarily at him the relocation to the friends home on mercer island was a temporary fix at best to keep trouble from following them boldt would sleep at the family house only visiting the jamerson home for the occasional meal a workable but undesirable arrangement that obviously challenged a husband and wife who relished being together who needed each other in truth he was deeply worried about his family worried to the point that he hadnt eaten in at least ten hours the blue brick had shattered more than the windowit shattered certain limits too with it boldts work had come home in a way hed vowed would never happen again previously they had endured threats of arson the kidnapping of their daughter each time the family had rebounded though not without scars the brick had reopened those wounds he saw no immediate fix he and liz would talk there wouldnt be any simple fast answers but they would find them lizs blood was on the livingroom rug no matter how small the stain the damage was immense and permanent he counted on krishevski to identify those responsiblenot just a scapegoat but he wasnt holding his breath shes better boldt finally answered his private life was nobodys business did ms kawamoto get a decent look at him no sir the offender was apparently moving pretty fast shoved her down the stairs and took off thats about it for the blowbyblow breaks and bruises for the most part he repeated attempting to reassure himself he stopped so that he could ask this before they entered the home before he might be overheard by anyone sid he asked has been notified yes how many have been inside boldt inquired me and my partner she said pointing through the open door to another recruit who stood at the bottom of the interior stairs the uniformed officer reminded boldt of a boy scout what was a rollcall sergeant doing teaming two freshies in the same radio car was the department that hard up hed heard that another twenty to thirty uniformspatrol officershad failed to show up for work this morning but this pairing of two freshies indicated the situation was far worse than he imagined the two emts she continued other than that weve got a good scene well done officer boldt said wondering if he might have been the first to address her in this manner for her face lit up thank you sir he felt like a den mother the victim was fully conscious after the fall not as far as i know sir i think maybe she passed out briefly she saw him leave heard him leave not to my knowledge i believe she only heard him upstairs and went to take a look a sister lives with her part time he surprises her and shoves her down the stairs i think the situation got the better of her maybe she faintedpassed out for a minute or two it scared her pretty bad he left the premises how boldt asked still thinking about the timing of the crime daylight a day after sanchez no shoelaces around the wrists he didnt want so many differences between the two crimes no idea front and back doors were locked tight when we arrived she touched her breast pocket made note of that specifically locked he confirmed correct boldt opened the front door and inspected the mechanism no night latch he said keyed dead bolt and keyed knob if i may sir the young woman officer inquired go ahead upon being admitted through the back my partner and me found this particular doors dead bolt in place that is a keyed dead bolt as youve pointed out subsequent inspection of the back doorthe door through which we had entered the premisesindicated the same basic arrangement the victim ms kawamoto could not recall if she had thrown that particular dead bolt or not so my assumption was he both entered and departed the premises via that back door she took a breath and dared to submit speculation im thinking that subsequent to the offenders departure our vic locked the doorwhether or not shes currently aware of that fact its a kitchen door no sir the kitchen door accesses the garage this would be off the living area sir so the doer watched the house boldt thought knew which door to hita back door typically left unlocked and it had to be from a vantage point that provided a view of that back door ill keep your partner assigned to the front door boldt said loudly enough for the other officer to hear him too you will canvass the neighbors with an eye toward anything the of fender his vehicle anyone seen parked around here in the last couple days yes sir the recruit seemed thrilled boldt had little choice he didnt have much of a pool from which to draw she left through the front door passing gaynes who was on her way in as the boy scout opened his mouth to speak boldt lifted a finger and said not now okay unless its a top priority i need quiet your job is to keep everyone and anyone out until either detective gaynes or i give you the nod okay first one through that door is to be sid but only on our sayso no matter what you remain outside along with everyone else reading the nameplate pinned to the uniform he said you okay with that helman the kid had the wherewithal to nod sharply rather than open his mouth again good boldt said gaynes said ill take the basement and the ground floor lt youll take upstairs ordering around her lieutenant was an uncomfortable act at best if thats good with you fine the assault happened up there on the stairs she came to rest on the landing ill tread lightly boldt offered despite the dozen cases back on his desk and the dozen more that would be assigned in the coming days the sanchez assault and the kawamoto breakin were what interested him any investigator liked a clean case that cleared quickly but boldt had worked dozens perhaps hundreds of such cases he lived now for the challengenot the black holes that would never be solved but the cases that both meant something and offered contradictions sanchez and kawamoto appeared vaguely relatedburglaries gone bad women assaulted they presented an urgency both for the sake of the public and the media there was no apology to be made no words that would return cathy kawamotos sense of safety she would never fully trust this city again would never feel safe even behind the locked doors of her own home this weighed heavily upon him boldt felt that as a peace officer his role was to preserve a sense of safety and yet cathy kawamoto would have none now he knew boldt felt the case closing in on himit just wasnt coming together he carefully climbed the stairs on the one hand wanting a few minutes alone to immerse himself in the crime scene on the other wanting the differences sorted out and the offender in lockup by evening well before the news dumped it on the dinner plates a crime scene alone in silence lou boldt felt alert and alive as an investigator boldt experienced no prescient sense from the perspective of the offender he could not transport himself into this role as some investigators suggested was possible he saw the crime scene from the role of the victimoften viscerally but exclusively from this side of the crime boldt headed upstairs in the footsteps of cathy kawamoto a woman about to disturb a thief he assumed the thief was a plannernot some junkie kicking in doors and stealing a purse or string of pearls and here comes cathy kawamoto up the stairs chasing noises he stopped briefly to study the landing because the freshie had told him the victim had recovered consciousness on the stairs this was supported by the drying bloodstain he saw there the result of a bloodied nose if the offender had shoved her downstairs and yet fled the premises he had jumped right over her this thought coincided with boldts observation of a long black rubber smudge on the wall that seemed to fit with a person in a hurry jumping over a body on the landing he made a note to have the sid techs sample the rubber smudge and to analyze it no stone unturned he mumbled to himself well aware that the press and the public would attempt to connect this to sanchez and perhaps even carmichaeland that on top of the flu public concern would figure politically in both investigations demanding immediate arrests he found the offenders apparent target in the bedroom a corner hutch that faced the victims bed a television vcr and one of those allinone music centers with cd player double tape system and stereo receiver the offender had not had time to steal the electronicskawamoto had headed upstairs at an inopportune time but the man had moved the hutch from the corner in an effort to free wires boldt peered behind the television had been unplugged its wire neatly coiled and fastened what kind of person took the time to neatly coil wires before heisting a television more than the coil of wire it was sight of the white plastic loop secured around the coil that intrigued boldt a sophisticated version of a garbage bag tie had any such ties been inventoried at sanchezs he wondered another contradiction the other wires were snarled in a tangle and covered with dust who was this guy what kind of burglar showed such confidence daphne would have a heyday evaluating such a personality then a second thought occurred to him if the thief had possessed plastic ties at the sanchez breakin why not use them to bind her wrists instead of shoelaces why shoelaces and not the plastic ties he took notes albeit unnecessarilyhe wasnt about to forget any of this perhaps the burglary unit had files on record that mentioned white plastic ties being used he had in hand the physical evidence hed hoped for now he had to connect it to a suspect chapter i need help phil i need the names of who did this to liz and i also need your burglary files for the past month i thought you might be able to speed things up for me on both counts boldt said unless youre too busy he added he needed to connect the white plastic ties to earlier burglaries to establish a pattern crime to widen the scope of evidence and increase the number of leads to follow captain phil shoswitz seemed the means to that end are you suggesting im intentionally slowing things down around here shoswitz questioned defensively in point of fact some of the lower brass had effected a slowdown and shoswitz was probably part of it the man paced his cluttered office a baseball fanatic the captain of crimes against property which included burglary had bookshelves overflowing with intramural trophies and major league souvenirs a bat autographed by junior a hardball scrawled upon by the entire mariners team a photo of himself taken outside safeco field on opening day his ticket proudly displayed he rubbed his throwing elbowa nervous tic that indicated both deep thought and irritation i detest what happened to liz you know im with you on thateveryones with you are they boldt had come up through the ranks with phil shoswitz had spent nearly a dozen years serving under the man in homicide over eight of those years as sergeant to shoswitzs lieutenant now that shoswitz carried a captains badge in crimes against property and boldt a lieutenants shield in crimes against personscaprop and capers respectively boldt suspected the man had a touch of envy despite the higher rank homicide remained the golden egg the most prestigious posting on the department shoswitz had sacrificed that posting for his captains badge promotion and higher pay maybe not everyone shoswitz admitted but youve only yourself to blame for that you mouthed off to the press about the absenteeism you pointed fingers at people it was true boldt had been interviewed by a reporter and the story had hit the national wires painting a pretty ugly picture of the detectives who had joined the sickout in sympathy if shoswitz was telling him that the blue brick had been thrown through his window in response to that interview then for lizs sake his familys sake boldt regretted giving that interview even if what he said had to be said which was how he felt about it the politicians in an effort to keep negotiations open failed to express any feelingsrage disappointment angerover the events of the past week and boldt felt such attitudes did more damage than good for they subtly condoned the walkout while taking a hardline stance against it he loved police work and was proud of the department the flu had damaged its reputation perhaps forever i need access to your files phil boldt repeated he took shoswitzs concern for liz as lip service after nearly two decades of friendship he saw his former lieutenant in a whole new light if the man cared hed have already been on the telephone to his buddy mac krishevski and would have demanded the names of those responsible for that brick but he was mad at boldt for talking to the press mad at boldt for continuing to carry the caseload dumped on him mad at life anger had consumed him and if he didnt watch out it would consume boldt as well boldt asked whats so complicated about your helping me get those files shoswitzs eyes flashed darkly and his nostrils flared he stopped his pacing and stared at his former sergeant in an alltoofamiliar angry glare without the investigating officer or officers present it would hardly be appropriate theyre out sick boldt pointed out my point exactly their decision not mine not yours what are you suggesting we delay all active investigations we delay an investigation into the assault of a fellow officer in order to appease the blue fluers dont use that term in this office its a sickout phil whats the its more complicated than that shoswitz complained interrupting not to me it isnt boldt argued i need someone to stand up for what happened to liz and i need a look at your files explain how any of thats complicated shoswitz glared and returned to his aimless pacing reminding boldt of a pit bull in a cage he pushed away his personal concerns over liz and the blue brickshoswitz wasnt going to help him thereand tried to stay focused on gaining access to the paperwork he deemed crucial to the sanchez investigation a burglary was handled by the uniform who responded to the call typically he or she conducted a short interview inspected the scene and filled out a report leaving the victim to deal with the insurance underwriter detectives in the burglary unit shuffled these reports looking for possible pattern crimes or anything of substance that might connect up with information from snitches or fences theyd squeezed they did far less field work than their counterparts in homicide special assaults or organized crime because a single unconnected burglary was not worth a detectives timethe likelihood of recovering and returning the stolen property was infinitesimal boldt needed shoswitz to access his units case files he would also need the mans outright cooperation if he were to round up all the recent burglary reports from the three other precincts shoswitz could pull this off with a couple calls to the other houses but his entire team had walked out with the fluers and he seemed bound and determined to protect them it didnt come as a complete surprise to boldtshoswitz was a guild player through and through even though his rank of captain and the existing management contract prevented him from following the guilds lead is this for you or matthews shoswitz asked sarcastically any detective was practiced in the art of changing subjects but shoswitz had not been in the field in years his attempt to derail boldt succeeded only because it stabbed for the heart boldt knew not to get sucked into this but his mouth betrayed him what the hell does that mean he fired off indignantly shes lead on sanchez not you right so so whos here asking for favors shoswitz asked rhetorically it means what it means which is boldt asked lou do i have to spell it out you have to spell it out boldt assured him his face burned his mouth had gone dry phil shoswitz had been a friend for yearsand here he was questioning boldts loyalty to his wife and family shoswitz continued working that sore elbow you two you work well together he said drawing out the statement and meeting eyes with boldt who felt a hollow sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach she dumped that rich guy for good i hear theres nothing there phil leave it alone of course not youre pissing me off here phil how do you think i feelwe all feelabout your current enthusiasm for the job politics it hit him like cold water down the back he had not expected shoswitz to be so blatant in his support for krishevski boldt felt stunned another ally down and this one still wearing the badge still working in the office a friend how many others on the job felt similarly he wondered how much internal sabotage was taking place in support of the flu you were guild secretary for five years i understand that phil he tried to remind the man but you and iwere not only bound by a different contract were bound by friendship were not guild members not anymore are we still friends shoswitz huffed half a laugh half a groan this new chief shouldnt be playing games with peoples wallets big mistake look at us he said indicating himself and boldt would we be here arguing like this if it wasnt for him hes new hes a jerk what does someone from philadelphia know about this town hes one of the best in the country we both know that strange way of showing it shoswitz said pulling overtime cutting out offduty work its asinine a stadium went over budget you want asinine you look at lizs left forearm boldt fired off they brought this into my house phil they crossed a line agreed shoswitz said quickly you have no argument from me there dont i meaning boldt said tell krishevski to bring forward whoevers responsible im forbidden from contacting krishevski or anyone involved in the absenteeism shoswitz reminded him another wonderful decision from our new chief krishevski will start a war he keeps this up blue against blue whats that about that has no place on this job no one wants that tell that to liz or sanchez shes got her head screwed down so she cant move phil shes a pair of eyeballs at the moment have you been to visit her has anyone where the hell is everyone what if it was me or you whod taken that fall what does it take to get people back on the job promises shoswitz said thats where mac krishevski comes in hes playing both sides of the fence lou he has to yeah well he should keep the bricks on his side of the fence a hard silence settled between them along with the looks of betrayal from both men these files shoswitz cautioned tread lightly no one on this squad is going to want to hear that youre nosing around in their files it doesnt look right a homicide lieu stepping in and taking over a caprop case i cant be worried about that you need to be no i dont what i need is those files you have the authority to round them up for me boldt pressed i need you to do that i need to see if the sanchez assault fits into any kind of pattern your boys may have on the books why do you think we file in triplicate shoswitz asked the public safety building housed administration for all of spd boldt understood the message theyre here copies of all those reports are already here regardless of precinct shoswitz said where else youll request them for me theyll be on your desk in an hour shoswitz said but this conversation never took place you thought of this on your own you pulled a favor from someone in the boneyard you play this however you want but my name doesnt come up priorities boldt said how long do you support a guy like krishevski to each their own added phil shoswitz yeah sure boldt said in disgust who are your own phil these guys who walked off their beats or sanchez over there in the hospital doing staring contests with the ceiling tiles be careful lou you say that kind of thing in the wrong company and you wont be making any friends are you the wrong company phil get out of here before i change my mind about those files im gone boldt said he didnt add that hed gotten what he came for though he felt tempted to do so he wanted the last word but didnt take it he left shoswitz with the illusion of control he accepted the promise of the files savoring an undeclared victory the last three weeks of reported burglaries arrived on boldts desk ninety minutes later most of them nothing more than the requisite property loss reportone hundred and fourteen in all boldt switched on his desk lamp a cup of earl grey at the ready if there had been a night shift it would have been just arriving but the flu had killed such shifts civilians still manned their desks but with the detectives out sick the place was a graveyard he rubbed his eyes cleaned his reading glasses with a long slow breath and a piece of tissue and examined the reports each report detailed a burglary represented by a numbered code this was followed by name address time of day first officer investigating detective if any list of stolen goods a concise summary of events re turned home broken window missing stereo awoke to a noise entered the living room suspect seen fleeing eyenumbing repetition uniformed patrol officers going through the routine of making the rippedoff public think someone cared no one did but the insurance companies they wanted a report filed and signed off on boldt studied those reports fighting off drowsiness he looked first to the list of stolen goods separating out those that inventoried largescreen tvs home computers cell phonesall items believed stolen from sanchez a single tv didnt count a single computer didnt interest him with the exception of a cell phone the items stolen from sanchez each had retail values in excess of a grand picky exact kawamotos inch tv had clearly been targeted the vcrs wire had not been coiled had it been too inexpensive to worry about or had kawamotos interruption come before the burglar had enough time to examine it tvs and stereos would normally be considered the domain of a junkie looking for his next fix but junkies didnt put white plastic ties around the electrical cords junkies didnt trick home security systems by tying up the phone line boldt suspected that this particular ripoff artist sought out highend electronics in enough quantity to justify the risk a computer a couple tvs and a cell phone to be cloned later might net him fifteen hundred from the right fencenot bad for a days work better than cop pay based on the list of stolen goods boldt narrowed his pile to twentythree reports some of the forms had the small box checked off that indicated home security systems but not all on two of these reports he noted that the officers made mention of the security systems being compromised boldt smelled a possible insurance fraudhomeowners arranging for the theft of their own electronics they would then collect the insurance money have the electronics returned and pay out a percentage of the take to he who committed the burglary the stepford thieves wouldnt be the first whitecollar crime investigated by spd boldt flipped through the stack of pink archived triplicate copies wanting some other identifier he read each of the twentythree reports in more detail taking the time to study the notes wanting something to narrow these to a more manageable number twentythree phone calls would take days if not weeks under the current caseload even shared with daphne he thought the job could take a week or more two or three weeks was not out of the question if they reached a bunch of answering machines shoswitzs comments about his relationship with daphne troubled him stayed with him he wanted to see it as exaggeration lies he wanted to feel it in his heart as schoolhouse rumor but it triggered fear insteadas if hed been caught at something and that bothered him most of all his blunt concentration passed the time quickly the tea went cold his butt hurt all the little pleasantries of police work city traffic had slacked off outside he heard a distant whine of tires but not the upcloseandpersonal street traffic with which he hummed along by day the place smelled of janitors disinfectant a chemical lime smell that had a hint of melting rubber to it the janitor had passed through unnoticed he glanced up at the clockit was late he owed liz an apology but before he picked up the phone to call her he checked the clock a second time recalling that kawamoto had been hit in the daytimeextremely unusual sanchez had not but for the moment he managed to separate the two cases and keep them that way back through his pile of reports he went from the stack of twentythree he began pulling out reports his heart racing as the new pile grew to six burglariesthe shared element broad daylight he went through all hundredandsomething files again this time a total of nine reports made up his pile nine burglaries nine violations of private property in broad daylight all with thousands of dollars of highend electronics stolen big hits tricky hits some with home security devices apparently compromised wellorchestrated crimes practiced judging by postit notes and stapled attachments shoswitzs detectives had apparently spotted some of these same similaritiesthese overlapping loose connectionshad probably been developing leads when the flu came along and sent them home to watch reruns now boldt had them and he suddenly felt like a runner being passed a baton there was no mention of white plastic ties no assaults just nine pink sheets on missing electronics and some attached notes from boneweary detectives police work the smell of burned coffee drifted down the hall the janitor had forgotten to turn off the pot boldt did so stretching his legs appreciating the moment away from the eyestrain and the tight back he yawned he washed out the coffeepot and shut the door to the lounge to keep the smell contained all the while he kept a weary eye over one shoulder he kept thinking of that blue brick lying on his livingroom floor his wife in a sea of glass and her strained voice choking out i thought it was a bomb he thought of his kids his responsibility his promises he recalled shoswitzs warning that his intrusion into burglarys turf and open cases would not be appreciated but sanchezs eyes came back to haunt him he would want to speak with all nine burglary victims visit them in person if possible daphne should accompany him to read their answers what they didnt say and how they didnt say it was often more important than what they put down for the record he felt high his spirits lifted by the discovery taken together the reported crimes had been committed in broad daylight in houses where the occupant had vacated the premises in houses left locked often with the home security system armedwith not one of the security systems announcing an intruder sanchezs assault remained the anomalycommitted at nighttime with the security system engaged but the same highend electronics stolen location was another possible tiesome of the burglaries had occurred in the north precinct others in the east or south but always in white uppermiddleclass neighborhoods boldts excitement grew as he sat back down the cases looked damned good strung out in a line stacked in a pile they made sense as a package it was dark outside and nine oclock he had missed the family dinner at john and kristins had missed putting his kids to bed had worked through a date with his wife and family and friends at he called liz and apologized she sounded a little upset but said she missed him which he reciprocated he didnt mention his partial victory on the case because it didnt seem appropriate at the moment missing dinner was one thing in their family missing the kids bedtimes another he hated to disappoint liz even for a good cause he and liz had formed their courtship around jazz films of every kind and latenight dinners filled with stories and laughter he had thought her too pretty for him shed feared even early on that he was too much of a workaholic they had married young and for years had kept the marriage that way as well careers and the pressure to consider a family had briefly driven liz to an affair which in turn had encouraged boldt to give in to temptation with daphne matthews for a single night but that original connection between husband and wife had never been severedit remained strong if strained they rarely made it to movies as a couple any longerit was all disney videos and the occasional ice capades musical boldt sometimes played happy hour jazz piano as a distraction but liz stayed home with the kids the connection remained sometimes it took the form of a latenight movie or a rented video a shared bath or lovemaking on the couch with the kids asleep sometimes nothing more than a look or a tone of voice a long talk they practiced mutual tolerance mutual support they limped through the challenges thrown up by daily life sometimes overcoming sometimes only surviving but on this night he could feel liz attempting to be tolerant and not entirely succeeding call me in the morning she suggested a little too quietly but still gently sure will maybe you can come over for eggs maybe so he replied youll keep working tonight she said yes okay she didnt sound overjoyed about that they said their goodbyes and hung up with a monthly calendar laid out on the desk before him boldt charted the nine burglaries that seemed to have led up to maria sanchezs tragedy sanchezif part of that stringwas number ten kawamoto eleven there was no particular day of the week to tie the events together no exact hour though all but the sanchez crime had occurred during daylight nor had there been a particular neighborhood at first blush a detectives nightmarecircumstantial connections linking the crimes but lacking the hard evidence necessary to provide a trail to follow nonetheless for boldt the sim ilarities remained substantial enough to impress him he believed all eleven were connected even if it wouldnt be easy to prove it he had yet to discover how the burglar selected or targeted the homesand this was of course of primary importance to the possible identification of a suspect certainly the residences had not been chosen at randomnot since they were loaded with highend electronics the connection between these targetsan insurance provider a security company eluded him but remained a top priority or so he thought those priorities began to shift when he noticed a circled pair of initials on the top of one of the nine files the initials crowded the box reserved for the investigating detective for in this particular box two detectives had left their initials the home belonged to a couple listed as brooksgilman living over in queen anne a mittshaped neighborhood immediately north and west of downtown the brooksgilman case had been passed to a second detective probably as a result of the blue flu the circled initials were elegant and easily read maria sanchez he wondered as he then noted the date on which the detective in question had accepted responsibility for the case that date was just two days before the sanchez assault that exceeded the boundaries of acceptable coincidence ms maria sanchez had to be chapter i dont see what were after daphne said hurrying to keep up with boldt as he ascended the hospital stairs her connection to the brooksgilman burglary investigation he answered i understand that much she said a little miffed that he wouldnt give her at least some credit i read the memo boldt had circulated an interdepartmental email requesting any information on all cases sanchez had been working prior to her assault but how does that get us any closer to the thief so she took over some cases after the walkout happened we all did so what boldt didnt answer her not one person had responded to his email again reminding him that the flu had sympathizers still on the job he felt disheartened even defeated daphne matched strides with him in the long hallway lou shes my case its only right you tell me what youre thinking shoswitz said his boys would not appreciate any of us doing their work for them the implication being pretty obvious were considered scabs she gasped just because we accept some assignment passed to us by dispatch maybe sanchez was maybe they got pissed off at her for crossing over into their department the only way a strike is effective is when the work doesnt get done maybe i got that brick through my window because im supposed to stay in homicide not take cases from other departments she mumbled so to make the strike effective they intimidate us or worse he said break her neck strip her naked and tie her up she questioned does that sound like cop against cop i dont buy that hey boldt defended im not selling im just investigating is all leaving open all possibilities theres a big difference between a brick through a window and what happened to maria sanchez i dont disagree with you boldt said im just investigating is all they reached the door to sanchezs room and showed their badges to the hospital security guard posted outside he carefully checked the ids then permitted them to go in sanchezs condition had deteriorated since their first visit the decline had manifested itself in her skin tone and in the proliferation of icu equipment that was now attached to her daphne acknowledged her read of the situation with a grim look that told boldt to proceed with caution daphne stepped closer to the tangle of tubes and wires and said the patients name softly marias eyelids strained open followed a moment later by recognition boldts overwhelming sense of concern momentarily prevented him from speaking he felt painfully reminded that homicide cops rarely deal with the living we promise to come right to the point boldt informed the patient stepping closer so he could meet her now haunted brown eyes something has come up daphne jumped in that requires clarification sanchezs eyes never left boldt he felt they somehow held him responsible though he wasnt sure for what he knew that sanchez somehow understood their visit was at his initiation that the questions would come from him and so she waited she has no choice he thought are you okay to answer some questions boldt asked the eyelids closed and reopened eyes looking right how he wondered could something as simple as blinking ones eyes become so labored and difficult boldt leaned closer he could smell medication and hear the rhythmic efforts of the respirator among your cases prior to your assault was the burglary of the brooksgilman residence in queen anne yes she answered with an eyesright boldt felt a slight flutter in his chest the initials ms maria sanchez he asked had you identified a suspect no came her reply though clearly with great difficulty lou daphne said correcting herself to lieutenant i think shes too tired for this right now boldt ignored daphne remaining focused on sanchez do you believe your assault had anything whatsoever to do with your investigation maria clearly struggled with her condition or with the question boldt wondered an exasperating thirty seconds passed before her eyes fell shut and then reopened yes came the answer but this was followed by a no as well and boldt took to this to mean she didnt know couldnt be sure boldt gasped lou daphne whispered sharply had you made some progress on the case boldt asked again daphne attempted to stop him the eyes blinked open yes but not a suspect he repeated for his own benefit his mind racing his connection with this woman nearly visceral evidence yes did others know about this possible evidence he queried she paled another shade or two if that were possible whatever the monitors were saying daphne didnt like it youre going to have a nurse in here in a minute matthews warned im asking you to stop boldt couldnt stop not when he was so close he asked had you told anyone about this new evidence sanchez stared at the ceiling no eyelid movement no answer he heard footsteps voices and then the door swung open but boldt still didnt give up he leaned into sanchez getting as close to her as he could and asked did you tell anyone who was out on strike that you were working a burglary case he added its extremely important to the investigation that i know this thats it daphne announced coming around the bed and taking boldt by the arm come on were out of here before they throw us out one more minute oh my god he heard daphne gasp boldt turned around to greet the nurse or doctor unprepared for who had entered the room the normally cool and collected sergeant john lamoia stood straight and rigid as surprised as they were what are you doing here boldt asked chapter shes hispanic sarge a macho lamoia said coolly as if this explained something boldt had bullied them into a nurses lounge for the sake of privacy the room smelled of danish and was lit like a supermarket two dave barry columns were taped to the wall by the microwave someone had scratched out a no smoking sign and changed it to no choking it was a little overheated in and out of bed how long has it been going on boldt asked lamoia shrugged boldt fumed lamoia manipulated the world around him in a way boldt couldnt even if he wanted to lamoia got away with this kind of thing all the time what you saw of lamoia was what you got pressed blue jeans carefully coifed brown curly hair that nearly reached to his shoulders deerskin jacket silver rodeo belt buckle porcelain white smile oversized mustache and attitude he carried it in his walk his posture his dark eyes his confidence surfaced behind a softspokenness he was a hell of a cop somewhere between a fraternity brother and a war buddy for boldt a former protege who took what he wanted from life hed made himself the stuff of legend around public safety both for his sexual prowess and his abilities as a detective hed disappointed boldt greatly when hed called in sick at the start of the flu women found the package appealing something boldt would never fully understand the attitude accounted for some of it but not as much as people believed boldt thought it was more the mans soft brown eyes and the vulnerability they often expressedpuppy eyes pure and simple maria sanchez had fallen she wouldnt be the last i heard bobbie socks was asking around about her squeeze lamoia offered he meant gaynes i think you can take the squeeze off your list of suspects sarge youre looking at him he continued to refer to boldt by the mans former rank the same rank lamoia now wore like a coach and a player these two had a history that promotions couldnt ruffle and others couldnt explain if you felt anything for her at all youd have come back on the job boldt complained whats that about i came up through the front seat of a radio car sarge i still drink beer with the guys wearing unis hit balls at batting practice with them my names on the guild roster the chief is wrong about this i gotta stand up for that you can see that cant you you and sanchez how long boldt repeated knowing they could argue the blue flu all night long weve been seeing each other about a month now although the department didnt expressly forbid relationships between officers it discouraged them no involved officers could work the same division and were more often exiled to separate precincts sometimes having their careers destroyed in the process the credo personal lives do not mix with police lives hung on the lips of every superior and how long were you going to sit on this relationship im here and im talking right daphne snorted we caught you she said a lot of good youre doing maria on the sidelines maybe im doing more than you think lamoia said working the cop bars for information i suppose she offered derisively anybody angry at her about her dating a gringo boldt asked i knew you were going to ask that god damn it sarge family fellow officers in a city with a large population of asians hispanics seemingly suffered under extreme prejudice tensions flared on the force between uniforms from time to time boldt didnt want to face the possibility that sanchezs assault might have been racially or relationship motivateda hate crime and therefore disconnected from his current line of investigation nothing like that lamoia promised besides we kept it quiet neither of us wanted a transfer across town youre sure this is me sarge thats why im asking boldt said lamoia made trouble for himself from captains to meter maids hed made the rounds suffering suspensions and reprimands miraculously he had not only kept his badge but had managed to advance to squad sergeant in the face of rumor innuendo and outright scandal boldt had managed to keep lamoias affair with captain sheila hill quiet or lamoia would have been forced off boldts capers squad both hill and lamoia owed him for that boldt rarely collected on such debts though right now he felt tempted to pressure lamoia back onto the force boldt said so let me ask you this you know anything about this burglary investigation she was working lamoia twitched belying his outward calm boldt knew he had scored john boldt inquired lamoia maintained eye contact with boldt something begged to be spoken but did not reach the sergeants lips standing from his chair lamoia said you two take care of yourselves and hurried from the room boldt called after him but his voice fell upon deaf ears what was that daphne asked a tinge of fear in her voice he knows something about sanchez but is afraid to tell us boldt whispered wondering once again if liz and the kids were safe even tucked away miles from home john lamoia wasnt afraid of anything or anyone so why the sudden change in attitude chapter anthony brumewell struggled through another dinner alone when the phone rang the balding man was in the middle of eating some seashell pasta and broccoli in a pool of yogurt and butter covered with packaged parmesanplastic cheese he called itand drinking from a can of lite beer reading the seattle times sports page he cursed in the general direction of the phone as it rang annoyed he nonetheless stood up and answered he didnt get all that many calls after all hello mr anthony brumewell speaking who is this he tentatively identified the call as a phone solicitation a spike of indignation welling up and working toward boil didnt call me tony he thought other voices in the background keyboards clicking the words of the man on the other end were rushed though clearly carefully rehearsed im calling on behalf of consolidated mutual insurance mr brumewell before you hang up you should know that without obligation were offering you two free tickets to the movie of your choice anthony brumewell considered himself a film buff even if he mostly saw these films by himself did two free tickets mean two different films or two tickets to the same film this meant a world of difference to him and he assumed the latter which accounted for the receiver heading back for the cradle the salesmans voice barely audible through the tiny earphone he stopped himself from hanging up two free tickets to the movie of your choice two tickets to one film he asked or one ticket to two films and you should know theres a big difference to me however you would like to use the tickets the salesman answered the man had won another minute of his time go ahead im listening he said in fact he was holding the receiver an inch away from his ear as if this represented less commitment on his part at the end of this phone call consolidated mutual will guarantee a fifteen percent reduction when compared to your current homeowners policy absolutely guaranteed the tickets and i got to warn you im this close to hanging up on you two free tickets at any pantheon theater arranged electronically for pickup at the theaters new automated ticket teller for the movieor moviesof your choice at the time of your choice on the day of your choice two free tickets two different films brumewell made it a statement yes absolutely yes any pantheon theater one second here brumewell heard the sound of a keyboard even louderhis salesman was typing seattle wallingford im showing eleven pantheon theaters in three different locations within ten miles of your residence im aware of the pantheon theater chain brumewell said knowingly wanting the idiot on the other end to get to the point he eyed his cooling seashells and briefly thought about the fact that these phone solicitation people knew too much about you and used it against you at every turn could i use the tickets as early as tonight tonight would work certainly once weve completed the agreement any night you choose the agreement okay whats the catch consolidated mutual would like you to complete a very brief survey which i can go over with you now if you wish after the satisfactory completion of that survey the ticketsand the guaranteed savings on your homeowners policyare yours or if you prefer we can arrange for the tickets at a later time the offer is good for three months a survey a phone survey thats it thats all no obligation whatsoever and a guar antee brumewell chimed in i got that okay now we gonna get down to this survey or what how much time are we talking about anyway my dinner is getting cold here how come you people always call at dinnertime we can do the survey now certainly sir that would be fine or i could call back if you would prefer nah my dinners probably already cold anyway go ahead how long did you say seven to ten minutes sir some questions about your coverage is all you may find it worthwhile to have a copy of your current homeowners policy in front of you though that is not required by any means ill pass on the policy well have it done in no time okay okay lets get on with it brumewell eyed the microwave dinner could wait chapter as he stepped out of his battered departmentissue chevy boldt immediately sensed that something was out of place a moment later the same sensation registered as reliefthe neighbors dog was not directly on the other side of the rotten fence greeting boldt after a long day of work instead he was barking furiously at the far corner of their shared propertythankfully a decent enough distance away to reduce the ear damage the boldt driveway led past the left of the house to a detached garage lizs spankingnew ford expedition typically won the inside parking while the cavalier was relegated to the elements where it rightfully belonged but with liz and the kids at the jamerson home boldt nosed the front bumper to within a foot of the garage door and parked with the engine running he didnt carry a clicker he would have to trip the automatic door from inside the garage his watch read suddenly it hardly seemed worth parking the thing in the garage for a few brief hours while he attempted sleep he killed the engine and pocketed the keys though hed been preoccupied with the sanchez case and now brooksgilman he had nonetheless put in some time on other cases including a teen shooting at a drugstore just as he was leaving the precinct he sent off a second departmentwide email requesting information on any of sanchezs activities or known cases prior to her assault but he wasnt holding his breath neither was that damn dog the thing was suddenly berserk with the barkingwild to where boldt shouted shut up loudly enough to hope his neighbors would hear if his own kids had been home they would have been sleeping that seemed reason enough for the reprimand eleven oclock he thought gimme a break the back door to his house just ten to fifteen yards away suddenly felt much farther his neighbors fence was to his left the garage directly in front of his car blocked his way to the back porch forcing him to come around the rear bumper three sides of the box were closed to himhis only egress to the street he wasnt sure why any of this mattered perhaps it had something to do with the bloodcurdling yelps of that annoying dog and its steady approach up the fence toward boldt the air felt electric adrenaline charged his system what the hell he wondered someone jumped him from behind someone big someone strong whod probably come up along the narrow space between garage and fence because that barking dog was now immediately on the other side of that fence boldts brain kicked in muggings were up a hundred and fifty percent since the walkout the chokehold was decisive boldts neck in the crook of an elbow enough pressure to slow the blood to his brain and air to his lungs a stinging rabbit punch below and behind his right ribs he heard his gun thump to the driveway another person to his right big and broadshouldered too dark to see faces or maybe masks he wasnt sure they meant business another rabbit punch more pressure on his windpipe a hand found his wallet it registered in him again that he a cop was being mugged but his body felt hard and frozen he was in no shape to put up much resistance another devastating blow found his side caught a rib maybe broke it a hand slipped down his pants side pocket and pulled out some bills and change he took another charge of voltage to his gut and weakened one or two more like that and hed be throwing up blood a third man appeared to his leftor had the second simply moved boldt caught sight of a black balaclava covering this ones face the next abdominal blow buckled him forward further choking him and thrusting him toward unconsciousness down there by his own shoes he saw a pair of gray and brown nike running shoes one of the curved logos partly torn off he raised his head it was a third guy and this one carried a baseball bat its polished aluminum winking in the ambient street light boldt thought that a hospital bed might be wishful thinking this guy seemed intent on a home run to the head the neighbors crazed dog sounded ready to climb the fence the dog what little strength boldt still had lay in his legs he rocked back into the chokehold and simultaneously pushed off his car driving the man behind him into the fence the chokehold faltered boldt broke the hold and spun around either the baseball bat or more fists found his upper backhis chest and lungs felt stunned his right arm numb he was going down the man whod lost the chokehold around boldts neck wanted it back and now danced around boldt in an ungainly step using the fence to pin him in boldt took advantage of this human shield protecting his abdomen by leaning over at the same time he kicked the rotten fence like one of the kids in the park practicing penalty kicks the bat hit a single to first base using his shoulder as the ball the old plank fence had seen endless winters of relentless rain had stood witness to days weeks even months of it without a single ray of sunshine to dry it out boldts second kick split it open the black shiny nose of the angry creature with the gleaming white teeth poked through quicksilver saliva raining from its gums the chokehold reinstated itself with authority and boldt gagged and choked he felt a glove against his ear and pressure began to twist his neck to the right he kicked the fence again as the man behind him attempted to drag him away from that wall extremely strong boldt thought no junkies these three he kicked a larger hole through the rotting wood this time big enough for the things entire bearlike head to poke through that limited success provoked further enthusiasm from the dog he took over for boldt the hole widened even more k a voice warned from behind the baseball bat found the dog bouncing off as if it had hit a stone statue the dog clearly took umbrage at the use of an aluminum bat on its head it shrugged and wiggled forward enlarging the hole and making progress through it the dogs entire head popped through ears and all followed by the shoulders splinters of rotten wood rained out onto the boldt driveway he was some kind of hybridbred for teeth and head and muscle an oak body but flexible and fast perhaps rin tin tin had been trained to identify the victim versus the assailantperhaps it was a matter of posture but the fourlegged trained killer went straight for the calf of the man holding boldt who was released in a nanosecond and purposefully fell to the ground both to distinguish himself from the others and in hopes of retrieving his weapon the man cried out as those jaws tore into him and ripped flesh boldt felt blindly around the blacktop for his gun the fervent growling like a wind in his ears a dull thump of that baseball bat won a whimpering whine and a momentary relapse as the dog considered the time zone footsteps fleeing car doors thumping shut at least one engine starting ferocious barking as the dog regained his bearings and ran down the drive in pursuit tires screeching boldt tried to roll over hop ing to catch a car profile or even the license plate but his body belonged to pain and pain alone he gasped for air a huge wet tongue found his face good boy boldt said more than a little afraid of the animal good boy his right ear rang like an alarm clock sounding in a distant roomhed been struck in the head with the bat and was bleeding buckets the way only head cuts can bleed good god a mans voice said his neighbor the owner of the dog police boldt groaned finally able to straighten up he fished for his id wallet but his attackers had apparently taken this along with his wallet and money i live here he managed to cough out neighbors dont move ill call the man took off at a run the dog followed probably expecting a tasty chew no boldt stopped him he lay there in the dark the smell of the rotting fence and his own blood overwhelming him he didnt want a call he didnt want the press getting hold of a cop getting mugged an inquiry reports paperwork invasion of privacy he didnt want to worry liz didnt want her arguing for him to take sick leavethinking that maybe that had been the intention of his muggers and not wanting to face that right at that moment i could use a little help here he said he needed to patch himself up and think this through daphne he thought as his neighbor attempted to help him to his feet and he felt the effort like a boneraw punishment chapter daphne wore tight blue jeans and a caramel sweater that complemented her dark eyes with the sleeves of the sweater pulled up she looked like a woman who meant business the twisted silver bracelet signaled she wasnt at work boldt figured that she had plenty of other such leftover trinkets from her courtship with owen adlerthe man would have bought her the space needle if it might have guaranteed her love for him she switched on boldts bedside lamp and leaned in close and studied him it seemed strange to see a woman other than liz in this bedroom it even inspired guilt in him despite the pain take your shirt off daphne ordered him i dont think so the last time i had my shirt off with you take it off and sit up on the bed or im getting in my car and going home maybe thats best she asked are you sure there isnt something broken his ribs and chest carried crimson blotches and eerie blue bruises she gently touched one or two and boldt winced with the contact not exactly positive he said the ear had been patched up with a bandaid used as a butterfly turn around she instructed i just love it when you boss me around he teased now he obeyed im amazed you can breathe and this one this ones right on the kidney have you peed yet what are you peeing blood lou no you need to see a doctor at which point ill have to report a mugging at which point ill have twenty reporters camped on my front lawn and ringing my phone off the hook no thanks you really need to see a doctor she repeated no what about dixie his patients are all dead boldt replied dr ronald dixon chief medical examiner for king county was one of boldts closest friends lie back she advised im going to pour you a hot bath feed you some aspirin make some tea and call dixie when youre out of the bath im driving you down to the mes and hes going to look you over they have xray there access to the hospital fair enough its not fair at all or i walk out now and leave you to patch yourself up sounds fair to me he lay back every bone every muscle complaining he wasnt sure he could sit up again without some help thats extortion you know do you want bubbles she asked heading into the bathroom ha ha he replied is that a yes or no yes please he confessed the eucalyptus thats just so the bubbles hide you when i deliver the tea mr modest damn right that is unless youre going to get in the bath with me and scrub my wounds mocking him she said in your dreams she started the water running he could only hear it out his left ear boldt was thinking sometimes you are yes the medical examiners office in the basement of the harborview medical center was eerily quiet when empty of doc dixons staff dixie pronounced boldt reasonably intact and still alive he added editorially if you had come in as a cadaver id have guessed you had jumped from a moving train or fallen from a very high ladder thats my story and im sticking to it boldt said softly finding it too painful to speak the pain grew inside him like roots of a tree trying to find water i could write you a couple of prescriptions pain sleep no thanks daphne said maybe just write them anyway it hurt too much to object listen to the little lady dixie said hows liz anyway dixie asked his back to them as he wrote out the prescriptions was there innuendo in that question boldt wondered healing rapidly she doesnt like to discuss it when do you tell her about this not yet boldt answered daphne mocked he doesnt want to go through the paperwork uhhuh dixie said who needs another case to investigate boldt reasoned that was a baseball bat daphne said as dixon once again studied the ear boldt mumbled k whats that dixon asked still probing the damaged ear since when does a mugger call a dog a k uhoh daphne said i smell a conspiracy theory coming boldt asked okay so its a mugging so why not take off once they had my stuff why stay to punish me with the baseball bat i thought that since the flu assaults like this are up dixie said dozens daphne answered true enough boldt agreed blood in the urine no boldt felt daphnes stare you want to watch for that as well as dark stool so noted and i want to hear about it immediately affirmative you got lucky here boldt winced yeah im feeling like a real winner no cop would ever do such a thing to another cop lou sickout or not i just dont see it dixie said that brick sure some name calling some harassment you bet but this just to keep you off the job i guess youre right boldt admitted though it certainly crossed my mind muggings are up dixie repeated i caught that the first time boldt said can you have him stay with you dixon asked matthews to boldt he said i understand your not wanting to alarm liz before you know whats going on i know you but you cant stay alone at your house tonight you just cant doctors order you need someone there so you either head over to the jamersons boldt shook his head interrupting him to daphne dixie said so you play nurse take his temperature every four hours feed him more aspirin if necessary call me if there are any rapid changes in his condition i need to call liz he said from the passenger seat of daphnes honda now youre coming to your senses but i dont want to wake her up and i dont want to frighten her thats out of my territory ill wake everyone up and turn this into a huge deal and make promises to her that by the morning ill break because im not going to take time offand thats what shell want lou if i take sick leave what the hells it going to look like he answered his own question flu and im not going to give krishevski a chance to play that card no way and this has to do with calling liz she questioned its complicated he said it must be it can wait until morning he convinced himself no need to wake anyone tonight he justified sleep it off and see how im doing he tested right this is your decision lou am i heading to mercer islandto the jamersons no he answered he leaned his head back a moment later he was asleep and lightly snoring daphne drove boldt to her houseboat and made up the futon couch in the downstairs living area just north of the noaa docks on lake union the floating community of houseboats had taken on a mythical reputation raising property values fivefold in just eight years two thousand square feet of living space dressed in red wood shingle and asphalt roof her houseboat had a red enamel wood stove and a sea kayak tied up to the deck outside her livingroom window there were ten other such homes on her pier five to a side a half dozen piers running up the lakes shoreline little henhouses of mailboxes out on the road where the mailman knew each resident by name community still meant something here the hippie feel of the past twenty years was giving way to microsoft geeks who looked stupid smoking their cigars while sucking down microbrewery beer on warm summer nights with the citys killer skyline forming a stage set in the near distance an animosity existed surrounding the influx of the chip set despite the lift it had given the economy but the quaintness of her houseboat remained small spaces carefully decorated so as not to clutter a faint trace of cinnamon incense the sound of lake water lapping at the sides if she ever sold shed be able to retire listen i appreciate the gesture he said but we cant do this sure we can she replied retrieving a pillow from her loft bedroom boldt lacked the strength to fight he wanted sleep i need sleep he complained you need a bath and some tea the sleep will come of its own accord im sure youre right im always right she said you just dont always choose to listen he awoke to the smell of tea and bagels daphne at work in the houseboats small galley she wore lycra that fit her like plastic wrap it was better than a sunrise which hed missed by an hour or more he didnt want to dress himself in the soiled and bloodied clothing from his beating anticipating this she had left him an owen adler navy blue polo shirt complete with the alligator a pair of underwear and a pair of athletic socks he didnt ask any questions their engagement had failed twiceenough said he showered barely moving beneath the hot hot water there seemed to be pieces of him missing others that shouted at full volume he only heard things from half his head when he reached the galley feeling refreshed but bludgeoned he found a buttered bagel next to a jar of raspberry jam and a note that showed a stick figure running he ate outside alone with a view of the morning activity on the lakea seaplane landing in a graygreen knife stroke on the waters still surface ducks flying in unison and veering north over gasworks park with its eerie skyline of pipes reminding him of a refinery he felt incredibly grateful to be alive odd that he had that dog to thank that dog he had hated so much he took a bite of the bagel it hurt his ear to chew he searched the fridge for applesauce or yogurt something that didnt require any chewing he found something with live culture the thought disturbed him the city ran wild with crime while his coworkers willingly stayed home awaiting policy change he couldnt see the sense in that just as he couldnt understand why a trio of muggers would start working on him with a baseball bat unless they had found his badge and suddenly panicked or filled with hate over his being a cop hate corrupted even the bestintentioned mugger hate corrupted everything in its path and he felt filled with it all of a sudden and not a verifiable target in sight chapter wheres maria sanchez gone boldt asked the attending nurse at the nurses station hed arrived to find her room unguarded and empty he felt as if the floor had fallen out from under him the nurse checked the computer and it troubled him that she wouldnt know this off the top of her head she was transferred out of icu to the third floor room three seventeen then shes better boldt said hopefully recalling that on his last visit she had definitely slipped backward the move would indicate shes stable the nurse corrected any movement other than the eyes youll have to discuss that with her physician she advised boldt rode the elevator as he had coming in for a man who normally took the stairs this felt wrong even privately humiliating he shuffled down the hospital corridor painfully aware that he probably looked too much like an old man his father had raised him to believe there was no way around pain only through it right now he was even aspirin free he pushed his limbs to move his ribs to tolerate breathing his head to survive the throbbing hed told liz that hed been mugged his money and badge wallet stolen that the ugly dog next door had probably saved his life hed been roughed up before in service to the city thankfully liz didnt berate him for electing to keep working she wanted to see him he promised to make that happen she didnt know that the muggers had used the term k and that one of the three had intended to do a mark mcgwire on his head no one knewnot even daphne exactlythat a part of him suspected the attack was a krishevski telegram like those strippers that knock on your front door and flash you on your fiftieth birthday a krishevski invitation to get a bad case of the flu he needed a second opinion he checked in with the new security man outside the door and confirmed sanchezs guest list discovering that lamoia visited at least once a day usually well past the posted visiting hours typically for long stints he could imagine the man in the dark of the room alone in a chair as sanchez slept others would find this image of lamoia inconceivable but boldt knew the man as few others did the blinds were pulled casting the overly sterile room in a haze the rooms television was tuned to a public access channel that ran ads while nasalsounding classical music played from a small speaker strapped to her bed he recalled the head phones in her bedroom and thought he should bring her something better hamilton peterson monk or gatemouth brown stable he recalled the nurse explaining of course she was stable he thoughtthey had her head bolted inside a contraption that looked like it was part of a medieval torture chamber she couldnt move just to look at her brought a queasiness to his stomach he recalled a slightly younger maria sanchez standing at his front door there to babysit the kids for the first timealive brighteyed but cautious and uncomfortable at the same time not wanting to mix the personal with the professional but unable to resist the idea of being with kids he suspected that was why she hadnt hung around for too longtheir shields had gotten in the way it certainly hadnt been out of any lack of rapport with the kidsthey had loved her from the start and that won any parents heart including his boldt had liked her right away had talked her up around the shop from that night forward had tried to open some doors for her the way he once had for gaynes maybe hed had something to do with her moving quickly to plainclothes maybe not it no longer mattered he felt anger over her present condition he seethed those eyes flashed out of the darkness open awake hey boldt said caught a little off guard to be in the room alone with her she blinked more questions you up to it he half hoped she might refuse him he felt at odds with himself over using this woman as a witness eyesright maybe tough questions he cautioned she shut her eyes and reopened them eyesright okay boldt approached the overhead television and turned down its volume sanchez locked her eyes in a stare that reached past him not eyesright a yes nor eyesleft a no not a look that penetrated through himthankfully her stare finally turned him around to face a chair he pulled the chair up to the bed now nearly eyetoeye with her she was tired of being looked down upon better he inquired eyesright yes but it struck him as more than an answer for her eyes were soft and caring filled with emotion hed not seen since the first of their visits together he remembered those same eyes from when they had first fallen upon his own childrenthey seemed to hold something very different now any better are you feeling any better no answer she just stared he wondered if she could feel any physical sensations at all he agonized right along with her if i dont look right if i dont sound myself its because im not i was mugged last night her eyes seemed to focus and harden but her face didnt changeit couldnt that struck boldt as the worst prison of all and what im thinking maria officer sanchez he corrected is not something a peace officer wants to think not ever so my apologies up front but i need to ask you this because we share these assaults now you and i mine was headed badly very badly indeeduntil a neighbors dog broke it off so im counting myself on the lucky side boldt continued there are two possibilities one is that i was mugged although ive got to tell you we havent seen a mugging in my neighborhood in seventeen years the recent muggings weve been seeing in the other parts of the cityand weve been seeing a lot of them in the past weekhave been downtown in parking lots and garages at sports events movie theaters convenience storesout in public they havent been in peoples backyards we had a burglary where a woman was knocked downstairs but that hardly qualifies the other possibility boldt continued is what you might call involuntary flu certain people might have thought that i was acting a little too healthy and disrupting the current efforts of some of our brothers in blue they sent me a brick through my window as a warning and i ignored it i stayed on the job and got assaulted in my own yard and now i cant hear very well out of my right ear and it hurts to breathe so what im wondering before your assault had you received a brick or any kind of warning anything at all suggesting you cool it for a while no she replied with her eyes boldt couldnt think of another way to put it he just had to ask maria did you know the person who did this to you no she signaled if you were afraid at first afraid because you suspected a fellow officer afraid of matthews and me because we carry badges and you didnt know who to trust im hoping nownow that you know what happened to methat now you can trust me so my first question is whether you believe you were attacked by someone who came to rob you by a burglar she stared over at boldt for a long time her head gripped mechanically her eyelids fluttered shut and opened yes came her answer but her eyelids closed again and reopened with eyesleft no youre unsure is that right yes her efforts were labored he scribbled a question mark in his notebook alongside the question you were working a burglary before the assault brooksgilman over in queen anne it was assigned after the sickout do you remember the case yes do you think your assault had anything to do with that burglary investigation yes no maybe so let me ask you do you think your assault had anything to do with your work she closed her eyes and held them shut maria boldts heart beat faster he repeated her name he said is it possible that your assault had somethinganythingto do with or was a result of your police work yes then no maybe youre doing well maria boldt said can we keep going yes okay then he glanced through the pages of his notebook and moved a question forward onto his list a part of him didnt want to keep going a part of him just wanted to leave this poor woman alone to deal with what for her were more urgent problems why he wondered did he feel so pressed to squeeze something out of her right now is it safe to say that you believe your assault may have been at the hands of a fellow officer her eyelids fluttered shut when they reopened her eyes were locked onto boldts and he began to feel all watery and weak inside she wasnt going to commit to that not yet she was still as terrified of the idea as he was cop on cop strike or not it seemed inconceivable she wasnt looking directly at him anymore now her eyes were fixed below the horizon of his gaze something else lower he looked around the room for what held her attention seeing nothing that made sense he wondered about her stare did she just want him to stop had he and his questions pushed her further toward frustration was he just giving her another problem to handle listen he began i probably shouldnt be press ing you so hard he continued to try to figure out what it wasif it was anythingthat had caught and held her attention but he could see that her eyes had become more frantic jumping to make contact with him and then dropping back down locked onto whatever it was shes telling me something he realized feeling a tension in the air still searching the floor the wall behind him his own right hand his keys liz had pointed out that he had a nervous habit of constantly fiddling with his keys he barely even realized he was doing it it was just something to do motion like a smoker rolling the ash of a burning cigarette he drew the keys out of the pocket and marias eyelids fluttered shut and opened eyesright yes those eyes shouted now focused onto him with a burning intensity what about the keys he asked with growing excitement she didnt answer her gaze still fixed on the keys and key chain my keys he asked no now her eyes seared him his own eyes stung your keys yes the mechanical efforts of the respirator moved in time with her chest as it rose and fell with ungainly symmetry its exhale a long peaceful artificial sigh what about your keys he wondered aloud trying to make sense of it he held his up until they rang like tiny chimes and sparkled in the glare of the tube lights again her eyes lit up with anticipation and even fright she didnt need to tell him anything morekeys were somehow significant in what she was trying to communicate he asked her directly are the keys important yes you left your garage you were headed to the back door and you had your keys she closed her eyeshe thought in frustration and held them shut when she reopened them they bore into him im off track he whispered yes she answered the effort draining her he sensed her fatigue which she was fighting desperately they both knew he was losing her she closed her eyes to rest this time for longer your keys he repeated feeling he was working her too hard she struggled to open her eyes yes the robberies the burglar made copies of the keys something like that and then he thought he knew where she was headed whoever did this was in side your house hed gotten your keys somehowand he was inside waiting for you no her frustration seethed from her eyes im sorry he mumbled the great detective cant string three useful questions together he felt impotent damn it all he muttered her eyes fluttered sagged shut and failed to reopen maria maria he gently tested it took him a moment to realize the interview was over maria had fallen asleep chapter i m not sure i see the point of this daphne said hurrying down the hallway toward property boldt had rousted her out of her office the point is boldt said pain ringing through him her keys are important how im not sure youre lead on her case which means i dont get her keys out of property without your signature she held a door for him he said im beginning to believe my assault and hers are linked thats what led me back to her hospital room now thisthese keys ive got to face facts people dont get mugged in my neighborhood daffy i know that so if they werent muggers who were they maybe we dont want to find out the cop in me doesnt want to believe any cop would do this to another cop not ever you think i like it boldt asked the psychologistshes a different story she went on theres resentment here frustration on the part of the fluers venting those pentup emotions is a natural progression a natural expression but the sickout is working she agreed to us it is because were worn out by it but to those cops now on the outside she questioned to themand to the public toowere wounded were down on one knee but were not on the mat were not raising white flags that could be the source of a lot of anger violence he asked her she shrugged and reluctantly nodded id rate it as a possibility she confirmed but for the record id put marias assault down as a burglary gone bad your little skirmish im not so sure so we listen to the victim and we chase the evidence he reminded her boldts law of investigation in the sanchez case chasing the evidence now meant a certain set of keys as its senior sergeant krishevski ran the evidence storage facilitys daily operations claiming the day shift for himself and his threeman squad as guild president krishevski had caught a bad case of the blue flu as had his squad leaving what remained of the night duty and graveyard shifts to handle things ron chapman a uniformed sergeant with two years less seniority than krishevski looked haggard barrelchested potbellied and pale he looked as much like an irish potato farmer as a cop in pressed blues boldt knew chapman casually though not socially having spent years passing the man in the hallways and seeing him working behind the property rooms wiremesh screens in the process of cataloging case evidence any field detective worth his salt knew any and all of the officers who manned propertythe repository of all physical evidence from active and uncleared investigations and arraignments that had yet to reach trial as lead on the case daphne signed off for the sanchez evidence at the cage and chapman retrieved it for her a few minutes later chapman delivered the items in a sealed cardboard box that in turn contained a large plastic garbage bag kept shut by a wire twist that carried a tag bearing the case particulars that tag had to be torn in order to open the twist and get to the contents daphne did so in front of chapman who held a computerized inventory of the bags contents she removed the womans black leather jacket now stained with chemicals used by the lab in an attempt to develop fingerprints she held it up for both to see im removing the jacket she noted chapman said to boldt i got your emails about sanchez that won boldts interest thing about email chapman said is they can trace it back to its source you know you have something for me ron you know anything about the brooksgilman burglary didnt say that did i was there any evidence collected in the brooksgilman burglary not that i know of may i see the log for the past two weeks dont see why not chapman said typing for a moment before spinning the computer terminal to face boldt and daphne boldt checked his notepad for the date sanchez had taken over the investigation for shoswitzs fluridden burglary unit boldt noticed that three days before her assault sanchez had visited property both in the morning and the early evening he counted four visits in all but there was no case number listed nor any victim name which struck him as unorthodox at best ron chapmans initials listed him as odthe officer on duty for sanchezs evening visit whats with the lack of reference ron no number no name no kidding chapman said staring at boldt in nearly the same manner as sanchez had stared as if something were expected of him as if he were supposed to pull this all together out of thin air theyre required boldt reminded not always they arent the man returned the statement confused boldt since when wasnt a case number required for a property visit an officer cant just pay a visit and do his or her shopping boldt said chapman leaned toward the screen like an inmate entertaining a visitor he said faintly not all visits are recorded the same way he hesitated these are tumultuous times he said shooting boldt another knowing look clearly begging him to connect the dots daphne announced formally im searching the pockets of the leather coat that stuffs in here chapman said indicating a sealed manila envelope he read from the label set of keys and a garage door opener boldt scrolled back through the listings he didnt want to lose chapman and the mans uncertain willingness to cooperate how about a little help here ron daphne signed the manila folder and then opened it dumping a set of keys and a clicker into her waiting hand the keys and clicker had been dusted and fumed for latent prints giving them a pale purple cast chapman swiveled the monitor back around and made notes in the computer log everything in its place but no case numbers alongside sanchezs name why boldt had in his possession what hed come for but he was leaving with more questions than answers let me ask you this boldt said to daphne from behind the steering wheel of the chevy since when does a uniform like ron chapman not walk in concert with krishevski bothers me too yes daphne agreed youre the psychologist peer desertion she asked looking for a cubbyhole it would typically indicate a selfish motivation something personal maybe retirement illness in the family some situation where the paycheck is deemed more important than the cause then why cooperate with me at all its troubling i have to admit then you thought that was strange back there boldt said encouragingly unusual she said choosing her own word unexpected he wanted to tell me something no she corrected he wanted you to discover it sanchez wanted that too he informed her these keys she was practically killing herself to help me figure this out and i never did at least not yet she said displaying the keys and letting them dangle he pulled the car to a stop blocking sanchezs driveway i still cant forgive sid for parking in the driveway that night who knows what we might have missed such as if its burglary robbery whatever this guy has to park somewhere hes yarding in tvs dont forget maybe he parked in the driveway maybe we might have lifted a tire pattern or something who knows if she questioned dont you hate this not knowing we know they got my wallet and yet they stayed to finish me off one of them used the term k we also know there have been a dozen serious assaults since the flu she reminded him right now only these keys interest us she quoted maintain focus and objectivity boldt amen boldt said snagging the keys from her grasp and limping as he led the way to the sanchez house okay he said once inside lets review the inconsistencies i thought this was about the keys she complained cant we just try all the keys first its your case he said a little miffed he passed her the keys attached to the ring was a black plastic bobble with a black button she sighed and gave in saying most security systems were blocked hers was not she was stripped and tied to a bed the only other known assault was kawamoto and she was left alone he added time of day was off all the others were committed in broad daylight but all the burglaries involved highend electronics including sanchez similar neighborhoods similar mo jewelry silver and other items left in plain view go untouched how often does that happen daphne walked them through the house trying the keys on exterior doors one key worked all the exterior doors three keys to go she said are you going to explain how this guy bypassed the security systems he didnt not exactly boldt answered are you going to make me beg i love it when you beg he said you be careful what you ask for she said trying a key out on a locked closet she found one that fit the closet was empty probably for renters boldt said so boldt said the guy does this for a living right he knows damn well that home security systems dial out over the phone line he scouts the place he knows its empty so he calls the house just as hes going to hit it the message machine picks up engaging the line which means its now busy the security system cant dial out hes got a minute or morehowever long the answering machine gives himto break in when he does he busts up the systems siren and gets the phone physically off the hook sweet except that siren is blasting from the minute hes through the door until he kos it those things false alarm all the time as bad as car alarms you think a neighbors going to pay any attention if the thing stops within twenty or thirty seconds no way two keys unaccounted for she said theyd been through the whole house garage should be one of them she agreed they walked out back the disturbed area in the grass was marked off and protected by yellow crimescene tape they reached the garages side door and the key fit they opened it up and stepped inside boldt said all keys accounted for one left she said indicating the smallest on the ring youll find it fits that dirt bike he said pointing she slipped past the car into the far corner and tried the key just the same when it fit she said you do impress the ladies you know do i yes absolutely but i failed in my mission he pointed out why the keys maybe you misread her maybe if youd asked me along she prodded upset that he had not she added sarcastically but then again its only my case she took the keys back theyd been exchanging them back and forth like this as if playing some kind of parlor game daphne took them stepped toward the parked car and pushed the button on the key rings bobble with both of them facing the cara badly weathered toyotathe garage door opened behind them they spun around in unison she said i figured it for the car yes boldt agreed snatching the keys back and stopping the door midascent he pushed the button again and the door started down daphne was already digging in her purse by the time boldt looked over at her her hand came out holding the clicker found in the pocket of sanchezs leather jacket she pointed it toward the door and squeezed nothing boldt grabbed it from her he aimed the clicker at the overhead garage door mechanism and depressed its button twice nothing again he tried the small black clicker attached to the set of keys again the door reversed direction boldt and daphne met eyes she said so it wasnt the keys after all no and youre thinking the obvious he answered whos it belong to she said indicating the freestanding clicker exactly a boyfriend her parents house a sister someone she was housesitting for one of the cases she was working boldt suggested i knew you were going there she sounded disappointed she knew the time involved in going door to door to nine different homes she wanted us to find this he reminded her holding the clicker cherishing it and now we have she said chapter boldt didnt like the look of the city streets he could see the difference since the sickout fewer pedestrians anarchy at traffic lights a pervasive restlessness people walked faster and more determined taking less time on street corners there were few if any beat cops out here no patrol cars attendance at mariners games was off forty percent over the prior week despite the new stadium benaroya hall had hired a private security firm to patrol the area so that symphony patrons could reach their cars safely following a concert the citizens of seattle were scared and for good reasonstreet crime was up doubledigits in six days the city was backsliding into the very urban problems it had previously managed to keep at arms length he followed the traffic out to queen anne anticipation clouding his thoughts sanchez hadnt been trying to direct him to some boyfriendhe felt certain of this the keys had led to the clicker the clicker belonged to brooksgilman the burglary case she had signed off on or so his reasoning went he felt certain of it or almost anyway enough to talk daphne into a drive to queen anne the brooksgilman house had views of both puget sound and the downtown skyline before boldt led the way up the walkway to the front door he stood out on the street and tried the garage door clicker the door lifted open daphne let out a small cheer sometimes she said i actually get off on this stuff boldt said we were stupid were we she asked in every case the doors to the burglarized homes were reported locked even our own first officers put it down this way she continued his thought we wrote that off to doors being jimmied and owners panicking and locking up once they realized theyd been hit but it wasnt that it was that so few of us lock the door that leads into the house from the garage nodding he pushed the clicker and stopped the garage door sanchez understood that she saw the one point of vulnerability and pursued it but one still needs the clicker daphne said what this guy steals them from the cars visor in car washes and parking lots the garage door opened again but this time boldt had not triggered the device he looked first toward his hand and then toward the house and pointed to the silhouette of the woman standing at the mouth of the garage she may be able to answer that he said helen brooksgilman a hyphenate a dotcom mom whole neighborhood was probably hyphenates he thought he attempted to return the clicker to the woman as he explained that detective sanchez had been hospitalized and that he and daphne had taken over the burglaries she accepted the clicker cautious until daphne produced her id wallet and boldt unfolded a photocopy of his lieutenants identification you dont have a badge she inquired my id wallet was stolen its a long story boldt answered tempted to lift his shirt and show her his bruises holding up the device daphne asked is this clicker yours the woman invited them inside its a long story she answered purposely matching boldts tone the interior was pastels and hardwoods programmers and internet cfos took these s clapboards and sunk a small fortune into flooring moldings and windows boldt knew firsthand he and liz had done much the same to their place fifteen years earlier for a third the price and a second mortgage they were still paying off the first officers report said there was no sign of forced entry boldt said in a voice that bordered on impatient he had a theory on that now he needed it proved out helen brooksgilman wore a combination of rei and nordstrom tipped hair cut cleanly above her shoulders a small rolex but a rolex nonetheless leather deck shoes though he doubted she sailed cup of coffee boldt declined the offer coffee went through him like acid were there by any chance any doors left unlocked no its funny thats what the insurance people asked as well all the doors have night latches and we leave them that way all the timewith the buttons in it can be inconvenient for example you take the trash out and the kitchen door shuts behind you and you need a key to get back in boldt asked how about the door leading in from the garage helen brooksgilman looked perplexed well no thats never locked but the garage door is she caught herself catching up to his reasoning thats why the other detective wanted our spare remote boldt nodded i think so yes you loaned officer sanchez the garage door opener daphne asked brooksgilman confirmed this with a nod our spare she requested it boldt asked to see the garage and she showed them into the kitchen subzero refrigerator and viking range he opened the door into a garage cluttered with gardening tools and sports equipment surrounding a gray minivanthe luxury model with leather and electric windows he and liz had looked at the same car but couldnt go the four grand for all the bells and whistles your sheet lists a television and camcorder taken from your bedroom a computer wasnt there our sons imac boldt pulled out the white plastic tie from his pocket and asked any of these found since the theft she looked a little stunned yes in our bedroom thats why i called back to you people in the first place and you got detective sanchez daphne suggested an operator took down my name and detective sanchez was the one who called me back and subsequently paid you a visit boldt said helen brooksgilman explained the strike had started she explained to me she didnt typically work robberies burglaries he corrected and its not a strike its a sickout daphne chided him with a single disapproving expression she intervened we need you to answer a couple more questions helen wed like you to sit down and get comfortable brooksgilman led them to the kitchen table this time she offered them decaf they declined boldt and daphne sat across the table from her so that they could measure her physical reactions as well as her facial expressions daphne continued detective sanchez took your call and then what she came over as i mentioned i gave her the thingy id found that would be the white plastic tie daphne said yes thats correct boldt said and she looked around top to bottom she was very thorough i liked that about her she took it seriously the other officerthe one who came after my nineoneonehe just wanted the forms filled out the garage he asked yes she looked at the garage and then daphne asked she asked to borrow the clicker she didnt say why and i confess i didnt ask she was doing her job that was good enough for me boldts turn she asked you some other questions as well like who if anyone had serviced your home appliances recently pizza deliveries that sort of thing daphne added any phone calls youd received especially any where the person on the other end hung up on you when you answered ive hung up on a few of them she told them dinnertime phone solicitations my husband will talk to themdont ask me why but i absolutely will not i find the whole idea offensive boldt pushed her a bit more as to the repairs washing machine fridge any deliveries she and i went over this yes the woman answered all i can tell you is what i told her i have no idea how this guy picked us to rob but it wasnt any of those ways no deliveries no strange phone calls other than the usual phone solicitations you loaned her the clicker daphne suggested she said shed return it said shed return it in a day or two yes tech services boldt suggested to daphne who nodded he suspected that would have been sanchezs next stop it would have been his daphne apologized to the woman im afraid were going to have to borrow it again chapter boldt guessed rightsanchez had in fact paid a visit to spds tech services and had asked a lab rat named tina ming a variety of questions about cloning garage door openers ming confirmed that duplicating the radio frequencies used by such a device was scientifically quite simple they had not ended up providing sanchez with a clone however because their work had been delayed by the flu ming suggested boldt consult the fbi flu or not the fbi was never the fastest agency to respond boldt would seek solutions elsewhere he thought he now understood where sanchez had been headed a blackmarket source for a cloned garage door opener nine of them to be preciseover the course of the last several weeks a way into homes otherwise believed locked up if he could find that supplier and squeeze out a name of a buyer he might have the repeat burglarand quite possibly sanchezs offender behind bars by the end of the day he felt pulled between two theoriescop on cop or burglary gone bad but the solution to the sanchez assault seemed paramount to both the apartment occupied the floor above the jokes on you bear berensons comedyjazz club that enjoyed an odd combination of a happy hour police crowd and a primetime college clientele boldt pulled the chevy down the back alley and parked making sure to put the laminated blue policeofficial business card that would keep the tow trucks away he hoped to only spend a few minutes with bear but the potsmoking angstridden longtime friend could make a scenic drive out of the shortest errand he practiced patience preparing himself for an extended stay required to address a white plastic box housing a badly scratched talk button and a speaker grid that had inherited some chewing gum boldt gained admittance through a buzzing door jamb with bears distorted voice welcoming him he climbed the long dark stairwell the smell of stale beer and cigarettes familiar to a man who occasionally worked the happy hour piano on the other side of the communicating wall where others might gag lou boldt felt comfort he had spent a lot of good hours at this bar and its predecessor the big joke a few million notes had passed through his fingers here the steep stairs presented a challenge his battered and painful body was still unwilling to climb but he managed nearing the top landing he smelled the weed knowing bear he had opened a window trying to air out the apartment but his attempt had backfired and instead was blowing the smoke toward the stairwell boldt forgave him the habit but asked that he not smoke in front of him for obvious reasons sherlock berenson had a smokers rasp a neatly trimmed black beard with gray streaks coming down like fangs and something of a beer gut maintained by the contents of the longneck bottle gripped casually in his right hand live and in person boldt said tea you think id risk contamination you look a little off bear said and you a little sideways boldt observed he won a smile for that comment im always sideways sore is all boldt explained ive been dodging baseball bats lately sit down before you fall down berenson advised bear loved an audience he paced from side to side as if working a stage boldt said id love to say its a social call did i forget to pay you or something boldt explained its more of a research visit weed women retail sales frankie boldt said frankie bear asked wounded i wouldnt ask if it wasnt important frankie bear repeated he sucked down some beer and wiped his mouth im not after himeven if hes involved i promise him a free ride a name is all im after one name are you paying berenson asked youre his agent now just asking bear replied im paying boldt answered bear had a tendency to put himself in the middle of things and no one wanted to get between frankie and anything including boldt frankie isnt going to want anything to do with youfor obvious reasons it had better be a shitload of money know what i mean a shitload of money boldt agreed and maybe i get the current charges reduced ive known the man a long time bear said it doesnt mean i know his current status with the pa and i dont want to theres a woman officer in bad shape boldt explained maybe frankie can help with that i read the newspapers you know so hooked on phonics actually works youre going to bite the hand that feeds you bear added you want a name is that all maybe i can get you the name myself boldt usually tended not to see the degree of bears intoxication after years of friendship he took him as he was but now he saw that he was a little more stoned than usual and decided to connect the dots for him im interested in garage door openers berenson spit out some beer as he laughed ive got to do this in person bear he offered ill give you a happy hour for free bear straightened up took another pull off the beer and said no need to be rude since when do you and i buy favors off each other boldt suggested two hundred bucks and reduced charges run it by him would you garage doors a faint grin bear read the back of the beer bottle for useful information he picked at the label boldt waited him out knowing that stoned head of his was debating saying something or not you be careful with frankie he said hell have a blanket cross his lap never know whats under that blanket til its too late got it boldt said the expression reminded him of bobbie gaynes she used it so often she owned it the only detective on his squad not to walk he appreciated the loyalty in ways he would never be able to express berenson brought him back to the room with one long draw on the beer bottle and a thundering burp that apparently satisfied him you want me to try to set it up now or later your call sooner the better mind if i drift downstairs and play a couple numbers while you make the call boldt asked its been a while have i ever minded you know where to find me yes i do bear said at my piano in my club waiting for my phone call to my contact he added you dont have a fence that needs whitewashing do you frankie maglioni filled the electric wheelchair from the waist up a blanket covered his waist and withered legs sucked dry from atrophy nine years earlier he had jumped from the third floor balcony of a spanishinfluenced estate as the security firm had breached the bedroom door hed landed on a steel air conditioning unit the impact snapping his spine like a twig and ending a successful career in cat burglary though never confirmed he was believed to be the dinner bandit a name gained for striking the wealthy elderly as they dined in their own house a floor or two below he was only convicted of the one crime his sentence reduced because of the injury but insurance claims accounted for seven hundred thousand dollars in missing jewelry over a threeyear period all of it attributed to the dinner bandit he was now believed to be a fence he lived in a singlefloor loft apartment that occupied the entire third floor of a former paste jewelry factory and was accessed by a freight elevator boldt slid open the elevators wooden slats and introduced himself we aint never officially met the man said no said boldt i guess because youre homicide im told most of the time but right now no youre standing in for jorgenson and them ive got a burglary case yes boldt informed him and in case bear didnt make it clear im not after you he broke a womans neck frankie yeah bear said so i kinda got me a weakness in terms of that kind of thing someone does that to someone elsedoes this he said indicating his legs a person like mein my particular situationkind of thinks twice about letting that slide you know i can imagine thats right which is on account of why youre standing here plenty of businessmen such as myself you could have talked to i needed the best thats bullshit i need to know about garage door openers frankie maglioni shot boldt a look of surprise respect and reluctance in regards to its his way inside i think boldt added its a new one on us i need a little education maglioni backed up the chair behind an electronic hum and the whine of tight gears the chair turned and wheeled forward to a low table no thanks and if i can get your probation tossed thats a pa id be hearing from and maybe you will and maybe you and i have a chat right about that time know what im saying we can chat right now a cop cant get probation tossed frankie said this cop can boldt fired back ill get the probation tossed and the arrest taken off your sheet boldt waited for that to sink in you want me to make the call to some dick on your floor who knows the game and makes like a pa dont think so so you make the call boldt suggested an apa name of williamson maybe i will you go ahead boldt said i know the number he recited it dont want no number from you maglionis distrustful eyes reviewed boldt from his tie to hairline and back down again he wheeled back to a drawer and a phone book only reason im doing this is because that jail aint no place for a man in a chair the only reason youre doing this frankie is that with probation lifted you can plea your next arrest otherwise its hard time this gets you back to work you see every poleesman assumes the rest of us got nothing better to do than to break the law its under governmentthe listing boldt instructed maglioni reversed the pages and ran a stubby finger down the page a moment later after a brief discussion with williamson he motored back over to the table so you think ahead he said so what i didnt say anything you making fun of me not at all boldt said garage doors pretty damn simple mr smart you bat a car window lift the registration and the clicker if you hurry youre home before daddy registration gives you the address clicker gets you inside and if were not talking about busting out a car window the man nodded faintly at boldt yeah okay different deal you understand not that i done it myself heavens no them guys clone cell phones you know they got this little box lifts the valid codes i know about cloned phones boldt answered im interested in garage door openers a white boy was asking around on who could build him a custom scannernot for no cell phones you understand when a couple months back who them clickers work off radio crystals you got yourself the right kind of machinery and youre laying by close enough to pick it up you can lift that frequency the thrill of discovery keeps any detective in the game but outwardly boldt sat deadpan as if dissatisfied with frankies explanation he said i know about cloning clickers what i need is the guy who built the scanner for this white boy youre telling me about that wasnt our deal frankie complained his nostrils flaring again our deal was you make me happy your probation goes away thats bullshit i need a name i dont have no name he complained you think this is the radio shack or something boldt repeated i need the name of the guy who can build these things or the name of the guy who bought one he added you get me either name and it proves goodand your probation goes away if i get the buyer your arrest record disappears frankie negotiated the probation goes away now as agreed i locate this technician the arrest is erased smiling boldt removed a business card from his pocket and placed it on the table my rules frankie not yours and its got to be within the next twentyfour hours or i forget i ever saw you boldt walked toward the freight elevator his back to the man in the wheelchair he pulled the elevator gate shut behind himself and pushed the button chapter the voice on the other end of boldts cellular sounded artificial or forceddisguised in some wayand as a result immediately troubled him you shouldnt miss this call its important to you the line went dead he looked up to meet eyes first with liz and then with kristin jamerson both of whom sat across the dinner table awaiting his response to the call this their first dinner without kids the adults forestalling their own meal until after eight when the last of them natalie the jamersons eldest went to sleep the cell phone call was clearly an intrusion no one said anything but john jamerson stopped chewing and also glanced over at boldt liz and the kids had been guests at their home for over a week nowa sixbedroom home overlooking lake washington a gary nisbet collage centered on the largest wall a deborah butterfield horse in the living room nice digs liz had cooked a lamb dinner as a thankyou for the twobedroom guest cottage above the pool house with boldts mugging it looked like they would be here a bit longer the meal was less than ten minutes old he still held the cell phone it remained the focus of everyones attention boldt addressed his audience if i told you it was a mysterious call that implied i was missing something of great importance lizs fork went back to work on her plate intriguing she said worth a followup kristins eyes implored boldt to forget the call but how could he dismiss it so easily to what call had the mysterious message referred he wondered a phone call a radio call indicating a crimescene investigation this latter thought held the most weight should he have to beg forgiveness to do his job correctly what kind of investigation he wondered who had called with the warning a person who knew or had access to his cell number a person who knew his innate curiosity liz suggested he take care of it follow up on the call love why do you think the microwave was invented he felt he owed it to kristin to finish dinner but what did he owe sanchez what about the importance of a fresh crime scene ill just quickly call downtown and find out whats up lambs good cold liz said without resentment her healing her new faith seemed to carry her through these situations husband to wife if i possibly can ill stay we know that liz answered do what you have to there had been a time in their marriage when such a situation would have condemned them to impossibly long hours of cold stares and failed communication sometimes a day or more of it he credited liz with the turnaround not himself her struggle with her health had been turned into something positive he knew in his heart of hearts had known forever that music was a gift from god knew this unquestionably it was only since the birth of his children and his wifes medically unexplained recovery from cancer that he saw himself on a slow road to the discovery that all of life was equally a godgiven gift and that it might do to credit the source from time to time she said ill keep a plate warm for you knowing he was going to leave if he made that call dont lock your bedroom door he said with that liz blushed and smiled and for lou boldt the whole room grew brighter with his left cheekbone virtually missing lieutenant rudy schock looked only remotely human he looked more like some sort of flesh balloon with what appeared to be a giant blood blister where his ear and neck should have been schocks left arm and hand had borne the brunt of his attempts at selfdefense his elbow was no longer capable of a right angle and his wrist hung limp and useless his breathing was long and slow lieutenant mickey phillipp had been the first struckwith a single blow to the base of the skull unconscious so that he lay in a pool of his own blood but otherwise didnt look as brutalized as his colleague the sight of the two injured officers turned boldts stomach he knew them both though not as close friends however tonight they felt like brothers boldt could feel his own rage building percolating dangerously near the surface no matter who had struck the blows boldt directly blamed mac krishevski and the sickout that had caused such dissension in the ranks this was no mugging that much seemed clear an emt said to boldt a little harder and this one was either dead or never walking again blunt object you got it both lieutenants mark heiman whispered softly from behind boldt heiman was himself a lieutenant who until a week earlier had been with narcotics such labels were gone now rank held little purpose anymore the alley was a block and a half from the cock amp bullan irish bar in the norwegian neighborhood of ballard seattle demographics the wet narrow lane between brick buildings owned a pair of dumpsters a teetering stack of discarded wooden pallets a dunkin donuts bag and a flattened mcdonalds fries carton oozing a sickly green mold that had once been potatoes the alley smelled sour with urine and faintly metallic from the spilled blood there was a lot of blood everywhere somebody saw this boldt suggested hopefully to heiman who was lead on the case other than the guy who did it returned heiman if true he hasnt come forward how do you see it boldt asked wondering how heimans report would read how i see it the other said is one thing a couple of lieus fifty yards from a major watering hole for the north precinct does the name krishevski mean anything to you he paused how i write it up robbery assault deadly force with intent to kill a mugging boldt stated dejectedly there was no other way to put it on paper but he suddenly wished he had reported his own attack so he might have established a pattern first sanchez then him now these two krishevski indeed without witnesses or further evidence heiman sounded apologetic how would you write it up a little defensive same way mark i hear you but were thinking along the same lines if im reading you right and maybe it might help you to know that someone took an aluminum louisville slugger to my shoulder and back two nights ago and that i passed on reporting it because i didnt want the paperwork heiman considered this pensively then why dont you look like the back of phillipps head rin tin tin a k on the other side of a neighbors fence hated the thing til it saved my life heiman fumed these guys are going to get a war if they dont watch out boldt nodded i said the same thing to shoswitz told him to pass it along to krishevski looking down at the paramedics trying to stabilize the fallen lieutenant he said but im thinking maybe the message didnt get through yeah well it better or ill deliver it myself youd have company there just say the word heiman suggested steady as she goes its what krishevski wants if he cant get us to join them hell get us suspended for conduct unbecoming and he wins either way is that what this is about he lights the fuse and watches as we selfimplode keep me up to speed will you boldt requested handing him a card with his cell phone number heiman returned the gesture while youre putting this to bed boldt said viewing the bloody landscape i think ill have a beer over at the cock and bull heiman understood the implications boldt was known on the force as a teetotaler chapter the cock and bull had been fashioned after an irish pub with low ceilings exposed beams low lighting it served up fifteen microbrewed and specialty beers on tap another sixty in the bottle fish and chips burgers and sixteenounce tbone steaks with idaho baked potatoes the place smelled of cigarettes hops and campfire charcoal irish music played a little loudly forcing patrons to shout lending the crowded pub a sense of celebration and revelry there was no explanation for the bars cops picked or the shortorder grills they frequented sometimes the connection seemed obviousan officers brother owned or managed the establishment or the proximity to a precinct house made it an obvious choice in the case of the cock amp bull a favorite haunt of the north precinct boldt thought it was probably the name of the place and the emphasis on beer a few heads turned as he entered then elbows nudged no one noticed that it was lou boldt they noticed a lieutenant from the west precinct two young waitresses ushered trays through the throng of lustful eyes and rude comments used to it a cop bar was part juniorhigh locker room part mortuary an uncomfortable blend of the morbid and the adolescent a pair of elevated color tvs at either end of the bar showed a stockcar race boldt attempted to contain his anger and rage at those in the room all blue fluers he wanted to drag one of them by the hair over to the alley and rub his face in the spilled blood to show all of them the eerie electronic silence of sanchezs hospital room he knew damn well there wasnt going to be much sympathy in this room for two assaulted officers and he had to wonder at how one week of absenteeism could change people so dramatically how some overtime pay could wipe out all signs of loyalty how could they go on drinking and telling jokes as if nothing had happened would a thorough search reveal a baseball bat in the truck of one of the cars parked out back had it come to that so quickly could the trust built via years of working side by side be cancelled out by the edict that there would be no more offduty work and the denial of overtime pay he found himself drawn to one particularly raucous group a dozen or more men crowded around a table like gamblers at a cock fight boldt edged up to the outside perimeter of this knot and caught the balding reddish tinge of a scalp he knew to be mac krishevski the guild president held court at the center explaining in a loud drunken voice the difference between the fuzz on a peach and a sixteenyearold girl and winning peals of laughter with the punch line licking the pit he and boldt met eyeskrishevskis glassy and excited boldts narrow and fierce dudley doright rides again krishevski said not averting his gaze weve got two lieutenants with their heads beaten in boldt announced he added disgustedly you guys arent celebrating that are you were aware of the situation lieutenant krishevski replied suddenly sober and theres not a man in this bar who isnt pulling for schock and phillipp so dont go suggesting otherwise if youve got business here state it otherwise find your own corner and let a fellow officer enjoy the camaraderie hes entitled to my business is to gather information useful to the investigation yes well im sure youll want to start at one end or the other and work the room certainly not in the middle he indicated their locationdead center in the bar if you have time between the tasteless jokes boldt said you might discuss amongst yourselves what you know about the incident tonight one of the drunker men said i know that by morning my heads gonna feel worse than theirs do now a couple of the others laughed but not krishevski who once again met eyes with boldt there was a flicker of recognition there a moment of understanding krishevski stood addressing the drunken man you want to joke about a fellow officers injuries you drink without me he moved to a different table where he was greeted like a general returning from the front boldt received a half dozen evil eyes from the men that krishevski deserted he turned and glanced around the room he hadnt taken a step before he felt himself the attention of someones stare he thought nothing of it realizing he was odd man out a working lieutenant in a den of strikers an officer based in the public safety building a world away from the north precinct but that burning sensation persisted and he looked to his right intent on staring down whoever was responsible john lamoia stared back at him from a corner booth boldt felt a chill had the phone call that had interrupted his dinner come from lamoia his former protege friend even lamoia stood and headed down a hallway toward the mens room boldt wanted to follow but resisted his sergeant had made no indication or signal whatsoever he thought it best to wait him out lamoia fit in at the cock amp bull the way the suspender set fit in at mccormicks and schmidts he was a man who moved seamlessly between the uniforms and the brass the meter maids and the sex crimes detectives the entrepreneurial friendtoall who always had an investment worth your making or a bet worth placing he navigated a thin line between snitches and interrogation rooms right and wrong never quite crossing into criminal behavior but always carrying a cloud of uncertainty in the wake of his swagger boldts cell phone rang he moved to the front of the bar and stepped back outside to answer it where he could hear lamoias voice spoke into boldts ear it would be natural for you to say hello to me lamoia said and when you do im going to be rude just so you know and now i know the marina out at palisades one hour ill be there boldt confirmed boldt put some effort into questioning unwilling and uncooperative officers reeling from their unwillingness to help him out but his heart wasnt really in it following that call from lamoia he wanted the hour over quickly and it wouldnt cooperate it dragged on like a sack of cement left out in the rain when he finally checked in with heiman reporting hed gained nothing from his interviews it felt as if the entire night had passed him by he was back in his car when his cell phone rang lou it was phil shoswitz got a minute you heard about schock and phillipp boldt asked i heard shoswitz confirmed but im delivering another message boldt attempted to clear his head knowing this had to be something of major importance on the occasion of their last meeting shoswitz had been questioning the very nature of their friendship im listening the chief is going for a stolen base hes facing the possibility of national guardsmen taking over his turf so hes gonna smoke a couple fastballs over the plate and hope to clean out the top of the lineup mention of the chief got boldts heart racing cleaning out the lineup didnt help matters what the hell he knew shoswitzs opinion of the newcomer and feared the worst but it was worse than even that what im telling you is youre not going to sleep tonightyoure gonna be on the phone to every goddamned officer of yours because those officers were mine not long ago and to a man theyre the best weve got and id hate to see you lose them lose them hes sending out something like a hundred health care personnel in the morning door to door to verify every officers claims of illness those that arent ill will be held in violation of the guild contract and will be terminated without pay and will forfeit all benefits including fourohone ks the static sat heavily on the open line the implications were enormous the chief would break the guild and restructure spd in a matter of hours boldt could foresee a string of lawsuits stretching out over years and a younger more vital police department for its newly installed chief with the guild broken he could negotiate new levels of pay and recruit from across the country possibly cutting a deal with king county police in the process and bringing the two departments under one roof oh my god boldt muttered into the phone your people have to report for tomorrows day tour lou or theyre thrown out of the game if he fires that many people its going to be molotov cocktails instead of blue bricks just dont let it be your people use the emergency calling tree weve got to drop all the animosities and get as many people back by tomorrow morning as possible amen and lou im calling from a pay phone because when the chief finds out this thing leaked hell be looking for a scapegoat for sure he wont appreciate some people being tipped off and others left to eat it but thats how it going to be no matter how hard we try theres no way well reach everyone by morning just so you know i wouldnt be making calls from my home or my cell he added the airport might work theyve got those business centers on a concourse i follow he sensed the man about to hang up and thanks phil what are friends for the line went dead palisades a marina and upscale restaurant hung off the south shore of the magnolia peninsula supported by pilings and enough docks to house several hundred pleasure craft all neat and shipshape and sparkling white under the lights teak and aluminum and enough fiberglass to wrap the city in a dome boldt appreciated the view of the skyline and lamoias choice of location the prices at the restaurant guaranteed they wouldnt run into fellow officers palisades was more for the professional set and gold card tourists boldt walked the docks drinking in the cool night air and charting the determined progress of the slowly moving cavalcade of lights from the state ferries he made out the mans distinctive silhouette from a distance bold confident even aggressive you wouldnt walk up to lamoia at night without knowing him boldt approached him in silence distant city lights reflecting in the silver black water a mirror image that looked like a giant glowing key or the mouth of a shark boldt felt an urgency to get this meeting over with and head to the pay phone if schock and phillipp hadnt had their blood shed he would have postponed the meet sorry about the cloak and dagger lamoia said boldt answered i appreciate the call we need to talk the two of them worked in concert to watch for anyone watching them an unspoken system that had one looking toward the restaurant the other searching the neighboring docks then switching assignments in a dance born of years of working the field together lamoia supplied many hands make light the work yeah boldt complained well im a little shorthanded thanks to you and the squad dont go forming stereotypes sarge you think im home watching chips reruns or something im working marias case boldts surprise registered on his shadowed face as confusion damn right figured a slouch like you could use a little help lamoia added im working all sorts of shit you dont wanna know about that much was probably true lamoias investigative approach was anything but conventional you have to come back on the job boldt informed him not only were lamoia and his wealth of contacts invaluable but shoswitzs news threatened the mans future with homicide dont look a gift horse im serious john the chief lamoia interrupted schock and phillipp had ron chapman under surveillance id lay odds on it chapman boldt questioned his thoughts jarred chapman swinging a baseball bat on a fellow officer not likely krishevski is property chapman is property but i dont see ron chapman doing big macs dirty work chapman hasnt even joined the flu that doesnt make sense im just telling you what i saw those boys were eyeing him thats a crowded bar john chapman doesnt hang at the bull i do sarge as much as i hang at the joke when youre on the ivories and chapmans out of place he stuck out tonight because everyone knows hes still on the job you could say he got a lukewarm receptionsame as you go on boldt continued to scan their surroundings ensuring they werent being watched it was no longer safe for one cop to talk to another he hated the way things were chapman came in looking for someone no doubt about it completely obvious schock and phillipp werent far behinda staggered entrance one through the front one through the back textbook shit phillipps a couple minutes behind his partner about as long as it takes to double park in an alley down the street if you hear what im saying im putting em on chapman on account thats the way i read it chapman wanders around craning his head this way and that gives it up and takes off bout as subtle as a whore at a tea party maybe he signaled someone maybe not im thinking schock hangs to maintain appearances phillipps out the back door a couple beats behind the mark im telling you sarge couple minutes later schock follows maybe he gets a call i didnt see that cant say but they dont make it far right and if thats a mugging then your bruises came from falling down stairs lamoia apparently had heard boldts inhouse explanation for his pains and aches not much sneaked past him the chief is sending health services door to door boldt explained what shoswitz had passed along to him its a bluff sarge shoswitz was supposed to leak it if im the chief uniforms are promoted to detective academy recruits whore past the threeweek mark head straight to patrol i keep the national guard out of my house lamoia looked a little more convinced you and your squad need to be back on the floor tomorrow before this hits the fan its the perfect bluff im telling you a couple lieus leak this and they get thirty forty percent of us back with nothing more than a phone call phil shoswitz was guild secretary whose side do you think hes on boldt said dont double guess this john the information is good we need to work the call tree and we need to do it tonight phil thinks we should avoid our home lines oh this is precious lamoia snorted and shook his head and looked boldt over trying to read him he asked tentatively you buy this boldt knew to leave it alone it was the only way to convince his obstinate sergeant as much as he wanted to argue his case he returned to lamoias reason for the meeting schock and phillipp are vice why are they sitting on a guy like chapman are they lamoia asked vice youre homicide sarge but are you at the moment one cop watching another what they got handed an ii internal investigations had been wiped out by the flu same as burglary it wasnt out of the question no matter how unlikely ii was a closed unita dreaded assignment but it only made sense that these investigations would have to continue in spite of the flu he considered this possibility we need to know who chapman was looking for saddled by obvious reservation lamoia informed boldt maria got hooked up to something first day of the flu sarge she wouldnt talk about itand we talked about everything i got pissed off partly cause she wouldnt talk partly because she wouldnt join us in the sickout basically sarge she threw me out next time i see her shes got her head screwed down to that bed ii boldt asked it might explain why she wouldnt discuss whatever it was lamoia suggested the unit operated under strict secrecy acts the explanation satisfied boldt lamoia added let me sniff out chapman you chat up maria about that case with me involved it would only get her pissed off again hispanics and temper sarge im telling you the call tree ill think about it thanks again for the call boldt repeated i would have missed that crime scene what are you talking about sarge the call putting me on to the assault the only call i made was from the bar lamoia said earlier boldt asked lamoia shook his head wasnt me boldts gut twisted who had wanted him to see two badly beaten officers and much more important why so he could help out with the investigation or as a warning of how close he had come to incurring the same fate chapter boldt placed the call from his cell phone disturbing phil shoswitz at home boldts former boss had the kind of contacts within the department that john lamoia had in the private sector lamoia could come up with any and all information on a suspect or witness be it financial taxrelated insurance or medical he had deep throatssources within institutions and industriesthat would have made government agents blush shoswitz had formed similar relationships within spdironically in large part due to his many years of guild serviceand had ways of turning gossip into hard fact he knew the scuttlebutt in the departments vehicle garage as well as the chiefs social calendar exactly as boldt needed recognizing boldts voice immediately shoswitz said youre supposed to be working that phone tree already in motion what about schock and phillipps condition boldt asked word is both are going to pull through although schock may lose the eye phillipp wont be completing any full sentences for a week or so but hell be back on the job shoswitz already had the full medical re ports on the two and understood boldt wanted this information first boldt said cautiously i need to know if they had drawn ii duty as a result of the flu i hear they may have followed a fellow officer into that bar i can ask around but i wont get confirmation lou not if its ii and that lack of confirmation will tell us what we need to know not necessarily i read this wrong phil blue on blue i was thinking we were getting roughed up in order to cut our numbers strengthen the effect of the flu and sure maybe a brick through a window some rookie pissed off his paycheck isnt coming in and drinking too much but assaults sanchez schock and phillipp he left himself out of it would we do that kind of damage to each other over guild politics dont underestimate what a desperate man will do shoswitz cautioned six months into a strike maybe but one week does that make sense and so carefully executed to look like muggings the things are textbook phil your point i could use a little help here boldt prodded ive got two vice cops poking around a bar and apparently following a property sergeant whats that about ill ask around shoswitz confirmed but if they were ii about the best well get is a denial well be working hunches is all i have another source i can work boldt told him sanchez may be able to fill in some of this i thought shes comatose so does everyone boldt said right now thats the one advantage ive got it was too late to visit sanchez at the hospital shed be medicated and fast asleep but it wasnt too late to grab onto a few limbs and start shaking the tree whoever had committed the assaults would have fresh blood to hide might even have defensive wounds to show for their efforts boldt called gaynes and matthews and caught them up on the assaults as well as shoswitzs alert about the surprise health inspections he put them onto the task of firing up the departmental phone tree and to start making calls gaynes rallied without complaint a soldier in the trenches daphne as ever ferreted out boldts true intentions to question ron chapman at his home she refused to allow him to go at it alone and informed him she was bringing a stun stick along as backup he knew better than to argue with her or to admit that hed welcome her company he picked her up at her houseboat and they drove to chapmans together using the drive time to prepare the two of you at this hour its not social chapman said shutting the door behind them he had made no effort to keep them out perhaps boldt thought he didnt want to eat alone little late for dinner isnt it ron chapman lived in a studio apartment with a partial view of pill hill he had the tv going and a stouffers microwave meal on a folding table in front of the rooms only chaira lazboy recliner hed been widowed several years earlier and the dust bugs and dirty windows confirmed a life of a man turned within to boldt the room felt sad and depressed crowded with too many snapshots of the late wife some people couldnt let go chapman suddenly struck him that way and boldt found it odd that his attitude about a man hed known for years could change with a single look inside that mans home if there had ever been joy here it now rested in the urn that held his wifes ashes chapman didnt offer them seats in part because the only two chairs were at a small table that framed the galley kitchens doorway and there didnt seem to be any more room for them elsewhere little late for a house call isnt it lieutenant strange times these you hear about schock and phillipp rudy schock daphne said calmly they were assaulted tonight not far from the cock and bull boldt supplied ron chapman carried an extra thirty or forty pounds on his irish bulldog looks it wasnt easy for such soft flesh to remain so absolutely still then at once he returned to his dinner like a dog to its bone you were at the cock and bull tonight ronnie whats that about a guy cant buy himself a drink chapman complained working on the dinner in the small plastic tray since when what do schock and phillipp mean to you the man glanced up as hot as his prepared dinner who says they mean anything why play games boldt asked are you into something here tell me im wrong youre wrong convince me boldt said ive got my dinner to eat daphne asked are you afraid of them chapman stiffened she clarified im not talking about schock and phillipp im talking about whoever did that to them are you afraid of those people he wouldnt look up from his food way i heard it they were mugged a street assault why should i be afraid of that their bad luck is all she said you dont have to swing the baseball bat to be guilty of assault theres conspiracy theres intent you want to think about that boldt said next to narcotics property is probably easily the most tempting duty of all of em you guys are carefully handpicked doesnt mean temptation doesnt win out now and then theres a heck of a lot of goods on those shelves theres cash on those shelves chapman said jewels weapons and as far as i know its all still there lieutenant go ahead and check you came to that bar looking for someone two officers right behind you were assaulted what if i told you they were following up on a case that was being worked by sanchez just before her assault daphne turned her attention to boldt angry at not having been included in on this chapman wouldnt take his head out of his dinner boldt said maybe ive got it wrong maybe you were doing a favor for schock or phillipp wearing a wire making a contact it wasnt like that the man objected heatedly fork in midair daphne picked up on boldts lead the rumor mill is brutal she said you cant do something like that to me label me a squirrel for ii he thought this over and flushed its not funny lieutenant especially not the way things are going right now lets take you out of the equation ron thats what im suggesting lets put schock and phillipp working the cock and bullit isnt their usual bar or yours either ron he let this sink in theyre looking to work someone that leaves me asking who who in your opinion might they have been looking for up there i know what youre asking chapman said and you got this all tangled up so help me untangle it i was in for a drink is all and schock and phillipp a drink as well i didnt talk to them wouldnt know sergeant daphne said calmly youve stayed on through the blue flu precious few others have been so bold as to do so if you hadnt stayed on others whove never worked property would have been assigned to that duty but you stayed one could almost imagine youre protecting property from outside eyes and now these assaults sanchez schock and phillipp someone even showed up in lieutenant boldts backyard uninvited you want to talk about mistakes that was a mistake you know the lieutenants reputation as an investigator do you think hes going to let this go four brutal assaults you two do what you have to you come to whatever it is by yourselves chapman suggested leave me out of this boldt craned forward but then there is something right ron something to leave you out of youre tangling this all up boldt repeated slowly so help me untangle it dinners getting cold daphne said we can be convinced otherwise tell us it was schock and phillipp doing the dirty work tell us they pursued you into that bar what do they have on you what do you have on them id like it if you left now the man said daphne stepped closer to chapman boldt admired her technique hes property lou there have to be people who owe him favors to the subject she said is covering for someone the right way to play this its not like that chapman shouted now leave twenty minutes later boldt pulled the chevy to a stop at the end of the dock that led to daphnes lake union houseboat he escorted daphne to her front door he wasnt going to add her to the list of assaults so we know chapmans caught up in something the psychologist said yes we do but not what nor to what degree no so whats next i go back to john for an update you start working the phone tree we save as many people as we can before the axe falls and if john has something youll call your linell be busy he said from all that calling youll be doing lou for a moment the connection between them was everything and he had to remind himself of icaruss perilous journey too close to the sun or that even the most loyal husband remained subject to the laws of gravity they paused at the front door to her houseboat and for one awkward moment it felt to him as if they might kiss then he turned and left john lamoia lived on the third floor of a waterfront loft that thirteen years earlier had been a drug lab in the heart of a gangcontrolled neighborhood the lab had been busted by police including a wetbehindtheears patrolman who when the raid was concluded noted the spectacular view on the other side of the paintedover windows lamoia had never forgotten that view nor the neighborhood because of the repeated radio calls taking him there disruptions street wars stabbings he bought low well ahead of the gentrification that followed restored the interior installed security and scraped the paint off the windows so that now he commanded views of the waterfrontthe piers and tourist restaurants on alaskan wayas well as elliott bays sublime graygreen waters and the whitecapped peaks of the olympics beyond it wasnt often that a bluecollar policeman like lamoia celebrated a capital gains cut but when congress voted a lowering of the surcharge to twenty percent john lamoia threw a beer bash for fifty of his closest friendsmostly women boldt stepped inside and lamoia threw a lock behind him it clicked into place with authority he caught him up on the chapman visit i wanted to go back over what you saw at the bar before you went to bed and lost the immediacy of the moment worried my memory will slip that sounds like something matthews would say lamoia countered does it boldt questioned distractedeven disturbedby the comment the flu boldt said apologetically has thrown us together round the clock you know how it is lamoia said hey i was just teasing sarge lets go back over who was there tonight at the cock and bull boldt said sarge its a pub probably a hundred of us in there all unemployed cops you expect me to recite the roll call boldt interrupted anyone from property at the bar property chapman clammed up but he grew all nervous when i pointed out he didnt belong in that pub daphne and i are thinking weve got this one wrong what if schock and phillipp were into something ron chapman found out about something inside property lamoia said connecting the dots he nodded i suppose it could fall that way couldnt it what about maria and the possible ii connection tomorrow morning boldt said tonight we deal with the assaults while the bloods still fresh lamoia squinted his eyes shut when boldt had first started working with him lamoia had been a smoothfaced young loudmouth smart but a little too sure of himself now the face showed ten years of rough road and though the mouth still broadcast his unparalleled selfconfidence the eyes revealed a more practical sea soned man what i remember he said squinting ever more tightly in terms of property is that pendegrass and some of them guys were whooping it up over the racea nascar qualifying heaton account i was trying to hear about this unscheduled pit stop and i couldnt hear nothing because of their racket and im trying to think now but i gotta put chapmans arrival right about then maybe i looked up and caught sight of him or something you know maybe i had this little brain fart on account chapmans still active and im thinking it was gonna be him getting the shit beat out of him and how im not gonna let something like that happen and what a pain in the ass it was going to be for all concerned and then im thinking how stupid it is for chapman to show his face at the bull you know and then im wondering if maybe he took a brick the way you did because theres been more of that you know and so maybe hes showing up pissed off and ready to settle the score or something and that kinda leans me away from wanting to help him out too much i mean if a guy is stupid enough to walk into a room like that maybe its darwins law that he get the living shit beat out of him but the point is the pit stop was something to do with communications radio problems between the crew and the driver and they didnt want to get into the final third of the race without communication john which means i heard the explanation sarge get it i heard the guy explaining the pit stop which means that chuck pendegrass and his riot squad had either shut up cut out or all gone to take a piss at the same time which is technically impossible on account the mens room is only one urinal and a crapper and there must have been three or four of them over there hooting it up he repeated i got a hunch pendegrass split the minute chapman walked through that door and let me just say that he and his buddies did not impress me as being ready to leave a few minutes before that when chapman arrived or schock and phillipp boldt pressed you got me there maybe it was a minute later but chapman didnt speak to pendegrass i cant say one way or another maybe pendegrass shut up when he saw chapman same way chapman caught my eye he added chapman caught a lot of people by surprise sarge so pendegrass left when no clue they could have talked boldt theorized for that matter they could have simply made eye contact some kind of visual we dont even know that chapman came looking for pendegrass lamoia reminded him no boldt agreed but we could ask him yes we could at that lamoia replied collecting his coat off the back of a chair doesnt chuck pendegrass have a boy about ten tanner lamoia answered knowingly but whats that about nothing boldt said but inside he was thinking that ten was a good age for little league and aluminum baseball bats before lamoia knocked on the front door of the gray house he said to boldt i hate this shit cop on cop i dont even want to think it much less confirm it we dont know that thats what weve got boldt said sanchez could have been a burglary gone wrong she could have nothing to do with schock and phillipp probably totally unrelated then what the hell are we doing here sarge ill tell you what boredom does weird things to people lamoia tugged at the sleeve of his deerskin jacket this rains a bitch thats the wrong coat for seattle ive been telling you that for a couple years now they make chamois out of deerskin sarge doesnt hurt the jacket jacket doesnt stop the rain boldt said cant have everything pendegrass met the front door himself his face enmeshed in a threeday beard already in a snarl his hair was wet his eyes rheumy dont want any he stepped back intending to shut the door on them lamoia slipped the toe of his cowboy boot up onto the jamb ive seen this done in movies he said giving pendegrass his best pepsodent smile a pair of detectives got hurt tonight boldt said is that right thought you might tell us what you know lamoia added maybe out of the rain pass pendegrass eyed the detective since when are you back on the job since schock and phillipp took an ambulance ride lamoia answered you ever heard of loyalty to the badge we could use some help boldt said suspecting the man had an alibi in place you saying im a suspect in this assault a suspect lamoia glanced at boldt as if this was the furthest thing from his mind we were thinking witness lamoia explained you and i were both down to the cock and bull earlier tonight boldt chimed in and lamoia didnt catch a whole hell of a lot of what was going down but he remembered you were there i bet he did pendegrass said cautiously eyeing the detective and by the way get your foot outta my door maybe you saw something someone boldt said and dont even realize its importance there were a whole lot of someones at the bull tonight lieutenant ron chapman showed up boldt said is that right lamoia ventured that would be about when you left were thinking baseball bat or pipe boldt added catching the mans eye nightstick maybe lamoia said reminding pendegrass of a possible police connection you mind if we come in and talk about it boldt asked a rivulet of rainwater running down his neck im home sick lieutenant in case you forgot not a real good time for me your name will never get mentioned even so ill pass lamoia complained all we need is five minutes on what you maybe did or did not see in that bar right you know the drill thats right i do he added i can crush your foot in the door if youd prefer lamoia left his boot there pendegrass looked pretty drunk the longer he stood there the more apparent it was he was known as a mean drunk boldt didnt want this degenerating into a rumble drunk cops like pendegrass loved a chance to fight and lamoia always seemed to find his way into the middle of such things you werent too sick to visit the cock and bull boldt reminded him a medicinal visit chuck a womans voice called out from inside the house distracting the man who is it honey you were there lamoia said during the time in question you left around the time chapman arrived which was only minutes before schock and phillipp youre jamming us up here chuck you see that you see the way its gonna look you not wanting to talk in the right place and the right time so you didnt see nothing you heard something maybe like a head getting cracked open or someone in some kind of pain boldt wanted to take advantage of the mans apparent drunken vulnerability not give him the chance to sober up and rethink his answers wed like to do this tonight now he said strongly you know how it is when a witness avoids you or delays you these are fellow officers who got hurt chuck we want to clear this one before the morning news ill bet before john q public pressures city hall to cave in on this sickout politics boldt gasped you think were playing politics do whatever it is you boys gotta do but this here aint happening no way weve got two brothers down you know lamoia repeated and your not talking aint right no matter how you slice it dont matter what you think of phillipp and schock it aint right chuck the woman called out again she rounded the corner and approached the door wearing a perplexed expression she was small and mousy her hair a mess chuck its raining these men are standing in the rain john lamoia isnt it she said to the sergeant every woman associated with the department knew lamoias face and lieutenant boldt lamoia said extending his hand chuck she said her concern obvious theyre standing out in the rain no theyre leaving pendegrass said meeting eyes with boldt boldt took his best shot at the woman the background sound had taken him a minute to identify funny time of night to be doing a load of laundry she clearly didnt appreciate the tone of his comment chuck brings back that cigarette smell and its straight into the machine for the clothes and into the shower for him one of the few laws around here that i made up boldt caught sight of the studio shot of the two kids hanging on the wall as the woman pulled the door open further he said does your son own a baseball bat mrs pendegrass whose doesnt pendegrass asked he shifted his weight preparing to shut the front door boot toe or no boot toe as he did he offered boldt a glimpse of the stairway climbing to the homes second floor and sitting on one of the steps a pair of anklehigh hiking boots bearing the nike logo he wondered if there might be a slight tear in the nylon above the side logo boldt had seen a similar nike logo at pointblank range while lying face down in his driveway pendegrass elbowed his wife out of the way kicked lamoias boot clear and slammed the front door shut on the way back to the car boldt said im starting to think if we searched his closets or his locker downtown or the trunk of his car that maybe wed find a baseball bat or a balaclava boldt said and that might begin to make sense of things eggplant whats with that lamoia asked naively or is balaclava one of those greek desserts boldt dismissed the mans ignorance hes on krishevskis squad right right as rain so maybe thats all we need to know they ducked through the downpour and ran for the parked car lamoia calling out loudly and complaining about how much he loved his deerskin jacket chapter youre being awfully quiet daphne said stung by the irony of the prominently displayed sign that reminded hospital visitors to keep silent the morning routines kept the corridors busier than on their previous visits doctors were doing their rounds med students in tow nurses and orderlies seemed harried and overworked thinking boldt replied about last nights assaults she completed for him pendegrass is a loyalist hell do whatever krishevski asks youre the staff psychologist you know theres a thin line between cop and criminal from what you told me his wifes explanations made sense tell me how that connects to krishevski you didnt see his eyes his attitude pendegrass riordenkrishevskis boys down in propertythey all ride in the back of the bus it doesnt mean they cracked open a couple of heads but they could have he said he needed answers he still believed sanchez the best source for those answers the rentacop security guard on sanchezs hospital room recognized matthews and boldt daphne led the way through the door it warned of oxygen in use but boldt thought they might post other cautions as well this womans assault seemed to be tearing at the fabric of spds integrity implicating misplaced loyalties to labor unions and dissolving the bonds between fellow officers he came to find out if sanchez had worked an internal investigation prior to her being found tied to her bed with her neck cracked he came hoping that her assault was nothing but a burglary gone bad without confirmation otherwise this was how the case had to be investigated it was rare for him to enter an interrogation desiring his hunches and instincts to be proved wrong but that was exactly what he felt as he stepped into the room and looked over at the paralyzed woman lying in the bed sanchezs haunting eyes had come to plague boldt pleading silent saddened a young vital woman had been sacrificed maria sanchez was trappedher spirit was confined to a body that would not release her within the next few days or weeks surgeons would apparently know if her surgery would reconnect this woman to the life she had previously known we know this is difficult for you officer daphne began after greeting her the reference to the patients rank was intentional they needed the participation of a policewoman they needed honest difficult answers weve had several important developments in the case boldt informed her her eyelids shut with some difficulty and as they opened her dark brown irises fo cused intently on boldt whose voice caught as he said some questions wed like to ask you her eyes shut and then reopened again her pupils fixed to the right yes came the womans answer she seemed worse today than the last time hed seen her he reeled there have been two more assaults daphne said stepping closer to boldt at the foot of the bed to make it easier on the patient both officers both badly off the eyelids shut boldt said there seems to be the possibility of a connection that we would prefer not to face but face it we must our primary interest remains this burglar especially in your case where your possessions went missing were pursuing all relevant leads but unfortunately another possibility has raised its ugly head that these assaults on officers my own included have to do with an ii investigation that this investigation whatever it is or was is the common thread weve been missing and thats why were here daphne said boldt said cautiously sometimes the system itself can stand in an officers way we need answers and were not getting them from upstairs we need your help when her eyes opened this time they aimed to the right yes prior to your assault boldt began were you involved in an internal investigation her eyes fluttered shut and remained so please maria daphne pleaded yes came the answer boldt experienced a combination of relief and anxiety sanchez had been working an ii prior to her burglary assault a dozen questions danced on the tip of his tongue did the investigation involve property he asked she stared at the ceiling unable or unwilling to answer boldt wondered krishevski boldt asked quickly for his suspicions remained with the property sergeant the ceiling but he thought she struggled not to answer pendegrass the ceiling perhaps she was overmedicated he thought chapman her eyelids fluttered she squeezed them shut tightly when they reopened she stared at the ceiling maria a frustrated boldt pleaded please youre the only one who can answer these questions he allowed this to sink in do you believe someone anyonefrom property was involved in your assault he asked this with as little emotion as he could summon and yet his own convictions surfaced no replied the injured woman daphne glanced at boldtsanchezs first definite answer took property out of the assault a part of him felt satisfied he could focus on the burglary and let others turn over the rocksif those rocks even existed but chapmans anxiety the night before remained in the forefront of his thoughts and cautioned against accepting sanchezs answers do you believe your assault was related in any way to your ii case daphne inquired again she stared at the ceiling boldts frustration built maria we have two more officers in this hospital this morning we have suspicious movements from officers in property we have far more questions than answers and youre apparently one of the few people who knows whats going on i know its asking a lottoo much evenbut please help us out here her eyes shone a tear escaped down her cheek weve upset you daphne apologized to the woman are you avoiding answers maria because we are not ii not directly your superiors on this case yes somehow those eyes shouted again maria stared at the ceiling tears running but we want to help an exasperated boldt pleaded daphne repeated softly do you think your assault might be connected to your ii case her eyes shut and reopened yes she replied now staring directly at boldt daphne looked across to a relieved boldt and said we need this burglar in custody if he can give us an alibi for the night of her assault then maybe that would be enough to take a good long look at whatever case she was working boldt interrupted the secrecy surrounding ii cases was notoriously impossible to crack he said youre right about the order of thingsthis burglar just might become our star witness chapter anthony brumewell caught a glimpse of himself in the drivers side mirror as the garage door flipped shut electronically and he stepped out into his garage working nights was not his thing he felt exhausted he entered the homes small kitchen dumped his briefcase onto a kitchen chair and headed straight for the refrigerator and a coors lite he yanked down a jar of dryroasted peanuts popped off the yellow plastic lid and spilled out a handful he blindly reached over for the tvs remote and came up empty when he turned toward the tv itself he realized there was no remote control because there was no tv and that was when the first pang of dread overcame him what the hell he wondered his mind fishing for a recollection that might explain its absence he dropped the beer can on the counter the peanuts spilled like pebbles onto the floor and his heart raced furiously the television had been stolen he realized now was someone still inside the house he panicked he picked up the wall phone no dial tone hello it was off the hook somewhere else there were two other phones one in the living room one in the bedroom he scrambled to get out of the house only then did he notice his home security box had been smashed up terrified now brumewell hurried back out to the garage and into the safety of his car he locked the car doors tripped the garage door to open turned the key and shoved the car into reverse knocking a mirror off in the process he reached for the car phone already stabbing the three numbers he had never before dialed chapter another breakin boldt contacted the brumewell crime scene by cell phone and uncharacteristically drove over the speed limit to get there phil shoswitz had caught him while he was on his way to the jamersons for breakfast shoswitzs burglary unit had drawn the investigation on a chaotic morning when nearly nine hundred officersout of the eleven hundred who had walked outhad returned to work unexpectedly the media was camped in the lobby of public safety making a zoo out of the place the victimthe owner of the housewas waiting for their arrival the radio led with breaking news that the strike had been broken by a tough stance from the new chief rumors and stories abounded without asking if the victims home had a garage boldt requested that the garages clicker be waiting for him sid had not yet arrived the sunrise had brought rain then sunshine now rain againlike boldt it couldnt make up its mind there had been no assault and therefore no detective initially assigned it was only through the diligent eye of a dispatcher that shoswitz had been notified at all with flutime burglaries at an alltime high and low on spds priority list anthony brumewell might have been missed by the radar entirely boldt intentionally blocked the short driveway with the cavalier sunshine again he hoped it might hold he didnt want sid pulling their van in there as they had at the sanchez crime scene cleanliness was next to godliness at a crime scene the patrolman said ive got the owner in the front seat of the cruiser if you want to later boldt said accepting the clicker from the man take down his statement officer mallory no editorials just let him talk youve got five to ten minutes yes sir if the press shows up you keep them away from him you got that got it sid waits outside as well anyone entering while the captain and i are inside will be chalking tires that includes you officer mallory you want me you page me dispatch has the number the officer nodded but looked a shade or two paler than a moment earlier he took off as shoswitz caught up boldt pressed the clicker and the garage door opened out and up reminding boldt of a mouth of a tomb he handed shoswitz a pair of latex gloves you ready captain shoswitz rubbed his elbow violently boldt took that as a yes brumewells garage was crowded though not cluttered with collapsible lawn furniture and rusted garden tools hanging from nails on the wall boldt and shoswitz steered their way clear and then boldt tripped the clicker he held in his hand the garage door slowly closing whats with your interest in the garage shoswitz asked point of entry boldt answered deadbolted homes phil it took us a while to see the common denominator our boy clones the garage door clickers probably by hanging around nearby and picking up frequencies i had someone looking for a name for us but i havent heard from him so i suspect weve drawn a blank my guys didnt have this garage thing shoswitz queried a little troubled neither did i phil sanchez gets the credit on this one they entered the kitchen boldt speculated my guess is that the burglar takes only one big risk he backs his van into the victims garage in broad daylight and then shuts the door if he pulls that off cleanly hes home free probably carries a policeband scanner with him if its me i put the scanner in a pocket and an earpiece in one ear if i hear this address called in im gone otherwise once hes inside hes inside shoswitz followed boldt out of the kitchen and into a living area where several vacant spaces on shelves marked some of the stolen electronics a cable tv box sat on a tables empty surface a vcr untouched my guys didnt get this a frustrated captain repeated not important boldt said it is to me you made inquires about an ii connection first thing but the chances ill hear back i know boldt interrupted boldt had greeted lamoias return to the fifth floor by dumping a copy of all eleven burglaries on his desk and ordering him to use his contacts in the private sector to look for possible insurance fraud standing in brumewells living room he made notes about the missing electronics clean job shoswitz said its no junkie thats for sure the comment triggered a thought and boldt dropped to his knees searching the area behind the cabinet that had held the tv shoswitz followed obediently also dropping to the carpet a moment later he asked sheepishly what exactly are we looking for lou boldt stretched squeezing his arm between the cabinet and wall as he touched the object his mind leaped ahead wondering where pendegrass and chapman fit in and if hed ever prove a connection between these men and the assaults this he said suddenly jubilant pinched between his latexgloved fingers he held a white plastic wiretie chapter the noon news carried a plea from krishevski to the mayor to drop the hardball tactics and allow police officers to once again take their place protecting and serving the city of seattle but it proved too little too late the mayor had played his cardhealth services had invalidated dozens of sick leaves and officers were being fired from the force krishevski attempted to turn schock and phillipp into martyrs claiming that inexperienced officers promoted prematurely by the chief with the mayors blessing had failed to support the detectives and that the chief should be held directly responsible for their injuries the pressure failed in a press release the mayor announced that the two hundred and twelve firings were not under reconsideration that health services had determined that these officers claiming sick leave had been perfectly capable of serving their city and had lost the publics trust causing permanent damage to the reputation of all city employees and services krishevski it was announced was himself fired and the mayor announced he would no longer be considered president of the guild as this position according to charter had to be held by an active police officer viewed as nothing more than a negotiating position the nature of krishevskis status remained in question a compromise seemed inevitable the cost to both sidespolitically and economicallyhad not yet been calculated you look awful lamoia told boldt upon entering the mans office but this he said indicating the busy fifth floor this is beautiful the floor teemed with activity partially trained cadets promoted to uniform uniforms to plainclothes boldt complained its a circus no one knows what the hell theyre doing and theyre all acting like they won the lottery for christs sake beggars cant be choosers lamoia said you wanted it over sarge krishevski will be gone by the end of the day everyone wanted this thing over once youve seen all the seinfelds twice i feel more like a schoolteacher than a lieutenant lamoia grinned and said we got more members of our unit back than any other division thats what i hear thirteen shields out of seventeen disappointed he had wanted them all back yeah well those other four poor poor pitiful them he said intentionally misquoting a warren zevon song lamoia was zevons biggest fan boldt recognized that cocky grin of lamoias with no less than a dozen active cases on the desks of every returning detective including his sergeants this wasnt a social call so give it up boldt suggested i made some calls the man confirmed proudly it isnt insurance fraud lamoia said knowingly disappointing his boss and i tried everything i could think of in terms of trying to connect the vics to each other in terms of trying to determine how our boy is picking them as targets their finances came up blank no overlaps i could see mind you its a quick pass and not all my calls have been returned there may still be something there a gas station they all used a department store some one place they all shared in common then why that look boldt asked what look lamoia asked offering the look again are you going to chortle over there all day or you going to tell me what you have who says i have anything john its not exactly convincing evidence sarge its a connection is all he added confidently teasing the man sure maybe even the connection were looking for but not something you can take to shoswitz or hill boldt elected not to speak not to engage the man lamoia would drag this out as long as he could would make boldt beg if possible the silent treatment boldt said nothing he offered only a lazyeyed stare okay okay you wanted me to work the insurance angle so i did like you asked a decent idea worth pursuing but it came back blank as i said zip zero and then i catch the unexpected and im thinking well maybe not exactly zero he waited for boldt to react but the man remained as patient as a fisherman at that point it became a contest and boldt finally gave in caught what lucky as hell i did catch it because it wasnt anything i was looking for you know you know how that is sarge youre looking so damned hard for that missing red shoe that you overlook something way more important something right there in front of you a knife a gun i dont know john a name is all lamoia said of the nine burglary vics three of them had switched their household policies in the weeks prior to the breakins all three to the same company consolidated mutual boldt sat forward three of the nine had switched insurance carriers thats what im saying yes new policies yes bigger policies no not a one of them its not that lamoia said its not fraudits just that switch a salesman maybe door to door boldt speculated he gets a look inside he picks his targets more what i was thinking yes lamoia said maybe hes in as partners maybe just sells the info to our burglar and lets him take it from there but its a connection something that ties one to the other and either way weve got to chat up this company consolidated mutual boldt repeated not actually lamoia corrected something called newmann communications theyre out of denver boldt scribbled down the name he knew that look lamoia had rolled over a large rock our problem is that it never showed up on any of the burglary reports lamoia stated obliquely again boldt waited him out rather than feed the flames lamoia asked you spoke to this helen brooksgilman sarge and to kawamoto did either happen to mention a pair of free movie tickets boldt asked sarcastically are you on some kind of medication how about phone solicitations brooksgilman had in fact mentioned phone solicitations though it had been nothing more than a denigrating comment about the intrusion upon their privacy shed said something about how those were the people who should be arrested he thought he also recalled kawamoto saying something similar to him phone solicitations boldt queried you check the phone logs at newmann communications my guess is youll find out that thats what all the burglary victims shared in common they all received phone solicitations from newmann several chose to up their insurance coverage others cashed in on free movie tickets its the linkage sarge its how they were targeted so tell me what youre really thinking lamoia said crossing his arms and leaning back tell me how fucking great it is to have me back on the job chapter squeezed by seattles prosecuting attorney newmann communications found itself facing the possibility of a federal investigation into interstate fraud if it failed to cooperate with seattle pd with the sanchez case still belonging to matthews she and boldt were dispatched to denver to confirm the role of a phone solicitation campaign in the string of burglaries and if possible identify the particular employee responsible for tipping off the burglar back in seattle on which homes to hit hoping they might accomplish the task in a single day both boldt and matthews nonetheless packed overnight bags and booked hotel rooms believing two or even three days more likely police work rarely went off like clockwork newmann communications occupied a fouroffice suite in a mudcolored cement block building that housed kspk a conservative talk radio station and irvings red hots a diner featuring hot dogs the sausage odors fouled the building the employment flyers in the firms reception lobbya room that reminded boldt of a department store changing roomgave away its gameearn money while staying at home internet opportunities retail management adult entertainment printed on green construction paper the small flyers fit well in the human palmperfect as handouts on downtown sidewalks and college campuses phillip rathborne listed presidentceo on his office door the oily scalp bad complexion and knockoff armani suit suggested a man in his forties or early fifties but the degree on the wall from north florida junior college put his graduation just six years earlier meaning he had not yet crossed thirty the office tried too hard to imply money but reminded boldt instead of a room found in a truck stop motel with a heartshaped bath the clock phone and desk lamp had been bought through the sharper image catalog but the desk was granite veneer chipped at the edges and the jungle plant in the corner needed a serious vacuuming the computer looked authenticits monitor screen was large enough to be a window something the office lacked the screen saver played images of fairways at pebble beach and augusta boldt was all business you received a call from the colorado department of justice he began boldt had called the office and had been informed that the count had increased seven of the nine burglary victims recalled the phone solicitation offering free movie tickets and had accepted the offer lawsuits seemed certain to follow newmann communications could anticipate leniency in return for cooperation boldt expected nothing less i did rathborne confirmed the man seemed preoccupied with daphnes silence and her intense beauty a common enough occurrence useful to interrogations her looks could be used as a means of distraction she wore a scarf to hide the neck scar where a knife had cut her a few years before and a blouse buttoned to the top the less skin the betterunless she needed something from someone her job this time around was to play the silent powerful type when she finally chose to speak she would be the more difficult of the two leaving rathborne surprised that ice could flow from such heat and they suggested you cooperate they did the man had the annoying habit of wincing or grinning after every comment expressions that somehow did not belong on his face like those obscene reproductions of the mona lisa that change the smile you run paypercall numbers out of here boldt said indicating the flyer in his hand area code nine hundred numbers he wanted the man on his heels wanted him thinking in the wrong direction stroke lines adult entertainment all perfectly legal i dont see any phone banks the beauty of technology lieutenant our sales representatives operate out of their own homes for the most part through a computerized switching terminal we receive and reroute all calls college coeds boldt asked housewives mostly he waited for boldts shock to register the woman moaning on the other end of the phone is doing her ironing in front of the television half the time cooking dinner playing solitaire on the computer its all about role playing lieutenant the men call to be turned on and to hear what they dont hear at home at eight dollars a minute boldt pointed out supply and demand and the internet site a repulsed boldt inquired some soft porn shots he said directing this at daphne to get the juices going our nine hundred numbers are promoted there someone wants to hear a human voice for a credit card number the photos go video and get a hell of a lot hotter we grossed sixty thousand last fiscal quarter off the site alone wave of the future the pantheon theater group daphne asked we handle a wide range of telemarketing needs for our corporate customers special promotions like the consolidatedpantheon campaign travel reservations catalog sales our rate sheet is typically about forty percent less than our competitors and our service just as good if not better keeps business brisk lower labor costs she asked look around low overhead translates to customer savings housewives again rathborne affected that same grimace telemarketing campaigns are much more difficult to facilitate because of the need for networked computers and a shared database if we used isolated individuals for the telemarketing the technology requirements would kill us no we subcontract in the case of consolidated theyre working strictly off demographics the computers target households based on income and real estate value the sales rep sees a name phone number and address on his or her screen its slick consolidated insurance owns the pantheon theater chain theyve installed these new electronic ticket kiosks nationally and wanted to use this campaign as a synergistic way to introduce their targeted insurance sales customers to their theater chain simultaneously it was my idea actually and weve hit a home run im happy to say subcontract daphne pressed to whom the justice department didnt tell you rathborne asked boldt i assumed that was why you were here youre washington state right i thought you were looking to model our system out there in washington something like that the state benefits as much as we do daphne said nothing like that were crimes against persons were working an assault investigation now wait a minute here the man objected slipping out of his corporate image no one said anything about this i was told youd have some questions for me about the consolidated mutual campaign the man said i assumed we have no intention of charging you boldt said quickly nor anyone else at newmann communications its more than likely one or two of your employeesthese subcontracted sales repsthat were interested in daphne suggested you may have a bad apple another waft of frankfurterandmustard invaded the space boldt felt sick to his stomach he clarified we would like to speak to this subcontractor you put us in touch with him and were out of here daphne repeated we have no intention of involving your company in any of this as long as you cooperate its all about labor coststhis business all about putting people on one end of a telephone the automated programs suck and denver in this boom you try finding people willing to work on commission daphne inquired what are you trying to tell us all we need is the name of the subcontractor on the consolidated insurance campaign i dont understand why they didnt tell you when you talked to them an irritated rathborne said weve used them for three years now never once had a problem when we talked to whom daphne pressed consolidated passed us on to you no not consolidated the justice department should have told your guys we use correctional facilities state prisons inmates rathborne explained our subcontractor for all our telemarketing campaigns is the colorado correctional services inmates boldt mumbled stunned by the announcement daphne clarified you have inmates making your phone solicitations rathborne replied not without some pride technically its part of their rehabilitation chapter a sunset flaring red beyond the continental divide boldt drove the rental through the third guarded entrance to the privately owned prison coils of razor wire sitting atop the twentyfivefoot chainlink fence the facilitys outer wall rose thirty feet high its masonry block connecting the four heavily armed guard towers the middle fence which was nearly invisible carried high voltage warnings on large red and yellow signs the facilitys physical plantowned and operated by the etheredge corporationhoused both maximum and medium detention units with separate visitor entrances one of a dozen such compounds nationally all built and managed by private companies the correctional services contracted back to the state and were paid for by tax dollars etheredge corporation traded on the nasdaq prisoners for profit daphne read from a photocopy of a twoyearold article found in the downtown denver library keep reading boldt said he had timed their visit to the facility purposefully knowing that the telemarketing would likely be under way in the evening when the callers could catch families at dinner or watching tv she read on the public had been outraged the politicians impressed by the prospect of reducing corrections costs unsubstantiated charges accused unnamed state representatives of taking bribes for pushing the private corrections concept through the state legislature with three such private facilities operating in colorado and two more under construction the point seemed moot nevada had four idaho two the federal government was getting into the act corrections had gone private boldt and matthews intended to play on the fact that washington state had a similar proposal on a referendum that was scheduled for the fall election boldt found a parking space reserved for visitors a sign reminded them to lock the car and take the keys corrections in private hands had gone high tech electronically keyed gates requiring both a guards handprint and the swipe of a creditcardsize magnetic key permitted access to various areas of the mediumsecurity facility the floor plan was an octagonal layout that placed the only guard station in a center hub allowing unobstructed views of every cell video surveillance infrared sensors and electronic lojacks secured around the ankle of every prisoner rounded out the cuttingedge security technology evidently colorado could not afford to build such an elaborate facility and yet could pay the forty thousand dollars per year to house each prisoner boldt had not approached etheredge corporation on his own knowing full well that no privately held company would appreciate law enforcement discovering a fault with their business plan instead he had used a friend in washington state corrections to make the introductory call for them alleging that a pair of detectives on a factfinding mission to colorado were interested in touring etheredges jefferson county corrections facility and citing in particular the medium securitys socalled private commerce program etheredge executives aware of the impending referendum in washington state saw a potential client boldt and daphne were greeted by the facilitys managing directorits wardenfortyfive with closecropped hair and a steely glint to his eye two administrative assistants both men in their midthirties reminded boldt of army or marines corporations knew where to recruit impressive boldt said indicating the security through which he and daphne had just passed the warden a talker a salesman went against the stereotype boldt had difficulty fitting him in with the other wardens hed known over the years the private tour lasted forty minutes all showandtell of the facilitys hightech security the infrared gear was sensitive enough to detect any mammal with a body temperature above a rat who else have you toured the warden inquired competition in his blood he led them down a long plain corridor daphne pulled out a name from the article shed been reading aloud only minutes earlier the warden nodded they came in behind us still trying to catch up he suggested immodestly we turned a profit after just four years of operation dont forget nationally im talking about we maintain ninetyseven percent occupancy best bedtoinmate ratio in the business zero escapes in four years of operation zero he repeated nationally he said again the private commerce program boldt said assuming this was where he was leading them he asked does the state share in any of that revenue absolutely the warden beamed i believe the states take is twenty percent he turned to one of the two sycophants and said we can verify that the young commando took off down the hall to a white wall phone boldt stabbed so etheredge takes eighty percent of the private commerce profit for itself seventy computer workstations widebandwidth data lines over five dozen phone lineswe have expenses lieutenant telemarketing in a prison daphne said who would have thought we didnt invent it the warden reminded them defensively it has been around for years catalog sales surveys even airline reservations and yet those early programs failed to take advantage of what they had we use the computers in our alternative education program as well its the multiuse concept what you really come to appreciate about etheredge is our designers best in the business swear to god still defensive he added seven states currently use telemarketing as a revenue enhancer in corrections facilities he was back to his salesman attitude its an effective way to partially subsidize costs while simultaneously training for employment opportunity on the outside over sixty percent of inmates participating in our private commerce program will be offered similar work upon release recidivism in this portion of our population drops noticeably boldt said its a fascinating use of prison labor the comment intrigued the warden who stopped at a secure door and placed his palm into a reader he swiped his card next and the door unlocked youre in luck he informed boldt appears were in session except for the jumpsuits with their wide navy blue horizontal stripes one might have mistaken the seventy inmates and the enormous room for a university computer labgray office cubicles with soundproof baffling and bright ceiling lights in many ways it reminded boldt of homicides fifthfloor offices but on an even grander scale the irony not lost on him the inmates had it better than the cops the room hummed with sales pitches computer fans and keyboards clicking furiously daphne and boldt exchanged knowing glances somewhere in this room a connection to the assaults and burglaries existed he wore a headset and manned a keyboard the consolidated program boldt asked revealing information he shouldnt have newmann communications the wardens contempt rose in a cardinal display inflaming his neck and ears whats going on here he inquired is it all newmann in this room boldt repeated all the consolidated campaign one of the mans assistants spoke up too quickly for the wardens tastes half newmann half air express electronic ticketing how do you know about newmann the concerned warden asked boldt replied lieutenant matthews and i need to see the phone logs sorted by workstation we have newmann communications cooperation in this you lied to us the warden gasped youre not part of any search committee were searching all right boldt confirmed but not for a new prison always one to appeal to human nature daphne added our state is in the market for a private correctional facility if we take home a favorable impression youre wrong about this the warden told boldt realizing the trouble it might mean for him personally as well as the corporation the prosecuting attorneys office has already con tacted colorado corrections privately run or not its still their show this can end up a real mess for everyone boldt suggested its all how we handle it ill need to make some phone calls the warden suggested understood boldt said what exactly do you need access boldt answered perhaps we start with a place to talk daphne suggested the warden was clearly disgusted the home office is not going to like this he said boldt replied neither does one of our police officers who cant feel her legs chapter d aphne used frequent flyer miles to upgrade her hotel room which meant a few more square feet a deep bathtub with jets and a view of the rockies in his own slightly smaller room boldt ordered a pot of earl grey tea from room service drew himself an incredibly hot bath upon its delivery and spent twenty wonderful minutes soaking away the stiffness still present from the assault when the kids had been infants boldt had taken baths with themglorious memories of splashing laughing and soap in the eyes he missed his family terribly he wanted this case solved the flu over and his family back intact daphne called to say she had made dinner reservations downstairs coat and tie required she sounded excited the case he thought boldt ironed a shirt that had suffered in the shoulder bag dinner the two of them alone in a hotel a thousand miles from home maybe sheila hill should have assigned lamoia to the trip he was thinking feeling homesick he called liz she had reinvented herself following her illness she lived cleanly spiritually minded more centered more collected than ever an anchor her brush with death had invigorated her pursuit of life she made few demands upon him other than as the father of their children and did her best to support him in a job she did not particularly care for him to have her work at the bank brought in a good salary and she occasionally nudged boldt to consider corporate security work for one of the giant multinationals in the area but she didnt push he had nearly interviewed for boeing once their conversation was goodshe was thrilled to be home again with the kids boldt made absolutely no mention of his impending dinner with daphne despite a couple of perfect openings for him to do so and when he hung up he wondered why he hadnt told her he pulled his necktie tight choking himself a fortypage fax was delivered to his room etheredges attorneys had made the right decisionhe was in possession of a portion of the consolidated mutual phone solicitation log for area code daphne wore a creamcolored silk blouse with a mao neck buttoned to hide her scar a single strand of pearls swept gracefully across the ghost of a delicate lace bra rising and falling behind her every word she smelled earthy a hint of sweet one look at her and he experienced a systemic warmth like after a stiff drink she worked slowly on a glass of pinot noir boldt nursed a cranberry juice she said newmann and consolidated give those inmatesconvicted felonsaccess on their computer terminals to property tax assessments full credit histories number of dependents number and value of registered motor vehicles what did they expect would happen boldt had given her half the fax together they combed the list for the phone numbers of any of the nine burglary victims he wanted to tell her that she looked great he kept his mouth shut and his eyes aimed at the fax and that survey did you get time to look that over estimated income value of residence personal property in the residence number of computers owned by the family number of cd players number of vcrs all these little demographic triggers that satiate an insurance companys appetite for data but in the wrong hands she lifted her head he felt it as a warm wind are you listening appetite for data boldt repeated he had other appetites going he tried to quiet them and the guys on the other side of the room are booking travel plans you cant hit the homes while theyre out of townitll lead us right back to you but you could scout them make your plans hit one or two maybe but far enough apart we dont connect the dots ive got one he announced a little too loudly drawing the attention of the diners at the next table brooksgilman is down as having been called by an inmate identified as number fortytwo he informed her number fortytwo she repeated running her finger down the column that indicated which inmate in the private commerce program had placed the phone solicitation brumewell she exclaimed excitedly matching a phone number number fortytwo did brumewell too she was radiant when excited like this one of those people who generated an electricity a palpable physical sensuous energy that sparked across the table and infected boldt he felt that energy run wildly through himthough he didnt like where it landed where he felt it the most he shifted in his chair relieved at the approach of the waiter they both put the faxed pages aside they ate their salads slowly and in silence he felt like skipping the main course he wanted to get back to the faxed pages boldt caught daphnes eye read her mind its all right that we enjoy ourselves he suggested trying to sound convincing no harm in that no harm whatsoever she echoed though clearly not convinced another minute passed before he spoke the thing about us yes the silence isnt uncomfortable no its fine it feels good even the salads were withdrawn replaced by pewter domed entrees as the lids were whisked off in unison rosemary and garlic stirred the air its comfortable is all he said once they had been left alone thats not all and you know it she replied no maybe not he conceded weve been there lou and weve had plenty of opportunities since then to revisit and we dont which is good i think you think or you know her illness the cancerit pulled you two even closer together yes it did he agreed its making the most out of a bad situation you two did that its admirable thank you he said sincerely it doesnt mean i care for you any less she reached out across the table and took his hand in hers i know that and it goes both ways you know their eyes met smiling he lifted his water glass to private commerce caller number fortytwo id say weve got a suspect id say wed better get through the rest of that list tonight if we can connect mr fortytwo to more of the victims our case is only that much stronger agreed my room or yours yours its bigger boldt answered she pushed back her chair and excused herself without looking at him and hurried across the dining room in that graceful movement of hers when she returned he felt her urgency to leave the table how about one dance before dessert she asked a jazz trio in the hotel bar boldt had tried to block out the music because it could so overpower him and demand his full attention so could a dance he was thinking it was a bad idea she added that shed taken care of the tab charging it to her room making it impossible for him to stall why not he said his mouth working against his better judgment a mistake boldt knew it the moment he put his arm loosely around her and felt the warm indent of her back in the palm of his wide hand secrets were lost in such moments kingdoms fell with daphne in heels they stood nearly the same height she pulled herself closer and their chests made contact okay she asked her breath warm on his neck you know what i think she asked this time in a hoarse whisper that sent chills down him their hearts beat contrapuntally extraordinary he said marveling at the sensation she placed her head gently on his shoulder and answered herself i think this is dangerous feels that way to me he admitted not letting her go songs over so it was he hadnt noticed only the one song or had they stayed out there longer he took her by the hand and led her off the dance floor they walked together down the long corridor of rooms she used her electronic key to open the room door and boldt found himself reminded of the prisons security she leaned a shoulder against the door and it opened this is all right right right he answered not taking his chance to back out the faxed pages bulged in his coat pocket she reached up lightly stroked his cheek then playfully took him by the necktie and said into my room big boy but her words were lost to the kiss that boldt delivered more out of reflex than conscious decision he kissed her on the lips not the cheek right there in the hallway she holding his tie brief but delivered like he meant it the kiss stunned her but she didnt falter she pulled him through the door by the tie turned once inside and returned that kiss with all her enormous powers they kissed hard and hungrily a kiss that had fermented for years his fingers worked the tiny buttons to her blouse the silk melting away and exposing her chest as she unknotted his tie a car backfired and they both froze intuitively and then looking at each other in the early stages of undress one of them started to laugh and the other followed until the laughter grew by which point her blouse was buttoned and her face red behind a girlish blush maybe we go through the fax tomorrow morning she suggested nervously boldt felt awkward devastated i dont say anything she pleaded placing a warm finger to his lips and holding it there too long her blouse was buttoned incorrectly his shirt was partially open his tie hanging from his buttondown collar chapter the jefferson county corrections facility appeared somehow otherworldly as they approached the sprawling sandcolored facility surrounded by silver waves of razor wire all of it pushed out into the scrub of high desert the ride had been unusually quiet daphne rolled a starbucks cup between her palms as if warming them it was eighty degrees outside the airconditioned car the sky a blue found only in the mountains boldt felt a little blue himself he found it difficult to focus on the investigation which was after all the purpose of the trip this despite the fact that before going to sleep he had connected inmate with another four of the burglary victims phone numbers he and daphne were on their way now to have a little chat with number boldt turned left onto a long gravel road that led toward the shimmering facility dust rose behind the rental in a growing plume that colored the sun he said listen daffy ive thought about that kiss for a long time now that its behind us maybe we can make it another five or six years no harm no foul she questioned i dont want you mad at me is that what you think she asked you know for being such a good detective sometimes you dont have a clue true story he said he mugged a smile for her squinting eyes giving him away he pulled the car up to the first of three guard booths and slipped his id wallet out of his blue blazer daphne did the same and the conversation ended boldt and matthews sat across a speckled vinyl tabletop in an employees cafeteria boldt read from the folder in front of him inmate number fortytwo as listed on the phone solicitation sheets david ansel flekno c serving a threeyear sentenceget thisfor grand larceny hes been part of the private commerce telemarketing program for the past eight weeks right about when our robberies started daphne said they had half the connection flek had been the telemarketer who had spoken to each of the burglary victims before interrogating flek they needed the other half contact with the outside they awaited the warden when the man arrived boldt noticed that some of his military composure had worn off he understood the implications of all this for his facility nothing less than his job was at stake yet he was on orders from etheredge to cooperatea private facility refusing to cooperate with law enforcement would sound a death knoll for state prison contracts our pay phones here are owned and operated by an etheredge subsidiary he began never leave a dime unturned daphne said the home office is still working with the database of calls placed from those pay phones the attorneys will eventually have to sort out the first amendment issues many if not most of the calls made from our pay phones are placed using calling cards owned by relatives or friends on the outside we can get these numbers from the various carriers im told but it will take some time in the meantime i have this he handed boldt a stack of twenty faxed sheets they are not sorted by area code he apologized well live boldt said but i did have my secretary highlight any directdial calls made to the twoohsix area code he added somewhat proudly and she put a check by four of the calls that could have been made by inmate number fortytwo determined how daphne inquired pulling her chair next to boldts and looking over his shoulder boldt pointed to the top sheet by time schedule the warden said its not open access pay telephone time is closely controlled boldt said so how many others had access to the phones at the same time flek did there are five pay phones the warden explained we give each inmate fifteen minutes a day so four other guys boldt suggested it was a nice narrow field something he could work with he recognized the prefix of the highlighted number as a cellular prefix he would call lamoia and have the owner of the cell phone identified he would make sure david flek made no more calls if they got lucky theyd have their burglar he wasnt holding his breath it was rarely that easy daphne tested him so our chances are one out of five that flek called seattle and passed along the names and addresses of possible burglary targets he doesnt know that boldt answered to the warden he said i think its time we meet mr flek we can arrange that but first you mind explaining how all this works my people are going to ask me and im going to look a hell of a lot smarter if i know what im talking about boldt thought it sounded fair enough flek is supplying names to someone on the outside through the phone solicitation this survey conducted by consolidated through newmann he identifies homes that have a couple computers a highend stereo or a couple tvs a nice bottom line daphne had returned her attention to the original fax of phone numbers called by the phone solicitation team boldt continued he calls out on the pay phones probably to this cell phone numberand supplies the names and addresses of potential highend targets at that point its in our part of the world we get a burglary call daphne her nose still in the fax said lou granted three of the burglary victims are not anywhere on this list from last night maybe they were placed a week earlier than the records weve been provided marias not on the list either in his excitement over the connection to inmate boldt had neglected to search out sanchezs number in the database it was such a simple oversight but suddenly the absence of her number from the phone solicitations master call sheet loomed largely over their efforts she could have been called earlier as well he suggested the closer they came to the interrogation of a possible suspecteven an accessory to the fact like david ansel flekthe more boldt dreaded the possibility of discovering that maria sanchez had never been one of the burglary targets the implication would then be that marias assault had been cop on cop the same way he feared his own assault had been now that he approached whatever truth existed he did so cautiously well aware that on rare occasions some truths were better left undisturbed no she said shaking her head in every case the burglaries come within ten days of the initial phone solicitation that being the case shed be on here erased boldt inquired of a confused warden he and daphne exchanged glances and he could see her concern as well to my knowledge the man said the system does not allow it you cant erase any information from the private commerce database thats one of the stipulations just in case something like this ever happened to daphne boldt stressed we need flek to implicate whoever was doing these burglaries if that guy was not at sanchezs if he never hit sanchezs place if we can confirm it prove it then maybe we have the ammo we need to go knocking on iis door and get a look at whatever they know she nodded though her concern like his was palpable to the warden boldt said we need to speak to flek right now the prisons interrogation room still smelled of the glue used to fasten down the vinyl flooring it ranked as the cleanest interrogation room boldt had ever seen better than even the fbi or batf a video camera looked down on the occupants built into the wall was a twin cassette tape recorder that kept track of every spoken word every sound the twin cassette concept borrowed from the brits ensured that no one could later edit the content of the interrogation to fit his needs one tape went with the officer in charge the other was filed in a vault accessed only by the warden a failsafe against corruption david ansel flek wore the demeaning zebra suit his number ejc on a patch sewn onto the right breast pocket and on another that ran shoulder to shoulder across his back fortytwo the guards called him never using names never personalizing or humanizing the process a team of privately contracted criminal psychiatrists had advised etheredge corporation on how to treat the prisoners in order to maintain discipline and keep peace so it came as something of a shock to the man in the jumpsuit when boldt and matthews addressed him by his christian name it also served to mark the two as outsidersexactly as matthews had advised boldt who are you the man inquired fleks boyish face and blond surferdude hairstyle his blue eyes and white teeth reminded boldt of one of the beach boys or tab hunter in a fort lauderdale movie his smallish frame had been beefed up in the gym boldt knew the ordeal such looks suffered in any prison they called them babes wives soapiesthe young men forced to lie on their stomachs for the rulers of the pen but to his surprise boldt did not see the steelyeyed resentment he associated with the abused the more he studied flek the more he believed the man had somehow escaped the role of girlfriend either a credit to etheredges management of the facility or testimony to the ruthlessness of flek himself were your only hope daphne said boldt clarified your only hope unless you like it here unless youre thinking of turning fifty in here daphne said dates or age had a way of shaking up any inmatethe passage of time was the only god in such places the only redeemer according to his file the man was twentynine years old and boldts comment seemed to hit home whats it about he asked the harder you make us work for it boldt informed him the fewer years we trim off whats going to be added to your sentence you want to get out of here by forty thirtyfive then dont play dumb his ice blue eyes searched them both they favored daphne and for a little too long boldt cautioned there are no second chances flek we leave and we take twenty years of your life out the door with us i requested my public defender the man reminded and shes on her way as i understand it boldt said you know how busy they are so we wait flek said confidently boldt and matthews exchanged glances daphne spoke to the inmate im not advising you one way or the other david ansel he corrected a little too quickly youre somewhat new to the system she said he winced he didnt want to be told that weve seen your file first offense light sentence they were lenient with you youre lucky in that regard as im sure you found out once you took up residence here you have a little over a year left to go boldt reminded him so why add ten to twenty to that our point is daphne continued that going the attorney route is your legal right and even if we could help you out here we cant do anything to stop you from exercising that right and in fact youve already invoked that right which is perfectly acceptable to us though in my opinion not in your best interest in a calm voice he answered daphne but you are in my best interest a couple of cops i dont think so ten to twenty boldt informed the man daphne echoed you need to be thinking about turning fifty here at etheredge boldt reached across the table and forced the mans hands up in plain view flek said i was scratching is all still not breaking his eye contact with daphne daphne allowed the facilitys forced air system to account for the only sound in the room it swallowed the three of them she asked maybe you want to put the idea of an attorney aside for a moment and at least listen to our offer what can it hurt to listen boldt asked so talk flek said boldt felt a minor victory he knew from the mans file that flek had graduated from junior college and decided to approach him in a businesslike manner boldt informed him wed like to start with the phone solicitations you made and then continue on to the sub sequent pay phone calls made to the cell phone based in washington daphne added the more details you provide the more they prove out for us the stronger voice well have in your sentence recommendation which for you translates to fewer years the judge tacks on to your time here no matter what you hold out on us and youre looking at more time boldt explained including the possibility of accessory charges to a felony assault so the smart money says cooperate before the attorney arrives and screws it all up wasting your time flek told him his words spitting across the table he motioned toward daphne i enjoy the scenery but all the small talk i could do without i dont have a clue what youre talking about what she knew about his background didnt jibe with the man in that chair making her psychologist side immediately suspicious he was hiding behind his inmate persona why we have the phone logs boldt countered the phone solicitations are all tracked on computer the pay phone calls to the cellular numberweve got those too are you dumber than you look or what im represented by a public defender he said all inquiries should go through her what happens in places like this daphne said meeting eyes with him is you get tunnel vision you get so you can only think like everyone else thinks and the everyone else im talking about are not exactly the cream of the crop you know theyre losers you start to think like a loser dont be a loser ansel she said switching names were talking about adding twenty years to your time in here youll be fortynine years old before youre eligible for parole the mans nostrils flared and his eyes shone wetly he repeated all inquires should go through my public defender you dont win anything she pleaded by playing tough flek shook his head boldt asked the man why would you willingly add twenty years to your time here you answer a half dozen questions and maybe we just walk out of here as if none of this ever happened you cant be that stupid we wait for my attorney boldt stood from his chair daphne followed his lead wrong answer boldt said the events of the next few hours unfolded in a way that he never would have expected chapter boldts official complaint which he filed with the colorado department of corrections clearly touched off a nerve it took the spotlight in news reportspoliticians quickly attempting to distance themselves from statesanctioned phone solicitation programs involving inmates at first it seemed nothing more than electionyear candidates seizing an opportunity to grandstand how else could boldts onepage report have mushroomed into a media feeding frenzy no doubt some clerk had leaked the complaint within minutes of its filing that leak had spread through media and the medias subsequent outrage had caught fire when combined with the ulterior motives of politicians seeking reelection by the time boldt and daphne returned to the hotel at midday a half dozen press and radio reporters were already waiting for them in the lobby boldt and daphne issued no comment pushing toward the elevators when they returned to the lobby thirty minutes later to check out the reporters had been joined by two television crews three state representatives the staff of a united states senator and two mayoral aides the hotel had requested and received crowd control from the denver policetwo of whom pressed through the reporters to help boldt and daphne reach the registration desk the shouting from the reporters was nearly all the same is it true that inmates at etheredges jefferson county facility were engaged in a phone sales campaign do you know who authorized such a campaign has the governor had any comment to your knowledge is it true that inmates conducted crimes from within the privately operated prison it amused boldt that neither he nor daphne answered these questions but instead the various politicians and their assistants facts surrounding the private commerce program at etheredge unfolded according to a congressmans aide the program had been approved by a handful of politicians and had been kept quiet these many months under the pretense of it being a test program as such a statement had been made to the voting public that etheredge corporation was paying both the county and the state substantial fees on a commission basisno mention that certain influential state politicians had been generously entertained and their campaign coffers padded prior to the subcommittees closeddoor vote that had authorized the program in the first place boldts letter of complaint to the states department of justice lit a fuse that would burn for many months to come finally destroying more than a few in the hotel lobby is it true this program was initiated under the guise of prison reform a reporter shouted what was david ansel fleks role in your investigation a wellinformed woman called out from the crowd boldt and daphne met eyes how had that leaked and what does your trip here to denver have to do with your ongoing investigation of the tragic assault of seattle police officer maria sanchez daphne grabbed him by the arm stopping him we need to deal with this we need to head it off if the flek investigation leaks home we lose our jump on his possible accomplice agreed boldt said he assumed this reporter had searched the times internet archives for one or both of their names and had uncovered their participation in the sanchez investigation a guard or someone in the wardens office had fleks name daphne spoke up loudly and as she did the crowd quieted down for the first time ladies and gentlemen please thank you lieutenant boldt and i are with the seattle police department investigating a string of bur glaries she looked this woman reporter in the eye to drive home her point we came to denver to follow up on possible leads that may or may not be connected to the etheredge facility in jefferson county we spoke to a variety of individuals at the facility including inmates and administrative personnel none of whom has been charged with any crimes i want to stress that point to date no one in colorado has been charged with any crime associated with our investigation this was and is a factfinding mission and nothing more the lieutenant and i are returning to seattle now to follow up on what weve learned here any forthcoming charges or connections to our investigation will be released to the press in a timely fashion we are working in cooperation with the colorado department of corrections and the justice department that is all we have for you at this time thank you boldt and daphne exited the room following a pair of patrol officers a reporter pulled at boldts overnight bag and the lieutenant elbowed the man away camera flashes blinded him as they staggered out into the daylight expecting their rental but instead finding themselves shoved into a waiting stretch limousine bearing the hotel logo moments later they were on their way to the airport when the two werent calling out on their cellular phones the devices were ringing abc radio broke the story nationally ten minutes into the ride ensuring that even more press would be awaiting the two at the denver airport two cars and a television van dogged the limousine pulling alongside reporters leaning out of the cars and shouting for one of them to put the window down and answer questions the limousines cellular phone rang it was the television van following right behind them the driver hung up boldts cellular rang lieutenant boldt a mans voice asked speaking boldt answered into his cellular john ragman colorado department of corrections we spoke this afternoon yes theres something here i wanted to share with you it concerns the inmate you interviewed out at etheredge im listening you run the mans surname through our system and you get more than one hit you follow me yes i think i do youre on a cellulari can hear it digital no so maybe i shouldnt say much more the reportersoften scan the analog frequencies yes i understand the person you want to talk to is a sergeant john lamoia boldt gave him the direct number ill call lamoia from a land line out at the airport to be caught up or ill call you directly if i cant reach him if you two havent spoken got it ragman added youre gonna like what ive got or maybe not i guess but either way you need it lieutenant boldt disconnected the cell waited for daphne to get off her own phone and told her theres another flek in the colorado system maybe a relative maybe currently living in seattle she deduced one has to wonder boldt agreed hence fleks reluctance to cooperate with us she said protecting a brother a cousin she had felt something odd about his demeanor now maybe she had an explanation for it worth pursuing boldt said that call i just hung up from she said the number called from the pay phone at etheredge it looks like maybe its a cloned cellular phone that bill has dozens of calls being disclaimed by the customer a cloned number offers anonymity it makes sense boldt agreed which means wed have to catch this guy in the act to connect him to flekrelative or not and well lose that chance because hell be warned off by all this media attention beat the clock boldt said he remembered the quiz show from his youth you think we made a mistake lou interrogating him tipping our hand maybe wed have been better to sit on him intercept the activity boldt believed she was probably right but also knew there was no looking back during an investigation he didnt answer directly instead he said we work this relative of fleks and we work this cell phone that was called we work it fast before too much of this makes it onto the evening news maybe we get lucky since when daphne asked chapter upon returning to his job lamoia thought the excessive workload facing him must have been some kind of cruel joke perhaps cooked up by boldt to prove how hard things had been for him during lamoias absence there were nine active investigations on lamoias desk he had responded to two of the crime scenes and taken reports from the other seven at the same time he was wearing the hats of burglary detective special assaults detective and homicide sergeant and hed only been on the job for two days when some guy identifying himself as ragman called from colorado corrections and mentioned boldt by name lamoia focused his attention on the message being relayedthe name of a possible accomplice he scribbled the name bryce abbott flek into his notebook ragman said brother flek owns a pink sheet the length of your arm a juvie gone bad his more recent history here puts him in double jeopardy one more felony conviction and the guy does fifteen without parole flek lamoia repeated reading from his notes having spoken to boldt earlier he knew about the failed interrogation out at etheredge he had asked a friend at intercel to identify the cellular phone number called from the prison and then had spoken with matthews ten minutes earlier to deliver the bad news the number had indeed been cloned ragman warned his jacket is littered with references to what one officer called the volatile nature of his personality theres also a reference to a psych evaluation in here although i dont have my hands on it way it looks to me this is a dog that bites little brother is tame by comparison this one took out two uniforms trying to arrest him back in ninetythree both hospitalized one with a broken neck broken neck lamoia repeated yanking his feet off his desk and sitting upright in the chair you have aliases for this mope you got a sharp pencil its a long list better yet what if i fax you as much of this as i can is he on westcrime lamoia inquired ncd ragman said the national criminal database you guys lined out with that yet you bet weve got access to westcrime ncd and all the federal databases then youre set on the aliases ragman said ill still fax you the liner notes in case that stuff didnt get posted to the database the way it shakes out hes a thief with a fondness for anything electronic a violent son of a bitch when he wants to be and i guess thats most of the time just so you and your boys know to wear vests got it lamoia said drawing a thickening ring around the name bryce abbott flek to where it dominated the page he called boldt who said cant talk on the cellular ill call you back from the airport the line went dead he accessed the ncd database and downloaded both flek brothers criminal records bryce abbott flek operated under six aliases all ending in ek or eck lamoia typed in the various names all separated by commas he tried spd records king county records and state records no arrests he tried the mans colorado motor vehicle registrationa blue dodge van a subsequent request with the licensing bureau kicked five unpaid instate parking tickets all within a threeblock area of ballard the first of these parking tickets was dated a year earlier the same month as david ansel fleks conviction the pieces started falling into place lamoia grew increasingly excited fingers drumming he considered various means to pinpoint the address and locate bryce abbott flek one option was to drive around the threeblock area looking for that blue van with colorado plates and put it under surveillance when they found it he would then wait for flek to show up and hope to follow him back to an apartment put that under surveillance the time and manpower requirements seemed enormous he tried a friend at us west no go not one of fleks aliases kicked for a current listing no great sur priseif the man was using a cloned cellular why bother with a ma bell installation if flek was renting a room or an apartment lamoia had no way of finding out where there were no tax records and no utility bills at least not that he could locate he racked his brain for some other way to find the guy and to find him fast before the news leaks boldt had warned of reached flek and he heard of his little brothers contact with seattle police if and when that happened flek was certain to go underground perhaps not surfacing again he debated whether to put out the word on the streethe had fleks mug shot courtesy of the ncd database he thought of liquor stores and dominos pizza delivery boys he called a friend at a credit bureauno credit cards no loans no bank accounts under any of the aliases in the end using the patrol force to search ballard for any blue vans appeared the best choice he put the word out over the mobile data terminals network notifying nearly two hundred patrol cars simultaneously an hour before boldt and daphnes plane touched down at seatac lamoia was notified by an spd radio car that a blue van with colorado plates was currently fueling at a gas station in ballard not five blocks from lamoias current location lamoia had issued the be on lookout for the van with little hope to his surprise he had been notified of four blue vans in the past thirty minutes this radio call represented the first mention of colorado plates within minutes lamoia confirmed the registration bryce abbott flek about that same time he doubleparked his fireengine red camaro with a view across the street the gas pumps black hose hung from the vans tank like an elephants trunk the driver nowhere to be seen he spotted the cruiser patrolling a block away hailed them over the radio and ordered them to park out of sight he then radioed dispatch and ordered all spd patrol cars kept out of a tenblock area surrounding the gas station he didnt want anything anyone alerting flek to their presence when he requested additional unmarked cars the dispatcher had the audacity to laugh at him request is noted the uncharacteristically amused dispatcher announced lamoia understood the subtext in terms of winning unmarked cars and plainclothes detectives as backup he was in this alone the quik stop gas station teemed with activity some customers pulled up to the pumps others parked shopping for a soda a bag of chips or a quart of milk but by his count every customer arrived and left by automobile he observed no bicycles no pedestrians this latter realization prompted a second study of the back of a big man already a half block behind the quik stop and moving away the man wore a thighlength leather jacket blue jeans and hightop running shoes the telltale sign that got lamoias adrenaline pumping had nothing to do with clothes but instead the lack of anything carried no paper or plastic bag no soda it seemed conceivable the man had purchased a pack of cigarettes or something small enough to be pocketed it was no crime to leave a quik stop on footbut his recollection of the case file suggested otherwise the burglar was believed to monitor police radio bands probably on a portable scanner and lamoia had impetuously cleared the area around the quik stop by ra dio naming the gas stations location foremost on lamoias mind where had this guy come from he had not seen anyone arrive on foot in the last few minutes more to the point according to his criminal records bryce abbott flek stood six foot one and weighed in at two hundred pounds that fit well with the man now nearly a block away lamoia needed someone to watch the blue van while he pursued its apparent owner on foot but he didnt want the cars police radio to communicate about it the real flek whether or not he was the man on foot might be listening in wandering the aisles of the quik stop wondering how to play his situation realizing he had to take a chance lamoia grabbed the radios handset and informed the dispatcher he was switching to one of the four secure frequencies used by spd illegally modified scanners could not intercept these digitally secure frequencies he requested the dispatcher to assign a patrolman from the nearby cruiser to take up a position with a view of the blue van and to report any activity naming the cross street behind the quik stopthe intersection where the bluejeaned pedestrian was headedlamoia requested that two cruisers position themselves as backup bookending the street this done he took off on foot he did not run but instead walked with a brisk longlegged stride calculated to quickly close the distance between himself and his mark he had not thought to bring along a portable radio from the squad room and so he was on his owncloaked in the dark only his cellular phone connected him to the world outside of bryce abbott flekif that was in fact whom he was following by the time his suspect reached the intersection and turned right lamoia had closed the gap to half a block following several weeks of inactivity lamoia felt awash invigorated by the pursuit hungry for confrontation he loved his job there was nothing quite like slamming a mope up against the wall and slapping a pair of bracelets around his wrists taking another piece of infectious waste off the streets out of the game duty called he felt positively electric with anticipation the first blow came from behinda devastating show of force unexpected and overpowering an openpalm smack to the back of his skull delivered with such ferocity that his chin bruised his chest and a whole series of muscles at the nape of his neck ripped loose he heard his gun clink to the sidewalk the dull sound of metal on cement useless where it lay that blow to the head stunned the muscles of his upper back and numbed his spine to where his arms suddenly weighed upon him like sandbags he attempted to turn around to fight back but his arms hung at his side swinging like gorilla limbs and the man behind him directed him otherwise smashing his face into the brick wall twice and then working a volley of rabbit punches from just above his hip points into the center of his back ribs the man hit intending to do harm intending to quickly eliminate lamoia from the field of play swinging through the punches at the brick wall with only lamoias flesh and bone in between the mans knee bruised lamoias coccyx and the heel of his foot found lamoias instep to where as he let go the sergeant sank to the sidewalk bloody and broken a mass of misfiring nerve endings his lungs burning his legs unable to support him he never even saw the mans face chapter shying from the obnoxiously bright light boldt rushed through the emergency rooms automatic doors met there by the oncall physician who had tended lamoias injuries daphne spoke to a nurse upon being informed of the assault they had made the drive from seatac in just over ten minutesroughly half the usual time even in good traffic the doctor spoke breathlessly also trying to keep up with the lieutenant fluid in the right lung bruised kidneys contusions partial concussion fractured ribs bruised coccyx if i hadnt gotten the report from the officers who delivered him i would have said hed been hit by a vehicle from behind they stepped into the oversized elevator and the doctor hit a floor button boldt felt ready to explode so nothing permanent he said nothing disabling a good deal of pain a long convalescence and hes back to normal the doctor said the guys got a hell of an attitude lieutenant hes making jokes as were wiring his jaw shut his jaw daphne said didnt i mention that the doctor asked as the elevator toned its arrival broken mandible jesus boldt hissed daphne reached out and squeezed his forearm in support he turned to face her im the one who put him there he wanted to say he charged out of the elevator and hurried toward room a powder blue blanket hid most of him lying flat on his back without a pillow a variety of monitors a dozen bright yellow numbers some flashing at first boldt thought they had the wrong room because he didnt recognize the man lying there then he realized they had shaved lamoias mustache to deal with the cuts and abrasions and to stitch up a spot where a tooth had come through his cheek boldt had to look away he was so overcome with emotion boldt didnt always deal well with his anger and he was very angry now a rational thinker he tried to avoid anger altogether by compartmentalizing explanations and analyzing situations though he frequently failed lamoia was too close a friend for boldt to see him solely as a wounded sergeant boldt had connected ragman to lamoiaand from the sketchy details he had boldt believed himself responsible for the injuries how long like this daphne whispered to the doctor but so that boldt could overhear she wanted to bookend this for boldt to show him it wasnt forever to make it finite the lung will keep him here for a day or two well get him pretty healed up by then hell be home with just a couple bumps and bruises in no time six to eight weeks it never happened try telling him that boldt said medically speaking the doctor replied the body in the bed grunted its bloodshot eyes open now and fixed on boldt who slowly made his way to the injured mans bedside boldt saw a familiar morbid humor in those eyes and for some reason this made his anger all the more palpable how dare lamoia make light of this how dare he try to forgive him boldt knew what that attempted humor was about flek boldt asked the mans lips moved but boldt couldnt hear the doctor warned he shouldnt attempt to speak please in the morning maybe but lamoia grunted drawing boldts ear closer to his lips good drugs the man whispered boldt felt tears spring from his eyes jesus john im sorry he dragged his arm across his face trying to hide his reaction lamoia just grunted in response the doctor pulled boldt away and checked the monitors its rest for you he said to lamoia addressing an iv pump and increasing the rate of flow and stop flirting with the nurses he added never lamoia whispered meeting eyes with daphne and trying to smile healthy as ever daphne said chapter the flek brothers daphne said you want to hear this boldt sat at his office desk still preoccupied by his hospital visit to lamoia he nodded yes all the while thinking about lamoias empty office cubicle just around the corner we have a pretty classic svengali here bryce abbott flek the older brother has been in and out of trouble in mostlysince he could ride a bike the bully in school truant petty theftbicycles cigarettes from the candy store a couple juvie arson arrests possession of a switchblade grand larceny auto at the ripe age of fourteen liquor store robbery fifteen model citizen one troubled kid trailer park life in the colorado oil fields statutory rape charges when he was eighteenturned out it was consensual charges dropped he beat up a lot of people one hell of a volatile personality its endless you dont need to sound so excited he said daphnes professional curiosity about the criminal mind exceeded ones reasonable expectations she was always looking for ways to interview suspects ahead of their arrestwhile they still showed their true colors she cast him a disapproving look and continued saying in and out of youth detention facilities corrections six months for this eighteen for thatminimum or medium facilities never the big house fast forward hes thirtythree years old he has two recent felonies on his dismal sheet one aggravated assault one grand larceny file that for a moment she said motioning for boldt to set bryce abbott aside rewind david ansel flek little brother same trailer park same parents same schools but no truancy no arrests until hes seventeen and that ones for loitering and curfew violation following a winter flood that takes out the family trailer and mom along with it its sketchy at best but a denver post article i pulled from the net mentions her by nameadrian abbott flekelectrocuted when the flood hit got to be the mother father blew off the sons and headed to the alaska fields david drifts south although he never leaves coloradohis brothers influence can hardly be said to be positive david enlists in the army makes it two years goes awol is arrested on one of his brothers robberies turned back over to the army serves a couple months in the brig serves out his stint and is dishonorably discharged at twentythree state tax records show him employed briefly with a computer software firm mail room or programmer we have no idea but hes basically on the straightandnarrow its during this period that brother bryce is making his mark with the local blues one arrest after another increasingly violent make note of this davids next job is with a discount electronics retailer a best buy type he moves up to manager in a twoyear periodhes twentyfive twentysix now theres a breakin at davids store right after a major deliverytwo dozen tvs vcrs twice that many computers david is busted and eventually confesses his first felony he goes down for two to seven in etheredge boldt said correct hes out in two with good behavior boldt said correct which means we have all sorts of leverage if we convince younger brother david that with both the sanchez and lamoia assaults bryce faces bullets from the first uniform to make him maybe he gives us a lead or maybe we simply hold the threat of an added ten years over him although that sure didnt work the first time i like playing him for the brothers safety the only thing is we dont have either brother for sanchezno phone solicitation records remember and we dont have bryce for lamoia he never saw his attackers face so were looking at burglary at best unless kawamoto can make him someone walked away from that blue van and never came back how difficult is it for a judge or jury to see that its circumstantial when and if we catch up with bryce hell tell us the van was stolen an hour before we cant disprove that what about the convenience stores security camera did it pick up his face the systems vcr was lifted a month ago and never replaced by management there is no tape we cant put bryce flek at that gas station she said what exactly are you saying david is our way to find bryce we find bryce maybe we wrap this thing up maybe she said but bryce would have to confess to sanchez to get any decent charges to stick boldt answered maybe not he hoisted a blackandwhite mug shot of bryce abbott flek and turned it to face daphne what if sanchez can id him boldts private line rang and he took a call hanging up a moment later a satisfied grin playing across his lips he informed her we found the apartment where flek has been staying chapter bryce abbott fleks photo was recognized by a guitar maker the rented room one of five that occupied the two floors above fletcher brocks custom instrument shop consumed three sid field technicians who combed it floor to ceiling lamoias assault could be felt here toonormally boldt would have been lucky to get even one tech to a potential suspects abode in under an hour what have we got boldt asked a sid tech from just inside the doorway he wore latex gloves and a snarl the place was a pig sty stroke mags beer drinker junk food dirty laundry three cellular phones all apparently working could be a college dorm room if i didnt know better the phones clones boldt said three of em probably weapons negative prints a lot of liftsmostly the same guy maybe a woman by the size of the others box of tampax on the floor by the toilet blond pubic hairs mixed in with the more abundant darker ones collected from the sheets toilet rim and shower drainplatinum blond shoes pair of hightop sneakers is all nike boldt asked recalling the shoe at his own assault had that been brother flek converse weve already bagged and tagged the clothes well go over them for hairs and fibers if theres anything that links this place to sanchez or your other sites youll hear about it drugs alcohol valium and amphetamines in the bath street grade no prescription bottles the beer some cuervo gold thats about it purely recreational stuff not in combination daphne said softly into boldts left ear two bennies one valium and a shot of gold thats a street cocktail they call a glow plug a couple glow plugs and a guyll think hes bulletproof as in beating up a cop from behind boldt suggested to her that would certainly fit he turned to the tech and asked electronics parts computers anything in that category just the three cell phones any of these he said pulling from his pocket one of the plastic ties hed recovered from the kawamoto crime scene not here but in the van the man answered you did the van the blue van colorado plates all three of us the tech replied indicating the woman and man still busy behind him he stepped forward and picked the white plastic tie from between boldts fingers must be a couple hundred of these lying around loose in that van boldt looked over his shoulder at daphne and said thats a start revisiting the hospital wasnt easy for boldt this time he was there to see officer maria sanchez he perked up the moment he and daphne entered the room as the woman lying there was able to somewhat jokingly wave hello to them with her toes movement had returned to the digits of both feet and with a great deal of concentration her left ankle could be flexed though she remained paralyzed from the knees up the womans hopefulness and enthusiasm now filled the room like warm sunlight replacing the fear and terror that had so recently been in evidence we have a suspect daphne announced the woman looked right signaling yes not yet in custody boldt added we would like to show you a photo array you know the drill officer another yes daphne explained there are six faces in the array all numbered if you recognize one of the individuals as your assailant we would like you to blink the number to us number twotwo blinks et cetera is that okay with you are you up to this boldt asked yes came the indicated reply if you have doubts boldt continued well get to that for the moment we simply need to know if any of these faces looks familiar to you the woman looked right with her dark eyes yes good daphne said checking with boldt who nodded to go ahead daphne pulled the array from her shoulder case sandwiched layers of heavy stock the six head shots sat behind equally sized cutout windows a number below each four were blackandwhite two color she held it an arms length from sanchezs pillowed head and knew within seconds that the victim did not recognize any of the men in the photos then she reminded herself that sanchez was incapable of facial expression and because of this she held out hope sanchez closed her eyes boldt held his breath in anticipation ready to count the number of blinks he wanted desperately for the number to be four fleks position in the arraythough doubted she could identify the man who had done this to her if she identified bryce abbott flek then they had linkage between all the robberies either way they still needed flek in custody if boldt hoped to pry the lid off the ii investigation when she opened her eyes sanchez looked left no boldt questioned you dont recognize any of them daphne clarified no came the womans answer youre sure daphne asked shes sure boldt answered an assault at night boldt had been through that he knew the victim doesnt recognize any of the faces in our array boldt pointed out we take it from there we take it where daphne asked without flek in custody so we get him in custody boldt fired back and when we do well sit him down and well question him and then maybe we get some answers he added in a hoarse whisper if were really lucky then whoever brings him in has a hard time of it and makes him pay for what he did to lamoia his eyes sparkled which is why i hope im the one to bring him in chapter meeting in the fifthfloor conference room with a deputy prosecuting attorney named lacey delgato a woman with whom hed worked a dozen other cases some successfully some not boldt struggled to find a way to bring david ansel flek to the table as a witness the prosecuting attorneys office was crucial to his effort delgatos unflattering nickname the beak was a result of her oversized nose with a low center of gravity and a voice that could etch glass lacey delgato surprised anyone who made the mistake of judging her by her appearance to boldt she represented the best and the brightest of the upandcoming trial attorneys in the pas office her loud mouth and the fact that she wasnt afraid to jump in with locker room vocabulary turned off some people but not boldt for anyone who worked with lamoia and gaynes all else was tame into their second hour of discussion of the brothers flek delgato and boldt had yet to solidify a legal strategy that might force the incarcerated david ansel flek to open up and provide leads to help police locate his older brother with this the most obvious and direct way to end the case boldt pressed on relentlessly maybe we should be looking at the girlfriend delgato suggested weve got some pubic hairs and a box of tampax boldt reminded thats a pretty wideopen field and some lifts delgato reminded indicating sids record of the fingerprints developed inside fleks boarding room boldt explained lofgrin ran them through alps the states automated latent print system used to analyze and identify latent fingerprintsand struck out weve posted them on the bureaus database and if he brought her from colorado with him delgato asked the missed opportunity stabbed boldt in the center of his chest such a simple idea and he had overlooked it for the better part of the last eighteen hours damn he mumbled just an idea delgato said in a doubtful tone of voice that implied he had screwed up boldt placed a call down to the lab the unidentified fingerprints lifted from fleks apartment would be posted over the internet to colorados bureau of criminal identificationcbciin the next few minutes thats why they pay me the big bucks delgato said once boldt was off the phone you might be the better cop of the two of us a somewhat defeated boldt suggested a woman looks at the relationship between the principals a guy looks at the evidence thats the only difference its what makes you and matthews such a good team youre lucky to have her boldt didnt touch that he thought of her too often that kiss had still not left his lips and he knew that wasnt right delgato continued the whole time were sitting here im looking over this sid reportthe pubic hair the lab idd as being bleached blondand im thinking what kind of babe dyes her privates you know and im thinking stripper sure it could be an older woman whos trying to dye a few years off the truth by taking the gray out of anywhere it shows but someone hanging with a burglar more likely young and obedientblack leather pants and a halter top a real gum chewer flek says i want you a blond all over and little miss junior mint is off to the pharmacy for some nice n easy which just about describes her perfectly and if she is who i think she is then shes not so different from flek some drug charges some soliciting maybe some fraud maybe even armed robbery who knows maybe she drives for him a lookout maybe shes giving him a hum job before the hit for good luck maybe she knows nothing about his game but i like her for a juvie sheet she has that feel about her shes the kind that smiles for the mug shots you know the type all that from dyed pubic hair im glad youre on our side boldt said if you were a pd id retire youll never retire she fired back and ill never be a public defender we both hate the bad guys too much you know yeah i know boldt agreed a sharp knock on the door drew their attention a woman civilian from the secretary pool whom boldt had only met that same morning lieutenant she said call for you line one they said its urgent or i wouldnt have boldt interrupted thanking her and scooted his rolling chair over to a phone boldt he announced into the receiver as he listened to the mans voice on the other end of the call his shoulders slumped his head fell forward and his right hand clenched so tightly into a fist that his fingers turned white and ghostly he hung up the phone lieutenant a concerned delgato asked in her strident voice boldts voice caught he cleared his throat and tried again were going to need another game plan he warned her another angle something he finally looked up at her stealing her breath away lieutenant she repeated a little more desperately seems the inmates didnt like having the private commerce program shut down probably enjoyed the extra income not to mention the access to information can you imagine how many games were being run out of that facility lieutenant what the hells going on she demanded the call was from jefferson county corrections david flek was found beaten to death in the showers they would have called us sooner but it took them a while to identify the body delgato frowned luck of the draw were screwed boldt said chapter the woman believed to be connected to bryce abbott flek was identified through her fingerprints by colorados bci as courtney samway the mug shot came back as a creamskinned sixteenyearold with a pretty face and a home haircut that made her into a tomboy vixen with a curiously rebellious expression samways colorado parole officer had required her to register in seattle upon her fulfillment of obligations and her departure from the colorado corrections system samway had in fact contacted the washington state parole board upon her arrival as required meaning that a tiny insignificant computer file in the vastness of the endless mainframes that constituted law enforcements efforts to track thousands of offending juvenile felons provided an address of residence for the recently released teen she kicked from colorado two months ago boldt told bobbie gaynes who rode shotgun in boldts brandnew crown vic nearing midnight the city still teemed with activity ten years earlier it would have been dead this late at night the car replaced his chevy cavalier hed earned the crown vic apparently for his loyalty throughout the flu the chief was handing out perks boldt wasnt complaining the crown vic was twice the car and even came with a remote device that locked and unlocked the door or popped the trunk from thirty yards mug shot is two years old gaynes said shes a punk slut you can see it in her eyes age doesnt matter boldt said she registered with a parole officer here claiming the move was to support a job offer she turned eighteen last month gaynes said reading from the womans jackether record having been forwarded by colorados bci the alleged job is with a fish processorprobably someone flek bought off to write her a letter of employment the address is not the same as the one her po provided not that it matters im betting this address is smoke you want five on that have i ever taken one of your bets boldt asked checking the rearview mirror to ensure that the radio car was following as planned the address is good he guessed she registered with the parole board that tells me she didnt like serving timeshe doesnt want to go back there she played by the rules laid out for her in colorado the address will be good maybe i should take that five he contemplated yeah right gaynes laughed the day you take a bet lt im having your head examined the brick structure had been built fifty years earlier at a time when this south part of the city had prospered from timber and fishing time had not been kind to it the street was paved in wet matted trash the carcasses of vehicles resting on rusted rims lay alongside broken glass and spent syringes littering the alleys like discarded cigarette butts it was not somewhere to take a stroll they had waited impatiently to conduct a midnight raid a daytime operation in this neighborhood was worthless rats only returned to the nest at night boldt used only secure frequenciesbelieving flek might be monitoring the normal channels if this was in fact samways apartment with fleks roost already raided it seemed possible even likely he might be inside on command the cruiser behind him turned up the side alley he would allow his team a minute or two to take positions according to city fire records for the once commercial building three possible exits offered egress at each of the three a uniform would be waiting for anyone beating a hasty retreatanyone who managed to get past boldt and gaynes with gaynes at his side boldt knew not many would slip past once inside the wet and cold building loud rock and roll from a downstairs apartment obscured boldts hearing he relied on his sensitive ears the way a bloodhound depended on its nose and he found the overpowering music frustrating and troublesome gaynes gestured through a series of hand signals indicating that she would take lead on the climb up the stairs boldts chest knotted and his skin prickled with sweat a month earlier he would have had special ops as his advance team but the flu had taken its toll in the company of one other detectivealbeit a bulldog in the form of a poodlehe prepared to take on some animal who had cracked one officers neck and rabbitpunched another into the hospital weapons drawn he and gaynes worked up the staircase as if an adversary had already spotted them gaynes in the lead boldt trying to cover her both top and bottom nerves rattled a sudden movement behind and below boldt swiveled silently to see a railthin junkie cross the hall in a tshirt and bare feet moving between neighboring rooms boldt signaled gaynes to continue the staircase smelled strongly of cats crushed candy wrappers spent lotto tickets and cigarette butts littered the edges of each step they reached the first landing it smelled of pizza the thumping of the downstairs music faded behind them boldt heard at least two televisions and a considerable amount of muted talking they turned right at the top of the stairs bobbie gaynes looking stressed and tension ridden her movements sharp and angular they passed three closed doors before gaynes raised her hand to stop them she pointed across the hall to their target boldt signaled back an acknowledgment and moved gaynes to the side her back to the wall immediately alongside the door his gun aimed to the side and down to the floor boldt tried the doorknob and found the door locked he rapped his knuckles loudly against the wood stepped back and waited when nothing happened gaynes reached around and pounded on the door police she announced open this door shock waves reverberated down the hall police through the closed doors behind them they heard much shuffling but the door before them remained quiet boldt reared back onto one leg and hammered on the door kicking it hard most of his weight behind the blow his second attempt broke the door loose from the jamb the door crashed loudly into the wall as it swung open police he repeated eyes darting to gaynes who confirmed she was ready boldt stepped inside and snugged his back against the near wall gaynes flowed in behind him moving to the center of the small room boldt took the galley kitchen to her right clear he announced gaynes rushed the tiny bedroom to the left clear she echoed they lowered their guns though kept them at the ready boldt shut the door as best as possible need a pair he asked indicating the latex gloves in his hand all set she retrieved a pair from her pocket they moved through the small area fluidly two investigators accustomed to their work the warrant called for a plainsight search for any materials relating to the thefts but gaynes conveniently found drawers and cabinets surprisingly left open to where she could search them boldt made sure his back was turned milk is dated next week he announced so shes been living here recently he wondered if kicking the apartment had been the right thing the do they could have placed it under longterm surveillance but boldts guess was that if samway was hooked up to the flek brothers then shed already been advised to avoid her own digs couple of roaches left in the ashtray gaynes announced we could get her on that if we had to shes on a years probation following her parole we want her boldt reminded he would worry about the technicalities later here we go gaynes announced from the bedroom boldt approached her voice but with his back to it his attention mostly on the apartments broken door he glanced to his rightan unmade bed cigarette butts piled high in an ashtray facing the bed was a inch trinitron with a cable box on top he said we should have checked the cable company maybe wed have found her or fleks name there not that this gaynes said swinging the bathroom door open further bathing suit thongs and bikini tops the size of corn chips i guess she likes the pool boldt said the image not fitting with his vision of courtney samway this here is her work uniform gaynes corrected shes stripping lt were looking for matchbooks coasters check stubs tshirts he interrupted something with the name of the club on it he said boldt walked through the small bedroom carefully studying the place he reached the side of the bed and a mound of cigarette butts in a plastic ashtray he dumped the butts onto the floor without a second thought his gloved fingers wiped away the ash and tobacco smudges cleaning the bottom of the ashtray he held it up then for gaynes to read from across the small room mikes pleasure palace he said table for two gaynes replied i shouldnt admit it but i love strip joints i like the female body gaynes told him from the crown vics shotgun seat you guys fantasize about jumping their bones but i fantasize about looking like that theyre gorgeous these girls on top of it they can really move and they choose to be there so dont give me that shit about it being exploitive they rock their hips and some asshole stuffs a twenty into their gstring thinking hes some kind of big shot when shes gonna take that thing off regardless hes gonna pay her another twenty and then she goes backstage and drinks for free and awaits her next performance and the lap dancing boldt asked hey most of that is voluntary extra credit work sometimes not sure sometimes management demands it but its a power trip for the girlsits gotta be drag your crotch down some guys thigh and cream him in his pants fifty bucks for five minutes work theres no kissing no fluids exchanged no harm no foul im hearing this from a woman a woman who likes to watch other women she reminded him not touch despite what they say about me not woman on womannothing like that but i appreciate the si swimsuit edition as much as any of you the boys cant understand a woman appreciating the female bodybut they can watch one guy pound another guy on the scrimmage line every sundayso thats their problem not mine id never been to strip joints until the guys from our squad dragged me in one time and them thinking they would gross me out you should have seen them have i ever gone down on a woman no do i want to no disgusting do i like marble nudes you bet nude dancers why not i think i have more information than i need boldt said if i had a body like that i might show it off for a few bucks im built like a truck so what can i do about it you are not boldt objected youre a goodlooking woman thats horse shit lt lacey delgato is one thing he hesitated im not having this conversation he said vehemently after a long silence gaynes said under her breath thank you for saying that lt youre a peach so ill make you a deal he said shoot ill handle the bouncer and the bartender if youll do the talking with the ladies he checked to make sure a cruiser was following as ordered if shes here its straight into the radio car for a ride downtown i want her scared theyre girls lt correcting him bodies as hard as that they just dont last all that long upon entering mikes pleasure palace boldt shouted to be heard above don henleys grinding rock and roll these girls dont often use their real names even with the help gaynes said pulling him down to hear use the mug shot from bci unnecessary boldt said pointing to the stage where pulsing blue light welcomed the next dancer to the platform wearing a translucent wet tshirt and an equally showy wet white cotton thong the relatively smallchested courtney samway strutted out onto stage her platinum blond hair showing slightly from beneath a black wig there was no mistaking her she didnt have the meaty frame of a stripper and the crowd of men seemed to be assessing her until she began to move to the music at which point all eyes took to the stage boldt scanned the crowd for flek you see him no gaynes replied but im thinking we might want to hang for a while in case he shows we approach her too soon we could scare him off im not hanging around if thats what youre sug gesting boldt said i want her downtown i want some answers she slithered like a snake wrapping herself around her own frame suggestively the tshirt came off somewhere in the process followed a moment later by the thong boldt told himself he wouldnt have watched if he hadnt been required to but in truth there wasnt a male not watching she didnt have a centerfold body but she was shapely enough hair colorings a match boldt said still looking thing looks like a sheepskin rug gaynes said bout as naturallooking as one of those car seat covers you take the dressing room boldt advised gaynes ill stay out here he reminded her radio cars out front probably hadnt been helping win mike any customers gaynes never met samway face to face that night following her dance the woman slipped into a robe and stepped off out front summoned for a lap dance boldt cut the private performance short two minutes later samway was escorted to the backseat of the police cruiser and was headed downtown to public safety samway occupied the chair inside the interrogation room in her satin robe chewing gum kept her jaw pumping deputy prosecuting attorney delgato could see this all for herself since boldt had summoned her to the am interrogation the witness had requested a public defender despite the fact she was only in for questioning where a public defender appeared prosecuting attorneys followed hence delgato daphne too had been rousted gaynes watched from the other side of the rooms oneway glass with delgato boldts ateam all but lamoia it hurt boldt to think about him laid up in the hospital you talk to us now before your courtappointed attorney arrives daphne told the young woman and the lieutenant here forgets about the probation violation of associating with known felons and we forego the urine test to see if youve been smoking pot im sure she said you want to hear it from a deputy prosecuting attorney daphne asked i give the signal and shes in here laying it out for you trust me boldt intervened from the chair next to daphne all we want is a little frank discussion about your roommate he saw you on the news at that denver hotel she said ominously while staring at boldt meaning daphne asked samway said listen whos talking to you ive never seen you before but him she eyed boldt boldt wanted courtney samway the focus of the discussion not the other way around he tried to signal daphne but failed speaking directly to boldt samway said venomously youre the one shut down the program the one got davie killed abby said youre a dead man i heard him say it i dont need to talk to youim talking to a dead man daphne grew several inches as her spine stiffened boldt reached out and gently touched her forearm he said lets start there then abby was you and abby were watching the news on television you saw me here in seattle she shied smelling the trap he laid for her im not saying nothing you see the problem boldt asked her trying to keep her mind engaged and slightly off her game if it isnt us who catches up to abby to speak with him lets say its denver or reno or portland for that matter all that the police there see is the sheet the warrant the be on lookout the all pointsa guy wanted for questioning in regard to the assault of police officers you see how that looks to a cop like trouble big trouble serious trouble the kind of trouble where you shoot first and ask questions later because this guy is on the sheet for doing cops forget about me do i look dead to you its abbybryce abbott flekyou need to be concerned with here hes the one in danger and honestly youre his only hope right now bullshit its not either its the godgiven truth matthews and i want him alive we need him alive because were not so convinced what his role is in any of this we know david called him from etheredge so what wheres the crime we need to talk to him no matter what he believes my role was in his brothers murder i wasnt the one who beat david to death courtney im not going to be the next guy lying on a slab you and abby watched the news he said so you know we have a hell of a lot of young officers on the job maybe not the best trained at the moment one of those guys sees abby out on the street what do you thinks going to happen and how are you going to feel when you look back and see you could have prevented it bullshit she said a little more tentatively this time wheres he gone courtney boldt asked daphne said you want to be the one who could have helped him but didnt the witness glanced back and forth between her two interrogators both of whom saw opportunity courtney samway would talk if pressured correctly boldt said weve confiscated his van so whats he driving daphne added weve seen the apartment did you know that not your apartmentwe got it tooim talking the rented room in ballard so where does abby have left to go and how does he get there he had better go somewhere because if hes out on the streets the buses the ferries well these young officers are out on the street as well you see where that leaves him courtney boldt took a wild stab wheres it leave you courtney wheres it leave you once he knows youve been brought in for questioning no matter what you tell him the first time he stumbles upon a cop abbys go ing to think you set him up you tell me where does it leave you daphne flashed a look at boldt that suggested he might be stepping on her psychologist toes she didnt need him playing psychologist any more than he needed her playing detective i want a lawyer courtney said now her lips wet and trembling one has been appointed boldt said and is on the way over here count on it i want my lawyer now courtney repeated this time with more of an edge you dont have to talk to us if you dont want to daphne reminded but it might be in your best interest either way we cant leave you alone right now so youre stuck with us you dont know him she mumbled the cracks widening why dont you tell us daphne suggested theres like a switch in him you know ive never seen anything like it when davie died just then her young attorney burst into the interrogation room a blur of briefcase and words violation of rights protecting my client boldt had heard it all too many times before well give you five minutes he announced courtney samway looked over at daphne and with a frightenedsounding voice she whispered snookers the bar he hangs there chapter snookers was a bikers bar a beer and pool hall with two voluptuous waitresses who wore plastic cowboy hats and tight jeans the bartender was the size of sasquatch when boldt and gaynes entered all but a handful of the twenty or so men in the bar noticed the pair immediately a half dozen slipped quietly toward the back exit there these seven men encountered four patrol officers that boldt had assigned to watch the back door two of the seven escaped the remaining five were pushed up against a brick wall and searched boldt and gaynes walked past the back pool tables and let the screen door slam shut on their way out a patrolman informed boldt we lost two of them lieutenant of whats left we got two handguns a blade some pot and what looks like cocaine only one guy is clean out of all of them well take the clean one first boldt informed the man after studying each face for flek and not finding him addressing the group as a whole boldt announced loudly were seattle pd we have a few questions gaynes spoke deliberately and slowly to the group bryce abbott flek abby information or whereabouts buys you an instant out david ansel flek davie abbys brother recently deceased information buys you an out boldt dragged the clean suspect away from the others out of earshot gaynes at his side the officers kept the other suspects engaged to the wall he said you get the first shot at a hall pass you cant hold me the young man complained on what charges he had some latino blood in him maybe some asian as well he was short but solid he wore leather jeans and air jordans gaynes fished out the mans wallet we can run your name though bci and see if youve been a good boy or not if youre on parole and any of these others guys turns out to have a record well then thats a violation isnt it do whatever you have to do but you cant hold me and i dont have shit to say to you gaynes stepped up like she was ready to hit him boldt signaled her to back off boldt said who are we interested in over there indicating the lineup against the wall third guy black hair name of robert knows the one youre looking at gaynes returned the wallet we know who you are we know where to find you if youre blowing smoke at us no way he mentioned this guy abby okay the kid admitted heard him saying something about him take off boldt said releasing the kid the third one from the left a tall lanky kid had junkies jaundice and the smell of a boozer as one of the two caught carrying a piece boldt had a noose to hang him he led the man away from the others and launched into a discussion about unregistered handguns and mandatory prison time it won the mans attention abby flek boldt said adding no editorial guy has flipped out what was your business with him me no business man gaynes encouraged a closer intimacy with the brick wall think harder she said no business with him gaynes leaned her knee between the mans legs and then lifted her leg sharply that gun you were carrying is going to cost you a year the lieutenant here has run out of patience and so have i you want the year you keep telling us you had no business with him because were too busy to give you a second chance got it hardware the man said weapons boldt said lets just say im connected okay lets just say youre a collector gaynes corrected sound good nothing illegal about collecting a few weapons whatever abby has lost it okay the guy will start a fight over anything he comes to me im not about to say no of course not gaynes said but i couldnt say yes either because my connections he said straining to meet eyes with gaynes my collection he corrected i didnt have what the man was looking to score which was boldt asked semiauto long rod russianbuilt was okay but he wanted a particular german scope a snipers rifle she asked incredulously way out of my league the guy said and then some boldt said wondering if he was the intended target he added when was this three maybe four oclock today boldt gasped they were only eight hours behind the man and you referred him to a fellow collector gaynes said leading him on what would you have done and the name of this individual this fellow collector she said macallister the guy whispered so quietly that boldt wasnt sure it had come from his lips i know macallister gaynes told her lieutenant she slammed the suspects groin again and warned this blows up in our hands and were coming after you understood yeah i got it cause if macallister hasnt heard of this guy right or wrong its your ass were coming after and there will be no second chances so take a moment to contemplate your existence my friendto ruminatebecause you gotta be good with this and im smelling that this is some bad shit youre peddling manny wong the man corrected not macallister manny wong down in the district most of his stuff is chinese but abby said chinese was okay as long as he got that german scope dont know him gaynes warned boldt never heard of him thats all right boldt answered i know someone who knows everyone down there chapter the woman reminded boldt of orson welles in a muumuu she wore a piece of black embroidered silk big enough to wrap a small car on her shoulders pink hummingbirds flew toward vivid red blossoms tiger faces with sequined eyes roared from her ribs ivory bone buttons speared through silk loops and strained at her enormous girth he felt grateful she wore her teeth for in the past he had found it hard to understand her pidgin english without them her eyes appeared as black half moons beneath the arcing chinese curve of her painted eyebrows her face in a permanent blush behind the applied rouge puffy cheeks reminiscent of dizzy gillespie mama lu sat enthroned in a huge rattan chair a gigantic rising sun woven into the chair back above her looking like a second head two black enameled chests flanked her their surfaces as lustrous as mirrors the secondstory room where she met them was rather dingy accessed by a narrow stairway from the butcher shop of the korean grocery store below but the rooms contents belonged in a museum collection as did this woman mr both she said she had never pronounced it correctly great lady he said allow me to introduce one of my detectives roberta gaynes mama lu gaynes said using the womans street name roberta mama lu returned to boldt she said i heard of yamoia sent small gift to hospital boldt imagined something grandiose despite her surface modesty placing a pudgy swollen pale hand on her enormous bosom she said heart made sad by this its why ive come boldt explained sit she instructed we wont be staying boldt said but thank you you must eat she said looking him up and down you are not eating why a woman or work boldt felt his face flush and wished that gaynes was not there to witness it he said quickly were after the person who did this to lamoia and mama lu can help the woman inquired hopefully a gun dealer named manny wong we think hes had contact with the individual responsible for lamoia gaynes added we mean no trouble for mr wong when mama lu squinted at a person it felt as if all the lights in the room were dark and a hot spotlight switched on in their place gaynes took a small step backward police always trouble mama lu informed her to boldt she said present company excepted what is offer shes right boldt said indicating gaynes no tricks all we want to do is talk to manny wong far as im concerned when he walks out of that interview room i forget his name and ever having heard it me too gaynes said though mama lu didnt want to be hearing from her just questions the great lady repeated testing them thats all boldt confirmed answers to those questions she had to physically turn her wrist with her other hand the watch face hid in a massive gob of silver and pieces of turquoise the size of quarters you will be at public safety in one hour she checked with him thatll work boldt agreed he comes in voluntarily she reminded if hes helpful you return favor next time he may need it i can do that boldt assured her the tradeoffs bothered him and always wouldthey kept him awake at night this long list of favors owed but he never let them affect his negotiations you couldnt work the streets based solely on principle it just wasnt possible deals begot deals mama lu sucked at her front teeth boldt feared they might be about to fall out and he wanted to spare himself the sight as well as her the embarrassment she said i do this for yamoia and peggy wan addressing gaynes she explained my niece she like yamoia very much gaynes nodded boldt noticed the beads of sweat on her upper lip not much could make gaynes break out soup she tried again rain check boldt asked but then thought she wasnt familiar with the expression another time he said she pouted and nodded you wait too long to visit poor old woman said one of the richest women in the city soup always hot she offered boldt looked at his own watch for the sake of reminding himself one hour he asked no worry mr both mama lu not forget she smiled the dentures pearly white not forget anything manny wong carried his large head on bent subservient shoulders and peered out of the tops of his eyes straining to catch some of the glass in his smudged bifocals his forehead shone his ears too large for his body looked like small wings boldt sensed a wolf in sheeps clothing the man had thin moist lips and bad teeth that whistled with some words a sniper rifle gaynes said the news that flek had possibly acquired such a rifle had been included in the be on lookout as a matter of safety rumors were al ready circulating that boldt was the intended target chinese manufacture she looked remarkably fresh if she felt fatigue she didnt show it this is the man who purchased it she slid a mug shot of bryce abbott flek across the table and in front of wong she held it in place with outstretched fingers wong wouldnt touch ithadnt touched anything since hed removed the driving gloves he wasnt going to give police any prints they didnt have and they didnt have his never would as far as he was concerned boldt and wong had run the rules of engagement for the better part of the last half hour wong careful not to get a foot snagged in an unseen trap for his part boldt had not mentioned the kid interviewed behind snookers by name german scope wong said scope very important maybe he had used such scope before maybe he only read about it maybe just trying to sound like he knew what he was talking about get better price the range of the weapon and accuracy boldt asked with that scope sighted correct if weapon handled by expert three four hundred yards amateur if he rests on a mount two hundred yards no problem on shoulder a hundred a hundred and fifty yards he can still hit target semiautomatic boldt stated magazine holds thirtytwo one in the chamber thirtythree a child could empty the magazine in a few seconds boldt realized wong never lifted his head his eyes floating in magnification and the rosy fatigue of red webbing meeting eyes with boldt he mumbled cops and guns i never understand police youre sure its him boldt said indicating the photo boldt felt those thirtytwo shots in the back of his head fifteen hundred dollar sure you see what he was driving gaynes asked no his clothes boldt questioned jeans leather jacket i think boots boldt asked sneakers not remember not see mans feet ever sold to him before no how about this man boldt asked producing a photo of david ansel flek the younger brother never seen him hes in possession of the weapon then gaynes asked he owns weapon yes she asked about possession boldt reminded him the man fixed his attention on boldt but said nothing the scope boldt inquired those eyes roamed around behind the smudged glass again ill take that as a negative boldt said thats correct he still has to pick up the scope boldt stated glancing hotly at gaynes as he sensed an opening that would be correct the man repeated when use new internet site called iship delivery guaranteed tomorrow ten oclock ten oclock you told him that boldt said after lunch he corrected need time check merchandise to sight the scope for him gaynes suggested both men looked over at herwong with an urgent appraisal that came too late boldt with respect the gun dealer said nothing gaynes said if youve handled the weapon before its used to kill somebody you could be accused as an accomplice especially if we lift a print the man smirked at this impossibility even without your prints on it boldt said so be glad none of this is on the record gaynes asked what distance did he want you to calibrate it for cops and guns the man repeated shaking his head answer the question boldt said a hundred and fifty to two hundred yards the man replied so hes planning on firing from the shoulder boldt said a hundred fifty yards that is request that is what i deliver no gaynes told him firmly youll sight it for fifty to seventyfive yards the first shotsll fly low the man shook his head not possible my reputation seventyfive yards gaynes repeated he maybe test weapon the man complained with your reputation she mocked i doubt it maybe hell sight it maybe not if not then maybe we spare his first intended target a bullet she ended this sentence with her eyes on boldt who felt chills run down his spine boldt said well collar him before he ever gets the chance to fire that weapon maybe we will gaynes said turning to wong boldt informed the man were going to need you to put one of our people behind your counter with you wong shook his head vehemently those haunting eyes rolling like dice boldt had to amend the deal hed made with mama lu and it bothered him to do so and if you wont agree boldt continued well detain you indefinitely and put our guy in your place chapter seattles reputation as a rain forest was largely undeserved it was true that during the rinse cycle november through march northern pacific storms tracked through regularly leaving the city without so much as a glimpse of the sun sometimes for weeks at a time true that spring and fall saw their fair share of partly sunny days that were actually partly rainy as a thick and dreary mist fell broken by moments of spectacular sunshine the warm power of which could almost evaporate the moisture before the next wave of clouds passed over but for all those stereotyped storms and images of umbrellas and slickers presented by the weather channel the glory days of clear skies a light breeze and sixty degrees were just as common the moisture brought lush vegetation wonderful gardening and clean streets the air fresher and purer than perhaps any other city in the country boldt and gaynes orchestrated their plan to capture flek as he arrived to pick up his rifle scope the international district lay under a rich summer sky the air crisp and clean seagulls flew down the city streets their cries echoing off buildings the towering snowcapped peak of mount rainier loomed impossibly close as if part of a hollywood backdrop it was a day when liz would tell boldt to pinch yourself that good you with me l t gaynes asked from the shotgun seat whats that with their unmarked van parked a block from the street entrance to manny wongs electronic repairs shop boldt and gaynes had an unrestricted view of the surveillance target asians peopled the sidewalks and occupied the vehicles in proportions that made caucasians stand out for this reason boldt and gaynes stayed put behind the vans tinted windows and although the departments demographics prior to the flu had included dozens of asian patrol officers and detectives the suspensions and firings imposed by the chief had drastically reduced their numbers to where boldts field team consisted of detective tom dooley kwan currently inside the shopand three relatively green patrol recruits out on the street in plainclothes a twentysomething african american danny lincoln playing the role of a bike messenger who on one knee was busy with what looked like a blown bike chain a middleaged vietnamese woman jilly hu outside the shop looking left and right as she acted out anxiously awaiting a ride her hands occupied with the ubiquitous cellular phone and a third man russ lee a chinese american in a wheelchair with a blanket over his lap concealing a loaded assault rifle keeping speed with the first rule of engagement never be outgunned hu and lee were partnered lincoln and dooley were soloon their own four patrol cars two uniforms each maintained a threeblock perimeter in case backup was needed gaynes explained i was saying that its kind of eerie without all the normal radio chatter boldt reminded her that the bicyclist danny lincoln was wearing a radio headsetas so many messengers did it happened that lincolns headset connected to spd dispatch they had jilly hu on the cell phone dooley wore a wirea concealed transmitter and receiver they werent exactly in the dark the police coverage of the rifle sight pickup had been hastily thrown together as the impending moment drew nearer boldt feared that if it went wrong they might not only lose a suspect but someone might get hurt he had lamoia to remind him of that whats your take boldt asked gaynes she had a nose for such things not great same here our people look good its not that she said and i think its smart that we have dooley working in the back of the store not out front at the counter thats way more natural than if dooley is just loitering out front and making flek nervous and maybe its just all the goddamned asians milling around these streets but something feels wrong about it you know like its going to go south yes i know boldt conceded doesnt mean it has to no it doesnt he agreed maybe its just everyone warning us what a crazy son of a bitch flek isthe hairtrigger temper the violent nature i hate that shit maybe its thinking about sanchez and john and how this guy doesnt seem to give a shit about us wearing badges you know whats that about downright disrespectful id say boldt said she grinned into her slight reflection off the glass downright right you are i think you can take sanchez off his list though we wont know until we collar him he did lamoia hell pay for that he told her about sanchezs inability to id flek and of her earlier uncertainty concerning who was responsible a large ben and jerrys truck momentarily blocked their view of the gun dealers storefront after the truck passed boldt saw that lee hu and lincoln had all adjusted their locations signaling a development the cell phone in hus hand carried an open line to gayness right ear gaynes wore a small headset attached to her cell phone to keep her hands free she mumbled into the headset and then informed boldt a caucasian female just entered the store boldt turned up the volume on the dashmounted police radio receiver being in the back room dooley kwan and his rf microphone provided no insight into the goingson in the front of the store boldt desperately wanted to know what was going on the slightest movement on kwans part resulted in a scratching through the receivers small speaker you turn that up any louder gaynes commented and were going to hear him sweating description boldt requested gaynes repeated the request into her headset poking the earpiece firmly into her ear to hear kwans reply she reported female late teens early twenties caucasian fivesix fiveseven platinum courtney samway boldt said flek sent her to pick up the scope for him he had an undercover team in place following samwaylater that day he would have heard about this visit in the teams daily report albeit too late he used the radio to notify her surveillance team to leave the area he didnt need any additional confusion they transmitted samways identity to dooley kwan and informed the others to follow the suspect if and when she left jilly hu on foot danny lincoln by bike the radio picked up dooley as he responded to wong boldt and gaynes listened intently the exchange was brisk dooley delivered fleks scope to the front of the store at which point his concealed microphone picked up the conversation in the room wong told samway tell your friend all sales are final the modifications he requested have been made and that next time i wont deal with a gobetween its not how i do business whatever the woman said he just asked me to pick the thing up for him i dont know what he wants with some microphone anyway its her boldt said to gaynes recognizing the voice it must be in a microphone box gaynes nodded yup the girlfriend i overheard her in the box gaynes said you think its conceivable she doesnt know what it is i think he does her thinking for her if thats what youre asking over the radio wong said a hundred and fifty for the modifications he only gave me a hun courtney samway complained she was fifty dollars short boldt checked that the cassette hubs were spinning he said that connects her pickup to a man and we already have her connected to flek thatll help delgato in terms of arrest warrants she complained does us no good without the collar notify the street team the mark is good boldt ordered and remind them that flek may have simply dropped her off he could be in the area boldt then radioed spd dispatch and dictated instructions for the uniforms in the patrol cars for securitys sake the messages to the patrol cars would be sent over the vehicles onboard mobile data terminal mdt these digitized text messages were impossible to intercept he wanted his team alert if flek was in the area he probably had the assault rifle in his possession scope or no scope it represented lethal firepower wong and samway argued money over the radio worn by dooley samways voice said faintly hang on let me make sure he only gave me the hun boldt didnt want wong to refuse her the scope he needed that scope to lead him to flek what do you know samway said i had it all along next time no gobetweens wong complained heard over the radio i no do business with gobetweens yeah yeah the young woman scoffed a doorbell rang softly signaling her departure courtney samway appeared on the sidewalk in front of wongs store doesnt look like a stripper from here gaynes said boldt watched and listened as his crew kicked into gear jilly hu followed on foot danny lincoln fixed the chain mounted the bike and pedaled out into traffic samway walked west boldts team followed he and gaynes carefully monitored the radio lincoln informed dispatch that samway had boarded a bus gaynes asked eastbound or westbound damn boldt shouted traffic blocked by a doubleparked bread truck wonder bread gaynes said reading the back of the delivery truck wouldnt you just know it as the eastbound bus pulled away from the curb samway aboard boldts team scrambled to followalthough to look at them one would not detect the slightest bit of anxiety this in case flek was himself watching boldt drove the van with gaynes as shotgun lee drove a ford with hu as his passenger danny lincoln pedaled furiously on the bike predictably in tortoiseversusthehare fashion the bike outpaced the slower vehicular traffic and kept up with the bus lincoln reporting its location block by block dispatch reported that phil shoswitz had arrived to act as the surveillance teams coordinator shoswitz knew his way around mobile surveillance the bicyclist kept up with the eastbound city bus without much trouble due to the vehicles frequent stops shoswitz deployed the ford the van and four cruisers around an extended perimeter as a safety net the chess match had begun boldts team had to prepare for samways departure at any bus stop at the same time they had to be prepared to follow a moving bus the strategy paid off courtney samway disembarked the line and gathered with others awaiting the unaware that just fifteen feet away a plainclothes policeman monitored her every movement samway placed a quick call from a corner pay phone a call that was not monitored but would be the cause of much legal wrangling immediately following deputy prosecuting attorney lacey delgato would battle with the courts to be given access to the pay telephones call sheet a situation that had legal precedent on her side but a liberal courts policy toward expectation of privacy working against her boldt believed absolutely that the call had been placed to flek in all probability to a cell phoneacross the street across town across country he couldnt be sure until that call sheet was made available what does it matter gaynes asked its bound to be a cloned phone its not like well lift a physical address triangulation boldt answered its got to be a cell phone that works in our favor cellular service providers possessed software to locate an individual cellular phone using radio triangulation methodology developed for the military in world war ii currently the technology was used to locate emergency calls placed from cellular phones law enforcement had been quick to take advantage of the existing technology tracking down drug dealers and gang members the technology was currently slow however and boldt was caught unprepared to deploy it what do you want to bet gaynes replied shell lead us to him anyway then she added oh yeah i forgot you dont bet boldt said i think hell park her for a whilean hour an afternoon a day keep an eye on her himself maybe just let her stew the guy knows us knows the way we think hes been in and out of the system his whole life his brothers dead hes wanted and on the run pissed off that too depending on that temper of his he could exercise some patience at this point theres no real rush other than staying away from us you overestimate him she disagreed hes an impatient wild man and if we believe samway his one purpose at the moment is to take you out for getting his brother killed thats urgent thats pressing ask daphnehes irrational unpredictable and impatient that call she just made he called her in weve got this skel samway rode the broadway bus north for eleven blocksa cop sitting a few rows behind herand then disembarked in front of a seattles best coffee where she drained the next hour off the clock jilly hu entered the same establishment wearing a scarf over her head and read the paper and sipped tea for this same hour one eye on the suspect another ready with her cellular phone by the time samway departed the coffee shop shoswitz had unmarked cars in placeready to continue the game of chess boldt and shoswitz remained in constant contact the radio hummed with activity boldt lived for these moments when an hour had expired samway reboarded the the northbound broadway bus jilly hu remained behind in the coffee shop youre biting your nails lt gaynes said you dont normally do that boldt glared her timing was off he envisioned the movement of the various cars as shoswitz redeployed them fully aware that flek could be on any street corner or waiting in a car nearby youre thinking hes a planner gaynes said reading well his steadied concentration i am that hes waiting out there watching for us tracking her boldt said like a stalker and if he spots us hell never make contact with her again itll be the last we ever see of him he sensed something from gaynes what i have a hunch youre gonna hear from him lt the rest of us maybe not but you hes not through with you thanks boldt said thats reassuring i call em as i see em which is on account of why id like to see us catch him first well at least were in agreement there broadway teemed with college kids restaurants record stores grocery stores moviehouses on foot it would prove far more difficult to follow her given the environment thankfully samway remained onboard the bus at the busiest stops when she did disembark it was to transfer from the to the a move that left shoswitz hustling through bus route schedules but gaynes knew the putting their van a jump ahead of the rest of the surveillance teams it goes through montlake to the udistrict boldt speculated he wants her in areas where there are a lot of kids her age first broadway now the u we can beat the bus there lt and get me into the fieldonto the street if she tries to use the crowds to lose us im already on the ground and running boldt felt somewhat obliged to let shoswitz orchestrate the manpower but gaynes was right they had a window of opportunity and though a gamble it seemed worth taking reading his thoughts gaynes said bluntly this woman is not getting off in montlake lt he wants her in the u boldt turned away from his assigned route without reporting in while the radio spit static as shoswitz hurried to comprehend bus route gaynes reached for the radios microphone we gotta call it in lt wait boldt instructed he continued north on th avenue making for university bridge as shoswitz began to bark orders boldt keyed gaynes to report that they were already under way to the university bus stop we dont know shes headed to the u shoswitz objected over the radio boldt took the microphone from gaynes and said yes we do captain im getting there ahead of time to put gaynes on foot youll stay in formation shoswitz ordered were crossing university bridge ill report when we have gaynes deployed he put his foot to the gas in part to cover the sound of shoswitz screaming by the time the pulled to a stop and samway disembarked clutching the box given her by manny wong boldt was parked across the street from the universitys transit hub while gaynes watched from inside a nearby kfc for all his efforts shoswitz had outsmarted himself with two cars stuck in traffic hed been reduced to boldts van and a couple of cruisers with the cruisers unable to show themselves for fear of scaring off samway boldt and gaynes led the surveillance samway headed out on foot into the crowds of college kids she keeps checking her watch gaynes reported now following on foot ten minutes passed by which time shoswitz had reassembled his crew the ford driven by lee and now once again with jilly hu as passenger parked on th avenue danny lincoln amazed everyone by arriving on his bike his messengers backpack strapped on tightly were coming back toward you gaynes reported i smell another bus this guy is careful boldt relayed the information to his team believing flek may have used the stop as part of his plan while samway walked around the u flek could buy himself time to move to the next location and set himself up with a viewpoint thankfully no one from boldts team had followed her off the bussomething flek may have been watching for boldt reported his theory to shoswitz warning that flek might be a step ahead at each phase of samways progress suggesting the cruisers be pushed out well away from the center of the action shoswitz concurred the team now came down to boldts van and the ford samway led gaynes right past boldts van reentered the transit hub and boarded the whose electronic display carried the words northgate p amp r gaynes slipped in beside boldt now he wants to lose her in the mall she said hes watching boldt warned it gets tricky now boldt drove on the bus headed north again traffic became the nemesis to part the traffic with a light or siren was unthinkable and yet both boldts van and lees ford fell farther and farther back as traffic worsened this keeps up gaynes warned and we lose her suggestions we slip over to eighth or fifth running parallel and use our stuff if we have to i like it boldt said he nudged his way left his blinker flashing a navigator let him through with a polite flash of its headlights the ford remained behind the bus gaynes called in the change of plans was about to suggest that shoswitz said it was the only time boldt had smiled in the last two hours boldt ran red lights on eighth avenue and quickly passed the buss reported parallel position gaynes suggested she leave the van upon their arrival at the mall i can be in that parking lot ahead of her the made one stop after the mall we dont know the mall is her destination boldt said gaynes pushed is he going to have her ride the bus all the way out here and then skip the mall he can get her lost in there lt it has to be the mall she hesitated this is one time youre going to have to gamble boldt pulled to the curb to his right he spotted the bus two blocks away also slowing go he shouted gaynes popped the passenger door open boldt watched as she entered the malls vast parking lot a moment later she looked like just another person walking from a parked car toward the mall to his right boldt saw passengers disembark the he studied body types tortured by the agonizingly long stream of peopleuntil finally he spotted samway among them to his relief she still carried the package they had guessed right gaynes would call it gamblinghe might never live this down he looked on as gaynes made visual contact with the mark from a hundred yards away and quickened her pace accordingly keeping an eye on samway gaynes made it into the mall ahead of the young woman a position where marks seldom thought to look russ lee and jilly hu pulled up on the far side of the mall announcing their position to boldt over the radio boldt felt his stomach knot a mall the crush of a thousand shoppers the perfect place to either disappear make a drop or spot a tail all flek had to do was watch from an upper balcony to see if anyone was following samway jilly hu had been used in the coffee shop shoswitz sent lee into the mall as backup for gaynes on strict instructions to keep use of his cell phone to a minimum and then only in believable situations fearing the phone might catch fleks eye five minutes passed in relative silence agony six boldts throat stung of heartburn ten shoswitz wondered aloud over the radio if they should risk sending hu in to assist boldt suggested not its gaynes captain his only explanation of his confidence twelve minutes he felt ready to go in there himself fourteen minutes boldts cell phone rang he let out a long breath it was bobbie gaynes shes moving again lt where west side you should have her right now got her boldt saw samway push through the wall of doors she seemed struck by the warm air get this she bought herself a thong swimsuit you suppose she deducts those things off her taxes she added what now i dont want to stick out we see who picks her up he answered the area surrounding the mall was not a place for pedestrians cars were the preferred mode of transport samway wasnt headed for a car as it turned out but the sidewalk beyond if gaynes followed she would be easily spotted the same applied to danny lincoln who had arrived on the scene riding his bike only moments before the unmarked cars were a possibility but not a good one gaynes made for boldts van lee reported in having returned to the ford boldts team collectively held their breath samway walked behind the mall and north on fifth avenue ne where lee and hu made visual contact she crossed northgate way with the light and walked west boldt and gaynes sat in the front seat listening as lee reported the womans progress gaynes caught sight of her briefly and pointed far off into the distance boldt looked past the interstate worried there might be a car waiting worried it was about to get ugly the motel he said to gaynes as he noticed the tower and sign placed to advertise on the highway you think flek takes a room near the mall it gives him access to public transportation a lot of cover if he needs it the mall being so close the interstate in his front yard flek is inside that motel watching her approach from a window shoswitz barked an order for lee to follow boldt cut in and suspended the orderoverriding a captain send lincoln on the bike he said flek is watching shes heading to that motel chapter she was inside the motel following the resolution of the sickout special operationsspecial opscontinued under the command of patrick mulwright a fortysomething binge drinker part irish part native american who looked about sixty the mans two different colored eyesone green one almost brownlent him a crazed mongrel look that forewarned of his disposition boldt and mulwrights histories went back too far overlapped too much which happened in any organization but was particularly difficult in a police department where lives depended on reaction and response time special ops gained access to leadingedge technology far in advance of any other unit the way the fbi always had the cool toys ahead of any city law enforcement mulwright passed out digital cellular phones with walkietalkie capability to each of the operatives involved although the method of their distributionhaving an undercover street person drunkenly wander the area surrounding the motel pushing a grocery cart in which were hidden the communications devices took an inordinate amount of time the digital devices could not be scanned nor the conversations overheard meaning that all parties surrounding the motel could monitor and communicate via the same walkietalkie channel without concern that flek would hear them at the same time the secure police frequencies remained available for communication back and forth between the field and headquarters at public safety mulwright brought with him longdistance video and audio surveillance highpowered binoculars and monoculars which included night vision capability if needed and four emergency response team officers prepared to put their lives on the line and kick fleks room if and when required to do so the slightly chaotic and scattered attempt to keep samway under surveillance quickly streamlined and took on the feel of a wellrun operation mulwright swallowed his dislike of boldt not allowing it to interfere with operations the police net was carefully structured in concentric circles well out of sight positioned at key intersections several blocks away in every direction four police cruisersradio carsoccupied the four corner posts of a contained perimeter included within this perimeter were boldt and the ford with the wild card danny lincoln still pedaling but now with a police vest hidden beneath his nike windbreaker everyone involved kept a weather eye on the sidewalks in case flek approached on foot the good money had flek already inside mulwright and his special ops command center personnel occupied an oreida panel truck its painted sides and roller door advertising a new thickslice potato chip with thirty percent less fat it was parked on the curb immediately in front of the motel offering the ert team quick access to the motel if needed a lone police sniper under mulwrights authority was positioned on a rooftop west of the motel covering the buildings back side seventy minutes after samway headed inside operation baywatch was in placeso named by mulwright because the motels small indoor pool happened to be peopled to overflowing with bikiniclad women who according to a welcome marquee were attending a presson nail and cosmetics conference judging by the pool not many were attending the seminars when courtney samway was spotted inside the pool area slipping into the hot pool in the recently purchased lime green thong and matching top it was boldt not mulwright who formulated a plan to discover which room she was in and thereby concentrate special ops considerable assets you feel like a swim he asked bobbie gaynes although boldt and gaynes had both been at the stripper club the night they had brought samway in for questioning gaynes and the girl had not met face to face gaynes had gone backstage to the dressing rooms but samway had come out into the club offstage leaving boldt to detain her and get her into one of the cruisers he needed someone in that pool area and he wanted it not only a woman but a woman he trusted in front of all these guys with twentypower mon oculars she returned my thighs forget it try jilly shell knock their socks off boldt disagreed we used jilly out front of wongs store and again in the coffee shop shes used up i could probably pull a woman from one of the radio cars but the inexperience could burn us lt she objected use a guy use milner ive got a feeling he has a great bod under there there must be a dozen women in there bobbie no men i send a guy in and nobodynobodyis going to miss it another woman wanders in nobody may notice im supposed to buy a suit in the gift shop i suppose if they sell them boldt said over at the mall if they dont im sure they do she sighed and real beauties at that i dont want to do this lt if she came down for a dip she brought a room key with her and its probably lying on a towel and if its one of those electronic card keys she asked then you follow her to her floor and do a little police work in a gift shop bathing suit she groaned in a gift shop bathing suit he confirmed and youre going to order me to do this she tested we can go to the front desk and ask about flek flash badges and mug shots but if hes bought off the front desk clerk then we lose lose bigtime if that sevenroundsasecond bullet hose comes into play and i gotta do this now because she wont stay long might not thats true and then we got nothing nothing ill be laughed off the fifth floor you know that lt not by me he said lifting the binoculars and sighting in through the semifogged windows of the indoor pool area shes still there ill have to take a room in order to use the pool well expense it he said and i leave my piece here i suppose on account i gotta change in some ladies locker room or something so you send me in naked she said referring not to the bathing suit but to the fact she would have to leave her weapon behind you go in naked he suggested spinning her meaning and im pretty sure theyll notice you ha ha she returned try not to get noticed okay bobbie and no heroics get inside pull the room number dip your toe and change your mind use your cellular the minute you can but watch whos overhearing ive got two in the hospital already okay bobbie you owe me you watch boldt said youll probably get asked out on dates as a result of this yeah to a spa i cant believe youre serious i cant believe youre making me do this she unclipped her belt holster and left her weapon behind with boldt they both knew he couldnt order her to do this by unclipping her weapon she had just volunteered she pocketed her cellular carry the phone with you if it rings once and stops weve made flek and i want you the hell out of there got it and i mean it about no heroics no heroics she repeated pausing with her hand gripping the door handle she said hey lt its heroic of me to just get into one of those gift shop suits im telling you you owe me it took gaynes longer than boldt had hoped registration shopping for the suit changing into itboldt kept checking his watch by the time gaynes came through a sky blue door wearing a yellow skintight speedo a size or more too small a rainbow set of olympic rings running diagonally up her middle samway had come up the steps of the hot pool and stood there dripping wet boldt thought it was all for nothing but then the teenager walked the short distance to the real pool and slipped down inside for the cooling effect momentarily blocked from view by another woman drying herself off as wolfwhistles carried loudly across the special ops walkietalkies causing boldt to grin bobbie gaynes walked casually relaxed toward the smaller hot pool and stood for a moment before setting down a pink towel boldt could tell from her numb hesitation from his own familiarity with her that something was wrong too many towels too many keys no keys at all something wrong he called over to mulwright to see if the man had picked up similar feelings who woulda thought shed have a set of lungs like that mulwright asked exposing himself to the possibility of a future lawsuit get a load of that who woulda thought for his own reasons boldt thought of daphne at that momentof waking up in her houseboat to find her there in her running clothes he worried the kiss in denver had ruined things between them she seemed to be avoiding him had the kiss been his faultnot something they both wanted he strained to locate gaynes through the binoculars some of the women clearly knew each other or were at least comfortable chatting as they sat waist deep on the pool steps conversations carried on in and out of the water most of the women were a little paunchy two of the thinner girls wore butt floss and postage stamps though even one of these showed cottage cheese in her hind cheeks there wasnt much tan in the room but there was plenty of cleavage a room service waiter delivered what looked like iced teas he watched as gaynes seemed to study the towels and keys by the hot tub he caught himself grinding his teeth not too obvious he wanted to call out across the distance that separated them if he got another officer injured he would turn in his badge he worried for herwondering if there was any chance samway had caught a glimpse of her during her interrogation at public safety a creepy feeling wormed inside him perhaps he had taken too big a chance if samway recognized her for whatever reasonsthen all bets were off he had stranded gaynes there without her weapona fact of which he was painfully reminded by the gun on the passenger seat he checked the binoculars in time to see samway climb out of the lap pool she tugged once on the thong and crossed back over to the hot tub a few older envious eyes followed her as well as those of special ops she swayed without trying conditioned by all those hours on the stripper stage provocative and sensual she lowered herself into the hot water boldt watched as gaynes turned to speak be careful he spoke quietly into the vehicle with only his ears to hear bobbie said i moved the towels getting in pointing behind samway sorry about that samway glanced back at the row of the towels and keys no problem here for the seminars bobbie asked her innocently no thats a great suit thanks bored or maybe the hot water was getting to her samway looked bobbie over trying to see into the water bobbie felt uncomfortable pulling on her own suit she said borrowed it its so small it hurts samway chuckled you ever tried one of these no you should all the comments about butt floss im telling you it feels fine and its killer for the tan line im not exactly the right shape bobbie said what are you twenty or something close yeah well im not not even close she added again making the girl smile one of the women kicked on the jets and bobbie kept quiet while samway floated in a boiling bubble stream gaynes had heard matthews talk about wanting access to suspectsespecially violent suspectsahead of police intervention ahead of the emotional barriers attorneys and defensive postures now she finally understood that urgeshe wanted desperately to get samway talking and to pick her brain for all the juicy details she could extract but she held her tongue briefly a few women climbed out a few more climbed in there was a lot of flesh and not much fabric in the room the talk she overheard centered on the looks of the male presenters at the seminar bobbie tried highway noise bad on your floor samway her eyes closed said didnt really notice you must not be on the second floor bobbie said third samway said im on the highway side bobbie told her scoring one for herself third floor its pretty bad over there weve got a view of the space needle from ours samway said gaynes could take that pronounweto the bank despite the hot water she felt a chill flek was here on the third floor things were going to get ugly its a small room samway conceded but its still a pretty view first time to the city gaynes asked just to sound conversational samway turned toward gaynes and offered a penetrating suspicious look that made gaynes feel queasy one too many questions perhaps or maybe there had been something in her tone or maybe the cop in her just leaked out now and then whatever the case samway recoiled from the conversation like a snake she crossed her arms nervously glanced around the room as if expecting others to be watching her mumbled something about having to go and climbed out of the pool bobbie spun around knowing that this was her moment she had pushed it too far she could no longer wind up in the elevator alongside the girl without it seeming forced she had to get a look at that key that room number but samway cupped the key as she checked to make sure she had the right towel and bobbie didnt get even a glimpse samway glanced back bobbies position in the tub left her looking right up at the girls ass it was then that an overlooked opportunity occurred to her she quickly pulled herself out of the pool and grabbed for her own towel samway wrapped the large towel around her tucked it into her top and slipped her feet into some dutchboy shoes bobbie toweled off and wrapped up as samway made for the door bobbie caught up she had never done anything like thishad no idea how to approach it but felt convinced it was just the trick she needed as they pushed though the door nearly side by side samway clearly uncomfortable said nice meeting you trying to be rid of gaynes i ah bobbie wanted to stall until onto the elevator nice meeting you too she said same here she was more uncomfortable to the point of nausea do you think she said hurrying to keep up with the nervous samway do you really think id look okay in one of those suits they stepped into the elevator samway clearly felt trapped bobbie had mentioned the second floorshe had to push samway pushed and it lit behind her touch the doors shut the elevator rattled as it lifted bobbie pulled off the towel to display herself to the other woman she turned once as if on a runway intentionally awkward she blushed she knew if ever there was a body not to wear a thong it was hers but she wanted to convey more as well when she came fully around and faced samway again she spoke before the other could i think youre beautiful she said in a creamy voice she took a slight step forward just enough to invade samways space she whispered hoarsely i realize this is a little sudden purposely nervous i mean i dont even know your name but if youre not doing anything tonight i mean you want to hit some clubs or something listen youre sweet samway said warmly calming considerably and if you want to try the suit i think you should but im a dancer mens clubs and a lot of my girlfriends are into other girls you know thats fine but not me and besides i gotta work tonight anyway where bobbie said trying to look crushed pleasure palace i mean the suit bobbie said samway parted the blanket and pointed to the logo sewn into the waistband she couldnt resist showing her tiny waist and perfect legs one last time as she did so the key dangled in her left hand the room number facing bobbie bobbie felt her heart skip a beat nike samway said got it over in the mall a sports shop the elevator stopped thanks bobbie said and sorry if i made you uncomfortable she said privately youre very beautiful your body too she felt herself blush again and figured that was okay she stepped off the elevator her knees like water no problem samway called after her have a good one the elevator doors slid shut bobbie pulled the cellular phone out of her rolledup towel and made the call room three twelve she felt ready to faint what if samway had accepted her proposition when the sniper on the back side of the motel confirmed the presence of two adults in room he erroneously mistook samway and her own reflection in a mirror as the movement of two adults it was this officers confirmation that patrick mulwright used to make a raid and therefore ultimately the chaos that ensued moving special ops or ert officers through any public area presented great risk to civilians and enhanced the possibility of operational compromise people tended to either panic or follow when they spotted blackclad figures bearing assault rifles boldt could have assigned any of the detectives to talk to reception but reserved the job for himself his weapon doublechecked beforehand he approached the registration desk and asked to see the manager revealing his identity only by passing a business card never showing his shield or speaking his rank he wore a radio earpiece in his left ear familiar with the floor plan supplied by gaynes the existence of that earpiece bothered him no matter how subtle its look but he saw no way around being connected to mulwrights communication network he simply had to monitor radio traffic in case of developments because of this he kept one hand up to his ear scratching shielding the earpiece from view as best as possible the woman behind the desk looked up boldt repeated softly the manager youre coming with me there was no telling who flek might have bribed the receptionist nodded nervously and indicated a door to the right boldt stepped through a moment later the manager a woman in her midforties had reddish hair and carried a slightly frightened and disapproving look once boldt was introduced he waited for the receptionist sit down we have a situation he said to the manager room three twelve may be harboring a fugitive wed like to empty several surrounding rooms as quickly as possible before conducting our raid ill have to contact the owners boldt said im not here to win your approval i dont need your approval only your cooperation my counterpart simply wanted to kick the room and we already would have if i had not intervened but since we believe the individual in question may be in possession of tactical weapons i prevailed i want to empty those neighboring rooms now right now how telephone boldt answered you call up to each of the rooms and tell them that the smoke alarm system is malfunctioning and that the city safety code requires you to empty everyone from the room theyre to come down the stairs not the elevator quietly and orderly you say you dont expect it will take more than ten minutes or so to clear up all of the rooms on the third floor boldt spotted a diagram on the wall and approached it these four rooms on the third he said drawing the area surrounding these above and below he added first i need to confirm the registration on three twelve the manager typed furiously her troubled eyes more on boldt than the screen robert grek boldt nodded as if this made sense and mr grek has no other rooms in the motel the manager checked the computer only the one king bed smoking very well boldt picked up the phone receiver from the cradle and handed it to the manager sound as natural as possible calm confident the problems going to be resolved shortly youre not at all concerned by this she nodded the receptionist stood sit down boldt said distrusting her not wanting her out of his sight we have a customer she pointed through a rectangle of oneway glass that looked out on the desk the customer will wait boldt announced to the manager he said can you put anyone else on the front desk she nodded her fear more apparent do it the manager summoned an employee named doug to the front desk using the public address system a moment later the man stepped in behind the reception desk call boldt said sternly indicating the phone please he added somewhat sarcastically mulwright was out there preparing his team he didnt trust him to wait we need to do this quickly two heavily armed ert operatives entered the motels north fire stairs exactly five minutes after the last of the managers phone calls two others ascended the buildings south stairs at the exact same moment wearing protective vests boldt lee hu and bobbie gaynes entered the lobby passing the gathering of evacuated families who until that moment had believed their rooms smoke detectors were malfunctioning with the stairwells covered the boldt team split up lee guarding the lobby boldt gaynes and hu dividing up to ride the two elevators so that flek could not slip past boldt had in his possession a master key one of the ert guys carried the steel ram to be used to take out the door jambs interior security hoop boldts pulse hovered around a hundred and twenty mulwright acting as cocommand officerchoreographed each teams movements to coordinate perfectly so that as boldt stepped off the elevator on the third floor one member of each stairwell team was already silently running toward him and room in a flurry of hand signals boldt indicated he would clear s lock to be followed by the ram the order of entry was the two ert men then hu and gaynes and finally boldt the doors lock mechanism made a noise as boldt turned the key any element of surprise lost the second or two that it took the ram to explode the interior hardware felt fatally long to boldt the two blackclad ert men lobbed both a stun grenadea dumb bomband a phosphorus charge white lightninga fraction of a second before rushing the room weapons ready in the familiar leapfrog dance of advance and cover they arrived to find courtney samway lying on the bed in underwear and bra her nose and ears both bleeding from the dumb bomb her hands frantically waving behind her blindness due to the white lightning her screams penetrating even the cement block wall so that they echoed not only down the stairs but out onto the street the tv was tuned to a payperview movie where a police gunfight raged within seconds the room was crowded with all but boldt as the team searched under both beds through the rooms only closet and its small bathroom boldt was first to notice the communicating door that connected with the adjacent room he pointed it out picked up the ram from the hallway floor and signaled for his team to divide all the while his mind grinding through the reality of the situation if flek had taken the adjacent room then the manager on boldts orders had just asked him to come down to the lobby because of a smoke alarm problem flek would have fled the room immediately either remaining inside the motel or disguising himself and slipping out unseen the team raided the communicating room from both sides simultaneously they found an oily pizza box and the recently opened package that samway had delivered empty sid would later find the fingerprints to confirm it bryce abbott flek had escaped and boldt had helped him to do so chapter the minute he got the phone call from the manager he pulled on a pair of boxer shorts threw a towel over his arm and headed down to the pool samway said from the other side of the cigarettescarred interrogation table in the box mulwright boldt and gaynes occupied the other side of the table samway wore an extralarge black police windbreaker to cover herself the effects of the stun grenade had required a visit to the emergency room costing boldt precious time she had punctured an eardrum and wore some foam padding over her left ear but other than that was medically sound the rifle boldt asked i aint saying nothing about no rifle she replied not until i see me a lawyer young lady boldt addressed her you are in legal quicksand the more you move the deeper you sink do you understand weve been through this attorney thing before one has been assigned to you and is on the way just like last time but just like last time you are far better off to cooperate now and save yourself some heartache in a backpack he carried it with him samway continually glared angrily at gaynes recognizing her from their pool encounter after a long stare she complained dyke bitch she told boldt she hit on me boldt wondered if flek had walked right past the front desk right past that oneway glass in the office it seemed unlikely he said i would have seen him in the lobby theres an entrance to the pool from the weight room on the second floor jilly hu informed boldt and we didnt hear about it boldt thundered we knew about it mulwright countered its on the floor plans of the building he said referring to the city fire departments data we redeployed assets to cover the various exits higher priority boldt complained you did this after the suspect had already fled the building hey mulwright countered dont lay that shit on me you were the one wanted to wait i was the goguy if wed have gone like i said we shoulda then it wouldnt be this bimbo in the chair it would be our boy who you calling a bimbo moon face samway countered shouting because her voice could not adjust to the temporary loss of hearing in the one ear you lap dancer im calling you a bimbo and you know what im wrong bimbos a compliment to a slut like you youre street trash whoring for some asshole who goes around beating on people and heisting vcrs you think thats a man you been spreading em for you think he didnt know what was coming leaving you behind in the room like that he coulda got you killed you know that you understand that you think he cared he tell you the police were coming did he no he didnt did he i can see it on your face he burned you he sacrificed you sweet tits and you know what hes laughing over some beer somewhere he skates while you get the dumb bomb and here you are de fending him protecting him give me a fucking break what do you mean beating on people of everything mulwright had said to her this is what stuck boldt said we mentioned the assaults the last time we talked to you she squirmed maybe shed been high the last time maybe she didnt remember boldt explained we think he broke the neck of a woman police officer hell break your neck someday when hes tired of whats between your legs mulwright added dream on pizza face he dont get tired of it you ever seen me dance the only dancing youll be doing where youre going will be for some bull dyke whos got you in her love pack for the first time samways composure cracked the men missed it but bobbie gaynes recognized the womans vulnerability from their conversation in the elevator you realize that dont you gaynes said cutting off boldt before he could speak sergeant mulwright is right about that you play dumb with us and youll be locked up you go to trial with what weve got youre an accessory to firstdegree assault with your record youre screwed youll be sentenced to an adult womens correction facilitymedium security most likelysix to a cell thirty in the showers at the same time and the hell of it is not only will the dykes make claim to you make you do things youve never dreamed could be done by two women but the screwsthe guards men mostlywill make you go down on them for a pack of cigarettes a pack of gum anything and everything you want and youll want it allbut theyre the ones who get it she waited a moment and informed the other we try to fix the system reform it we really do but im not so sure its even possible anymore you know no matter how hard we try the bigger women are going to take lovers and a bad screw is going to slip through every now and then we can keep you away from all that boldt said picking up on the angle they got the virus in those places mulwright said his eyes wet and unflinching your tongues going to be tasting some virus sweetheart thats enough boldt barked sharply jesus he moaned a knock came on the door sheila hill leaned her head inside and summoned mulwright a look of complete disgust on her face as he reached the door she grabbed onto his shirt and hauled him out of the in terrogation room her anger carrying through the door as she closed it again gaynes apologized to the suspect that was uncalled for sorry about that samway looked paralyzed she muttered i want me a lawyer ones coming boldt said would you like us to leave the room gaynes offered for the sake of the cassette player running no a confused samway said what do i have to do some place we could find him boldt said tinkers she came back quickly with it and boldt trusted it for this reason tinker bell gaynes asked the suspect to boldt she said a fence down in kent she added i forget his real name billy teddy burglaryll know samway nodded and whispered he does business with tinker but if you raid tinkers abbyll know it was me and if he knows it was me who talked not necessarily boldt said we can get around that ive heard him speak to tinker on the phone the phone boldt mumbled he clones phones we know that we need the number of the phone hes currently using he was thinking back to his own idea of triangulationmaybe flek would lead them right to himself the number called from the etheredge facility had not been used since his brothers death boldt needed the current number billy bell is his real name i think gaynes interrupted still stuck on remembering the name of the fence she repeated burglaryll know you keep me out of jail samway demanded though weakly you get me into one of them places where they play volleyball and stuff like that minimum work release something like that we need the cellular phone numbers hes using boldt repeated if you supply us with those phone numbers then maybe tinker never connects our visit to flek meeting eyes with boldt she studied him this offer clearly appealed to her phone numbers she asked emphasizing the plural hes got only the one cell phone anymore she waited expecting boldt to chime in but he simply maintained the eye contact and waited her out you guys got the others when you raided his pad boldt waited her out tell me what i want to hear he said ive got the number she assured him boldt pulled out his pen and started writing chapter i wanted you to hear this boldt told daphne who occupied one of the two chairs on the other side of his desk in part because sanchez is still your investigation he reminded he could tell she had gone for a morning run because it flushed her cheeks with color throughout the day she wore a pink buttondown oxford a small gray skirt and black leggings she smelled sweet but not overpowering typical of her he motioned to bobbie gaynes she gave me a partial report over the phone lets hear daphne said gaynes said burglary raided three fences including billy bell in order to pull the attention off the flek case and lessen samways exposure all three were caught with hot merchandise in their possession and all three shown photo arrays that included flek bell ided flek as part of an agreement for a walk burglary ran descriptions of the electronic gear flek had stolen from the various housesthe makes models and some serial numbersand bell was good for most all of it he not only remembered it coming through his shop but had computer records of actual serial numbers in a bunch of cases modern criminals boldt mumbled they never cease to amaze me most all of it daphne quoted repeating what gaynes had said why most and not all because none of the sanchez gear could be accounted for by bell with the fifth floor busy once again there was never silence in boldts office but no one spoke for several long seconds and it felt like silence to him he said we can invent explanations for that right as rain gaynes agreed boldt suggested flek tossed the gear because it was tainted by the assault entirely possible gaynes agreed this guy daphne asked not this guy no you invited me in on this for my professional opinion this seemed aimed at boldt he does a job he wants some reward hes a hardened criminal she reminded him is he going to scare off because he threw some woman down the stairs or snapped her neck from behind boldt amended dixie cant rule out that possibility daphne asked gaynes how much can we trust what bell says not much she conceded but i happen to trust it in this case he knows about lamoia and sanchez along with the rest of the city he knows we mean business daphne said so when the sanchez assault is re ported by the papers to be an officer flek tells bell to ditch the gear gaynes replied possibly but then billy bell would remember that gear all the more so daphne complained confused gaynes said i think bell is right with this he has a lot to lose burglary can put him down for the stash they found why toy with us i just dont see it because hes afraid of flek daphne answered just as everyone else seems to be she glanced at boldt trying to judge his reaction but he wouldnt give her that could be bobbie allowed boldt interrupted the point being that if bell is right with this then he fenced most of the gear flek lifted except the sanchez electronics if true that needs explaining we have to listen to that we assume flek did john and as such remains at the top of the departments most wanted meaning what gaynes inquired sanchez failed to pick him out of the photo array daphne reminded them both and at least once she did not discount the possible involvement of more than one person so where are we going with this gaynes repeated impatiently we look the sanchez assault over real carefully boldt said start again build the case from the ground up and try to fit flek into it she worked one of the casesthat ties her to fleks world lets know every thing there is to know we work samway again but we let nothing inhibit the manhunt that remains our top priority he added flek is going to have answers for us but if flek didnt do sanchez gaynes persisted still annoyed by her own confusion then where are we going with this boldt looked over at daphne and meeting eyes saw her concern for him for a woman typically capable of containing her emotions this spoke volumes she knew exactly where they were going with this but it was boldt who voiced it to the devil he answered daphne nodded in agreement in house gaynes gasped then she added oh my god chapter it was a difficult meeting he told liz boldt presented the contradictory evidence surrounding fleks possible involvement with the sanchez assault at a divisional meeting attended by captains hill and shoswitz as well as the captain of detectives and a deputy chief to whom all the captains reported the meeting became heated as boldt suggested that though they suspected flek for the lamoia assault and intended to pursue him to the very edges of the earth questions persisted about the sanchez assault and that he could not rule out the possibility of the involvement of internal personnel deputy chief mcaffrey stated that he would reluctantly assign it to internal investigations for review boldt asked that iis involvement be curtailed until he and matthews had reviewed all the evidence circumstantial and otherwise mcaffrey agreed to give boldt fortyeight hours sheila hill skillfully negotiated boldts cushion to seventytwo boldt left the meeting with a clock ticking in his head in the middle of an active fugitive pursuit as well as at the start of a total case review on sanchez his plate was full he ate a gyro while liz tried the greek salad their relationship sat between them on the table like a tall vase of flowers or a lit candle one cant see past boldt had never felt so awkward in her presence mud up to the axles boldt said after an uncomfortable silence thats how this feels work you and i everything what i feel is a needa real needto get things right and they arent right now we imposed on john and kristin for weeks and that wasnt right we need to have them over to dinner buy them a real special thankyou gift but youre barely home and when you are you dont even talk to me she poked at the salad boldt felt it in the center of his chest i kissed a woman he announced apologetically it tumbled out of him and he felt a flood of relief with the confession it would be work but now they could make real progress she stabbed again and missed she knocked over the bowl spilling oily cucumbers onto the table they slid around like transparent hockey pucks she wouldnt look up at him her lower lip trembled he felt like dying he said it was only the one kiss it stopped at that not that that makes it any better he paused but it was enough to tell me something is very wrong ive let this separation drift us apart i couldnt face you without telling you about it and i couldnt tell you about it without facing you her mouth hung open she had some pepper stuck between her teeth any other day he would have told her about the pepper the fork fell into the bowl she didnt notice who she asked does it matter he scoffed its not who its why then why do i feel jealous she asked why do i feel this is somehow my fault its both our faults boldt said but it doesnt feel that way good she said that somehow makes me feel better she asked emotionally are you emotionally attached it was a single kiss its not an affair but of the heart she asked with difficulty wheres your heart in all this broken at the moment as i imagine yours is but the pieces are all with you elizabeth with us every last piece i need air i need time to think i boldt began but she stood and made for the door her purse trailing by its strap she held herself highever liz boldt felt as if he were swimming underwater consumed in darkness he pushed the food aside his appetite gone wondering what came next he felt sick sick and incredibly cold chapter boldt wished that liz had blown up at him in anger because as it was her levelheaded waitandsee approach only served to increase his sense of guilt boldt wasnt a drinker the only outlet for his frustration was work work consumed him took his mind off nearly anything and he wanted that boldt contacted one frederick osbourne at airtyme cellular and provided him with fleks cell phone number which samway had supplied in the course of her second interrogation osbourne explained that the technology and methodology existed to locate analog cellular phones but that it was not a realtime process he osbourne would begin tracking fleks cellular calls and report back to boldt of all their current efforts to locate flek boldt held to the hope that osbournes radio triangulation would come through sinking back into despair boldt blocked calls prevented visitors and spent nearly four hours in his office reviewing the sanchez jacket which had swollen to a thick file though under daphnes care remained properly organized and easily navigated there daphne was right there in his hands he couldnt seem to escape her he focused his attentions on the brooksgilman casethe investigation that sanchez had taken over in the wake of the blue flu reassignments prior to her assault she had identified that flek used garage door openers to break and enter boldt understood that he had allowed her work on the case to mislead him it was the ii case that seemed more likely to have gotten her beat up the ii case that interested him yet without iis cooperation he didnt know how he might break that case fleks testimony still seemed the most important first step if flek had an alibi for the night of sanchezs assault then boldt had the necessary ammunition to pressure ii into including him in on what they knew about whatever had led to sanchez schock and phillipp all ending up in the hospital he called down to the lab and reached bernie lofgrin he asked about the boots recovered from fleks closet in the first raid what about them lofgrin asked guy i spoke to said they were converse but have you compared the tread pattern to that nike pattern you found on sanchezs leather jacket i have and i sent them to property thats where her jacket is as well mention of property reminded boldt of ron chapman and his visit to the cock amp bull the night schock and phillipp had been mugged property boldt repeated thats right lofgrin said do you ever read your emails i was out of town boldt said spinning around to check his computer seventeen messages in the chaos of lamoias injuries and samways surveillance hed fallen behind he began to scroll through them pulling up the one from lofgrin as the man said into his ear tread pattern lifted from the jacket came back as air nike fleks closet contained two pair of converse all stars both are ubiquitous but theyre not interchangeable not even close same size boldt asked reading from his screen that the impression from sanchezs jacket had been a size flek wears a fourteen lofgrin answered again no match to what we lifted from that jacket he waited lou you there thinking not what you wanted to hear lofgrin stated or you would have hung up on me as you always do do i boldt asked astonished to learn this about himself every time lofgrin confirmed the nike boldt said is it a distinct print you bring me the shoe and chances are i can tie it to sanchezs jacket a little visit to property is all it would take there it was again property he made sure to thank lofgrin before hanging up who said you couldnt teach an old dog new tricks he called down to property riorden answered riorden ran with pendegrass both of them on krish evskis squad krishevski and pendegrass had both been discharged in the chiefs health service sweep riorden had somehow survived boldt elected to skip the small talk by now news of boldt and lamoias latenight visit to pendegrass would have reached riordenhe could do business with the man but he wasnt going to win any friends i need you to check your logbook for me boldt informed him for schock or phillipp boldt said any visits in the last ten days silence on the line let me check riorden replied boldt waited to hear the pages of the logbook turninghe had the ears of a batbut heard nothing not even the clicking of computer keys nothing i see lieutenant you might want to check yourself this time it was boldt who left the silence on the line yeah okay thanks he said knowing his ears had not failed him why hadnt riorden even bothered to check the log out of obstinacy pissed off over boldts questioning of pendegrass did the flu still continue inside these walls the thought that a handful of officers might yet still be sabotaging the efforts of those officers who had remained on their job during the flu stayed with boldt on his extended ride home he stopped at the jokes on you and played six ballads during a break in the comedy routine bear berenson finally interrupted him saying thats some really dark shit youre playing man he drove next to carkeek park and walked the waters edge wondering what to think about riordens apparent refusal to assist him as dusk fell and the sound washed gray from green as radio towers winked and jets flew almost silently overhead boldt felt overwhelmed his personal life was in tatters fellow officers were backstabbing his efforts to set the record straight on sanchez and perhaps schock and phillipp in the process his kneejerk reaction was to call daphne but he wisely ruled that out instead he made the drive home home where he belonged he climbed out of the car accidentally kicking an empty starbucks cup into the driveway as he bent to retrieve it the drivers door window blew out above his head cascading down as a thousand cubes of tempered glass his detectives mind immediately registered that hed been shot atan intended chest shot a kill shot his next coherent thought was flek he edged beneath the car instinctively defenseless but partially protected and less vulnerable he waited for the second shot hoping there wasnt enough of him exposed to take a bullet his heart raced out of control and he wondered if a heart attack might kill him instead ten seconds passed twenty the shot had not made any noise even the window shattering had sounded like little more than a hand clap and pebbles spilling onto pavement he didnt want liz alerted didnt want to bring her to the door for any reason one boldt as a target was enough a long shot boldt thought recalling the rifle manny wong had sold flek probably from on a roof or up in a tree and at a long distance which might explain why he had not heard any report from the weapon not even a trailing echo maybe wong had saved his life by resighting that scope he stayed there under the car collecting himself wondering if a german sniper sight was searching the edge of the car looking for enough flesh to sink a bullet into he heard tapping on a window he couldnt see but he knew it was liz inside the house wondering where he was shed seen his car perhaps she had heard the dull pop of the drivers door glass his kids would be getting ready for bed maybe already in bed the rest of the world was going about its business it took him a moment to extricate his right arm and ease himself out from under the car he didnt want liz to come looking for him shed come home without consulting him for a moment a husbands anger boiled inside him maybe his sniper was doing him a favor could he tell his wife hed just been shot at in his own driveway did he have any choice he squeezed himself out from under the car and ran crouched low to the back of the house he entered through the kitchen door sat liz down and explained that hed just been shot at he wasnt going to tell her to take the kids and leave that would be left for her to decide they embraced boldt felt himself swell with tearsthe fear of the last few minutes wanting an outlet boldt groaned who she asked daphne he answered believing her still questioning the kiss the gun shot she corrected tension steeling who shot at you and what are you going to do about it he leaned back drew his weapon from its holster and checked it as he spoke to her she didnt like that a tension settled between them im going to check the park i think the shot came from there if im lucky i find a shell casing doubtful but worth a try he hurried so that she wouldnt interrupt after that im going to go out there and look for the bullet which is probably the only chance we have for evidence youre going to report it she stated with no uncertainty all theyd do is look for a slug and a shell casing believe me i know how this works and when we find the slug or the shell casing itll be from a chinese manufacture longbarrel assault rifle you do know who it is she said a pretty good idea is all he admitted but that doesnt win convictions they met eyeshers filled with concern then she softened and said lou if youd kissed some waitress at a bachelor party surprising him but this isnt the same thing not even close ive changed over these last couple of years i know that im not so sure you have which is fine let me just say this if you dont want me i dont want you but for the sake of the kids id do anything not to break us up not now not so young anyway im angry with you not so much for what you did but for allowing it to happen ive got my faith to keep me strong what do you have she stepped back and crossed her arms defiantly go find your slug tonight ill sleep with miles for their sake were loving and cheerful in the morning maybe ill wait til morning to look he suggested hoping they might still talk it through you she asked do you know yourself at all maybe not he answered maybe not she agreed youre a cop once and forever her eyes sparked a thought clearly filling her head that look on her face grew with intensity youre a cop meaning our phone is unpublished and always has been your nameour addressis not in any phone book any listing anywhere so how did this guy know which house to watch right i mean thats the point of the privacy of all the secrecy right the internet he wondered aloud i dont know he answered somewhat lifelessly her reasoning bored into him deeper the more he thought about it who was the cop in the family now how indeed he wondered looking at that assassins bullet in a whole new light chapter he spent an hour in the park and found no evidence of his wouldbe assassin he searched his driveway in the dark again nothing in the dim light of dawn boldt methodically searched his driveway a second time flatbottomed wisps like microclouds hovered in the air twenty feet off the ground birds awakened with their percussive morning calls and crackles not yet song someone across the street had npr playing too loudly boldt could almost make out the news stories himself there would be nothing there about the attempted assassination of a cop nothing there about a police manhunt for bryce abbott flek that grew in scale each day presently that manhunt included not only spd but king county police the state sheriffs office and the washington state transportation department nothing on the news about boldts attempt to locate fleks cellular phone while in use when he discovered a small hole in the garages gray clapboard siding the only convincing evidence that drew him to it was the fresh splinters of wood showing seattles dampness aged any exposed wood quicklya week or two and a broken branch or a recently sawed two by four might be mistaken for a year old but these tiny slivers of missing wood surrounding the oddly shaped hole were a golden blond the holes location at knee height puzzled him and it took a moment to convince himself the slug could have ricocheted off the blacktop and landed so high up on the wall but as an investigator he knew better than to doubt the obvious anything could happen he had not thought to look at this height he had cost himself time he dug the slug from the garage wall with a hammer and flat blade screwdriver taking more of the clapboard than necessary to ensure he didnt further damage the slug he wanted it as intact as possible for sids ballistics analysis like an expectant father boldt waited in a formed fiberglass chair inside bernie lofgrins office lofgrin joined his friend at the first opportunity id really appreciate a case number to assign that slug lofgrin said later suit yourself but the work goes down in my log and its easier for all if that numbers attached the computer wont accept it without a number which means it will stand out get noticed be brought to my attention during some forensics audit and therefore to your attention ill call down a number boldt told him oh goodie lofgrin said because by that look on your face i was afraid it was personal and you know the new lab policy about doing personal work for officers no its not personal not that i wouldnt make exceptions for my closest friends lofgrin said still prying but id have to know to make those exceptions well before the computers became involved you can see my point i see your point lofgrin added hows floorshow doing anyway boldt felt a hole in the center of his chest he hadnt checked up on lamoia in days he felt awful about it better i think he said give him my best right here we go lofgrin said indicating a lab woman approaching lofgrins office your ballistics report she knocked on the open door and lofgrin admitted her introducing her to boldt who missed her name she looked first to her boss then to boldt is this some kind of test or something she asked them both clearly irritated to lofgrin she complained does the upstairs brass know that we didnt lose anyone to the flu that we dont need this kind of thing to prove our competency our loyalty to boldt she said are you the messenger here lieutenant ive got better things to do than be tested like this addressing lofgrin she said maybe we should remind the brass that were civilian employees that we have actual active cases to workpressing casesand that school got out for most of us ten years ago throwing the file onto lofgrins desk she said meanly someone tell the person who did this to stop blowing smoke up my ass meeting eyes with boldt she said i quit smoking she stormed off lofgrin grinned i just love a passionate employee he said what the hells going on boldt asked lofgrin opened the manila folder and read from the single page it contained he nodded to himself and smiled oh i get it he mumbled i dont boldt said somebodys pulling your chain on this slug lou no wonder you didnt want to give me a case number you sly dog are you in on this in on what boldt said raising his voice someone is apparently testing us boldt said guessing fired from a chinese manufacture assault rifle can you determine that youre not serious come on this slug this baby was fired from a rifle thats down in property confiscated in that gang raid where williamson and hobner were both shot this is the rifle that winged williamson shes right i mean why waste our time with something like this and you lou a part of it you ought to be ashamed boldt repeated for his own sake this gun is supposed to be locked up in property supposed to be a confused lofgrin replied this is some kind of joke right boldt didnt think so hed been on the receiving end chapter addressing sergeant ron chapman from outside spds property room boldt said ronnie weve got some confusion about a confiscated weapon he handed the man some paperwork from sid it bore a reference number for the rifle that had fired on boldt is that right chapman replied what kind of confusion just need a look at it is all boldt informed him that i can do while chapman consulted the computer boldt flipped pages in the log bookaccomplishing what riorden had refused to do for him help you there chapman inquired looking for visits by schock and phillipp boldt added i asked riorden im not sure he had time to check for me theyre in there somewhere chapman answered dryly theyve been down here since the sanchez assault or before boldt asked flipping more pages looking for the right date couldnt say boldt found the records of sanchezs four visits and worked forward on the next page he found schocks and phillipps signatures again as with sanchez there were no case numbers listed no case numbers he mumbled looking up he caught chapman staring at himsomething was wrong in those eyes though the man volunteered nothing ronnie its down in the warehouse he said the rifle you want a look technically the property room consisted of two different secure storage facilities both located in public safetys subbasements the boneyard located on public safetys ground floor held any physical evidence involved in an active case or any case pending trial within the next calendar year caged and managed by an armed uniform officer of at least the rank of sergeant along with a staff of two or three plainclothes officers per shift the boneyard remained open twentyfour hours a day several years earlier narcotics drugs as the officers called ithad managed to administratively separate the chemical evidence confiscated in arrests from the guns knives magnets and bell bars that typically populated property the drugs evidence was kept locked in a vault inside its offices on the fourth floor just down the hall from burglary propertys second facilitythe warehouseoccupied half of the buildings lowest floor on the same grade as the lower level of spds sublevel parking garage the warehouse was located behind a doublewide fourinch solid steel vault door with a combination tumbler and twokey perimeter locking system and a security alarm that had to be turned off from inside the boneyarda floor aboveno more than five minutes prior to entry all this because the warehouse not only accepted all the overflow weapons and munitions from the boneyard but also the heavier artillery that occasionally surfaced in raids entering the warehouse always gave boldt a chill because of its size and contents the public safety building occupied most of an entire city block and half its basement was one enormous room boldts first reactionno matter how many times he came herewas awe the room was crowded with row after row of floortoceiling freestanding steel shelving and was dimly lit by bare bulbs in the ceiling chapman read from the clipboard dragging himself down aisles of shelves stacked high and deep with tagged items of every description though predominantly weaponsfrom swiss army knives to machetes zip guns to flame throwers house lamps garden hoses gloves of every make and description the space smelled musty despite the constant hum of overworked dehumidifiers chapman said something about ken griffey jrs homerun count boldt barely heard it his gut churning his mind racing sanchez had visited property and had ended up in the hospital schock and phillipp the same boldt had called down to riorden the night before and had nearly been shot he had thought flek had thrown that shot but he had not and where did chapman fit in the property sergeant dragged a rolling ladder down the aisle and climbed high up to the sixth shelf he banged around up there for several seconds descended the ladder and returned to the end of the stack where he verified the row number and letter chapmans movements were lazytoo many years on the job to get worked up over another mans worries that or he was trying to cover for his own nervousness chapman climbed the rolling ladder for a second time he dug around on a shelf and handed down a tagged rifle for a moment boldt felt a sense of relief for his fear had been that the rifle wouldnt be there at all that it had been removed from property and used in an attempt to assassinate him he sniffed the barrel not used recently then he held the rifle at arms length as chapman climbed back down to his level and his chest tightened he fumbled for the label the numbers were right he doublechecked them something the matter chapman inquired sensing boldts disposition its the wrong rifle boldt replied its not even the right make his words echoed in the space his stomach knotted ron chapman looked at him and said oh shit we got problems boldt instructed daphne and bobbie gaynes to meet him in the garden terrace of the four seasons olym pic hotel where he had tea for three and a plate of currant scones waiting although not a regular boldt took afternoon tea at the four seasons whenever he felt he could afford it about once a paycheck neither gaynes nor matthews was fooled by his choice of location they arrived together having walked from the office so lt gaynes said sitting in a chair facing the man and leaving the other half of the love seat he occupied for daphne whats so important that we cant talk about it at the house am i so transparent not wearing that vest youre not daphne said boldt was a big man he carried the protective vest better than most hed bought a shirt two sizes bigger that what he typically wore to accommodate the vest all this at lizs insistence his concession to their negotiation for his return to the job he explained i promised liz id wear it daphne matthews looked pale i think you owe us an explanation he took them through his last eighteen hoursthe attempt on his life the visit to lofgrin the wrong rifle in storage daphne reached out to grab his hand but caught herself and dragged the butter to her plate daphne and butter did not go together so gaynes looked on in amazement someone threw shots at you gaynes gasped one shot boldt answered clinically and it wasnt a warning shot gaynes stared down at the scone on the plate before her well there goes my appetite i have a theory id like to share with you he told them gaynes interrupted daphne seemed frozen in the love seat flek found your crib boldt addressed her and said liz caught that too flek has no way of knowing where we live id have to put him low on the list he let them think a moment and said someone switched out the rifle youre giving me the weebies here lt someone switched out the rifle it is not the weapon confiscated in the williamson shooting sanchez paid four visits to property just before her assault schock and phillipp paid two what if thats the ii case no one will talk about sweet jesus gaynes blurted out the flu daphne whispered knowing him better than others did he found room to smile he appreciated the connection the three of them had lets say that word got out to a select few that the walkout was inevitable that negotiations had broken down lets say that all this happened well ahead of the rest of us ever hearing even a rumor of cancelled overtime the rank and file he said paychecks stop people borrow then the borrowing stops and families suffer so what if a couple of our boys decided they needed underwriting an insurance policy heist some weapons from property and sell them into the market gaynes suggested daphne objected but a weapon was there just the wrong one property cant make a mistake with that inventory exactly boldt said exactly what were supposed to think human error and thats probably what ii was checking up on gaynes disagreed ron chapman would not condone this not ever maybe not boldt agreed but he suspected something or discovered something that put him on to it ive got to tell you he looked as surprised as i was to see the wrong weapon attached to the label then who gaynes asked remember what wong said he asked gaynes remember what he mumbled a couple of times cops and guns he said said it at least twice it bothered me at the time not for the words themselvesi mean the guys a gun dealerbut for the way he said it like he was disgusted or something cops and guns one day theyre selling them to him the next we come along and we want them back daphne followed his logic she said ominously someone tried to kill you with one of those guns are you saying manny wong sold flek an assault rifle that had been blackmarketed by one of us might be flek boldt said might not the sooner we catch him the better gaynes said you have other enemies earlier in the day id been arguing in a closed meeting that maybe flek had not done sanchez that maybe we had to look inside our own ranks daphne said its all circumstantial extremely boldt agreed but it starts to add up gaynes said wong sold one of the property room weapons back to flek isnt that a bit of a coincidence agreed boldt said when we find flek it wont be his rifle that threw the shot we need him in custody we need that rifle for comparison fleks a screwup hes a burglar with a temper he hurt john and were bringing him in for that but its not the only reason hes our top priority flek can help fill in some of the answers whether he knows it or not he added my guess is that at this pointonce my discovery in property gets outthere are people or persons who wont want us to bring him in wont want certain questions answered he added bryce abbott flek has become their scapegoat gaynes reminded them whoever stole those weapons has to have someone from property in their camp boldt suggested who in property would have had inside information that a walkout was imminent krishevski gaynes asked timidly sweet jesus she repeated reaching for a scone to quell her nervous stomach chapter when boldt entered through the back door he knew that something was amiss not only from lizs perplexed expression but from the faint strains of oscar peterson coming from the studyhis music room why would liz play an lp but leave the livingroom speakers off she motioned toward that music mac krishevskis here boldts chest tightened as he stripped off his sport jacket the new shirt and tugged at the velcro strips that secured the vest over his undershirt too hot in this thing he mumbled as he slipped back into his shirt he asked did he call first she shook her head just showed up we talked a few minutes but he insisted i go about my regular stuff and that hed enjoy himself with your collection how long boldt inquired nearly an hour ago i figured youd want to see him thanks the kids were in the living room sarah in front of a video miles building a lego fort they didnt seem to notice him at all krishevski looked older than when they last had met tension filled his eyes the skin surrounding them stained blue with fatigue this was not a pleasure visit mac boldt asked from the doorway of the small room he rolled up his shirt sleeves his study a tenbytwelvefoot dead space partially beneath the stairs was occupied by nearly two thousand vinyl lp jazz albums filed floor to ceiling a twohundredwatt vacuumtube stereo a speaker system with handwrapped copper coils and a single leather recliner within an arms reach of the controls we got business to discuss krishevski said he climbed out of the recliner and offered it to boldt to be polite boldt declined and moved a ladderback chair in from the living room boldt could see liz trying to figure out what was going on he told her no calls please sweetheart im going to speak to mac in private for a few minutes she nodded back he closed the door krishevski turned down the music and returned the recliner to a sitting position not the best news im afraid krishevski said we might have a beer boldt offered thanks anyway civility between two men who were borderline enemies boldt placed his chair and sat down so whole fucking worlds a mess you ever notice that whats on your mind dont shoot the messenger krishevski requested im the one being shot at not doing the shooting krishevskis apparent surprise confused boldt was he that good an actor he wondered boldt continued so if youve come to warn me youre about a day late and at least one slug short i am here to warn you but no matter what you believe im only the messenger and the message is pretty damn simple you get your hands on the video and the video they got never gets shown and what video would that be krishevski reached over and turned up the volume we gotta talk ive got something for you the man making the phone call identified himself to daphne as frederick osbourne of airtyme cellular he continued a lieutenant named boldt left both his and your names in case i had anything and im only getting boldts voice mail information concerning fleks cellular phone she realized her heart leaping in her chest she and boldt had discussed osbourne yes was all she could think to say its not realtime he and i went over that im sorry about that were working on it we have some good ideas actually how we might improve that i explained the various technologies and their limits to the lieutenant when we spoke but i think youll find it interesting would you like to come over to the offices its seven oclock daphne pointed out if you have a location for the suspect perhaps you could just give it to me over the phone she suggested not exactly a location he answered more like a theory i think it better explained in person can you get hold of lieutenant boldt i can try yes youll want to see this before eight oclock at least before eightthirty sorry ive called so late but i only put it all together just now by eightthirty youll have lost him lost him daphne repeated her mind whirring as she realized osbourne believed he had found him ill be right there liz knocked on the door to her husbands study waited a moment and then let herself inside krishevski occupied the throne of the recliner while her husband sat in a chair facing him like a child in the principals office she paused looked her husband in the eye and said phone call for you no calls right now he reminded her politely its her she said says its important she drew the quotation marks in the air ill have to call her back ill tell her liz said she seemed to take pleasure in it she pulled the door shut wondering why the music was playing so loudly and what it was meant to cover the airtyme cellular regional control centerrcsquared osbourne called itoccupied portions of the twentyfirst and twentysecond floors of the columbia center skyscraper normally such real estate would have commanded quite the water view but rcsquared was a blackedout control room that stepped down in tiers to a curving wall of projection screens mapping cellular phone traffic over a sevenstate area that included portions of utah nevada and northern california it looked like something from mission control daphne counted seventeen people at computers all wearing telephone headsets the room was alive with hushed indistinguishable voices wow daphne said sensing that osbourne expected some kind of reaction he checked his wristwatch were pressed for time i wanted to show you what ive come up with so if youd direct your attention to the last screen on the right lieutenant matthews as im sure youre aware he continued the us congress passed a bill requiring us to geographically locate nineoneone calls placed from cellular telephones which presented us with a serious task in terms of the older generation analog phones the new generation digital phones have gps chipsglobal positioning systemsinherent in their technology but the older analog models without the chips have only their signal there are several ways to attempt to locate an an alog cellular phone thats in use and probably a half dozen companies competing for the best methodology he continued all of these methods were derived from the military the two most common are df direction finding and tdoa time difference of arrival both are variations on something called triangulation we use a company out of canada that has taken tdoa one step further into something called hyperbolic trilateralization triangulation and trilateralization work off the same principle if you have three antennas all receiving a radio signal from the same source and you can measure and record the time that a source radio signal arrives at each of those antennas then you can plot the location of that original source signal a cell phone signal lights up several towers at a time sometimes as many as a half dozen or more these towers pass reception and transmission one to the other in whats called a handoff as they determine which is the closer or more optimal tower because trilateralization works at very high speeds constantly measuring the time to base as we call it its method of triangulation is far more accurate than many of its competitors you with me so far i think so the long and the short of it is the older method of triangulation could take several minutes or even hours to process accurately this newer method im talking about is a realtime system with pinpoint accuracy because its measuring a cell phone transmission in nanoseconds and plotting the location accordingly your problem is this he stated full government compliance is not mandated for another eighteen months airtyme has the hyperbolic trilateralization software and of course our firmware network of towers and transmission centers but the two are not yet fully married adding to our difficultytwo of the three towers we may be using to measure time to base may belong to one or more competitors they will gladly provide us the tdoa data but it takes time to arrange we estimate full network compatibility in ten months youre losing me she admitted you do or do not have a way to locate that cell phone number lieutenant boldt gave you with the help of our competitors we can run the software on data previously gathered in terms of your needs that means we can if you envision it as laying the tdoa software on top of information weve already collected the software then analyzes that data and spits out a location for us though that data is typically hours old because weve had to gather it elsewhere he saw her disappointment register the only other technology available to uslogon signals is realtime but allows no location accuracy whatsoever to my knowledge no ones come up with anything for logons but thats one of the areas were looking into for you you said i might miss him daphne reminded looking at her own watch which implied you had found him or did i misinterpret osbourne reached forward and tapped the man in front of him on the shoulder the computer technician danced his fingers across the keyboard until that moment daphne had not realized this person was a part of their discussion osbourne said eyes on the screen to the right the screen was enormous perhaps a hundred square feet half the size of a small movie theater screen on it appeared a color map of the city that daphne clearly recognized the dark green to the left she took to be puget sound osbourne said if the person youre interested in had been calling on a newer phone our gps technology would have done the work for us the only shortcoming of gps is lineofsight interference which tdoa gets around and therefore ends up complementing the technology perfectly but your suspect is calling out on an older model analog im afraid each time he placed a call in the last eighteen hours our network and our competitors networks recorded those signal transmissions for his and hundreds of thousands of other phones all concurrently twentyfourseven a tower receives his signal and the computers timestamp that arrival for the sake of billing records downtown his transmission signal might light up six or eight towers all at fractionsofasecond differences we have a record of all of that he tapped the mans shoulder again what you see next are the various transmission locations of calls he has made a red dot means he was standing still a red line means he was moving we shade that line pink to burgundy to indicate directionpink being the area of origin burgundy termination daphne then saw the screen fill randomly with a half dozen red dots and another dozen lines some of the lines were as short as half a block others as long as a mile or more turning corners repeatedly fascinated daphne studied the graphic she could quickly identify the areas of town where flek spent the most time he seemed to avoid the downtown area near public safety altogether no surprise there she thought to the left of the screen she noticed three long pinktoburgundy lines in the middle of puget sound she turned her head slightly toward these time of transmission and termination are in parentheses alongside the respective dot or line so we know exactly when he was in each of these locations osbourne glanced over at her and i can see your interest lies properly in the lines to the left those over the sound what exactly are we looking at there again osbourne tapped the man on the shoulder he leaned forward and said softly enlargement please a flashing box of dashes surrounded the lines in question and then that area of the sound filled the screen entirely so that the three colorful lines were between two and six feet long the respective transmission times could be clearly read osbourne explained i thought to understand the technology to understand the situation and make an objective decision on how you wanted to evaluate the data you needed to see this lieutenant or i wouldnt have asked you to come over but these three transmissions include the only two that occur at like times offering the only overlap the only possible site where you might locate the individual in question daphne shook her head still not fully seeing what this offered her it so happens osbourne said that our digital mapping service uses alpha maps with research by cape flattery map company the same maps at the front of the phone books small wonder since were a phone company the point being that the alpha maps include all the ferry routes another of those instructive taps on the shoulder the full screen included the city once again this time with dashed lines leading from the piers out across the sound the dashed lines on the map ran incredibly close to the color transmission lines drawn by the software osbourne pointed thats the bainbridge island ferry route the winslow route he traveled into the city on the tenfifteen ferry yesterday morning back out to the island on the eightthirty back in on the tenfifteen this morning he tapped his wrist the eightthirty ferry leaves in twenty minutes if you hurry you can make it daphne shook the mans hand and took off for the door at a dead run krishevski said to boldt you learn to cut your losses in this job and thats what i recommend someone taking pot shots at youi hear this guy youre after bought a rifle its not him i dont want to hear that it disturbs you boldt asked what that they missed it isnt like that isnt it boldt asked hey this isnt my affair krishevski leaned on the word you know that the emphasis destroyed boldt he understood immediately where the conversation was headed krishevski glanced hotly toward the door and lowered his voice and now boldt could barely hear him they have video lou a security camera from a denver hotel he added im not party to this he didnt convince boldt im here strictly out of a desire to keep your personal life from being dragged through the press once this surfaces not only do the wife and kids suffer but one of you is going to leave capers and it aint going to be the psychologist on account shes the only one they got so wheres that leave you vice traffic his ears whined he needed names he needed some chance to stop this from happening youll go down with them krishevski he warned me who do you think called you the other night and put you onto schock and phillipps assault boldt sat there stunned see thats the whole point of my visit to cut the losses theyre ready to fry your ass dont let them do this for once just walk away do everyone a favor leave it be boldt tried to respond in a voice that said he had no intention of bending that he knew what he was talking about you chapman pendegrass its not what you think then someone had better enlighten me krishevski couldnt make the recliner sit up he struggled like a child wanting to be free of a high chair and finally got it okay i lied he said boldt felt a bubble lodge in his throat no one sent me im here to head off our both being dragged through the mud he met eyes with boldt and said i think i can do that but im in as deep as you are believe me i dont krishevski smiled nervously chapman had a video these guys will trade you straight acrossthat video of chapmans for the one from the denver hotel boldts pager and cell phone rang nearly simultaneously he shut them both off without paying the slightest attention to them never breaking eye contact with krishevski im to get this video and deliver it to you boldt said calmly he added sarcastically and youre not connected to this dont go there krishevski said emphatically im not left a lot of choice boldt pointed out if you came here on your ownif youre so squeaky cleanthen whats to prevent you from talking im not so squeaky clean he admitted ive been fired i dont want to face jail time as well uhhuh boldt said knowingly my crimeif youre going to call it thatis trying to correct stupidity other peoples stupidity ron chapman has a video that is trouble for some of my guys and now im jammed because i tried to help were all jammed thats as far as ill go as much as ill say deliver chapmans video it all goes away and sanchez does she stand up and walk ill go out the front krishevski said tell liz and the kids goodbye for me chapter by the time daphne reached the state ferry terminal the vessel destined for winslow on bainbridge island was booked full for vehicles though was still boarding passengers she parked her red honda in the lot and walked briskly toward the ferry her purse thumped at her side a warning light flickered at the back of her brainthe neck scar she carried was a wound inflicted on a ferry while in the line of duty boldt had been with her then she wished he was there now all the state ferries were behemoths of welded steel and layer upon layer of white and gray deck paint weary water buses transporting hundreds of thousands of passengers annually the ship seemed about as wide as it was long a mirror image of itself with two pilot towers bow and stern it amazed her that something made of hundreds of tons of steel and carrying in its hold hundreds of tons of vehicles and on its various decks several hundred passengers could nonetheless somehow manage to float to navigate open water she never felt perfectly safe on one mixed into her thoughts as she moved up the outer stairs to the vessels spacious deck lounges in search of bryce abbott flek was the portrait of the man created from her own psychological evaluation based on his criminal history shorttempered randomly violent prone to excessive drug use in times of acute stress he was to be avoided and she was pursuing him alone on a ship she would maintain surveillance but not make contact eventually boldt would take her calls return her messagesshe was outraged that he had apparently either turned off his pager and phone or left them behind somewhere in her mind her job was to identify and locate flek report his location to boldt and consult on what to do from there meeting the ferry with an army of bainbridge island police was out she knew that much flek was not the type to pressure with hundreds of potential hostages available to him like a wild horse he was better observed than handled if a lasso was to be thrown then timing was everything mixed in with this rational thought was a burning desire to speak with him before he knew who she was before contact with police before his arrest rarely did such opportunities present themselves as it happened he saw her first she felt a burning sensation from behind her and turned only to meet eyes with him way across the stern deck area she didnt want to turn away too obviously but she didnt want to stare either flek apparently took the prolonged eye contact as female interest on her part or at least as a green light to pursue her whatever the case he started across the cabin toward her it was only as she turned and walked away from him that it occurred to her he might have seen a photo of hera press conference one of the pieces on boldts closing of the prison courtney samway had identified boldt but not daphne but what if flek had seen her in the press coverage of that denver hotel what if abby flek was hunting her not the other way around her nerves unwound and for a moment she felt desperate losing her professional composure and wanting to scream for help then she reconsidered hes a wolf she told herself a man who preys on women courtney samway had been plucked from a stripper stage in denverflek was a conqueror it was nothing more than her looks and their exaggerated eye contact that now caused flek to pursue her she refused to hurry refused to fuel any suspicion in him her cell phone still switched on remained in her purse along with her gun she felt tempted to reach for one or the other instead she stopped alongside a group of tourists who were admiring the citys night skyline she gripped the ships metal rail with both hands to steady herself prepared for a confrontation she stood there head bent hair tossed in the ferrys breeze the sound of a foaming wake boiling below her catching sight of seagulls flashing in the ships outboard lights the citys stunning night skyline receding in the distance she stood there all of her muscles taut and tense her senses heightened her skin prickling expecting to hear a strangers low voice from over her shoulder expecting to shudder from head to toe he wouldnt dare harm her so close to others who could later identify him in fact she realizedfighting off her experience of several years earliera ship was no place to make trouble for there was no escape except to jump overboard and in the sounds lethally frigid waters that was no option at all she looked up turning her face into the wind flek was now gone nowhere to be seen she controlled herself and turned slowly as if savoring the breeze and looked to the stern gone a flutter of panic in her chest had she lost him had she lost her opportunity was he testing her watching her right now to see if she followed if she sought him out maybe it wasnt even him they had been separated by a good distance inside that cabin she supposed it could have been another man someone else her mind devilishly playing tricks on her she was damned if she did damned if she didnt to go after him could tip her hand it all had to do with appearances and intention she convinced herself people strolled the ferries constantly checking out all the various decks and cabins all she had to do was put one foot in front of the other and take her time stroll dont walk dont hurry use peripheral vision dont inspect the ship enjoy it she would stroll in the opposite direction from himtoward the stern the crossing was thirtyfive minutes ten of those had passed it was a large crowded ship with hundreds of passengers but a ship a finite space nonetheless she would methodically work this deck stern to bow then the next deck bow to stern she would cover every inch of the ferry top to bottom her police training kicked in flush him out patience she reminded herself glancing at her watch she had about twenty minutes in which to find him the size of the vessel only became apparent when one started searching it the hundreds upon hundreds of faces blended one to the next like sampling perfumes to where she could not distinguish one from the other without staring intently and she did not want to stare worse the ferrys population moved continuously scores of passengers moving constantly from deck to cabin and deck to deck to the cafeteria and the toilets men women and children though more men on this commuter leg and whereas some wore suits most did not and these others wore jeans and a brown jacket the ubiquitous recreational dress code of the pacific northwest daphne moved through this shifting sea like the ferry through the dark waters hellbent and determined but all the while attempting to give off an air of restless boredom more than a dozen times she believed shed spotted him only to realize it was not flek at all disappointment and selfdoubt stinging her the more she searched the more she convinced herself she had never seen him an apparition a wish unfulfilled she spent the majority of her time on the main levela huge open deck broken in the middle by stairs and the cafeteria cell phone records suggested that flek used the crossing to make cellular calls her own stubborn belief demanded that if he made such calls they would be placed as far away from others as physically possible after a thorough search she shifted her attention to the outside decks the minutes dragged on daphnes discouragement flaring toward impatience her strides increased in tempo and length those men facing the water with their backs to the ship hid their faces in partial shadow requiring her to slow and pay special attention she was amused by how many men spent the crossing on their cell phones minutes ticked past only as the ferry turned past wing point and angled up eagle harbor toward a shimmering winslow did she move her search to the parking decks everyone on the ferry had to get off she descended through the smell of oil and the sea there were two levels of parked cars on either side of a single open hold for vehicles she checked the two upper side wings first walking the long rows of parked vehicles amazed at how many drivers chose to ride out the thirtyfive minutes dozing behind the wheel or listening to npr the hold was dull paint and dim lighting vehicles bumper to bumper all aimed toward the bow vehicle after vehicle face after face no flek she reached the lower center hold facing well over a hundred vehicles time running out the water churned violently at the bow noisy in her ears and tangy in her throat she approached one of the ferry personnel and took full advantage of his interest in her listen she said raising her voice above the engine noise is there any law preventing a woman from asking a few of these good people for a lift not as far as im concerned the man replied when we dock these cars roll dont be standing out there then ill be yelling at ya thanks she said theres a couple taxis he told her thanks she said again the information about the taxi caused her to reconsider her plan if she spotted him then maybe the taxi would do she could follow then again maybe someone else would beat her to those taxis or maybe abby flek wasnt in a car despite her conviction at this point that he had to be he was in possession of a fairly large rifle perhaps stolen goods as well it seemed unlikely he would travel on foot a thought occurred boldt had been shot at the night before sometime around pm bryce abby flek had taken the ferry to winslowosbourne had evidence supporting this the next day this same morning flek had ridden a ferry back from winslow to the city granted there were numerous return ferries but what were the odds that flek had returned that same night to take a pot shot at boldt it seemed unlikely if not impossible to her she reached into her purse and grabbed her phoneshe wanted to tell boldt immediately but as she prepared to dial she looked up to see that most if not all of the vehicles were now occupied out the bow the welllit dock at winslow quickly approached if she were to do this it had to be immediately she had only the one chance she returned the phone to her purse rehearsed a few opening lines walked to the center of the four rows of vehicles and started down the aisle in front of her she looked left to right catching sight of every driver she approached only men and did not confine herself solely to this center aisle she tapped on a window and waited for the driver to roll it down excuse me she said do you happen to know who won the mariners game the strangers hopeful expression faded from his face and he answered they arent playing today oh she said well thanks anyway she moved on crossing past the front bumper of a minivan and settling on a black bmw knock knock excuse me she said do you know if theres a costco in poulsbo i doubt it he answered thanks anyway she said and continued on the ship smoothly slowed she wanted to be seen making as many appeals as possible for this reason she moved laterally port to starboard as well as working her way back toward the stern she was midships when she spotted flek he sat behind the wheel of an old model cadillac or plymouth a gas hog she approached the passenger side and knocked the thing had a landau roof that looked like burned coffee groundstoo many years in the elements he turned the key and put down the window electronically hey there he said excuse me daphne said a little flirtatious a little hopeful a tiny bit cautious you wouldnt be heading north by any chance would you the islands only major road ran north toward the bridge at agate passage suquamish he answered you need a ride poulsbo she replied affecting disappointment she had a destination nowthe port madison indian reservation town of suquamish hed been smart enough to leave the city each night smart enough to hide in a place that neither boldt nor anyone else ever would have thought to look for himpast the affluent enclave of bainbridge into the isolation of a reservation town theres a casino the other side of the bridge pretty well traveled i could leave you there he offered or ill tell you what he said before she could respond its nothing to run you into town a couple miles is all hop in you sure her heart fluttered in her chest no matter what the police side of her believed about seizing such an opportunityand it warned to err on the side of cautionthe psychologist hungered for a chance at conversation with this man in the raw unaware of who she was his guard down his true personality exposed her own ambitions had threatened her before but as a scientist she could justify this in any number of ways none of them very reasonable if shed been forced to listen to herself at that moment she knew she could refuse him and walk awayshe could lift the cars registration as she passed to the rear she could call boldt and organize a manhunt but conversely it might prove tricky ever finding him again perhaps it was a friends car perhaps a joy ride he would ditch within the next few hours boldt could still be notified the manhunt could still take place suquamish was tiny it wouldnt be too difficult to find this old car or perhaps they could lay a trap for him back at the ferry landing perhaps she would pull her weapon and walk him into the poulsbo police department and claim the collar herself sanchez was her case after all but none of that mattered right now first she had a decision to make she opened the door and climbed in thanks she said laying her purse on the seat next to her then reconsidering she set it on the floor its awfully nice of you how could i say no he asked a flicker of fear did he know her something in the way he had said it the ferry arrived at the pier with barely a nudge and the deckhands busied themselves the psychologist sensed the danger who had trapped whom she wondered the door handle cried out for her to grab hold and get out of the car while she still could it grew in size begging for her to use it none of those others would help you out he said had he sensed her reluctance and constructed a good line to ask they all live onisland she replied that door handle still calling to her the cars up ahead started their engines and the foul smell of exhaust filled the old car nearly instantly eldoradothe glove box read he pulled the transmission into gear as he did she heard the familiar click of all the doors locking at once she didnt look she didnt want to make a point of it but she knew hed locked the car or the vehicle itself had done so automatically upon leaving parkbut it seemed to her it was too old a car for that safety feature very subtly she adjusted her arm on the doors armrest and fingered the windows toggle the window didnt openwhereas it had moved for him only a moment earlier flek had disabled the windows with the child lock from the drivers door controls how much was paranoia how much reality she felt an icy line of sweat trickle down her ribs the cars and trucks began to roll she understood perfectly well that this was her last chance to attempt to flee to do so would alert flek and cause him to break any patterns he had established the psychologist battled the cop and the cop battled back and the psychologist argued again and flek took his foot off the brake in the end the decision was made for her he drove off the ferry and into traffic chapter mac krishevskis offer of a trade left boldts head spinning he didnt know how much the hotel video might have caught but it didnt matterit would look worse than it had been liz and the kids would suffer and so would daphne spds brass would require one of them to transfer departments and krishevski was right that it would be him hed never work homicide again he took a long walk up the hill and into woodland park all the while mulling over the possibility of trying to steal or leverage possession of the damning video it wasnt his style hed need lamoia if he were to try such a thing he wasnt thinking about returning any phone calls he intentionally left his cellular and pager turned off to give him the peace and quiet necessary for the decision he had to make now he knew that when faced with a difficult tangle if you pulled one way the mess miraculously came undone if you pulled the other it ended up an unforgiving knot he couldnt remember ever being cornered like this he rebelled against it but recognized too that he couldnt let his own rebellion get in the way of clear thinking he knew the wrong decision would have horrible consequences from somewhere up in this same park his wouldbe assassin had thrown a bullet at him he realized a little too late that he wasnt wearing the vest a part of him would have welcomed a snipers bullet at that particular moment but he knew one wasnt coming he wouldnt be that lucky tonight chapter you dont look like a hitchhiker no daphne agreed the trick was to control her nerves to not let her concern show as a professional she knew all the tricks though as a possible victim many of these now eluded her she explained im meeting a friend in poulsbo one of the deckhands told me theres only a couple taxis here at the dock and im late as it is and if i missed that taxi from the city yes i thought so and you here and there he answered as in here and there she asked or as in anywhere you mentioned suquamish friends there are you native american he looked more polish with a hint of mediterranean in the skin color and around the eyes no way just friends up there you know some business acquaintances what do you do she asked he glanced over and grinned though not playfully it was an asocial grin a grin that said to leave well enough alone a grin she had seen worn on the faces of child killers and rapists and multiple murderers too many to countbut only the one mattered at the moment she experienced that glance as voltage deep within her it disemboweled her disturbed her it dawned on her then he knows who i am electronics he answered im kind of like a sales rep i handle a lot of lines but there was that look again that said he could tell her anything he wanted because shed never have the chance to repeat it she saw maria sanchez lying in that hospital bed as still as a corpse except for the lonely eyes was he the man who had done that to her like electric company stuff she asked or more like my vcr you cant program my vcr can you he laughed at that and pulled a cigarette pack from his pocket and offered her one when she declined he cracked his window and lit up cant get my window to work she said as innocently as possible her finger showing off the problem oh here he said and her window operated again they were traveling a busy roadway at fortyfive miles an hour thing is constantly on the fritz he offered electronics maybe you could fix it he laughed again enjoyed a pull on the cigarette and made a spitting noise with his lips as he exhaled he said let me guess youre a model her turn to laugh she threw her head back and chortled to the faded ceiling fabric im flattered thank you ive seen you someplace he said his inquiring expression making her uncomfortable she felt him undress her with his eyes men did this all the time with her but this one actually penetrated beyond the clothing to where her skin burned hot and she felt repulsed by him she imagined him with samway abusive sexually dominant taking what he wanted when he wanted it the woman in her wished the car could drive faster that poulsbo would arrive sooner she could see him dragging her by the hair into the woods tying her up to some tree and having his pleasure with her leaving her there half naked gagged to starve to death or be consumed by the elements such things happened more frequently than the civilian population knew women of all ages disappeared at an alarming rate the bryce abbott fleks were responsiblethe professional in her knew this as well im a psychologist she said hoping it would put him off as it did so many people a shrink not exactly a counselor is more like it people come to me with their problems she debated going for the heart or sitting back to see where he took this but the desire to dominate won out she didnt want him controlling she wanted him back on his heels relationship problems grieving the death of a loved one control issues youd be surprised how many people cant control themselves the tv he asked you on a show or somethin is that where i seen you sally jessy somethin like that ive been interviewed by local news a few times but nothing recently maybe thats it he said she couldnt tell if he was teasing or not it felt a little to her like the cat batting the mouse in the face with the claws retracted playing soft because there was plenty of time and both the mouse and the cat knew who was running the show it was this control issue that she seized upon she needed him off balance or she needed to just shut up and get through the ride but the psychologist in her wanted to get inside him in a much different way than he wanted to get inside her you still look like a model to me he said working on the cigarette you should have waited for the taxi he suggested a stabbing pain at the v of her rib cage hows that she asked doing a decent job of concealing her sense of terror that resulted from the comment you took a chance thumbing for a ride like that there are a lot of creeps out here you know these islands a woman as fine as you you understand what im saying well then im glad it was you who picked me up she said she waited a moment and told him at least you dont strike me as a creep they both laughed flek first from the gut and hon estly daphne followed with the best she could managelaughter was not an easy concept for her the gun was in her purse at her feet so was the cell phone he said you can put it up on the seat if you want hed caught her staring i wont steal nothing from it she covered quickly just trying to remember if i left something back at the office or not so take a look he suggested its only lipstick she vamped a different color i like the one you got on thank you not that you care he sounded suddenly bitter sure i do thats bullshit and we both know it pardon the french i care what i look like she told him thats all i meant priorities he said in a dreamy voice so you being a psychologist and all my brother got smoked last week dead what do you think of that im sorry for your loss but what do you think of that she asked thats the more important question he glanced over at her i miss him a whisper that ran chills down her spine thats only natural grief is expected at such times as painful as it is grief is a healing force a cleansing force its good to just let it happen men more so than women can have a problem with that they bottle up their grief it comes out as anger or violence or both she hesitated are you experiencing any of that i didnt ask for a free session or nothing pardon me professional liability i guess i was only trying to help you cant help nothings going to bring him back nothing helps i didnt mean any offense she said flek reached down hooked the strap of her purse and yanked it up to the seat alongside of her he had the reaction time of a lizard she had barely seen his arm move jeez he said landing it next to her thing weighs a ton you oughta have wheels for that thing the gun and two spare magazines made it very heavy she panicked her brain locking as she stared at her purse she froze a moment too long and they both knew it the lipstick he said brightly the grieving brother suddenly gone she didnt like the fact that he could throw the switch so quickly another in a long series of red flags alerting her to his instability boldt had plenty to fear from this manflek was capable of pulling the trigger he said try the other color ill tell you which is best which i like its a date right poulsbo a dinner date right ill tell you which one is better he switched on the ceiling light i ah they approached the agate passage bridge listen she said i dont want to put you out if the casino is easier for you lets do that i can call a cab from poulsbo and hell be there in a matter of minutes dont try to change the subject he objected im telling you i think you look great but try the other color and ill tell you what i think but i left it i think the lipstick im sure i did look he said nudging the purse closer to her with his open palm as he touched the purse his head snapped up his eyes intense and dangerous had he felt the gun barrel he knows she thought this time with more certainty see if youve got it if you brought it with you id like to see it on you he couldnt take his eyes off her purse she thought he might wreck the car she couldnt open the purse her gun was near the topshed made sure of that on the ferryright where she could reach it in a hurry i dont think so she said you said you like this color thats good enough for me come on he pleaded she dragged the purse to her lap as they drove onto the bridge she was thinking that if there was a place to pull the weapon and force him over it was there where the car was restricted she hadnt thought any of this out clearly enough improvisation was fine but did not come naturally to a mind preoccupied with consideration even fear she angled the purse toward her and slipped her hand inside the cool metal of the weapon washed a sense of relief through her the rose lipstick had settled on the bottom amid tampax a flair pen and loose quarters her fingers danced between the two the handgun and the lipstick flek watched all this with one eye while driving with the other unable to see into the purse well he asked as if knowing the dilemma she faced she pulled her hand from the purse ever so slowly and produced the lipstick and a crumpled tissue found it she crowed i knew it he pounded the steering wheel suddenly a little boy lemme see lemme see she snapped the purse shut wondering if that was a mistake you mind she said taking hold of the cars rear view mirror go head she smudged her lips onto the tissue removing the sand colored lipstick and then carefully applied the rose her attention on the mirror she could feel him staring he said both lips you do both lips my mother she used to wear this really red lipstick would do just the top lip the upper lip you know and then kiss her lips together to get it onto her lower bright colors you can do that daphne said she kissed her lips together a few times and presented herself to him duhduh she trumpeted like a fanfare what do you think he stared a little too long she caught herself check ing the road she wore bright lipstick all the time your mother i got it he said confidently meaning she could take her eyes off the road im not gonna hit no one in control she thought what about the rose its sexier he said he successfully turned the attention away from himself and she felt resentful of this she wanted to get back to discussion of his mother my mother she said im probably older than you but she wore this fireengine red lipstick and i mean really big on her mouth my mother was a waitress he said and she sold clothes too for a while and bartended and stuff changed jobs all the time but i dont think she ever changed that lipstick is she still alive booze got her it was a long time ago do you drink he glanced over at her again that ones way sexier than the other one you think she tried to sound flattered the road state highway swung left past the casino toward poulsbo suquamishindianola was to the right flek followed traffic you want to get a beer she asked as they neared the casino her thought process was quick and therefore flawed though she tried to work all angles before speaking her mind a flurry of thoughts and consideration she wanted a chance to telephone boldt to tell him where she was and what she had in mind he could then call ahead to poulsbo and arrange for the local police to pick up flek moments after dropping her off he would never be out of her sight she might even be able to start an interrogation immediately after his booking it felt like a plan to her but she needed this chance to call boldt ahead of her being dropped off a bar seemed the perfect placeher cell phone from a toilet stall well away from the ears of abby flek right now he asked one beer would help relax mebefore this dinner she said he jerked the wheel hard throwing daphne against the door the tires cried and the huge car fishtailed slightly an oncoming car sounded its horn as flek shot the eldorado across to the far side and bounced it into a gas station next to the casino he hit the brakes hard and threw her forward against the dash sit tight he said leaving the car running couple beers coming up he jumped from the car and hurried inside chapter daphne sat back in the front seat of the eldorado the wind knocked out of hermore from nerves than fleks bad driving this was not the pit stop for beer shed had in mind she caught a glimpse of their suspect through the crowded shelves of the gas stations minimarket as he grabbed a cold sixpack from a wall cooler within seconds she had her purse open and the cellular phone out though her eyes remained on flek who was already at the cash register under the sterile bluish glare of tube lighting she had to look down to dial she nervously punched in boldts cellular and got the number wrong she cleared the last three digits and reentered them correctly she hit snd the phone signaled a busy cellular circuit she ended the call pushed rcl and hit snd again flek had a wad of bills in hand he leafed through them and pulled one out and handed it to the clerk for a moment nothing then the call went through she heard the ringing tone bleeping in her ear an swer the phone she willed or would boldts cellular be turned off this time of night and her only way to reach him be the home number liz had sounded so hostile when she had taken the call earlier what was that about did she even want to know answer the damn call boldt came his voice small and thin over the bad connection cellular to cellular flek had a couple dollars and change in hand as he pushed out the swinging glass door and into a light drizzle that started that exact same instant boldt had roughly explained the predicament over the denver video to liz before bidding her goodnight and heading back into town ive thought about it he had said and i dont see how i can just walk away its not the principled thing to do she agreed he loved her for this ability of hers to disconnect and walk the moral walk talk the moral talk her religious faith rekindled during her struggle with lymphoma burned brightly when tested she fell on the side of right of good even if it meant ostensibly insurmountable personal challenges her earlier anger at him was surface angeras she called it when faced with this kind of challenge they were a team again she loaned him her own personal courage and at no cost no spousal bargaining youre known for your integrity love you cant escape it even if you so desireand i dont think you do do you if theyre good for thiswhoever they arethen theyve got to stand up for it and theyre not going to not on their own if its time for you to leave this job then its time she said what they intend to doit will hurt hurt badly our friends your church you want to look at that carefully before we decide this listen im not saying i fully forgive you for all that has happened but ill survive it we will survive it she added faintly were survivors its no easy decision it cant be made lightly he cautioned although more for himself than for her to hear we dont decide these things theyre not ours to decide we choose to listen or not youre saying the decision is already made he suggested im saying there never was a decision there was only a question of whether wed listen or not and you always listen youre a good man lou i love you for these moments again she added an afterthought i dislike you for certain others weve never been quite at a moment like this elizabeth its going to rain hard on this house we can take it or not she added when you listen when you do whats right things have a way of working out maybe not this week or next maybe not this year or next we could be in for some challenges individually or together who knows but there comes a time when you look back and say so thats why that happened like that im telling youit happens every time inbound traffic had improved in the past few hours he wasnt going to sleep he knew that much it seemed right to get into the office and continue probing the sanchez case before his time was occupied with defending himself his cell phone rang and he answered boldt it wasnt until he heard her voice that he remembered he owed daphne a return call lou thank god she said breathlessly flek crossed through the drizzle at a run the six pack of beer held steady in his hands so he didnt shake the cans she whispered frantically im with him lou flek they traced his cell phone hang on dont hang up even if you think i have he popped open the car door and hurried behind the wheel setting the sixpack of beer down between them damn rain he said daffy boldt called out hearing a mans voice in the background a car sounded its horn from behind him he had unintentionally slowed to forty miles an hour he sped back up she said calmly so ive caught a ride with a really nice guy and hes taking me clear in to poulsbo to meet you even though its out of his way poulsbo youre with him an incredulous boldt asked her defiantly anger rose in him only then did he recall the message liz had deliveredthe phone call he had turned down it seemed every time he turned around he was to blame for something i know she answered reading from her own script ignoring his its really nice of him isnt it poulsbo boldt whispered again into the phone itll take me an hour or two to get there unless i can get one of the news choppers jesus daffy spd no longer owned its own helicopter but leased time from one of three news stations that ran traffic choppers friends she said still on her own script i thought it was just going to be the two of us no no you can bring your friends if you want id love to see them no its fine itll be a great dinner bring them im sure really okay see you in a few minutes the call did not go dead boldt could hear the two voices but at a distance daphne had apparently pretended to end the call but had left the line open boldt drove with the phone pressed to his ear friends boldt thought she wanted backup she intended to collar flek herself sanchez was her case and she intended to clear it perhaps this was more about her being a police officer than a psychologist but where in poulsbo when how was boldt supposed to orchestrate this from miles across the sound without putting her at risk he left the cellular phone line open still held to his ear and simultaneously used his cars police radio to ask dispatch to place an emergency land line call to lamoias hospital room he quickly explained daphnes situation to the man leaving out his own troubles i figured you of all people boldt told him would know the best bar and restaurant in a place like poulsbo cause i havent got a clue where shes headed give me five lamoia requested through a jaw wired shut when the radio called his name a moment later and boldt acknowledged lamoia said the liberty bay grill its the only game in town flek popped two beers and handed daphne hers quicker than stopping he said were both in a hurry yeah thanks she said accepting the beer she didnt like the taste of beer if they had stopped for a drink it would have been red wine a pine ridge merlot or archery summit pinot noir something above this dime store drool she gagged some of it down for the sake of appearances tell me about your brother she said what was he like the wide car cut through the night following the road to lemolo and poulsbo flek downed half the beer before the first minute was up the whirring of the tires was the only sound for the next few miles the longer the silence the more difficult she sipped some beer he was the best he said as if the minutes had not passed the black hole she said there are times you cant think you cant sleep youre not hungry he looked a little surprised he downed more of the beer have you experienced that she asked insomnia loss of appetite no appetite for food he said his eyes sparkling other things sure he killed the beer and reached for another daphne had barely taken an inch out of her own can she did the honors popping the next for him youre not a cop are you there were few questions that could freeze her solid but this one managed in all perhaps a second or two lapsed but to daphne it felt like minutes she coughed out a guttural laugh at which point flek joined her a pair of nervous people chortling contagious laughter at a silver windshield oncoming cars and trucks passing with that familiar if not disturbing whoosh that rocked the car side to side flek steered with one hand lightly on the wheel daphne kept one eye on the road ready to grab that wheel well good he said when she didnt answer pass me the gold its in the box he pointed to the glove box cuervo gold tequila half empty or was it half full on this nightshe couldnt be sure about that he downed two large gulps from the bottle and offered her some she declined as politely as possible he wrestled with his left pocket lifting his butt off the car seat to get a hand down deep and came out with a plastic aspirin container meant to carry ten for the road it carried small capsules insteadshe couldnt identify the drugs in the limited dash light i wont bother to offer he said dropping two down his throat and chasing them with the beer he clicked the aspirin traveler shut with the one hand in a move that was far too familiar to him he slipped the container back into his pocket possession she thought knowing they now had charges that would support his arrest he said does it bother you only that youre driving she answered he laughed i think i can handle it does it make it any better she asked pointedly lets not go there okay mom sessions over doctor ten fifteen minutes the patient wont care he added the patient wont be here then weve got ten minutes she suggested five is more like it lets not for now he pulled on the beer then stuffed it between his legs remember im doing you a favor here going all the way to poulsbo dont push it i was offering to help is all yeah well save it he drummed restless fingers on the top of the beer can in his crotch ive got all the help i need thats temporary help she said not giving ground depends how regular you are in administering the dosage doc ritalin prozac theyve tried it all on me doc started on me when i was eleven years old you lift a couple toasters they give you a pill wasnt me who started this he said looking over at her he added oh gee am i scaring you its you who wants to talk not me its called a glow plug isnt it she asked he looked a little surprised by her knowledge but recovered quickly he sang badly out of tune you light up my life and laughed hotly before putting out the fire with more beer it wont bring him back shut up he roared the car swerved and daphne felt weightlessness in the center of her stomach and a flutter in her heart he shoved on the brakes and the car skidded to a stop on the side of the road a pickup truck zoomed past its horn cascading down the doppler scale what the fuck business is it of yours he hollered his eyes wild spittle raining across the seat jesus he drew on the beer again leering why cant you just shut up about it she glanced down at her purse the gun she thought but suddenly all felt calm within her this was her domain the wild frenzy of minds losing grip this was the moment she had hoped for the anger breaking loose and opening up a hole through which she might travel in a perfectly calm voice she said youre experiencing guilt over your brothers death you blame yourself youre torturing yourself she pointed to the beer youre medicating yourself she hesitated he was actually listening to her though through elevated respiration dilated eyes and an increased heart rate judging by the pulse in his neck you can do damage you know assuming that kind of responsibility for another dont beat yourself up over this he coughed out a sputter of disgust turned his attention back to the road and floored the accelerator fishtailing back out onto the pavement daphne felt a penetrating calm she was inside him now they both knew it what do you know about it he said do you think youre the only person to experience grief and guilt what youre going through is a process but youre handling it wrong tell me about the guilt you feel he waited a moment and said pass the gold no im not going to i dont feel comfortable with that she wanted control if he accepted her refusal then she had him right where she needed him yeah he said a little tentatively well this is my car fuck you he stretched for the glove box and daphne blocked his effort she could sense his fencesitting he was debating opening up to her no she said its not the answer they wrestled though she didnt put up much resistance she wasnt about to control him physically and didnt want to start down that road if he turned to physical violence she had only the weapon to stop him he tripped the glove box and grabbed for the bottle she said talk to me abby tell me what youre feeling force of habit bring the subject closer by establishing rapport seek permission to use the subjects first name befriend dont belittle but she had slipped there had been no introduction no reason for her to know his name she had trapped herself in an amateurish mistake and she reeled with selfloathing on hearing his nickname his head turned mechanically toward her the road and the traffic there a distant thought daphne kept one eye trained out the windshield her attention divided between her purse at her feet and the murderous rage in the drivers eyes he looked her over through dazed eyes a mind stunned by what he heard she thought that perhaps there were gears spinning in there perhaps only the violently loud rush of blood pulsing past his ears he looked numb bewildered it all happened at once his words disconnected as his mind sought to fill in the blanks who the fuck are you his right hand dropped the bottle his left took the wheel and with one lunge his fingers were locked around her throat and pressing her head against the doors window he was halfway across the seat fingers twisting painfully in her hair and turning her head toward the dash the car losing its track the rear wheels yipping she saw her salvation lying in the bottom of the glove box but she could not reach it could not speak his strength consumed her she reached forward fingers wavering for purchase but hed stuffed her into the seat against the door and she couldnt make it suddenly his knee was bracing the wheel his left hand gone from it and her window came down electronically and her head thrust through the opening until fully out in the stinging dark rain he let go her hair grabbed hold of her left breast squeezed and twisted until she screamed turning with the pain just as he wanted the window moved up electronically now choking her throat who the fuck are you he screamed the window nudged up another fraction of an inch her windpipe would be crushed she couldnt manage more than a grunt her fingers danced closer to the glove box he must have been halfway across the seat and steering with his left hand but hed lost the accelerator in order to hold her there the car slowed noticeably and he headed for the side of the road finally she felt the soft plastic between her fingers she hoisted the cool cup that shed seen inside the glove box it was blue it was used to keep single cans of beer cold she turned it because she didnt know if she had the lettering facing him she spun it and shook it and tried to grab his attention the window came down and he pulled her inside she sucked for air grabbed for her neck and massaged her throat on the cup was printed in white a single word abby the car was pulled off the road engine running it smelled of exhaust and human sweat and tequila flek panted glancing over at her and wondering what came next daphnes face and hair were soaking wet her neck a scarlet bruise the windshield fogged as they sat there flek reached out and gently picked up the cool cup he said dreamily as if nothing had happened between them he bought it for me at a truck stop this trip we took once david my brother she said nothing knowing it best to allow him to calm her breast burned her weapon beckoned but she dared not move she glanced down quickly only to see her purse had fallen on its side the knurled handle of the handgun showing she extended her knee and placed her foot over the weapon covering it she knew now what he would do to her if he found out who she was all she wanted was out of that carbut she also knew he could not feel threatened by her departure could not feel she would go running to police or he would never let her go one slip of the tongue had brought her here to this moment she guarded her words carefully she had a role to play her voice rasped dryly as she spoke requiring deep breaths to get any sound out at all you could have killed me she said flek had left the adrenaline had kicked the drugs in ahead of schedule he ground his teeth so hard she could hear themlike a rock scratching slate out there in eastern colorado might as well be kansas its so damn flat there was a t on the cup when davie bought ittabbybut he scratched it off with his penknife and handed it to me saying it was my birthday present im going to get out of the car now she announced having no trouble playing the terrified and wounded stranger youre going to drive off and leave me with her foot she tried to stuff the handle of the gun back inside but it wouldnt go so she covered it again no no no he said suddenly aware of his predicament the car idled on the side of the road this was a mistake on my part she said i should have taken the taxi a little late for that youre upset over the loss of your brother youre lucky im a professional because i understand that ive seen men in your condition before another woman would report you to the police he said sarcastically and youre not going to no im not that would hardly be fair it would only further aggravate your mental condition i do not have no mental condition he objected i am not no mental case your grief she said calmly im referring to your grief over your brothers loss she would have to turn her back on him to try manually for the door lock and the car was one of those where the nub of the lock barely protruded when in the locked position so it was not going to be an easy feat there wasnt a mastercontrollock in her door panelthere was only the one window toggle and it was once again childlocked and inoperable we got ourselves a situation here he said rubbing his sweaty face with an open hand im going to unlock the door she informed him and im going to get out of the car all you have to do is drive away and there is no situation he seemed to be talking to himself more than her the thing is you look so familiar to me and i been trying to sort that out and then you go and speak my name like that and im thinking you are a cop that thats where i seen you something to do with davie and now you say you wont tell no one but thats bullshit and we both know it he hit the accelerator the rear wheels shot out plumes of mud and the car slowly squirreled back out into the lane nearly hitting a passing car that swerved to avoid them daphne turned and went for the lock deciding she could jump at this slow speed it accelerated quickly she only had a moment she heard the breaking glass and felt the blow simultaneously the nauseating smell of cheap tequila engulfed her one moment she was struggling with that damn door lock the next there was only pain and the dark blue penetrating swirl of unconsciousness chapter waiting for the ferry to bainbridge in the enormous state ferry parking lot his cellular voyeuristically held to his ear boldt agonized as he overheard the events that led up to the struggle between daphne and flek daphnes calm pleading that followed and the final crashing of glass that had silenced all discussion only the faint groan of the car engine told him the line was still active he couldnt be sure if the car had been wrecked or if flek was still driving movement in his rearview mirror attracted him or perhaps it was the magnetism of the man he saw there walking with a limp through the light rain the passenger door came open and a bruised and battered john lamoia climbed into the car painfully he glanced over at his lieutenanteverything below his eyebrows and above his chin a mass of swollen black and purple and yelloworange skinand said through a wiredshut jaw couldnt let you have all the fun now youve screwed up everything boldt said because now ive got to drive you back to the hospital instead of boarding this ferry no way the man mumbled his words barely discernable havent been on a ferry in years he added dont worryim not feeling any pain sarge matter of fact i feel pretty great boldts ear adapted to the odd speech impediment brought on by the mans wired jaw he sounded halfsouthern halfdrunk medicated to the hilt boldt handed him the phone and said no talking into it but what do you hear lamoia pressed his other ear shut though the move was clearly painful eight cylinder twin barrel maybe bad pipes boldt was not thinking in terms of a gear head he had wanted a straight answer but its a car right you tell me a car engine idling or running this babys on the road sarge three thousand rpm and cruising lamoia added what channel is this anyway sporttrax she left her cell phone on you told me lamoia reminded him but its still on there was a struggle and no ones doing any talking boldt spoke frantically i made the call to poulsbo pd from a pay phone told them they couldnt use any radios because this guys a scanner they have one plainclothes detective over there he was going to sit on the liberty bay grill with some radio cars nearby as backup maybe weve still got a shot at him the ferry lights approached finally boldt said no chopper i take it lamoia surmised all tied down for the night one pilot was available and he said with drive time and prep it would be an hour and a half before hed be off the ground ferrys thirtyfive minutes i opted to have the car once im over there hang on a second sarge we got some action here this guys pulling off the roadsome place bumpy lamoia handed the cell phone back to boldt who listened intently hes pulling over boldt told his sergeant stopping oh thank god he said with a little too much emotion what lamoia begged shes groaning its her shes alive a loud scratching the line went dead boldt knew it was not just silence on the other end but a full disconnect oh no he moaned he passed the phone to lamoia who jerked it to his ear she may be alive lamoia said but this babys dead he disconnected the call or the battery went dead lamoia suggested how long has that thing been on anyway he added angrily and how the fuck did she find this skel ahead of you anyway sarge what the hells that about i found him boldt answered she just took the call fleks cell phone records he said the words catching in his throat like chicken bones i had them work their call logs sarge lamoia knew that tone of voice in his boss thats why she left the call open john it wasnt so i could listen in it was so i could find her sarge lamoia repeated get gaynes over to airtyme cellular in the columbia building a guy named osbourne wake him up if we have to escort him i dont care just get him downtown now he added in dry whisper now before her battery dies and she along with it chapter she awakened in a dark confined space foul smelling and warm it took her a moment to identify it as the eldorados trunk by now flek had found her weapon and her id wallet by now he understood that to kill hera copmeant the death penalty if caught by now he was plotting what to do this man wired on a glow plug cocktail whatever the stakes previously for bryce abbott flek they had just escalated her wrists were handcuffed her ankles tied together with white plastic ties sight of the ties stirred memories of sanchez and kawamoto and stole her breath her mouth was gagged with an oily rag pulled tightly around her sore head it was knotted in the back she felt a strange sensation on her neck and decided it was damp blood whatever injury she had sustained it was not life threatening the man behind the wheel was another story the car rattled and bounced and she blamed the pounding headache as much on the seeping fumes as the blow to her head a pinkishred light from the taillights seeped through the car fixtures her blouse soaked in tequila radiated a sickening smell of her own fear perfume and the alcohol she had no idea where they were no idea where they were headed though by the sound of oncoming traffic passing quickly she knew they were traveling fast and with so few roads in this area it meant either toward or away from poulsbo if headed away then her message to boldt had failed only the open phone line presented any ray of hope however faintand only then if boldt figured it out she credited her trainingher ability to transcend the moment to rise above a patients despair and think clearlyfor the steadiness of thought she experienced she did not wallow in selfpity or succumb to fear instead after a quick flirtation with the latter she began to reposition herself in the trunk knowing what had to be done she had been inside a trunk once before in her life a different life it felt like a different woman she had no intention of this experience resulting in the same outcome this time someone would die and she wasnt going to allow that person to be her chapter the ferry steamed on through the dark churning waters interminably wind and rain frothed the waters into sharp angular chop unique to the sound but the ferry plowed down the peaks and beat them out its wake as a subdued white rolling foam boldt and lamoia sat off by themselves on a mostly empty deck a few tired businessmen occupied the other seats and a couple of kids with backpacks on these milkrun legs the ferry definitely lost money you shouldnt have come along boldt said true story lamoia answered through his clenched jaw what do we feed you ensure through a straw if i puke i die nice thought isnt it then why the last time this happened she got cut bad and you you beat yourself up pretty hard over that i hear you been beating yourself up over my little accident it aint worth it sarge my gig my choice my bad he said im slow but im not useless besides i knew you could use the company boldts cellular rang it was gaynes she said os bourne provided daphne with a location for flek that probably pretty well matches where you are right now in the middle of the sound and she went off of that boldt asked she had a time to work with the eightthirty ferry to bainbridge so were at least an hour behind her youre right about osbourne he has the capability of pretty much pinpointing a calls location the only bummer being that none of it is realtime its taking him about fifteen minutes per transmission signal which aint bad but aint great transmission signal he asked the phone being on an open circuit was constantly transmitting so he asked me to pick various times of the call for him to reference i chose three different times each several minutes apart her call originated less than a mile from sandy hookwest northwest of there when you get near the agate passage bridge you should call me ill help direct you and a few minutes later boldt asked where was she then hes still processing says its west of there probably near lemolo hell have an exact in a few more minutes maybe five more minutes he says lets plot the last known reference he advised but unless we know where he was ahead of that she suggested we wont know in what direction he was headed you want the direction dont you lt well be off this ferry in fifteen minutes boldt said i want answers by then what if fleks headed back for this ferry i need to know that i could drive right past the guy understood so have osbourne pull some help an officers life is at stake here ill suggest that dont suggest it order it right gaynes said though she didnt sound convinced whatever you can do bobbie boldt said it was as close as he could get to an apology he has a couple guys working on another technology we could pull them but i dont advise it lt what theyre working on is some kind of realtime technology it could be the ticket she disconnected the call boldt objected thats not realtime thats wasteoftime these guys are cell phone nerds lt they think theyve got something going im reluctant to butt in on that i will if you want but i think we cut them some slack here and see what they can do for us theyre pretty excited about this other possibility your call she said boldt said to lamoia osbournes using manpower on a long shot and gaynes wants me to go along with that boldt never consulted lamoia on such decisions and the sergeants obvious surprise reflected that lamoia said a wise old cop once told me that the dick in the fields in a better position to make the judg ment call than the suit back in the office he was quoting boldt back to himself though not verbatim im not in the office boldt protested and im not a suit it was the ultimate slur and boldt wanted nothing of it lamoias words garbled youre on a boat in the middle of nowhere sarge thats even worse lamoia was looking a little green i think maybe i need some air middle of nowhere boldt thought to him it summed up both his professional and private lives it had started with the flu this feeling he had no idea where or when it would end into the phone boldt said its up to you and osbourne just get me something by the time were back in the car thanks lt back at you she disconnected the call chapter you know what a talented person can do with a color scanner and a paint program these days and im talented yessiree courtesy of our corrections programs which taught me damn near everything i know maybe not hundred dollar bills but you lieutenant daphne matthews just gave me my passport outta here you and your id and your badge before that what choice did i have hide out jumping islands for six months lift a drivers license and give it a run at the border before its reported thats shaving it a little close for this boy but a cops badge are you kidding me i surrender your weapon at the border and drive right across all officiallike slam dunk gone and lost forever the way it should be they were parked in dark woods the air laden with the pungent smell of pine sap flek had propped her up to sitting in the trunk the rain falling down on both of them her clotted blood began to melt and paint her blouse that eerie but familiar rose he held a cellular in his hand switched on hers or his she wondered if he had disconnected her original call to boldt or if it had been transmitting all this time she held to that hope what bryce abbott flek did not know was that she had spent the last ten to fifteen minutes scrunched down into one corner of the locked trunk the right taillights plastic housing pulled away shorting out its connection in an endlessly repeating stream of three short three long and three short bursts they had traveled good road for most of that ride and she had to think that some car or truck had been back there some boy scout or former marine alert to a taillight blinking morse code she counted on someone having taken down the plate number of calling it into authorities on a hunch that the sos meant something this along with boldts earlier call into poulsbo for backup a call she was also counting on having been made seemed certain to alert authorities to her general vicinity the psychologist in her wouldnt succumb to the evidence at handthe fact that flek looked and sounded unstable apparently the victim of another glow plug or two that he held her weapon in the waist of his pants and had a glassy look in his eyes that forewarned her of that instability that he was capable of violence against her she had no doubt she had already witnessed this firsthand but a larger agenda loomed behind those eyes and she wanted her chance to redirect its course the first step was the gag she needed the gag removed to have any chance whatsoever she made noise for the first time sounding like a person with no tongue she had no idea of their location she guessed they were somewhere on or near the port madison indian reservation because it was dark as pitch out only a faint amber glow to the bottoms of clouds many many miles away the road was gravel and mud though in a partial clearing they were surrounded by tall giant cedars ferns and thick vegetation she heard a stream or river nearby if she could run to that water she could swim it or float it and hed have a hell of a time finding her she could climb a tree and hide wait out the sunrise she clung to these positive thoughts in the face of her impending execution did he know enough to blame her for his brothers murder as well on the surface flek seemed to be explaining why he was now going to kill her though the psychologist knew that if that had been his intention hed have already carried through with it either he was plagued by doubt or he had something else in mind she tried to talk at him again the rag tasting like gasoline on her tongue when you talk he said youll tell me his phone numberi dont want to hear nothing else from you not another word just the phone number this lieutenant louis boldt this one did this to davie a pagers fine his cell phone but nothing in no office no land lines i call once one call you understand you screw this up and its on you what happens next maybe i fuck you maybe i just snuff you sitting right there like thatall wet and disgusting maybe you go out ugly lady ugly and unlaid and dead not much worse than that she tried again grunts and groans lost on him swallowed by the relentless rain this is very important what im telling you he said just the mans phone number thats all then the rag goes back on you can nod now and let me know you understand anything more than the phone number right now and ill knock your teeth out with the butt of the gun and then you will pay god almighty how you will pay so how bout it do i get a nod chapter listen up a strangers voice demanded over boldts cellular phone he had been expecting the report from gaynes the ferry had slowed and was nudging toward the small but welllighted dock at winslow badge number six five six four your partner matthews right im a lieutenant i dont have a partner who is this boldt said he already had lamoias attention he gestured toward the phone and pointed back into the dark of the sound toward the city and lamoia got the idea the sergeant pulled out his own phone and made the call to gaynes boldt placed his thumb over the phones talk hole and whispered it could be daffys it could be his got it lamoia said flek announced into boldts ear ive got her badge in my hand or i wouldnt know the number right even a dumb cop can figure that out you want her alive you come get her alone thats the deal and believe me ill know if youre alone or not and if not then not no second chances a hunterll find her in a couple years boldt pushed the phones antenna down held the device away from his mouth and said youre breaking up i cant hear you hang on he disconnected the call while boldt was still staring at the phone secondguessing himself lamoia with gaynes on the line said whats up i hung up on him before he could give me the drop point you what lamoia hissed through his teeth loudly enough to attract attention the ferry gently bumped the dock and weary passengers headed toward the exits osbourne requires fifteen minutes to triangulate the call im trying to buy daphne some time or get her killed im aware of the stakes john jesus sarge i dont know tell gaynes that osbourne has to kill all the towers over here or at least effect a circuit busy on my line he repeated strongly circuit busynot line busy i dont want flek thinking its me i want him blaming the system as boldts phone rang again he glared at his sergeant now john now lamoia relayed the message into his phone his ringing phone in hand boldt already moving toward an exit shouted back im going below decks for the interference handle that and hurry it up were out of here and make it fast lamoia said into his phone i dont care what he sayshes got to do it the guy is threatening to kill matthews no you heard right he added harshly now bobbie now and if theres any way to keep my phone working do it chapter shit flek shouted holding the phone at bay his whole body shaking for a moment he seemed ready to throw the thing or to bust it up against the car but some tiny string of reason fought off the agitating effects of the glow plug and he restrained himself lost him he announced second fucking time daphne tried to speak this time with far more purpose she leaned forward to kneeling and pleaded with him to remove the gag again no shouting he cautioned she shook her head prayers were not a part of her psychologists tools but she prayed silently nonetheless as long as that gag remained on she had no way to effect change her prayers were answered flek stepped forward and unknotted the rag for a moment she said nothing savoring the fresh air and not wanting to rush him when she did speak it was gentle and soothing almost a whisper devoid of fear or the trembling rage that she felt inside she said we may be too far away from a cell tower maybe if we got closer to town maybe then the reception would improve flek surveyed the area looked at her looked back at the sky there were so many places to start with a personality like hisdruginduced and filled with bloodthirsty rage and revenge but it was a bit like those action films where the hero has to cut the right wire or the bomb explodesto come after him from the wrong angle was to incite that rage not defuse it it was not something one jumped into lightly she tried to strip away her own emotions to work past her own agenda and see this patient clearly right now clarity of thought was everything he looked back at her she said fresh batteries help i have a spare battery in the bottom of my purse perhaps he had overdone the glow plugs or perhaps on some level he knew the kind of trouble he had just brought onto himself by making contact with boldt by announcing his kidnapping of a police officer whatever the case the man didnt seem to hear her his own internal voices too loud for her to overcome we could try to get closer to town she said you could cuff me to the door i dont need to ride in the trunk if the morse code had been seen then police were looking for this car the closer to town the better if he brought her inside the car with him then she had a real chance at freedom cuffed to the door or not at the right moment she might deliver a properly placed kick to the head and end this i could look for the towers while you drive she didnt want to mention the phones signal meter because for all she knew the signal was perfectly fine out here she wanted his attention on solving the problem not assessing it she opted for silence allowing his fuzzy logic to sort out her suggestions to push too hard was to push him away im going to put the gag back on and youre going to lie back down well drive closer to town to beg or plead was to admit subservience and her job was to convince him of their partnership to make herself needed and wanted she fought off the temptation to whine and grovel she took a breath and said calmly but when you reach him hes going to want to hear my voice count on that you know he will abby and what then stop by the side of the road and pop the trunk what if someone drives by but a man and a woman in the front seat of a carwhats so suspicious about that im trying to help you abby obviously i want to live i think hell do what you want i really do but hes going to want to hear my voice she added you could make him release courtney have her delivered somewhere it might take a little time shut up he roared his eyes floating in their sockets dizzy dazed he shook the phone again pulled it close to his face and pressed a couple buttons he held it to his ear yanked it away in frustration and ended the attempted call with a final stab of a finger you fuck this up he warned her and you will know so much pain you will wish you were dead you will beg me to kill you he grinned wickedly and i wont not until im good and ready not until ive had every inch of you he added you ask courtney about that she knows he stepped forward daphne could taste her impending freedom chapter osbourne cant kill the system sarge lamoia reported from the passenger seat but they can lock a phone out from the entire networkall the carriersand thats what hes done hes locked out both matthews and the number we have for flek both phones will get a circuitbusy signal flek is known to carry more than one cloned phone boldt reminded hes got to kill the system samway had said he had only the one but boldt wasnt convinced lamoia repeated the request into his phone and then listened dont work that way lamoia said airtymes one of three carriers only some of the towers are theirs they attempt an airtyme handshake first but if that fails its rerouted first come first servethe calls going to go out what about the location a couple minutes more to pinpoint it exactly but we know it came from offisland my phones good to go boldt asked lamoia checked and awaited an answer thats affirm sarge boldt flipped open his phone pulled his notepad from his jacket and dialed a number all with one hand lamoia maintained the open line to gaynes they crossed the bridge at agate passage still on the phone boldt pulled the car over in a park and ride just ahead of the signage for the turn to suquamishindianola he listened more than he talked and then hung up the call you know how i feel about coincidence he told lamoia whats up poulsbo pd never made contact at the restaurant but they have this nineeleven call reporting a taillight of an old eldorado sending sos out its right blinker son of a bitch they observed our request for radio silence but still alerted their cars via their mdts mobile data terminals nobody caught sight of the eldorado but the caller reported that it turned off threeohfive here he said pointing to the intersection not a hundred yards down the road north toward suquamish boldt added i say we trust this one if its right it buys us a hell of a lot of time over running out to poulsbo and back boldt looked out at the dark road if its wrong information or if its flek trying to mislead us then we lose any possibility of a jump on him old indian saying lamoia replied his jaw wired his words sounding drunken when you come to a fork in the road take it that certainly helps a lot boldt said sarcastically but it did help it briefly lightened the moment i can see her doing that sarge the sos you know who else but matthews you know her better than anyone what do you think boldt pushed down the accelerator and turned right at the intersection north toward suquamish chapter this thing is out of hand does it feel that way to you daphne asked he didnt know handcuffs hed clamped the left cuff way too tightly to her wrist so that her hand felt cold and her wrist felt broken she winced with pain every time the car bumped which on the dirt road was every few yards no talking he said this but lacked the authority of his earlier insistence she knew he wanted to talk needed to talk it was the only way for him to build his confidence have you thought about why weve pursued you she asked to fry my ass the driver answered you see it is out of hand thats not it at all right he snapped he reached for a beer it was his fourth have you thought about how davie would play this dont you talk about him he wouldnt know how to play it would he abby because davie wasnt like you davie took the straight road davie was doing fine until you talked him into letting you hit that delivery shut up theres a tower she said pointing through the windshield sweet and sourshe needed to be both for him play both roles herself one moment the accuser one moment the accomplice flek slowed but kept driving he tried the phone and once again nearly lost his patience he reached over the backseat and fished in her purse and came out with her phone same reaction to his attempt with it daphne didnt believe in coincidenceboldt had trained her not to along with every other detective with whom hed worked over the years if the circuit was busy then that was boldts doing and if that was boldts doing then she still had hope what the fuck am i thinking flek said he sped up the car it had finally occurred to him she realized to use a pay phone she had wondered how long it might take him to see this get him into townboldt was on the same page as she the clock continued running in her head osbourne had said triangulation took time did they have a location on her was there a radio car waiting around the next corner and three more coming up their tailpipe my guess is davie would encourage you to work it out not get yourself killed i told you to shut up he shoved the beer can onto the dash so that it wedged tightly between glass and vinyl he tugged the gun from his waist and extended his trembling arm toward the floor of the car no she hollered but flek pulled the trigger shooting her left foot the bullet traveled through her and out the floor of the car thats one he shouted madly saliva spraying from his wet lips i got eight more in here and ill use every damn one before i bother to finish you now you shut up for a moment she felt no pain whatsoever her brain frozen with shock but then the burning began it raced up her leg through her gut and she vomited you disgusting bitch he screamed at close range beating her with the butt of the gun directly on the wound hed caused with the bottle her head swooned but she struggled for consciousness and managed to sit herself upright and turn her head slowly to face him the burning in her left foot was now an inferno she could barely hear her own voice as she spoke what now abby shut the fuck up youre going to have to bandage that or pull a tourniquet or im going to bleed out on you and then what then im a dead cop and boldt isnt going to deal with you youre damned if i die abby she needed to speak but could barely find the strength you know that dont you her words were long strings of stretched taffy her mouth disconnected from her brain the purple goo loomed at the edges of her eyes pulsing with each tick of her heart she pushed it back but it consumed her determined to shield her from this pain for a moment she maintained consciousness she thought she saw a phone booth up ahead a streetlight in the rain but then the black hood of unconsciousness slipped over her head and all hope was lost chapter the fix on the transmission point for fleks first call came only moments after boldt turned right off and onto suquamish way ne a minute or two after daphne had been shot reading from the back of his hand where hed scribbled notes lamoia said the exact fix is north degrees minutes west minutes give or take forty feet in english boldt requested a couple hundred yards east of something called stottlemeyer road ne its in the north end of the indian reservation lamoia fished the official spd road atlas from the glove box where it was required to reside and leafed through the nearly three inches of pages at a blistering speed you know what sarge it isnt in there correctomundo lamoia answered dispatch they said nearly in unison what do you want to bet they can track us from there each and every sdp vehicle now carried a gps location transmitter enabling dispatch computers to monitor location on radio cars that carried mdt terminals this same technology allowed patrol officers to monitor their gps position on a moving map and follow computergenerated directions for the fastest possible route taking into account reported traffic delays boldts unmarked car lacked the mdt but still possessed a gps transmitter in the trunk the system goes out wireless boldt instructed his sergeant lamoia never paid any attention to inhouse memos as long as our phones are working sos the gps its ringing lamoia said less than a minute later boldt turned left on totten road following lamoias instruction precise directions followed as a woman twentythree miles away on the other side of puget sound stared at a computer screen tracking boldts car to within a margin of error of forty feet right on widme road and straight through the dark woods boldt driving twenty miles an hour over the posted limit and nearly rolling the car on a sharp right that appeared out of nowhere the road bent immediately left and continued to its conclusion at lincoln where lamoia pointed left and the driver followed the darkness combined with the rain to lower visibility to a matter of yards not miles two cars passed them on lincoln both boldt and lamoia straining and turning to get the best possible look i dont think so lamoia said after the first that aint no eldorado he declared of the second youre the gear head boldt said his driving strained by the divided attention tell dispatch we want a lights out a quarter mile from our last turn well leave the car there and go on foot affirm lamoia answered stottlemeyer was the fourth right three tenths of a mile sarge lamoia announced boldt pulled the car over into muddy gravel less than two hundred yards from where flek had phoned him the moment his hands left the wheel they grabbed for the vest in the backseat he announced one vest one field operative lamoia looked ready to object youll stay here monitor the poulsbo channel and keep with gaynes at airtyme he fiddled with his own phone mine is set to vibrate you call if anything breaks i call if i spot them and when you do lamoia said optimistically ill try to direct you in around back then we ad lib if i cant get close then ill make myself a target and lure him to where you get a shot oh yeah theres a brilliant plan theres a good match my ninemillimeter on him his german scope on you we ad lib boldt repeated were not going to know til we see the situation maybe theres an old farmhouse or something maybe we wait for backup youll pardon my rank lieutenant but youre full of shit at the moment youre not making any sense my orders are for you to stay in the car boldt said lamoia objected why so you go get yourself killed by some worthless skel those are your orders bullshit lamoia fired back boldt doublechecked that all the phones came with similar services youve got callwaiting dont you yeah a disgruntled lamoia answered so stay on the line with gaynes and listen up for my incoming call as ordered sir boldt said calmly youre injured john youre slow and doubling up out there only doubles the noise we make this is not heroics its what makes sense to you to me boldt said boldt checked the cars interior light before opening the door making sure it would not light up as the door came open he adjusted the vest as he stepped out into the rainits woven plastic exterior would act as something of a raincoat there would be no flashlight he would allow his eyes to adjust and do his best in the dark he walked slowly at first unable to see more than a few feet in front of himself his pace and stride increasing the longer he stayed out in the rain he reached a muddy track to his right not far down the road and stayed to the edge where his sinking into the sloppy turf wouldnt show up in headlights in case flek was suddenly on his way out he stooped low and felt the mud the tire tracks seemed recent to him given the rain they would have been beaten down in a matter of hours he was less than a hundred yards down that track when he heard a car roar to life with the sound bounc ing in the trees it seemed to come from behind him not from in front as expected he crouched and reached for his weapon only to realize that in his haste hed strapped the vest in the way of his gunan amateurish mistake that made him realize he had too much emotion working against him when the car horn sounded out on the road he realized it was his own car that hed heard start lamoia behind the wheel he ran for the open road what the hell boldt said as he jumped into the passenger seat dripping wet lamoia was just shy of being a qualified stock car racer he was the best and fastest driver of all the detectives boldts car took off like someone had switched engines in the past few minutes turns out osbourne had a couple guys working on a hunch gaynes told me as much boldt recalled the hunch had to do with a part of the reserved bandwidth that isnt used for the calls themselves but as i understand it has to do with tower handshakes whats it mean john boldt asked impatiently strapping himself in lamoia glided the car on all four tires through a left turn that had boldt clutching to the dash both hands on the wheel the driver said it means that the reason we see those little bars on our cell phones for signal strength is because the phone and the towers are constantly talking to each otherand heres the catch whether or not were currently making a call as long as the phone is on its looking for the nearest tower and reporting to its own processor what kind of signal strength is available which comes back out of the phone as those little bars to do so it sends its own id every timelike a few thousand times a second and osbourne can see its his phone boldt mumbled both their phones but yes thats right he can see them realtimeno more fifteenminute delays they cant triangulate they cant pinpoint them unless he makes a calland were back to a delay at that point but they can watch movement tower to tower as the phones continue checking for the best handshake and both those phones are currently moving sarge he didnt take his grip from the wheel but his index finger pointed straight ahead east theyve been moving east for the last ten minutes or so the phones appear to be at rest at the moment which means were gaining on them boldt said bingo said the driver as he pushed the car past ninety on a twolane road swollen with rainwater chapter daphne awakened to bryce abbott flek pouring lukewarm beer down her face it spilled down her chest and into her blouse and she pushed him away as she came to the first thing she did was look down at her foot because it felt different he had removed her boot and sock and used the bootlaces to tie two cotton ends of the tampax she carried as plugs on the entrance and exit wounds one of the shoelaces was tied tightly around her left ankle reducing blood flow it hurt but surprisingly held short of screaming pain key to the cuffs he said sipping from the beer hed just used to shower her awake zippered pocket of my purse he went after them how long was i out five minutes maybe less it had felt like hours to her but she doubted she had hours now and that thought electrified her if flek had his way this was meant to be the last night of her life she realized she would bleed out if she didnt receive medical attention regrets and fear piled up inside her and she struggled to be rid of them eventually they won out she said what you wouldnt let me tell youwe only want you as a witness we have nothing but circumstantial evidence against you but there was an assault that we dont think youre good for and we wanted you in to clear that up sure you did he said heres how its going to be he glanced outside nervously the sidewalks were empty due to the hour and the rain im going to take those off he said meaning the cuffs and help you over to the pay phone and were going to call your friend and youre going to say hello and if anyone sees us youre going to hold onto me tight like youve been loving me a hundred years and if you dont the next shot goes through the other foot and then up the legs and so on clear i got it fast and easy he said then he added you got any change in here and dug deeper into her purse chapter hang on boldt hollered into his cellular let me write this down im not thinking too clearly right now it was no exaggeration when his phone had rung he had not expected flek believing the mans cellular phone was jammed he scribbled into his notebook miller bay north directly across from quail the streets name is sid price lamoia overhearing his lieutenant said sounds like a gameshow host okay okay boldt said into the phone lamoia tapped his watch frantically boldt acknowledged the signal with a nod and spoke into his phone lamoia wanted time boldt had to remember that flek considered him still on the mainland not a few precious miles away i can catch the ninefifty ferry if i hurry he said into the phone no we dont have a helicopter no we dont and that means an hour or so at the earliest i understand that but theres nothing i can do its the best i can do exactly yes alone but i want to talk to her if i dont hear her voice the meets off he waited okay boldt felt his heart pounding in his chest lieutenant her weakened voice inquired she avoided use of his first name she didnt want to give flek any hint of their friendship not so much as an ounce of added leverage im wounded boldt heard a struggle as the phone was ripped from daphnes handhe could visualize this as clearly as if he were standing by whatever pay phone they occupied wounded his stomach knotted one hour the man said the line went dead shes wounded boldt reported in a whisper wounded how he hung up lamoia onehanded the wheel yeah well the only reason he wants a meeting is to take you out with the call to bobbie gaynes pressed to his ear lamoia warned his passenger my batteries are going to go sarge boldts had already failed though a cigarette lighter cable now powered his phone theyd be down to that one phone in a matter of minutes get back to dispatch lamoia instructed his lieutenant slamming on the brakes and skidding the car thirty yards to within a few feet of a stop sign and a t intersection that offered either a right turn to the south or a left to the north the quick braking pasted boldt to the dash concentrating on the phone lamoia reported theyre rolling againeast northeast south end of suquamish he pointed out the windshield to the right a mile or two that way osbournes towertracking technology was working boldt called dispatch and reported the proposed location for the meet the car idled smoothly at the intersection both men held tightly to their phones their faces screwed down in impatience lamoia said something about them being men of the millennium boldt shushed him with a raised finger and explained to the dispatcher i need a look at three hundred yards in any direction elevations obstructions get a detective in there and pick a spot that has the best longrange rifle shot at the location i just gave you a longrange rifle shot he repeated right right boldt began to sketch a slightly crooked finger onto a blank page of his notebook it angled thinly to the right he marked an x to the left of the middle knuckle fastest route from here he asked a fraction of a second later he pointed north and lamoia left two plumes of steam and blackrubber smoke behind the vehicle as it jumped through the turn ill hold boldt said he didnt mean the dash but he held to that too he cautioned lamoia youve got to keep them reporting their movement if you step on it he said indicating his crudely drawn map we beat them to the drop an hour before he expects to see us and we get the jump on him lamoia said gleefully maybe boldt said grabbing for the dash as they skidded through the next turn the burning rubber crying out its complaint chapter you need to focus on what davie would think of all this daphne advised i warned you to shut up he reminded angrily yes you did its true and maybe im just delirious from blood loss she suggested but i want to help you if i can fuck you she said does the name maria sanchez mean anything to you i seen the news he said was that you the sanchez place he scoffed cops are all the same if its easy then thats your man what if theyd put this on davie davie didnt have nothing to do with it but you did according to the news im asking you she said im trying to tell you that thats the primary reason we wanted to collar you sanchez we need answers ive gotta believe she said trying her best to keep her brain functioning to use vernacular capable of establishing a rapport that davie wouldnt want you going down for something you didnt do you dont know nothing about davie what he did for me he didnt complete the thought but daphnes mind raced ahead looking for answers what he did for me suddenly she saw it she understood what he was talking about psychologically it changed everything davie was a martyr she said to flek the robbery he went down for he confessed to it was yours he let slip about a delivery coming into the store and you pounced but you were about to get caught sitting on two convictions with a third looming youre fifteen to twenty without parole three strikes and so davie takes the fall for you and big brother picks up bags and splits for seattle it was flek who suddenly looked wounded but big brother cant leave well enough alone he hears about little brothers work in the private commerce programa program his brother has qualified for because hes such a model prisonerand here comes another scam and little brother cant say no flek glanced over at her with a look of crestfallen failure the truth could soothe or the truth could aggravate and daphne had taken a huge chance trying it out on him but for the first time since climbing into this car in the belly of the ferry she felt progress she just wasnt sure she could retain consciousness long enough to take advantage of it we couldnt find any record of davie having worked the phone solicitation on sanchez all your other burglaries were on his list that is why we wanted to question you abby granted our burglary division would have heralded the arrest youd have gone away for five to twelve but were overcrowded and with the crime being nonviolent youd be out in two but breaking the neck of a policewoman and kidnapping another you want to think about that for a minute thats a bullshit charge and you know it the kidnapping asked the hostage sanchez he said do you have an alibi what if i do then i shot myself in the foot its my gunitll fit it happens more often than you think she added besides im a woman none of these guys think a woman can handle a sidearm youd lie through your teeth to save yourself right now youre missing the point abby what would davie want you to do thats got to be your focus you want his name linked to this assault does he deserve that he was a good kid davie was he stepped up when others would have walked away but now youre dragging him through it and theres nothing he can do about it but you shut up hes dead she said bluntly knowing this was the button that had set him off hes dead and gone all through a string of mistakes your mistakes abby and if hes looking down right now then his soul is tortured is that what you want did he take the fall for you to have it end up like this him dead you a cop killer she let this sink in thats what you have in mind isnt it kill boldt or me or both of us put the blame onto boldt instead of yourself do you see thats all youre doing do you realize it wont do anything to take away the voices he snapped his head toward her as if shed poured salt on a wound you hear voices they started right after your brothers death she said you think theyre bad now youve never killed a man have you abby its not something you forget its not something you walk away from and all is forgiven you blame boldt for ansel but youve got that wrong his eyes burned into her as he turned the car right onto a street marked sid price a damp and dark narrow lane enormous trees close quarters she couldnt be sure hed even heard her he drove down a small dirt track a deadend driveway that led down to a muddy patch of lawn and a boat launch into miller bay the narrow waterway was only fifty yards wide at this point flek parked the car up from the boat ramp he lowered both windows shut off the car and turned off the lights daphne could smell the low tide and mud flats it smelled like death dont do this she pleaded i can still get you out of most of this but if you go through with it paying little attention to her he leaned over awk wardly and reached under the seat and worked to untwist some hidden wire if she was to have a chance to fight back it was then with his head lowered but she couldnt summon the strength nor the courage she could barely keep herself conscious she had lost great quantities of blood perhaps she was dying she had heard flek mention one hour and she no longer believed she could or would make it that long certainly not conscious please she said he sat up the chinese assault rifle in hand the german scope he had wired it high under the seat so that even a thorough check under the seat by a traffic cop might not have revealed it he said cops lie lady they lie about me doing that other woman and now you lie to save your ass theyll lie about anything if it makes their job easier he sought out the oily rag and gagged her again a man going about his business he turned on the cars interior light and met eyes with daphne if i get boldt ill spare you if i dont its you whos gonna pay say your prayers then he was gone down toward the water the rain and the darkness absorbing him chapter gaynes says the signals have stopped moving lamoia reported then that was them boldt said his attention fixed on the entrance to the street marked sid price the crown vic was parked down a muddy lane called quail from which they had an unobstructed view across miller bay road a big monster of a car had turned through the rain only a few minutes before its taillights receding lamoia had guessed it was an eldorado shit sarge lamoia complained he could lay in wait for you anywhere down there we gotta rethink this were at least a half hour ahead of when he expects us boldt reminded thats in our favor we need to move while it still means something we may have the jump on him but hes got the snipers rifle our peashooters are good at ten to thirty feet sarge hes dead on the money at two hundred yards we had his sight recalibrated boldt informed the man who knew so little of the investigation to this point he wanted a hundred and fifty yards manny wong gave him seventyfive no shit and youre counting on that what are you smoking if hes tried the thing out on a range which you can bet your ass he hasthen everythings back on target i wouldnt put a hell of a lot of faith in this guy missing sarge id be thinking about shooting him first that usually has the more desired effect his first shot will miss boldt said confidently you have to hit him before he throws that second shot me and who else lamoia complained i got me a peashooter here i got to know where he is if im to be useful and i wont know until after that first shot boldt cupped his penlight so the light barely shone down onto his open notebook but it was enough to see by he had sketched in the information provided by dispatch and analyzed by patrick mulwright head of special ops who volunteered to help out intelligence a division where boldt had been lieutenant for a year provided highresolution military satellite images of miller bay within fifteen minutes of boldts request mulwright had come back to him with three likely sniper points rooftops either of two hightension electric towers that strung four hundred thousand volts suspended across miller bay and a marina directly across the water boldt and lamoia ruled out the nearby rooftops shooting a cop from the roof of a neighborhood house left too great a possibility of witnesses its one of the two towers lamoia said confidently across the water boldt added it gives him the distance for the scope and the water gives a natural break to slow down or prevent any pursuit on our part he escapes while were attempting to catch up and what lamoia asked skeptically he goes on foot from there osbourne confirmed hed been over here at least twice he could have anything planned he could have friends on the reservation he could have left a car or a bike for himself lamoia agreed that tower over there makes sense so you take the car boldt said im on foot he had rearranged the vest to sit beneath his sport coat his weapon at the ready the advantage of the towers lamoia said pointing out through the windshield is that he can see over the houses he can see us if hes looking boldt quit the flashlight not that hes up there yet but he could be any minute now he can see you coming boldt warned and if he does hell take out daffy if he cant get me hell take her now youre getting the point lamoia fired back and he wants you coming alone hell want to see a car drive up with one person inside if theres backup hell see it but ive still got that half hour faint light from cars passing out on the main road cast enough light for lamoia to trace a finger across boldts notepad boldt could now clearly understand the mans awkward speech patterns caused by his wired jaw you drop me over here right now believing hell be facing this direction i come up from behind you drive back and park someplace with no view of either tower you give me a good ten minutes because youre right im a little slow you cant scout it sarge as much as you want to he could see you even now he could see you and that blows it for matthews who knows what he has planned for her maybe the cars rigged maybe the first bullet is meant for her if he smells a doublecross at the appointed time you drive in and see what you see if my phone worked i could call you but it doesnt so we do this blind he added you hear a couple guys throwing shots youll know im onto something boldt wouldnt give up he didnt want to drive into the drop blind protecting daphne meant knowing the layout he wanted a first look pointing to his crude map he said i could make for this tower now after i drop you off and at least provide cover if he spots you as if you could hit him at that distance he doesnt know what im shooting boldt protested providing there arent any shots thrown then thered be plenty of time for me to still arrive by car if mulwright described this right this closer tower is far enough above the drop site that it wouldnt really be in the direction hes facing lamoia didnt like it but he said okay so i agree is that what you want to hear thats what i wanted to hear boldt agreed boldt dropped lamoia on a deadend lane on the opposite side of miller bay about a half mile from the highvoltage tower and the flashing red light that topped it he crossed back to the west side and parked the car well off miller bay road where it could not be seen by passing traffic he crouched as he walked through the tall grasses and marsh plants the highvoltage tower dominating his view it rose a hundred feet or more on four interlaced steel legs looking like an incomplete version of the eiffel tower its four outreaching struts supporting six highvoltage lines each the thickness of a mans forearm that drooped lazily before rising again to the tower on the opposite shore the sign hung on the chain link fence surrounding its base warned of the lethal electricity punctuating its message with yellow lightning bolts boldt climbed over the fence and dropped to the other side arching his back to look up and take in the enormity of the tower and the gray night sky that cried down its rain the metal was wet and slick and just the thought of water and electricity turned his stomach as he made a strong jump to reach the first of the steel ladder rungs welded to the westernmost corner he pulled himself up slipped dangled and tried again his rubbersoled shoes finally finding purchase a moment later he started to climb the eldorado had been parked on a muddy patch of grass facing the water its dim interior light revealing what appeared to be a single figure on the passenger side of the car it was too far for him to see if it was her but he sensed it was his chest knotted his eyes stung the car was perhaps a hundred yards south of the tower the nearest home up a rise forty or fifty yards west a concrete boat ramp led down to the water immediately in front of the eldorado the inlet was narrow at this pointno more than twenty or thirty yards acrossshaped like a crooked finger with boldt at the knuckle as it gently pointed east he looked for lamoia across the narrow body of water but did not see him he studied the opposing tower silvery black in the night rain knowing now how a person would ascend and looking there on any of the rising legs for a human silhouette or similar pattern that did not belong he felt daphne in fleks crosshairs if for no other reason than the man would be using the rifles scope to sight the opposing shore as he anticipated boldts arrival he hoped that scope might also commit flek to tunnel vision focused so intently on the car and his hostage that he might fail to fully take in the surroundings boldt climbed higher and higher yet ten minutes passed the weather vacillating between a light drizzle and a moderate downpour boldt chilled and soaking wet imagined lamoia and flek as equally miserable a half moon briefly appeared turning the unseen invisible night rain into a shimmering curtain of silver wire extinguished a moment later by a low rushing cloud and more drizzle perched as he was remaining quite still boldt finally discerned movement to the left of the opposing tower as lamoia emerged from marshland and waited stone still after several agonizing minutes lamoia moved again keeping toward waters edge he reached the base of the tower hesitating only briefly before moving on and thereby signaling his lieutenant that the tower was empty he approached the boatyard on the opposite shore boldt took his eye off the man long enough to sweep his surroundingsthe rooftops the main road and some of the houses beyond his next thought sent a shudder of panic through him what if flek was hiding in the trunk waiting for boldt to step up to the car what if he didnt trust himself at two hundred yards and wanted only a few feet instead what if the person in the passenger seat was flek himself and daphne had been left in some situation where she would perish if not saved and would not be saved unless flek was successful his panic mounting boldt began to descend the towers treacherous steel ladder he wanted to get closer to that car the first reports of gunfirea series of quick dull popsbarely reached across the water muted by the wind and falling rain boldt lifted his head and concentration away from the next descending ladder rung to see several more soft yellow flashes followed a moment later by the echo of the more slowly traveling report the shots briefly illuminated the boatyard as a mosaic of geometric shapes silhouettes of masts and daggerlike keels some of the shots had come from boldts left lamoia he figuredthe rest quite a volley of shots from high up on the deck of one of the drydocked boats flek by the time boldt had his weapon in hand there was near total silence he knew there was no point in making any attempt at cover shots no point in revealing his position he hurried down the ladder at a brisker pace to boldts right came the clunking soft metallic sound of shots landing in the body of the car flek was shooting for daphne the shots had fallen low the next shot took out the windshield of the eldorado boldt hurried his descent now taking two rungs at a time he squeezed off three quick shots out over the water hoping to distract flek he saw the white of a muzzle flash and knew from the color that the barrel was now trained on him he heard a shot whiz by ripping its way through the falling rain fleks scope was giving him trouble two more dull pops from the left lamoia had sneaked closer to his target flek returned a volley of highpowered rifle shots at lamoia the bullets chewing into boats and then all at once the tiny figure of a man jumped from a boat and ran for waters edge carelessly spraying a few bullets behind him in hopes of keeping lamoia low flek splashed into the water keeping his weapon held high and walked the mud bottom making straight for the opposite shore the eldorado daphne the cornered animal pressured by lamoias deadly proximity had reacted and was heading to the nest to finish the job heading away making his opponents handguns even less effective feeling the heat of lamoias firepower flek had fled to the cover of water offering only the smallest of targets as he swam boldt missed a rung and fell it happened so quickly one moment descending the next freefalling he dropped his gun lunging to grab hold of absolutely anything he could but hit the towers cement pad on his left foot twisting his ankle and buckling his knee white pain blinded him he forced himself to breathe in order to avoid passing out he could see past his fallen gun down to the water fleks arms sticking up and holding the rifle as he quickly negotiated the narrow passage swimming and walking through the chestdeep water flek and that weapon would reach the shore within the minute boldt tried to stand but cried out and fell with the painfell to within an arms length of his handgun across the narrow bay lamoia appeared at waters edge but flek spun around and managed several shots in that direction and boldt saw lamoia dive for cover no contest flek would reach the eldoradoand daphneunchallenged he intended for daphne to pay for his brothers death boldt again tried to stand again he fell this time onto his back writhing in pain he looked up into the sky and there was the answer boldt rolled lamoia crawled toward the waters edge boldt cupped his lips and shouted no john get back knowing full well that lamoia would make the swim in an effort to save daphne back back boldt shouted pleased to see his normally disobedient sergeant retreat toward the boatyard lou boldt was no crack shot he regularly visited the firing range and put in the time required of him to place four out of eight shots somewhere on the body given a brace on which to rest his hands he could manage a head shot on a lighted target thirty feet away but something the size of a forearm in the dark at a hundred feet he wasnt convinced he could hit it once much less accomplish the repeated hits he believed required of him nonetheless he dragged himself to the base pod of the nearest leg and braced for the shot he steadied his twofisted grip checked once over his shoulder at flek now only a matter of yards from shore returned his rainblurred vision down the barrel stretching it long and dark to the bead that he aimed onto the glistening silver highvoltage cable well overhead he had six shots available the first missed entirely racing up into the night sky rain stung his eyes he cleared his vision with the swipe of a hand held his breath took steady aim and squeezed a blinding shower of sparkshe had nicked the line or perhaps the insulated support binding it to the tower his third shot missed the fourth rained more sparks this time like fireworks the fifth severed the line boldt pulled his hands from the steel and rolled it fell like a dragons neck spitting fire a blinding lightning arc as it grounded first to one of the towers legs and then whistling and veering through the black sky and grounding to another dancing like a fire hose that has broken loose it fell directly for boldt with alarming speed several tons of highvoltage cable without a home all the while spitting sparks into the rainlaced air boldt could smell the burning ozone as the dragons head freefell for him curving away only at the last instant and winding itself up again lifting higher and higher that staticcharged roar chasing its every move it whispered and whipped through the wet air suddenly like a broken rubber band rebounding toward the distant tower across miller bay taking its hissing sound and metal smell with it the air became a flurry of white lightning and small explosions it raised its head one final timehigher higher higherstretching for the heavens before turning and diving like a kamikaze the buzzing of electrically charged energy rich and ripe and destined for the ultimate ground of all water it struck miller bay with a small explosion a huge white pulsing light ripping through the water in waves that reminded boldt of dropping a pebble in a still pond flek no doubt saw it approaching this white apron of raw voltage saw it like a tsunami ripping through the water toward him when it hit it lighted his body unnaturallya glowing white stick in a black pond the weapon he held above his head exploded as its ammunition combusted for a brief few seconds bryce abbott flek was his own fireworks display culminated by the detonation of what sounded like a small bomb which experts later said had probably been his head the houses north of miller bay were black and without power boldt dragged himself to the chainlink fence a section of which had been melted by that tongue of fire and crawled out and onto the wet ground halfwalking falling stumbling rolling his way toward that eldorado lamoia would later say that he looked like a man whod spent weeks in the desert lamoia came the long way around over a mile of roadway the last half of which he hitched a ride with a volunteer fireman he wasnt going anywhere near that water littered as it was with the carcasses of dead fish and the gruesome remains of one human being de spite the time it took him to reach the eldorado lamoia arrived to find boldt still crawling twenty yards out he briefly kept the fireman at bay helped the lieutenant to his feet and together they approached the eldorado from which there was no movement no sound please god boldt whispered under his breath matthews a tightjawed lamoia called out his crippled body attempting to support boldt the blind leading the blind daffy boldt hollered the exploding windshield had rained cubes of tempered glass into the vehicle so that she seemed covered in huge sparkling diamonds for a moment the scene looked almost beautiful but her body was slumped against the car door perfectly still her face scratched her chin bleeding shes bleeding boldt chortled excitedly shes bleeding he said gripping lamoias shoulder with enthusiastic force a heart had to be beating for a body to bleed homicide cops rarely saw bleeders i believe she is lamoia said tears choking him as he leaned boldt against the car and he and the fireman hurried to the passenger door to try for a pulse chapter my last conscious thought was that we needed him alive two days after her ordeal daphnes voice remained weak and trembling they sat in the front seat of boldts crown vic outside the home of ron chapman awaiting lamoia boldt wore a walking cast on his left leg daphne wore a cast on the same foot ever the pair he didnt feel the same way about you boldt reminded her he assumed hed be blamed for sanchez but he didnt do her he claimed to have an alibi the airtyme cellular records put him on the bainbridge ferry for the night you were shot at flek did the burglaries no question about it he pushed kawamoto down some stairs but not sanchez not you certainly not schock and phillipp hes not good for any of that which is why were hereto get to the bottom of it despite the obvious risks to our careers that video represents daphne reminded him leave well enough alone he asked is that what im hearing we put flek down in the books for the sanchez assault and we walk away from it there are those who wouldnt give that a second thought given the stakes and are we them he asked daffy im not going to force this on you its both of our careers we either do this unanimously or not at all he added i thought wed been over it she interrupted so did i but sitting here now ready to dig back into it it feels a lot different it would be so easy to cover it up say the word boldt advised her glancing up at the dashboard clock lamoia parked across the street he crossed and slipped into the backseat he carried a file under his arm that boldt had been expecting it arrived a few minutes ago he informed his lieutenant typical ii they handdelivered it and made me sign off on it twice speaking to daphne lamoia said through his wired jaw if its any consolation matthews ive been jammed in a lot worse ways than thisthe video im talking aboutand i know the value of a person keeping his mouth shut if it comes to that no pun intended daphne thanked him boldt flipped open the folder lamoia had delivered and angled it to catch the street light he read the contents flipped pages and read some more ronnie wasnt cut out for this he denied any involvement when sanchez interviewed him lamoia pointed out hopefully we can change that daphne said i feel like im visiting a convalescent home ron chapman said sitting across from boldt at his own kitchen table hed been reluctant to speak with them but boldt flashed him a look at the ii folder and chapman had acquiesced the story of bryce abbott fleks fiery death had already come and gone from the papers and newscasts public interest in the case had faded as quickly as the fish had washed out to sea from miller bay as quickly as it had taken work crews to restore power to eleven hundred households in the world of local tv two days proved to be an eternity boldt daphne and lamoia sat side by side across the table from chapman between us weve got over forty years ronnie boldt reminded the man some good some bad chapman said ive never had a beef with you lou the three of us over here have an ongoing investigation into that assault of the female officer sanchez daphne said lamoia told the uniform mine is more of a personal interest sanchez and i were friends im with you chapman told the three youve always been straight with me ron same here lou and i need you to be so now he repeated straight ive spoken to ii already if thats what this is about thats part of what its about boldt acknowledged krishevski paid me a visit told me about a video you have wouldnt tell me whats on it so maybe youre wasting your time you want to go down with them boldt asked having a vague idea of who them was iill get you for hindering prosecutionyou understand that dont you i got no comment lou boldt said i was with you when you discovered that rifle being switched i think it surprised you he waited a moment course it surprised me chapman said this is about the flu ronnie thats what i think its about some of the guys buying themselves a little extra insurance that the cash flow would be there when the guild funds started running dry its about inside information which is where krishevski fits in he talked when he shouldnt have the best pressure we have is that a missing assault rifle took a shot at me chapmans eyes went wide lamoia suggested youll be hooked up to that if you keep playing it the way you are daphne explained the shooting offers us the best leverage in terms of getting one of them to talk she had no idea what she was talking about but she hoped chapman didnt know that and i fit in how chapman asked vamping boldt said property has always been a clean department ronnie damn right and now this lamoia said gotta break your heart it does the man insisted and us too lamoia said daphne added we hate to see anyone look bad boldt said and we understand that when a guy is dealing with ii hes not about to so much as whisper a fellow officers name without damn good proof because no matter what anyone says any kind of ii association hurts an officer jams him up even ruins him sometimes and for no good reason agreed it was krishevskis shift boldt stated as if certain how long do you cover ronnie boldt readjusted his cast krishevski has three officers under him pendegrass riorden and smythe chapman was feeling uncomfortable im aware of that lou who was it what was it boldt tried to sound convincing one of them stole some assault rifles probably more like two of them given the way the mechanics workone guy having to trip a button upstairs in order for the vault to come open downstairs they sold them into the marketplace for some spending money is that whats on this missing video lamoia asked or was it you who threw the switch to open the warehouse i didnt throw no switch i didnt have nothing to do with that daphne speculated you saw something chapman answered i caught one of sergeant ks guys in house on my shift and he hadnt signed in you gotta sign in louthats on penalty of death in our unit there were threats exchanged obviously i realized something wrong was going down something had come out of the warehouse and it came out on my shiftthat was on purpose and if it came out then it had to go somewhere had to leave the building and fast the garage boldt nodded understanding the logic the warehouse and the lower deck of the parking garage were on the same level i dont know if these guys planned on covering their backsides later or not maybe theyre just plain stupid he looked at lamoia maybe they planned to give me what someone gave you what someone gave sanchez schock phillipp you gotta be some kind of stupid to try any of this but i got the leg up on em if i hadnt maybe somebody would have clubbed me in an alley or on the way out of a bar or something leg up ronnie boldt asked you remember that vandalism in the garage must be two years ago now vaguely boldt answered ii had a pair of cameras installed he recognized boldts blank expression lamoia said the video no one knows about those cameras chapman said the brass wanted it that way they didnt want anyone knowing they knew the vandalism had to be internal cop to cop and they wanted to put somebody right for it the wiring for the closedcircuit stuff runs into the boneyard they installed it saying they were doing maintenance thought theyd hidden the vcrs where wed never see themway up on a shelf in the back but i knew i had to know ive been in that room going on twentyone years i know every creak every sound ive been fighting rats and spiders so long that ive given them names i know every inch of those shelves but no one knew i knew the videotape lamoia repeated the ruddycheeked man grinned i grabbed it that night knowing it was my insurance package locked it away good and tight and if anything happens to me it goes directly to kstvs news four at five oh my god boldt gasped realizing chapman had images that could id the cops responsible for the theft ii caught on how chapman explained i loosened a wire put a blank tape into the vcr hoping to satisfy ii but it didnt of course the flu hit ii sent sanchez to talk to me lamoia guessed you reported that visit to krishevski daphne read the mans face not krishevski then to whom i need that tape boldt said its hidden they watch me probably you too now they want that tape they get hold of it and a week from now youll find me face down in my shower or lying up next to sanchez with my neck broke where does krishevski fit in boldt inquired recalling the mans visit to his home two days before dont look at him for this he knows about your videotape i imagine thats right daphne said having part of the story isnt going to help chapman agreed but couldnt quite bring himself to talk boldt reminded chapman when we looked in the warehouse for the rifle there was a rifle your doing ive never tampered with evidence never will those videotapes daphne said you tampered with those hey he complained those werent part of property you show me one piece of paper saying those were part of property lamoia tipped back in his kitchen chair okay he sighed i say we leave this for ii to mop up hes not going to help us chapman looked over at boldt the first real sign of fear on his face boldt looked the man in the eye you dont want to go down on the record as having told anyone anything daphne added because youve seen what they did to sanchez chapman told her i got a family i got kids boldt suggested so ill tell you whats right and youll stop me where im wrong chapman nodded his okay boldt closed his eyes and assembled the pieces when he reopened them he looked straight at chapman the two pairs of eyes locked together you figured out these guns were stolen and you accused krishevski because his guys were on that tape he paused chapman made no corrections either he told you or you figured out he wasnt directly involved so when sanchez shows up four different times asking questions pendegrass gets worried the next day sanchez is in the hospital another pause chapmans eyes were glassy your loyalty is to the room itself not to any officer krishevski feels pretty much the same as you do knowing you possess this incriminating tape krishevski suggests his boys will return the stolen weapons theyll make it right if you keep quiet and until you and i pulled that gun off the shelf you thought they had returned them he added how am i doing chapman said krishevski couldnt believe his guys could do such a stupid thing blamed himself for leaking news of the sickout practically begged me to let him set it right hes not the one youre after schock and phillipp take over the ii case for sanchez and pay a couple visits to property youre thinking pendegrass is checking the log and youre worried for them you go to the cock and bull looking for pendegrass to tell him to lay off schock and phillipp but theyre right behind you and pendegrass and company take a baseball bat to their heads as wellin part to scare you to let you know whos boss again chapman made no corrections krishevski calls me anonymously because he suspects his boys did schock and phillipp he wont condone that he knows they need to be stopped he plays it cool when i show up at the bar putting on a good act boldt paused no comments from chapman i call down to property and get riorden i start asking about visits by schock and phillipp and suddenly im on the list he paused ive got to have that tape ronnie no chance but you dont need me help me out here ronnie ii installed two cameras one upstairs at the street entrance one downstairs on level two he hesitated they switch tapes once a day fresh ones in place of the ones for the day before so i knew my switch had to be done that night before they arrived to put in the fresh tapes i replaced the tape in the camera on sublevel two with a copy and took the real tape for myself figured it might take them a while to realize my guess was they marked and stored the tapes and kept them around in case any more vandalism was reported maybe erased them after a while for all i know it leaves me the tape for camera one boldt said finally understanding i dont know if it will do you any good just seeing a car pull into the garage ive got the one with the actual business going down and it stays with me i dont think theyre too worried about that other one a couple cops coming and going wheres the foul but you lou maybe you can make something out of it maybe so boldt said glancing at lamoia who was already wearing a grin chapter boldt climbed the steps of the pendegrass home with difficulty due to the walking cast in his hand he nervously wormed the keys to the crown vic and the black remote that opened the doors or trunk in his left hand he carried a videotape in a quick shuffle he had sent liz and the kids across town to stay at the four seasons for the night promising his wife it was only as a precaution liz loved the four seasons she had accepted the request surprisingly calmly despite the late hour boldt took this as a sign they were on the mend he climbed the steps hoping that he and lamoia and daphne had prepared for any and every eventuality knowing full well that one never could there were always holes in any plan especially those made hastily he drew in a deep breath and knocked sharply on the door pendegrass answered he wore those same air nikes that boldt remembered only too well the two men stared at each other so pendegrass finally said boldt held up the videotape for the man to see i couldnt talk chapman out of his and i never will so i guess if youre set on that tape then whatever youve got of my denver trip goes out to whoever you plan on seeing it and this pendegrass asked eyeing the tape in boldts hand this is the one you overlooked even ii overlooked its importance this is the one thats going to hang you once i get it to sid for analysis this is what you want to trade for whether you know it or not its the original if you had me followed from chapmans then you know i went back downtown this is why this tape i substituted a mister rogers for it you think anyone will ever notice not a chance because ii doesnt understand the importance of the second tape as if i know what youre talking about you think im wearing a wire is that it he raised his arms still sore all over search me go ahead ill pass whatever it is youre trying to do nice try boldt youve got a vcr boldt stated five minutes give me five minutes he waved the tape its a real eyeopener an impatient pendegrass considered this and finally stepped back from the door admitting boldt who inside was a nervous wreck if pendegrass had slammed the door in his face it might never have worked the tv occupied a tabletop in a cluttered living room that smelled of cigarettes pendegrasss wife looked in on them but the man waved her away and she closed the door tightly a concerned look overtaking her tired face boldt handed the man the tape and remained standing he identified the vcrs remote and pocketing his own keys took control this had been daphnes suggestion maintain control over the physical environment the way i figure it boldt explained you and the others didnt think there was much to fear from the second security videothe one set up to record the entrance boldt pressed a button on the remote the television showed a grainy blackandwhite security video of spds parking garage but im telling you you underestimate bernie lofgrin pendegrass maintained a look of confidence though boldt had to believe there were cracks there are three men visible in that car you in the passenger seat riorden driving and smythe in the back boldt said advancing the tape to the place where detective andrew smythes face showed clearly through the vehicles backseat window you want me to keep going we come and go at all hours all of us do yourself included this proves what your car went down to level two he advanced the tape as can be clearly seen i dont know where youre going with this boldt but this proves absolutely nothing zero im not going anywhere with this boldt corrected its bernie lofgrin you should be worried about the guys a wizard you see this post right here boldt pointed to the freeze frame of the car on the screen its been scratched a dozen times by cars clipping it too close for lofgrin its going to be all about those scratches they ended up like marks on a measuring stick running up the wall now pendegrass looked concerned any cop knew well enough to fear the things the lab could do lofgrin will measure the height of the rear bumper against those scratches as you fellows arrived and then hell compare that to the height of the same bumper upon your departure less than ten minutes later he stopped to win pendegrasss attention what you should have done boldt advised the man was take the assault rifles but leave the military shipping cases but that would have taken more time right thats what im thinking you were in a hurry the guns dont weigh much at all but those military shipping cases add up lofgrin can measure the height of that bumper going in and coming out he will prove that when you left that garage ten minutes later you were carrying over two hundred extra pounds in the trunk a dead body i dont think so given the missing videotape recorded on that same night and at least one missing weapon what do you think ii is going to make of your visit circumstantial bullshit you wont get to square one with this this was the sticking point of boldts argument the evidence on the tape was circumstantialand only cir cumstantialbut boldt needed pendegrass to believe otherwise might be boldt agreed how do you think ii will look at it about all they ever deal with is circumstantial evidence people are going to get questioned about this people working in the boneyard you the others deals will be offered to one of you chapman will be subpoenaed to turn over that other tape the best laid plans a cop was shot at with one of those stolen weapons this cop boldt said defiantly he walked over to the vcr and took the tape back you guys talk it over my offers on the table for tonight and tonight only pendegrass stood there like a statue boldt said once bernie lofgrin gets this its out of my hands pendegrass tried to sound convincing it dont mean nothing boldt stopped at the front door then youve got nothing to worry about chapter boldts plan came down to the next few hours if he was to turn circumstantial evidence into incriminating evidence he believed it would happen before morning he lived twenty minutes from pendegrass and he spent much of the time with his eyes trained on his rearview mirror and his right hand gently touching the videotape in the seat beside him he couldnt be sure but he believed the same car that had been following him all nightto chapmans downtown and to pendegrassswas still back there a narrow set of headlights with a blue cast to the light itself riorden and smythe lived the closest to him and he assumed one of them would be awaiting his return home either there would be an offer to trade tapes or violence he doubted any call would be placed to his home with an offereven property cops knew better than to leave a paper trail as he pulled into his driveway a seattle mist filled the air fog passing so low to the earth that it gently rinsed everything everyone in its path he ran his wipers even though it wasnt completely necessary he didnt want any surprises he turned off the car that dreaded sense of foreboding enveloping him as well as a deepening sadness that cops were involved he loved the uniform he loved the department and what it stood for it was as simple as that he picked up the video and slid it beneath the seat as he and lamoia had planned once outside the car he used the remote to lock all doors at once he slipped the bulky keys into his pocket wondering what felt so wrong after three or four thoughtful steps he realized what it was the silence the neighbors dog did not bark at him did not scratch at the fence if pendegrass riorden and smythe had been the three men who had assaulted him a week earlierwhich he now believedthen they knew well enough about that dog its silence became all the more frightening pendegrass had taken the bait hello boldt called lugging that walking cast along with him his hand sought out his weapon the back door to his house suddenly seemed extremely far away he reached the bottom of the back steps it was dark up there on the porch there wasnt a light on in the kitchen or the back of the house which was not the way liz would have left it someone had shorted the circuit blown a fuse he didnt want to go up there but didnt want to drag the cast around to the front door even though there would be street light there and neighbors who might see him or hear him if he called out he heard a car door thump shut behind him one street away connected or coincidence he asked himself adrenaline filled him for hed been here before in nearly this exact situation only now there was no dog to come to his rescue now he carried this cast on his leg he glanced back toward the car wondering if he could beat the arrival of whoever was coming through the woods toward himwhoever had parked a street away and was now breaking twigs and brushing past bushes to reach him with a good leg he might have made it but as it was he simply stopped and listened he had believed that pendegrass would demand an exchange of tapes hed made contingency plans but he didnt want to exercise them the sounds from the woods stopped whoever was there was quite close now boldt switched the weapon to his left hand grabbed the wooden rail with his right and started the climb up the back porch stairs one clumsy step at a time he slipped let go the rail and fished his keys out of his pocket only a few feet more to reach the back door he wanted to get the key in the lock and the door open as quickly as possible this was how sanchez felt he decided someone had cut the lights the walk from the garage to the house impossibly far he fingered his keys again noise came from behind him in the woods boldt turned at the top of the stairs i thought you were going to call he shouted eyes straining to see in the dark i thought you would have headed straight downtown the muffled voice of pendegrass said he stepped out from the thick shrubbery that separated boldt from his backyard neighbors that would have been the right card to play coming home that was a stupid move he heard someone immediately behind him in the dark of the porch riorden he asked whoever was back there didnt answer that troubled him if it was negotiation they were after why remain silent pendegrass stepped closer barely visible in the dark he wore a balaclava over his head you think too much he said adding sometimes a person is better off just accepting the way things are you havent seen sanchez boldt reminded him to me thats the way things are shes getting better i hear pendegrass said movement in both legs shell pull through this you watch and then whatll be the point of all the fuss he repeated whatll be the point of all these heroics on your part wholl care flek did sanchez and fleks dead case closed if only it were true boldt lamented and thats worth getting the shit beat out of you already had the shit beat out of me boldt re minded him is that all and here i was thinking youre going to kill me giving up the tape buys you a simple beating call me generous he had reached close enough for boldt to make out the dark clothing and the ugliness of the faceless balaclava i thought we were going to trade thats what i mean you think too much pendegrass said and dont be thinking about that gun youre outgunned here old man drop the gun keep it at a simple beating he waited only a moment before ordering boldt for a second time to drop his weapon but boldt held onto his gun albeit with his left hand is that riorden or smythe behind me boldt asked the night air because whoever it is he gets my first shots drop the gun you think that vest is going to save you pendegrass asked it forces you to aim boldt replied disappointed that pendegrass had spotted the bulk of the vest im aiming right at your head came a deep voice from behind boldt smythe chills ran down his spine boldt didnt know the man well but he knew him to be a crack shot he tossed his weapon into the grass at the base of the steps mentally marking its exact location you missed the first time you tried boldt said assuming the attempt on his life had come from smythe not pendegrass who drank too much to be a good shot pendegrass said i thought that was your friend from colorado your dead friend have you informed smythe here that if he hadnt been so greedy and had returned the rifle as krishevski ordered you to do with all the other rifles if he hadnt been so stupid as to use it on me maybe id never have been the wiser about any of this boldt saw pendegrasss hand twitchthe one holding the sidearm body language daphne would have told boldt the bulge at the mans ankle filled in the blanks it was a drop gun a second gun and its purpose became clear boldt had half expected a confrontation like this but only then did he understand pendegrass inviting smythe along it wasnt for the mans marksmanship boldt sensed a hesitation in pendegrass that he blamed on how dark it was up on the porch the mans handgun carried a barrelmounted silencer hed come prepared turning his head slowly boldt asked the shadows whyd he ask you along do you think shut up pendegrass called out a little loudly for a residential neighborhood if boldt could keep him at that volume maybe someone else would notice the dog had been silenced boldt answered his own question one guy against a guy in a cast how hard can that be ill tell you why he invited you shut up he needs it nice and clean needs it to look like i shot you after you shot me only its pendegrass who shoots us both he looked back to pendegrass isnt that right chuck he spoke again to the dark porch you sure you want to be aiming at me im not armed but he is and look at his ankle hes carrying a drop as well whats with that shut up because otherwise if i get shot if theres an officer down with no one to blame theres gonna be one hell of a manhunt if youd hit me the other night it might have been blamed on flek but matthews interviewed him before he died did you know that now you boys have made a mess of it and chuck here intends to clean it up and keep himself in the clear thats bullshit rod pendegrass called out boldt reminded him he had me inside his house tape in hand whyd he let me go whyd he let me come back here my wife pendegrass answered quickly he ordered the tape boldt now no more of this i want that tape its in the car boldt said no fucking way pendegrass barked search me ask him he said motioning to the porch he was here waiting for me he saw me get out of the car he turned slightly did i have a videotape on me for a moment there was only the drone of an airplane far off and the low constant hum of traffic i didnt see it on him smythe confirmed untuck your shirt pendegrass ordered boldt did as he was told no tape fell out im telling you its in the car he added but then again i wouldnt shoot me just yet if i were you what if i dropped it off at a friends on the way over from boldts right a third voice then id have seen you riorden said also wearing a balaclava he stepped around the corner of the house there to block any attempt at an exit to the street to pendegrass he said he didnt stop anywhere the third part of the puzzle no more surprises no ones going to shoot you boldt pendegrass stated all we want is that videotape we were going to trade boldt reminded change of plans you ever get any idea to breathe a word of any of this and matthews ends up like sanchez or worse thats my leverage on you that and the tape thats my promise boldt felt another chill race down his spine pendegrass had made the wrong threat he had also just made an admission of guilt by mentioning sanchez boldt had much of what he wanted front seat of the car boldt said take the tape and get out of here before i lose my temper pendegrass chuckled amused im quaking all over he moved toward the crown vic though never taking his eyes off boldt he tried the passenger door but found it locked keys he called out to boldt boldt let the keys dangle from his right hand thinking that if pendegrass or the others had half a brain they would wonder why hed opted to have his keys out and ready in his right hand smythe might think hed intended to open the back door of the house but then why not switch hands with the gun when pendegrass had walked out of the shrubs but they werent thinking that was just the point they hadnt been thinking when theyd stolen the guns off krishevskis tip about the strike they hadnt been thinking when theyd broken sanchezs neck in an attempt to rough her up and get her off the ii investigation they hadnt been thinking when theyd tried to cover it up by making it look like flek guys like this didnt thinkthey reacted it was all they were capable of things got a remote boldt informed him letting the keys hang from his hand ill do it for you he lifted his right hand pointing the small remote device toward the car the way people aim clickers at their televisions straightarmed and determined again that eerie silence punctuated only by the keys ringing together like tiny bells boldt pushed the button the doors to the car clicked open pendegrass pulled on the door handle and opened the passenger door he leaned inside boldt pushed the remotes other button as the cars trunk popped open boldt shut his eyes collapsed to the steps and rolled down them lamoia came up out of the cars trunk lobbing a phosphorus grenade a police issue semiautomatic clutched tightly and ready to fire boldt heard one shot he wasnt sure from where he caught hold of his fallen handgun on the roll and opened his eyes to the devastating pure white glare of pendegrass coming out the passenger door burning brightly in that light like an angel he had let go of the videotape and it floated through the air in an eerie slowmotion arc one hand shielding his eyes casting a triangle of black across his brow he raised the tip of that silencer toward boldt who saw no choice but to fire he aimed low tracking his shots as two holes appeared in the side of the crown vic and a third found the mans knee bludgeoning it into a bloody pulp the force of a ton of bricks hit boldts chest knocking the wind out of him hed been shot drop the weapons he heard lamoia order through his wired teeth a siren cried in the distance on the ground now no one gets hurt his sergeant shouted they had two witnesses to pendegrasss mention of sanchez boldt and lamoia even if other charges failed they had all three on assaulting police officers attempted murder and deadly force boldt felt down and determined hed been hit in the vest not flesh it didnt feel that way his breathing was labored he couldnt speak the phosphorus died down hissing like a winded runner and boldt could see again smythe was down fatally woundedriordens doing not lamoias in testimony it would come out from riorden that he and pendegrass had in fact intended to kill both boldt and smythe just as boldt had guessed boldt for obvious reasons smythe for his stupidity and greed pendegrass lay bleeding passed out against the car the fallen videotape just out of his reach his fingers still stretching for it lamoia soaked through with sweat kept his weapon aimed at riordens back the man was leaning spread out flat against the wall of the house bleeding from his left arm you got him lamoia inquired indicating pendegrass ive got him its a mess yes it is boldt agreed lamoia hopped out of the trunk walked over to riorden and placed the barrel of the weapon against the base of the mans skull the location of the denver video he said ominously john boldt complained thats not how to do it we did this your way sarge we do this other thing my way he jabbed the gun you give up the video and your shooting of smythe goes down as a stray bullet with all this other shit youll still get life but you wont get lethal injection he added youve got three seconds to decide one two chuck has it the man spit out onto the wall locked up i think i dont know lamoia backed off pulled his cell phone from his pocket and hit a button you there he asked when a voice answered its pendegrass and youve got all the probable cause you need chapter boldt stepped out of interrogation room a the box at am an empty mug that had held tea in his hand lamoia was still in the next room over getting interviewed by his fellow homicide officers just as boldt had any officerinvolved shooting required the surrender of ones weapon a half dozen interviews and a mile of paperwork it wouldnt all sort itself out for another week she sat in one of the gray office chairs the kind with four spread feet on black rollers her left ankle encased in a removable cast looked more like a ski boot only daphne matthews could look so beautiful at four in the morning hey he said went a little differently than you thought she told him barely able to conceal her anger she didnt like him taking chances like that he took the bait boldt said thats what we needed at what cost im not saying it wasnt messy im not saying i might not do it differently given hindsight i considered involving the department for backup but these guys were too well connected they would have heard we were out to sting them and we would have either come up empty or dead so john took the trunk and we went for it you sent me to pendegrasss house without telling me why too big a risk no because you might have talked me out of it he paused youre mad damn right so are they he said indicating the interrogation room every right to be he sighed yeah well im whipped give an old man a ride home they confiscated the crown vic im without wheels he won a partial smile from her old man she quoted pendegrass called me that so blowing out his knee was generous of you damn right he added more like lucky i suppose im not very good prone like that youre pretty good prone she said pursing her lips and letting him know that they could still tease the kiss had been forgotten or at least wiped away she tapped her purse boldt missed the message he said are we going she clicked the purse open inside was a black plastic rectangle a videotape she explained i kicked the pendegrass home ahead of sid as soon as i got johns call i looked everywhere turned the place upside down couldnt find it then whats that he asked bernie lofgrin says that you owe him your original chet baker the ones thats autographed it was a original vinyl in perfect condition one of the prizes of boldts jazz collection small change boldt thought he says that he doesnt want to know whats on the tape and that as far as hes concerned there never was a tape his guys found it they make these books with fake leather bindings that arent books at all but hold videotapes in your bookshelf his guys found it in the bedroom while i was out searching the garage lofgrin brought it to me as lead on the search and seizure and i had to tell him tell him what i thought it was before he put it onto the inventory lou ive never done anything like this she passed it to boldt he held the tape in his hand his reputation possibly the end of his career on homicide he couldnt be sure and then he handed it back to her we return it to bernie right now while theres still time and he puts it into the inventory he told her ill give him that album anyway just because he was willing to go that far tears formed in her eyes as she looked up at him she nodded this was what she wanted to hear he said it isnt us doing something like this and besides pendegrass will mention the tape its going to come out the best thing we can do is stand up to it sheila hill is ultimately the one to decide if our relationship compromises her department and shes been in a few compromising positions herself you dont need to know about that shell go light on us believe me the tears spilled down her cheek tears of joy he hoped am i allowed to say i love you she whispered hell no he said offering her his hand and extricating her from the chair but that kind of thing goes both ways so you be careful yes sir thats better he said touching her in the small of the back and aiming her toward the elevator he couldnt do the stairs in the cast it would be a while until he could do the stairs again look at us a pair of gimps yes she said laughing through her tears a pair of gimps
