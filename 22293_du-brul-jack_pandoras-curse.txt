jack du brul pandoras curse greenland august the entire length of the air force c stratofreighter shuddered as the portside outboard engine began misfiring again this time was much worse than before and rather than risk his plane becoming too unstable major jack delaney shut down the twentyeightcylinder pratt and whitney wasp he reduced the drag by feathering the prop so the blades cut the slipstream edgewise but the plane still felt sluggish in his hands were in a world of hurt arent we major asked his copilot lieutenant jerry winger delaney didnt respond as he studied the gauges for the three working engines every instinct told him that they hadnt seen the last of whatever had affected the power plant the remaining engines were running hot making him think that the problem wasnt with the plane but with the fuel theyd taken on in england most likely poorly maintained tanker trucks had contaminated the fuel he looked out the windshield known as the greenhouse throughout the air force because it was made up of nineteen individual panes of plexiglas it resembled the cockpit of the venerable b on which the stratofreighter was based eighteen thousand feet below the military air transport service cargo plane the desolate north atlantic was as dark as the slag heaps in delaneys native west virginia the sky was thankfully clear only a few stringers of high cirrus clouds smeared the air high above the plane but delaney didnt know how much longer his aircraft would remain aloft yeah jer we might just be delaney finally replied glancing at winger he saw his own concern reflected in the younger mans eyes despite the heat blasting into the pressurized cabin the major felt a chill race across his skin like sheet lightning tom where the hell are we tom sanders the navigator was seated at his tiny desk behind the cockpit a chart spread before him and a worried frown on his face closer to greenland than iceland if thats what youre wondering thats what i was afraid of the pilot grunted id say were about forty miles from the greenland coast delaneys experience was that it took a series of small mishaps to lead to the catastrophe of a crash except he thought darkly during the war when flak or a japanese zero came out of nowhere hed had a few close scrapes during his command of a b but delaney had never lost a man now however his luck might have finally run out this time fate was dealing him one problem after another and there wasnt much the major could do it had started an hour out of england when they were rocked by a sudden wind gust that shifted an improperly secured cargo pallet in the hold of the giant aircraft it was not a mortal problem it merely caused the c to fly out of trim delaney was forced to keep firm pressure on the wheel so the plane maintained an even keel he had reported the incident back to the controllers and had them inform the isolated air force base at thule greenland that their supply plane would be coming in late he also said he wanted the head of whoever was responsible for tying down cargo when he returned the crew then had several troublefree hours until an electrical fault had sparked in the radios shorting out the entire system they were one hundred miles past iceland flying northwest and suddenly the plane was without communications tom sanders had tried to fix the set but got nothing for his troubles except some singed fingertips delaney had considered turning back except problems at dover air force base where normal cargo flights to thule originated had hampered three recent attempts to resupply the base above the arctic circle he also knew the narrow weather window they were enjoying would close before another mission could take off he now considered his decision to press on as another of the small mishaps befalling the crew of the stratofreighter then just half an hour ago lieutenant winger had noticed the engines were running hot delaney had opened the cowls around the four pratt and whitneys in an effort to cool them adding more drag to the aircraft and slowing them further the tactic had worked for a while but the temperatures began creeping inexorably back toward the red that was when the number one engine began to misfire it cleared itself for a few minutes and then started sputtering again vibrating the airframe until her aluminum ribs creaked delaney had no choice but to shut it down when the temp drops enough well try to restart the engine he told winger tom are there any landing strips on this side of greenland no sir chart shows nothing except mountains and ice there is a place called camp decade about a hundred and fifty miles south of where were going to cross the coast but its strips designed for planes with skis damn delaney paused his mind working out distances and odds all right if the engine doesnt refire smoothly well swing around and try for iceland major thats about two hundred and thirty miles behind us there was a tight edge in sanderss voice he was too young to have seen combat during the war and delaney suspected that this was the first time the young officer had tasted true fear during the five minutes the pilot waited for the number one engine to cool the flight deck was quiet even when the towering ramparts and dark fjords that protected eastern greenland came into view delaney had never seen such a forlorn place the mountains were all snowcapped and behind them the relentless greenland ice shelf pressed against their landward side so that great glaciers spilled between the valleys tumbling to the ocean like frozen waterfalls delaney knew that beyond the small strip of coast there was a sea of ice about eight hundred and fifty thousand miles square and as thick as any ocean was deep okay major temp is down in number one in fact it looks like all the horses are running in a row now delaney scanned the gauges and saw that the open cowlings had worked in cooling the engines again he restarted number one and it began purring sedately as though there had never been a problem working the prop controls he felt the four blades bite into the air and the c become more responsive thats a little better he breathed and winger and sanders exchanged grins feet dry in about five minutes the plane cleared the mountains at one hundred and eighty knots well below her optimum cruising speed and much lower than her most efficient altitude beyond the strip of icecarved mountains delaney and winger were faced with an expanse of ice that stretched far beyond the horizon under the immense weight of new snow dropping in the interior the billions of tons of ice were slowly moving toward the coast like an endless conveyor belt as the ice moved it scraped against the underlying rock so that any irregularities under the milethick mantle appeared on the surface as huge fractured ridges the cap was so riven that to delaney it looked like a hurricane sea had been flash frozen every wave rendered in razorsharp crests that sometimes reached a hundred feet into the air jesus he said under his breath lieutenant winger was just turning to say something to delaney when engine number one exploded the double banks of cylinders came apart like a bomb shrapnel and oil and burning fuel blasting apart the nacelle like it had been hit by antiaircraft artillery in seconds the wing around the burning engine was blackened by flame and soon it began to come apart as the wind ripped at the tears in the aluminum caused by redhot debris the c winged over as she lost lift on her left side delaney fought the plane taking just an instant to see the altimeter spinning backward in a blur he noted that winger was already shutting off fuel to the wrecked power plant good man tom what do you see the pilot shouted his lips pulled back around his teeth from the exertion of keeping his crippled plane in the air the navigator looked out the tiny window next to his station his training had taken over and rather than give in to the fear that cramped his stomach he spoke calmly the engines gone and the wing looks like its about to let go too shes still burning wait shes going out fuels off winger said as he straightened back to the controls and added his strength to delaneys on the wheel son of a bitch weve lost most of the aileron on the port side jerry feather the number four prop weve got to level her out shes pulling too hard on the starboard side winger did as ordered and since the crew halved the thrust on her one side the stratofreighter slowly began to straighten but still she was losing altitude in the thirty seconds since the explosion they had dropped to ten thousand feet and continued to plummet the two pilots held on grimly teasing the weakened controls so the plane stayed level there was nothing they could do about holding her in the sky it was just a matter of how gently they could put her on the ice start looking for a smooth area we can set this crate delaney had recovered from his initial terror and his voice was crisp and commanding once again im looking but the ice is just too broken up winger glanced at the altimeter five thousand feet in the denser atmosphere there was a little more lift under the wings and her descent became easier delaney tried to raise her nose slightly hoping to regain some altitude but the c dipped to port again for a panicked second he fought to level her what do you see out there before winger could respond the cockpit was suddenly filled with smoke a noxious mixture of burning oil and hydraulic fluid that cut visibility down to zero the thick pall made all three men gag as petrochemicals scoured their throats and burned into their eyes like acid sanders screamed that he had a fire right behind him groping blindly delaney reached forward to shut off the cabin pressure and vent the cockpits air in an instant the smoke cleared leaving the men choking to draw in the fresh yet frigid air get that fire out delaney rasped in the moments between the time the fire ignited and the time hed cleared the cockpit the plane had lost another thousand feet it was now dipping in a dangerous lazy spiral talk to me jerry whats out there nothing winger coughed one hand on his chest as if the gesture would extinguish the pain from his scalded lungs hold on a second he studied an area of clear ice it was under the shadow of a black granite mountain i got it delaney said at the same instant winger pointed it out to him fires out major but i cant promise for how long sanders had been hardest hit by the smoke and his voice sounded like he was drawing his last breath banking the lumbering cargo plane as gently as he could major delaney brought them around lining up the cs bulbous nose with the patch of smooth ice with as much care as hed ever shown in his life they were at two thousand feet and the airspeed was down to one hundred and ten knots he judged that his landing site was about four miles away and began to reduce their altitude this was a oneshot attempt and his knuckles were white on the control wheel he barely noticed that the cockpit temperature was thirty degrees below zero and ice was forming on the inside of the windows shes feeling a little more responsive winger said as he helped turn the c into the prevailing northward wind for her final approach must be the thicker air yeah delaney agreed feeling just a touch of optimism for the first time since the explosion every second he had the plane under control meant their chances were that tiny bit better should we try flaps no if they dont deploy on the port side the planell flip at two miles out the pilots could see that the area they intended to use as a landing strip wasnt nearly as smooth as theyd first thought it was ravaged by the high winds and the layer of new snow that would have cushioned the plane had been torn away leaving grotesquely shaped daggers of ice that could tear through the boeings thin skin and slice open her fuel tanks delaney ordered winger to dump their remaining fuel then prepared himself for the inevitable lift as the plane became lighter he calculated that there would be just enough avgas in the lines for him to maintain power until the plane was safely down he feared fire more than he feared the upcoming landing hed seen too many comrades returning from bombing missions in crippled planes make a safe touchdown only to have their bs burst into flames on the runway what about the landing gear wingers hand was poised over the switches id rather flop her in on her belly we cant risk a landing strut hitting one of those ice ridges had they lost their instruments there would have been no way to tell their proximity to the ground it was one of the bewildering aspects of flying in arctic conditions the absolute sameness wherever you looked it was mostly the trees delaney missed he could determine altitude by gauging their height his only visual reference here was the barren mountains looming out the starboard windows experience said they were about three thousand feet high but they could easily be just three hundred his hands tightened even further on the yoke the cold was affecting him now his eyes felt dried out though tears streamed down his cheeks he could barely feel the rudder pedals the altimeter spun through five hundred feet the stratofreighter droned in her two working engines maintaining a steady descent details of the ice field became crisper the closer they got and what delaney and winger saw was not good this would be a rough landing even if the ice were smooth but it wasnt the veil of snow blowing off the ice swirled and eddied against countless concretehard ridges delaney bumped the throttles feeling he needed a bit more altitude before flaring the crippled plane she came in level despite the winds desire to slew her around the closest mountain was only a quarter mile off the right wing yet it offered little protection from deadly wind shears he sensed a gust coming up and reacted accordingly fighting the spongy controls to keep the wings of the artificial horizon indicator balanced call the altitude one hundred feet winger replied at once tom you strapped in tight sanderss answer was a pained moan delaney had the plane so winger twisted around to check on the radioman he gasped tom sanderss face was coated with blood that ran from his nose in twin jets and steamed in the flight decks freezing air most of the blood had solidified into a crusty sheet covering the lower half of his face he cradled his head in his mittened hands pressing against his skull with so much force his upper body trembled his eyes bulged as though they were on stalks and more blood leaked from around them tom what happened winger assumed their radioman had hit his face against the navigation table sanders moaned again louder and began clawing at his chest smearing blood on his leather jacket like paint strokes jerry i need you jack delaney called they were fifty feet above the ice winger turned back to the controls somethings wrong with tom hes hurt a gust took the c pushing it to the left winger and delaney responded in concert easing the plane back on course they brought the nose up ever so slightly air beneath the wings was forced against the ice providing a cushion called ground effect that the plane gently sank through speeds one hundred knots delaneys concentration was total this was nothing like the countless flights hed done for the berlin airlift where planes were stacked up four and five high waiting for landing instructions this was a onetime thing land her safely or crash there was no third option in the clear air the ground came up deceptively fast he held her aloft for a moment longer then felt pressure against the yoke as though a weight had been forced against wingers column he turned and saw his copilot slumped forward in his seat his stiffened arms pushing on his wheel winger spasmed throwing himself back again droplets of blood from his nose and eyes splattered the inside of the cockpit a scream came out as a gurgling cry more blood fountained from his lips delaney guessed that it was the effects of the smoke inhalation fortunately he hadnt gotten it as strongly as his two crewmen there was no time to help delaney focused his vision on the landing just as the fully loaded plane hit the ice with a rending scrape her belly smashed into the ground delaney was instantly blinded by a fury of ice particles and snow he felt the props on the two working engines tear into the surface and then shatter the huge blades breaking off one sounding like it had scythed through the aluminum skin of the payload area the engine drone was replaced by the sound of the plane being ripped apart by the ice every jarring crash into a ridge slammed delaney against his seat restraints until his shoulders felt broken it went on and on the airspeed indicator had barely dipped below one hundred knots it wasnt possible delaney thought they should have been slowing his view was completely whited out he had no references nothing to judge their position or progress but it seemed that the plane was turning to the right toward the mountains the shaking vibrations continued unabated the airframe shuddering delaneys head pounded with the strain of trying to see what was happening he kept his hands away from the control yoke but his feet remained on the rudder pedals now he was sure the plane was turning to the right so he applied left rudder hoping to straighten them out to avoid the rocky projections that fronted the mountains when he felt he had corrected the skid he released the rudder and prayed he was right blinded by the maelstrom of snow blowing around the hurtling aircraft delaney couldnt have known how wrong his perception had been the plane had been following a straight line until he hit the rudder pedal the pilots actions turned the stratofreighter and now she was traveling toward a gentle hill that rose out of the ice the plane hit it and climbed up to its crest the low friction between aircraft and ice had not reduced her speed enough and for a moment they became airborne again lifting off the surface the plane flew out of the snow it had kicked up delaney screamed seeing they were headed for the rocks the c hit the ground a second time more violently than the first the ice here wasnt level it sloped down toward the mountains riding up and over hills that aeons of glaciation had worn down incredibly the plane picked up speed like a toboggan delaneys vision was obscured once again and for this he was thankful there was nothing he could do the aircraft hit an outcrop of rock the crash twisted it on its axis so that the port wing led its headlong rush momentum tilted the plane until the wing hit the ice and gouged a furrow into it throwing off tons of material like a snowplow this was the drag the plane needed to slow and when the wing finally snapped near its tip it was moving at no more than thirty knots another impact with a rock scrubbed off more speed and delaney felt that they would make it several windows had shattered and snow blew into the cockpit on a shrieking wind delaneys face was scoured as though hit by a sandblaster even numbed he knew he was bleeding the c stopped suddenly when her nose dug into a snowbank on the leeward edge of a foothill avalanches of snow poured through the broken windows piling into the cockpit until delaneys legs were buried but he was alive at first everything felt silent and still he sat there his labored breathing producing billows of condensation like cigarette smoke but he could not hear it or feel it everything just felt calm as his terror subsided into immeasurable relief and with relief came pride not one in twenty pilots could have pulled that off not one in fifty only then did he become aware of the wind howling outside and the volleys of ice that raked the fuselage like machine gun fire he wiped his cheeks and his hands came away covered with blood he felt no pain he was too numb for that but it reminded him of winger in his seat the copilot was dead his eyes wide and sightless the blood on his face had turned into a frozen mask tom delaney called to the navigator behind him tom are you okay there was no response his crew was dead the veteran pilot couldnt allow himself grief just yet he knew that if he didnt act soon hed be joining his men first he had to dig himself out of the cockpit so much snow had blown through the windows that he couldnt move his legs more than a fraction of an inch and even that took all his strength he felt weak weaker than he should have delaney wanted to close his eyes and rest for just a minute a particularly loud fusillade of ice pummeling the aircraft roused him even as his eyelids drooped once he was free of the flight deck delaney was sure hed be all right loaded onto the stratofreighter were thirty tons of supplies destined for thule including fuel food survival clothing and other arctic gear everything he would need to survive on the ice until rescue came of that he was supremely confident they would be searching for him within hours of his overdue arrival at the base he could use the plane as a base until then warm and with his belly full it was only a matter of time a few days maybe a week at the most but they would find him if only his head didnt ache so much if only he could stop the nosebleed that continued to pour coppery fluid into his mouth vienna austria the present when the weather was nice the old man and his little dachshund were a fixture along karntnerstrasse the trendy shopping street that passed next to the inner citys celebrated opera house was regularly jammed with gaping tourists and hustling locals yet many of the shop owners recognized the shuffling man and his sausageshaped dog he had walked this route for years many called him herr doktor though no one knew he truly deserved such a title it did fit him however his eyes were bright despite his years and his voice was captivating and learned it was late july and the air was warm and filled with the smells of pastry and traffic the doktor was affected by the pains of age so he wore a thin jacket over his buttoned shirt and cardigan and a homburg on his head in winter handel his dachshund sported a tartan sweater that made her look like a small piece of luggage but today her sleek black fur glistened like anthracite he strode with a special purpose this morning and many who recognized him were surprised to see him walking so early usually he wouldnt pass the wedding cakelike baroque staatsoper until ten or ten thirty handel seemed to sense his urgency and she trotted at his side obediently beyond the looming finance ministry building the foot spire of stephansdom cathedral shot into the air the massive gothic church with its mosaictiled roof was the symbol for vienna the way paris was defined by the eiffel tower before reaching johannesgasse the old man guided his dog to the right waiting at the curb for several red trams and a string of cars and trucks to thunder past the exhaust of so many vehicles had darkened the lower floors of many of the buildings so that architectural details were lost under countless years of grime in the warren of small streets near st annes church handel began to get excited she knew they were approaching their destination the house like all the others on the narrow lane was two stories tall and fronted with white stucco there was a tiny courtyard garden behind it and decorative wrought ironwork over the windows and at the eave of the steep roof affixed next to the heavy door was a discreet bronze plaque that read institute for applied research the men who ran the institute allowed their caretaker frau goetz to live in the tworoom apartment tucked into the back corner of the house though it was only nine she already had the front door unlocked and when the doktor stepped into the entry he could smell coffee and a freshly made torte he reached down to unclip handels leash and she ran off to her favorite spot in the back of the house where the morning sun had warmed her blankets guten morgen herr doktor frau goetz said coming out of the kitchen to help the elderly history professor off with his jacket guten morgen frau goetz replied doktor jacob eisenstadt the two had known each other for forty years and yet they had never uttered the others given name only a few years junior to her employer frau goetz shared his deep respect for the more formal traditions from before the war he was no more likely to call her ingrid than she was to wear slacks this in no way diminished the care she showed eisenstadt and his partner in the institute professor theodor weitzmann both men had been widowers for so long that without her influence they would have reverted to a bachelors slovenliness she made sure the clothes they wore had the proper number of buttons and the lunch she prepared for them would be at least one wholesome meal they ate each day professor weitzmann is already upstairs frau goetz informed him he beat you here by an hour we agreed not to come in before ten the old fool couldnt wait eh apparently not herr doktor the housekeeper knew what these men did and believed strongly in their cause but she just couldnt get caught up in one more batch of musty papers the way they did at times they were like young boys i will bring aspirin for his eyestrain when i bring up your lunch danke eisenstadt said absently he had already turned toward the stairs the institute was cluttered beyond reason and no amount of straightening by frau goetz could help she dusted regularly but so many old books and papers arrived at the quiet house that she could never seem to keep up bookcases lined every wall in the front rooms stacked floor to ceiling and interrupted only by the small windows that overlooked the street there were even shelves above the doors for littleused manuscripts and documents there were books in the bathroom piles of loose papers atop the toilet tank and since frau goetz had her own shower in the apartment the clawfooted tub was also mounded with binders of material the stairs to the second floor were narrow and made more so by piles of books on one side of each tread every book and binder and loose file of documents ran to a single theme and doktor eisenstadt had read all of it this had been his life for forty years accumulating information sifting through it carefully to find the one thread he could pull to get answers and retribution on the wall at the top of the stairs was a narrow space between two more bookcases in a simple frame was a picture of eisenstadts inspiration simon weisenthal and below it was a epitaph etched in a piece of wood and signed by the great man himself never again eisenstadt didnt need to see the engraving as a reminder his own memories and the numbers tattooed on his forearm would never let him forget like weisenthal eisenstadt and weitzmann were camp survivors turned nazi hunters more accurately these two were hunters for the gold and other precious commodities stolen from the jews by the nazi regime at the head of the stairs eisenstadt turned to his left and stepped into the office theodor we promised not to come in early today he said though he wasnt really upset you are here an hour before your normal arrival too theodor weitzmann was shorter than his partner and not as round in the middle his hair was a wild mane of white and his eyebrows were huge bushes above his dark eyes the office overlooked the garden and smelled of pipe tobacco for both men indulged despite doctors warnings two desks butted against each other in the center of the room their scarred tops littered with papers and pipe ash each man had several framed photographs on his desk the two largest being their longdead wives have you started going through the new material eisenstadt eased himself into his antique chair the wood creaking as loudly as his joints of course why do you think i got here two hours before i promised i would and what have you learned jacob i wont draw your conclusions for you the two had the abrasive relationship of friends who knew they could never hurt the other jacob took the mild rebuke in silence and lit his first bowl of the day finally he had to say some sort of rejoinder stop overfeeding handel i think she is constipated who isnt frau goetz came up with a silver tray laden with coffee and two slices of sacher torte as was a viennese tradition dating back centuries she also brought two small glasses of water theo had told her countless times to dispense with the water since neither man drank it but she continued the custom so tell me what has you two so excited this morning she placed the coffee service on the only open area of the joined desks i assume it has to do with the courier delivery just before you left yesterday you know we have been cultivating a source in stalingrad weitzmann said like jacob he used the wartime names for many of the cities in the former ussr yes he started sending you recently declassified archive material rather mysteriously too we dont know who this man is or how hes getting the documents but we are more than grateful for them arent we jacob highly irregular eisenstadt said from around a mouthful of cake but it is firstrate material mostly originals of german documents captured by the soviet army when they took berlin in the soviets have held on to this information for decades and now someone is sending it to you frau goetz asked with a trace of mockery the institute has a good reputation theo defended automatically but he knew what the housekeeper meant they were not as well known or as well funded as other organizations involved in the same work two months ago it started just a trickle if you recall two small envelopes in a week and then nothing for another ten days and then that large parcel that the deliveryman had to help us drag up here for the past three weeks weve been receiving more small envelopes through the regular mail they tell an amazing story one we hope will conclude with the special delivery we received yesterday i see frau goetz knew enough not to ask the men to divulge their tale until they were ready then i shall leave you to your work lunch will be promptly at twelve herr doktor i will walk handel for you at eleven if you wish thank you frau goetz eisenstadt was already absorbed in a loose collection of papers emblazoned with the wehrmacht eagle that theo had passed across to him at noon frau goetz brought their lunch but the two hardly noticed they were lost in another world one of evil and corruption where the existence of men and women had been reduced to numbers on bills of lading six thousand to dachau on november two hundred for labor use at peenemunde such was their preoccupation theo weitzmann didnt bother with the aspirin she had brought though his weak eyes watered painfully the delivery yesterday consisted of five hundred pages of documents and they scoured each one talking only when they had a question about a specific reference much of this was not new to them they knew the names of many of the ss officers and guards mentioned within the material by four in the afternoon they had each read everything word for word not one detail had been overlooked they sat in silence lighting their pipes to distract them from the inevitable conclusion nothing new theo said sadly we still dont know the shipments final destination have patience my friend the nazis were fanatical record keepers they tracked everything we could follow the life of one particular paper clip if we wanted do you seriously think that they didnt maintain detailed reports on the transport of twentyeight tons of gold looted from russia i know the records exist i just wonder if our enigmatic benefactor has them and if he will send them to us hes sent us everything else to this point remember until he first contacted us we didnt even know this consignment existed im sure he will tell us everything when it becomes available to him eisenstadts eyes narrowed in the particular scowl that had terrified hundreds of students he had taught at the university besides which there was something new here that you overlooked where theodor leaned forward offended look here eisenstadt leafed through papers until he found the one and handed it to professor weitzmann at the bottom see it the name ah i am sorry old friend you are right a major otto schroeder was present when the gold arrived in hamburg on june this is the first time ive seen his name at least connected to the gold jacob agreed we need to check our files to see if hes in anything else we have i must say though i dont recognize his name at all weitzmann was thoughtful no neither do i it doesnt appear he was with the ss or with an unterseeboot squadron major is an army rank not naval the biggest fear they shared was that since hamburg was a port city the gold had been loaded onto a uboat and spirited out of europe if that was the case they doubted they would be able to track it themselves they would have no choice but to turn over their findings to a larger and better endowed agency we have a new lead it seems we need to learn about this major schroeder it is possible hes still alive and can tell us what happened once the gold reached hamburg or maybe one of his children knows something are you suggesting that we will not receive more documents from russia i am making sure eisenstadt snapped that we are pursuing every possible avenue we know the gold was stolen from russian jews by the german army as they rolled into the country we also know that it has never been recovered this represents almost a billion us dollars i will not rest until that money is returned to its rightful owners calmly jacob theodor soothed his agitated friend neither of us will rest eisenstadt looked contrite but he did not apologize for his outburst his passion to restore stolen property was something for which he would never apologize with his head wreathed in aromatic smoke he added conspiratorially if we are lucky we will find schroeder alive and we can send our top operative to interview him frau goetz had come into the room and stood in front of the closed window her broad body all but blocking the light streaming through she had heard this last comment and on this one subject she would voice her concerns you two should leave her alone you pressure her too much she has her own life to live frau goetz anika is my granddaughter and she helps us because she wants to not because of any pressure eisenstadt and frau goetz had had this debate every time hed asked his granddaughter to assist them he would never set foot in his native germany again austrias complicity in the holocaust was almost as reprehensible but in his line of work he needed to be in the center of things anika who lived in munich had become an unpaid assistant whenever they needed something from there deep down he knew her aid was more out of loyalty than conviction but he took help wherever he could get it she would be married with children by now if she wasnt helping you two every time you wanted something there is where you are wrong theodor said quickly for he loved anika as much as her grandfather anika would be climbing every mountain between antarctica and spitzbergen if it wasnt for us we are helping her find her focus you are helping her find your focus not hers frau goetz stated and crossed her arms over her breasts she would say no more herr doktor you must go walk handel it will be past her suppertime by the time you get home eisenstadt fumbled a pocket watch from his cardigan sweater and noted the time yes thank you theo i will see you tomorrow and maybe well get something new from the mail i am going to work late tonight maybe we already have something on major schroeder in our files very well i will see you tomorrow a few blocks from the institute was a highrise building that rose from the heart of a quaint neighborhood it was an eyesore of modern architecture filled with subsidized apartments for lowincome families from the top two floors there was an unobstructed view into the walled yard behind the institute at that height and distance the garden was a small grassy speck amid the citys asphalt and stone in one apartment on the very top floor a remote recording device that used a laser to measure sound vibrations against glass had been installed its beam fired at the window in jacob and theodors office unknown to the two nazi hunters an enemy they thought vanquished sixty years before was recording every word they said munich germany the klinikum rechts der isar munichs largest hospital was also the citys chief trauma center no matter how often the roof was swept grit blew into an eyeclosing maelstrom whenever a rescue chopper landed on the designated helipad dr anika klein shielded her face from the blast as the white mbb helicopter swooped over the buildings edge and settled on its skids her cotton scrubs rippled in the wind flattening against her lean body as she fought her way toward the craft okay ak lets do it anika thought and ducked under the blur of blades two orderlies guiding an unwieldy gurney raced in her wake the helicopters side door crashed open and the lifeflight paramedic jumped out holding an iv bag over his head a thin coil of tubing trailing back to the patients arm he went asystolic about thirty seconds ago he shouted over the turbines din this is the second liter of ringers since the first ambulance reached the accident anika wasnt listening all she heard was that the patients heart had stopped right now everything else was details without waiting for the orderlies to transfer the stretcher to the gurney she hopped up and straddled the accident victim keeping her knees away from the blood saturating the sheets under his body pulling away the blankets she noted his skin across his torso was deeply bruised his ribs probably broken she began cpr anyway compressing his chest to keep his heart forcing blood through his body only when she had her rhythm did she once again pay attention to the paramedic he was unconscious even while they pulled him from the car blood pressures too low to measure his pulse has been thready since we took off what about his injuries she asked as the stretcher was maneuvered out of the choppers cargo area and onto the gurney both feet crushed multiple tibfib fractures in both legs right arm nearly severed right clavicle fractures lacerations to face legs and back pupils are nonreactive likely closed head injury was he wearing a seat belt no anika finally looked at the face of her patient he couldnt have been more than twenty years old asshole she knew the driver would be coming to the hospital too hed be wheeled straight to the morgue where his parents could claim him he had been the same age as the man whose life anika now held in her hands an hour ago theyd been playing formula one driver on the autobahn in a stolen porsche now both were dead though one had a slim chance of coming back astride her patient like a jockey anika rode the gurney toward the waiting elevator her upper body sawing with the beat of the cpr an orderly had a ventilation bag over the patients face and forced air into his lungs in time with her movements once the elevator doors closed she felt a sudden calm overcome her it was always like this for the first frantic moments she worked without thought her training guiding her hands and her body and now came the descent to the emergency room she had forty seconds before the door opened again and until that time there was nothing she could do except maintain the cprs steady cadence her mind was freed it was the gift that kept her sane amid the carnage of negligence stupidity and increasingly violence her eyes were on her hands but her consciousness was focused on nothing at all she was completely detached now actually as calm as though she were in a trance it was the same when she ran marathons the last quarter of the distance was not run with the body but with the mind she became aware that her heartbeat was synchronized with her cpr the doors opened and just as quickly the chaos returned the orderlies wheeled the gurney down a bright hallway toward an open trauma bay the lifeflight helicopter had radioed information about the car crash victim during their inbound journey so nurses and another doctor were waiting a portable defibrillator was standing by and a nurse was poised with jelly and the electrodes for the heart monitor voices crashed above the sounds of electronics amid the pandemonium anika continued massaging the patients chest until everyone was ready to take over she shifted her weight so the heart monitor could be attached to his bare torso its green line showing activity only when she compressed his body when she stopped hed flatline once again the gurney wheels were locked down and an orderly stood to help anika from the table but she vaulted off like a longtime horsewoman landing lightly on her rubbersoled shoes a nurse intubated him running a direct oxygen hose into his mouth to keep his lungs working the second doctor petr heimann had the defibs paddles positioned in an instant clear the young man convulsed as electricity jolted his body the heart monitor gave a matched spike but returned to a steady whine again anika called the defibrillator charged and heimann sent another blast through the dead man this time a slow beat followed the spike come on come on anika silently prayed as she looked at his ruined legs already thinking what would need to be done if they could get his heart beating normally his pants had been cut away at the accident site and even without x rays she knew hed lose both legs below the knees one leg was held on by only a few ribbons of flesh tourniquets around his lower thighs were keeping back the blood and turning his skin a deathly gray she imagined the gushes of blood that would pour from the ragged limbs when theyd release the thick rubber bands hes crashing again a nurse said anika didnt need to ask for epinephrine in a cardiac needle another nurse had it ready without being told the needle was long an instrument better suited for a nightmare than a hospital but anika slid it between his ribs without pause pressing it directly into the patients heart muscle once shed injected the drug she removed the needle shock him again for the third time heimann greased the paddles and applied them to the mans naked chest upping to joules at this stage the dangerously high current couldnt hurt him any longer clear he said with less anxiety they all knew the outcome of this battle the jolt of electricity arched the patients back as though he was a bow being drawn taut he fell back to the table and somehow miraculously his heart began beating with an anemic rhythm anika and petr began to work on the other injuries checking his eyes she discovered the pupils were pinpricks and did not respond to the penlight she flashed into them he was in a deep coma she ran her gloved hands through his hair and discovered a knot the size of an egg on the side of his skull closed head injury they needed a cat scan to determine the amount of brain damage judging by the other injuries she believed it was safe to assume his head had taken a brutal pounding anika crushed down her suspicions her job was to keep the patient alive long enough for the surgeons to take over once he left the er the future of the young joyrider was out of her hands tell radiology we need full trauma series x rays and a ct she told a nurse what do you think petr hell lose the legs even if he has enough mind left to control them the arm dr heimann glanced at the shattered limb hamburger the two doctors looked at each other both silently thinking that maybe they should have called the patient when they had the chance was the hippocratic oath meant to cover saving the life of a braindead triple amputee surgery is ready anytime we are a nurse announced okay thanks anika opened the tourniquets to allow blood to seep to the open wounds returning natural color to the skin before the flow turned into a torrent she retightened the bands the patients heart rate was steady but shallow and no matter how much saline they forced into him his pressure remained low he had internal injuries knowing the violence of the accident anika felt that some of his organs had likely detached and that was where the bleeding was a ruptured spleen was common with this type of crash she sounded his abdomen and found it tight with the stress of blood filling the cavities she was about to confer with heimann about a chest tube when the patient went into cardiac arrest for the third time no matter how heroic the efforts there was nothing they could do but watch him die after a further ten minutes of frantic work anika felt a touch on her shoulder petrs stern eyes said enough call him angered she looked at the wall clock stunned to see theyd been working for a half hour pm her shift had ended eighteen minutes ago anika stripped off her latex gloves and yanked the cloth cap from her head more than anything she wanted to wash the sweat from her spiky black hair but there would be police outside the er waiting to speak with her the patient had been a criminal after all as an emergency doctor she knew the importance of distancing herself from her patients yet losing even one pained her in a secret place she told no one about she had to force herself to push back those feelings until she gained the perspective of time anika washed her hands in the scrub sink outside the trauma bay and changed into fresh scrubs in the doctors lounge taking a moment to soothe her hair back against her head in the mirror her eyes were surprisingly clear considering what had just happened and that shed just finished a twelvehour saturdaynight shift heimann met her on her way out go start your vacation ill handle the police and the paperwork are you sure she was startled heimann wasnt known for his bedside manner toward patients or coworkers ja thank you petr i owe you one anika decided to go to her apartment for her shower rather than do it at the hospital she wanted to avoid dr seecht her boss at all costs she threw the laundry that had accumulated in her locker into a shoulder bag since her apartment was across the street from the huge medical center shed wear scrubs home her mind was on the lastminute details she needed to finish before leaving for her trip she had to get a key to her neighbor a surgical nurse here at the klinikum so she could water the plants she also needed to clean a weeks worth of leftovers out of her refrigerator then there was tomorrows trip to the town of ismaning for her grandfather and then on monday it was time to leave for greenland dr klein just the person i wanted to see dr heinz seecht had been waiting in ambush outside the womens changing room i was afraid you had already left damn anika had been avoiding seecht for weeks she knew what he wanted to talk to her about and she was hoping to delay it until after the greenland expedition if she could shed put off this conversation indefinitely seecht was about to box her into a decision she still wasnt ready to make i was just leaving my shifts been over for a while a moment ago she had been hyped up on adrenaline but now she felt nothing but exhaustion she crossed her arms over her small breasts yes i just spoke with petr you lost the patient it was said with condescension as if the kids death had been her fault her body stiffened we did everything we could im sure you did seecht said absently petrs a good doctor by force of will anika remained silent she and seecht had been at odds since she first came to the hospital he was nearly sixty and believed that only men made good doctors his was an extreme form of sexism that was pervasive in germany however now was not the time to lash out i wish to be blunt with you anika seecht said as though hed been any different with her in the past your performance is not up to the klinikums standards and hasnt been since you first arrived anika hadnt suspected hed take this tack and she was thrown off for a moment she quickly recovered rather than let him complete his thought she went on the attack it isnt my skills as a doctor that are substandard she stated every review places me near the top of all the trauma teams i have been honored by the medical boards and i have been singled out by the mayor when his daughter came in with a ruptured appendix i am more current on new techniques than anyone on your staff and i did a year of er work in los angeles before coming here i saw more trauma in a weekend there than doctors here see in a month so please tell me in what way am i not meeting your standards dr seecht she took a deep breath i dont question your surgical abilities youre goddamned right you wont anika wanted to shout a pair of technicians approached from down the hallway and seecht touched anika on the elbow to lead her away she resented the touch he wouldnt have done it to a male doctor he wouldnt even have done it to a male janitor he continued when they were alone again there is more to being on my staff than skills i demand dedication from my people and that is something you lack in your year and a half here you have taken leaves of absence totaling six months i encourage doctors to have interests outside their field but not when it interferes with their work your little adventures have become such an interference im afraid my little adventures anika snapped acidly have given me the research material for two published papers on the chemistry of stress seecht was not impressed you were not hired to be a research doctor and even if you were you didnt need to go on a fourweek climbing expedition to the himalayas to gather that information and you know it the papers you write are just your excuse your cover story he spoke as though on a telephone looking at a spot over her head so he didnt see the aggressive flare in her eyes it was at times like this she hated being just over five feet tall in a confrontation being short gave others a perceived advantage seecht needed only glance over her head and he completely isolated her from the conversation anika wanted to deny his accusation but she would never outright lie to seecht he was right writing papers was her way of legitimizing the fact that she wanted to go away to climb mountains or trek through jungles seecht finally looked her in the eye i wanted to catch you before you left for the arctic or wherever it is youre heading and let you know that you have a decision to make you will be gone for three weeks and when you get back you will find that my patience has run out there will be no more trips or expeditions or anything else you will work every shift i assign to you without complaint or you will find yourself without a job do i make myself clear she had long known that she had a decision to make one that would doubtlessly affect the rest of her life she didnt need this misogynist to point it out to her do you understand dr klein seecht repeated more forcefully i understand no matter how bitter the words she wouldnt turn away from him as she said it his voice softened you have the makings of a fine doctor like your father dont throw it away because you want to go play in the mountains it is time you grew up and faced the responsibilities of your profession to anyone overhearing the conversation it would have sounded as though seecht was being understanding in fact evoking her father was an attempt to cut her as deeply as possible anyone who knew her understood how much her memories of her father meant to her and how it was his footsteps as a doctor she now followed without another word seecht retreated down the hall leaving anika amid a storm of emotions being fired wasnt what bothered her with her credentials she could work anywhere in germany or the rest of the world for that matter it was the decision that upset her did she want to stay in medicine and honor her longdead father or would she leave to pursue her own interests with an angry shake anika cleared her head refusing to allow this to dampen her enthusiasm for the upcoming greenland expedition although three weeks at a remote arctic research station were far from the toughest challenge shed faced she felt the old stirrings of excitement already pushing aside seechts ultimatum something told her that the answer to her dilemma was waiting on the arctic wastes and she was eager to see what it would be new york city having traveled to some of the worst hellholes on earth philip mercer still had difficulty recalling a smell worse than a new york garbage truck in the summer it was a rank odor that hit like a nuclear blast the lumbering vehicles were making their pickups as he walked along amsterdam avenue a steady stream of wet offal drizzling from their gaping tailgates on one level the scientist in him was morbidly curious to know exactly what had been discarded that could be so putrid but his interest wasnt nearly strong enough to overcome the stench had he known the gauntlet hed have to walk he would have had the airport taxi drop him at his destination rather than embarking on this random stroll from midtown mercer abandoned amsterdam crossed columbus and began walking northward along the much better smelling central park west the morning sun beat against the sidewalks and he shed his suit jacket tucking it into the crook of his elbow doormen in uniforms paid him little heed as he passed their buildings monoliths of granite and limestone containing some of the most expensive apartments in the world brass handrails and awning supports gleamed like gold between th street and st stood the massive american museum of natural history his favorite spot in the city if he had time later he would come back to see the new rose center for earth and space he paused as he always did to study the statue of theodore roosevelt at the museums central park west entrance flanking the statue were two walls chiseled with oneword descriptions of arguably americas most dynamic president making comparisons between tr and himself was humbling statesman for a year mercer had had a pair of diplomatic plates for his jaguar as a gift from the united arab emirates but that didnt count author mercers doctoral thesis from penn state on mining and quarrying techniques had been used as a textbook for a short while soldier not with any army but mercer had seen more combat than even old tr governor ah no president not on a milliondollar bet explorer mercer was on his way to a meeting at the surveyors society an exploration club of which even roosevelt hadnt been a member for the rest he didnt come close but then again who could along st street were more art deco apartment buildings fifteen stories tall solid and opulent a professional dog walker hurried by with a brace of stately afghan hounds in a wellpampered pack a block to the west the neighborhood changed to nineteenthcentury brownstones with facades much more ornate than the town house mercer lived in just outside of washington dc he found the one he wanted the surveyors society standard of a compass face overlaid with a theodolite and a sextant had been carved into the wall next to the door the threestory town house was built of reddish stone with fluted railings flanking the wide steps leading to the front door from the street he couldnt see inside but he felt a prick of excitement as he checked his watch a mere invitation for lunch at the exclusive club was something to brag about and here mercer was being made a formal proposal to join to his dismay mercer saw that he was half an hour early for his meeting with charles bryce an old friend who had put mercers name up for consideration unconsciously hed pushed his pace to get here just as he turned to go the wooden door swung open and an elderly steward in a black suit called to him dr mercer yes thats right im afraid im a bit early i was just going to wait at the coffee shop down the street that wont be necessary sir mr bryce expected that you would arrive before your appointed time and he asked me to keep a lookout for you the servant opened the door wider wont you please come inside mercer slipped on his jacket and mounted the stairs thank you passing the steward mercer stepped from the early twentyfirst century to the late nineteenth he had never seen so much woodwork in one place the walls of the foyer were paneled mahogany the stairs to the second level were of oak age darkened to a smokey black the parquet floors showed only around the perimeter of a stunning oriental rug so tightly knotted that it shimmered adorning the walls were hunting trophies antelope heads a pair of boar tusks that looked like they came off a small elephant and a rhinoceros that appeared as if it had just smashed its way through the paneling judging by the sizes he was sure all would be listed in the rholands guide there were also dozens of old framed photographs of various expeditions carried out under the societys banner mercer also recognized a couple of paintings by joy adamson the celebrated author of born free the furniture in the reception area just off the lobby was all heavy leather covered and well worn on the floor under one window was a misshapen lump of iron about the size of a steamer trunk that could only be a meteorite it sat next to a goldleafed wooden mummy case leaning into one corner the steward cleared his throat delicately and mercer saw that he was waiting with an arabesque silver plate in his hand realizing his gaffe mercer pulled a business card from his breast pocket and placed it on the plate the servant returned the tarnished antique to a small entry table next to a golden figurine of the hindu god shiva mr bryce will be right down wont you please be seated mercer chose instead to wander around the room in glassfronted display cases were exquisite collections of cultural and natural artifacts one contained scrimshaw carved on whales teeth another held ivory japanese netsuke figurines above a shelf of delicate butterflies lay cleaved geodes their interior crystals shimmering in rainbow hues the display tags next to them listed where each artifact had been collected by whom and when without doubt this was the finest private collection hed ever seen and this was only the first room rumors surrounding the surveyors society claimed that they maintained a special vault in a downtown bank containing items so precious and some too controversial that they would never be put on display he was studying a flawless yellow diamond still in its kimberlite matrix stone when the floor creaked behind him a gift to the society from barney barnarto charles bryce said entering the reception room it was his half of the new rush claims that cecil rhodes needed to cement his monopoly on the diamond trade one that exists to this day as the debeers company look at you mercer full head of hair no gray i can see and in the same shape as when we first met bryce was shorter than mercer by several inches with a comfortable paunch pressing against his clothes his brown hair had retreated up his forehead and looked like it wasnt going to stop until only a fringe remained his once strong jaw was starting to show a little fleshiness underneath he wore tortoiseshell glasses that were too small for his face and made his dark eyes appear narrower then they were a banker by profession bryce wore a discreetly striped blue suit with a white shirt and club tie great to see you charlie mercer said shaking hands for a ninetofiver you dont look too bad thats the problem bryce said with a chuckle somewhere along the line nine to five turned into twentyfourseven i cant complain another ten years ill have a massive heart attack and leave susan with a couple million dollars mercer laughed always the optimist how is susan good thanks for asking with the kids at prep school shes had a lot of time to raise money for the citys animal shelters whats the count these days we now have three dogs and six cats and every month she brings home a couple more for foster care i feel like noah bryce said as they began climbing the stairs congratulations by the way i read the time magazine article about you finding that diamond mine in eritrea i cant tell you how glad i was when you called back this has all been rather short notice and i didnt know if you were even in the country ive been back from africa for a while mercer explained after taking some time off to recover from that one i had a contract to teach mine rescue in western pennsylvania thats where i was when i got your message who answered your home phone he sounds like a real character thats harry white hes a cantankerous old bastard who watches my place when im away he tends to move in and make himself right at home mercer didnt need to add how much harry meant to him the affection was in his voice he and i have been friends since i moved to arlington he just turned eighty and while he smokes and drinks like tomorrows doomsday hell probably outlive us all on the second floor mercer glimpsed a large dining room with eight tables set for lunch there was a fireplace at the far end of the room faced by an arc of overstuffed chairs a couple of old men sat there either dozing or reading the paper bryce continued down a narrow hallway adorned with an assortment of weapons big holland and holland nitro express rifles swords from medieval europe and asia spears from africa and the south sea islands and blowguns from south america and australia they came to a closed office door that belonged to an assistant administrative director here we go bryce said the office was small crammed with books and yet more artifacts the single window behind the desk overlooked an airshaft between the club and the neighboring brownstone mercer noted the window was wired for a security system and hed already spotted five roving cameras i thought we would chat in private first bryce said though im not too sure of the protocol you are the first invitee the societys had since the titanic was discovered bryce took one of the seats in front of the desk and invited mercer to sit in the other from a pile of papers on the tooled desktop charles grabbed an issue of the societys quarterly magazine surveyor this comes out next week thought you might want one early called one of the finest magazines in the world surveyor had won every award it could its photographers were all the tops in their profession and most of the articles were written by authors and journalists whod at least been nominated for a pulitzer its readership wasnt as large as the betterknown national geographic but its followers were more fiercely devoted to collecting each one since the society predated geographic by fifteen years some of the early editions went for tens of thousands of dollars at auction i dont know much about publishing but i cant imagine you make any money with this mercer said holding up the twohundredpage glossy magazine oh god we lose thousands on each issue i suspect subscription and circulation barely cover the printing costs but the moneys not important i should explain a little about how the society works there are three types of people who belong real explorers like yourself who are invited to join those of us who wish we were real explorers which is my category im afraid and those who are rich enough to pay others to explore for them they pick up the tab for the expeditions we sponsor and the publishing of our magazine and video documentaries did you notice the gentleman in the dining room wearing the tan suit mercer nodded his name is jon herriman back in the early s he invented some little gadget that goes into automobiles something about pollution control that device was only recently replaced with something newer and better he earned royalties for every car sold in this country until about five years ago charles noted mercers awed expression hes only one of eight billionaires on our board thats why i say money isnt important a few years ago one member paid five million dollars to the russian government so he could use their submersible mir to visit his old ship the uss yorktown which was sunk during the battle of midway the surveyors society is a labor of love to most of us of course we have paid staff to maintain our collections produce the magazine and all that but the actual members are here because we have an interest in exploration and have the money or influence to buy our way in no offense charlie but i didnt think you fit into the billionaire category bryce laughed too true actually susans grandfather spent his familys fortune tramping around south america looking for the el dorado treasure before world war two he didnt find anything of course but his work garnered him an invitation to join he brought me on board mostly because id begged him for years and also because of my banking connections he leaned back in his chair ive recommended you because you actually are an explorer something the club is sorely lacking i want you to understand what this means to me i know the caliber of people whove been members and i never thought i would be considered but im not an explorer im a mining engineer youre being modest mercer that mine you discovered in eritrea would be reason enough to bring you in but your reputation has more than qualified you i read in the time profile on you that accompanied the story that the value of the minerals youve found since you became a prospectorforhire is around four billion dollars and your fees total three percent of that number consulting geologist please mercer laughed secretly he admitted charlies description better defined what he did and both figures were grossly inflated no matter your work has helped our understanding of the planet and our ability to use its resources more than any geologist since alfred wegener first proposed the continental drift theory does all this flattery mean i dont have to pony up membership dues afraid not however your dues entitle you to a room here at the club five nights a year use of our dining room for private functions and of course a seat for our weekly lunches provided you tell the staff a week before you come our new chef was stolen from the hotel georges v in paris and makes the best chateaubriand you will ever taste i think though just being a member is what most interests you mercer didnt respond he didnt need to the golden age of exploration and discovery was long gone it was part of a bygone era much like the society itself and yet to be invited to join to be a part of the organization that had helped open up so many frontiers was an honor that mercer couldnt refuse his education and work entitled him to a string of initials after his name if he so chose but the prestigious mss member surveyors society was a title hed coveted since first reading their magazine as a boy much to his irritation a great deal of his work now took place in front of a computer rather than in the field the invitation was a way for him to reconnect with the pioneers of his profession he broke himself from his silent musings theres that and i want to find out if some of the rumors are true about parts of your collection ah the rumors speculation about the societys secrets had run rampant for generations because of its private status and the powerful people whod always run it many believed it had become a repository for a great many unsettling discoveries some said they had a portion of amelia earharts lockheed electra and others believed the great mogul throne from india was here hed heard of a group who believed the societys vault contained definitive proof of precolumbian exploration by phoenician explorers and another who said they owned a portion of the true cross the internet had served to accelerate the pace of conjecture a year ago a group on the net learned that a farm in roswell new mexico near where a ufo had supposedly crashed in the s had been owned by a member of the surveyors society the inference that the society possessed hidden evidence of alien contact came immediately afterward and the furor had yet to die down even i dont know half of it bryce admitted our tenperson executive council are the only people who know whats in the secret part of our vault there was a knock at the door and the elderly steward entered holding a tray with two glasses on it it is noon gentlemen lunch will be in thirty minutes in the dining room may i offer you a cocktail bryce turned to mercer its still gimlets isnt it good memory mercer accepted the vodka and sweetened lime juice concoction from the butler hed recently switched to gray goose a french vodka and noted this drink was made with his old standard absolut bryce took a tumbler of iced macallan scotch i seem to recall a night a few years back where you and i went through quite a few of these in very short order the only thing i remember from then is the weeklong hangover afterward the airconditioning kicked in mercer could feel cool air blowing from the brass grill recessed into the wall behind his back it was as though the chill had changed the mood of the meeting bryce went silent for a moment his eyes focusing on a middle distance only he could see he almost appeared upset by something they had said or something he was about to say mercer braced himself our review committee bryce opened has already approved you for membership that was taken care of a couple of weeks ago as i understand it this usually takes upward of a year however you are a special case whys that well people who are invited to join by virtue of their earlier exploits must participate in a societysponsored expedition before they can become members its an old bylaw of the club about three months ago we were approached by the danish government to see if we were interested in joining an expedition being planned by a german nonprofit group called georesearch whats this have to do with denmark the expedition is going to greenland which is still a danish protectorate i dont know if youre aware that denmark has recently gotten very selective about who receives permits for scientific research on the greenland ice sheet during a japanese expedition last year a mishap killed eight people and left eleven thousand gallons of spilled fuel on the ice the bodies were recovered but no steps were taken to clean up the diesel just a month later four american mountain climbers died in a plane crash a searchandrescue helicopter looking for the wreck also crashed killing three more since then the danes are demanding better oversight of what takes place on greenland theyve closed several foreignrun meteorological stations they feel are unsafe and limited climbing parties to just a small region in the south well away from the higher mountains as a way to discourage treks theyve even started rattling their sabers about closing thule air force base add to this the fact that germany and denmark are at odds over oilexploration rights in the north sea and it was surprising that georesearch didnt have their permits rescinded altogether their expedition is planned to gather global warming data and has been in the works for a year where does the surveyors society fit in mercer asked hed been to greenlands tiny neighbor iceland once before but had never visited earths secondlargest island he felt his interest rising back in the s there was an american base on greenlands eastern coast called camp decade it had to do with project iceworm something about determining if permanent towns could be sustained under the ice sheet one of our board members was assigned to camp decade when it closed in late and he wants a team sent there to see what the place looks like today bob bishops his name and hes unable to make the trip himself hes been bound to a wheelchair for the past two years what hes sponsoring is a small team to reopen the facility and videotape the interior check what kind of damage has been done to it that sort of thing im not saying im not interested but this bishop is willing to pay for an entire expedition just for a tape of the base are you serious moneys meaningless to most members i told you about the yorktown expedition this ones a bargain by comparison i read about a group who recovered a p lightning from southern greenland that had crashed during world war two mercer said they found the plane in near perfect condition but it was a couple of miles from where it crashed and buried under two hundred and fifty feet of ice camp decade might be in good shape but it could be almost as deep youd think but its not dont ask me to explain the phenomena im no glaciologist but the camp was anchored to a subice mountain of rock that cuts the natural flow of greenlands glaciers splitting the ice around it like an island in a stream the base is actually only about thirty feet under the surface new snow that falls on it gets carried away by the moving ice but the base has stayed in just about the same place im familiar with the search for the lost squadron that you mentioned it was actually a whole flight of planes that went down six ps and two bs that hit a blizzard and were forced to land there is a hell of a lot more snowfall where those planes went down than where our teams heading so the catch to joining the society is to lead your expedition well bryce drew out the word we already have someone to lead it bob bishops son martin charles waited for a reaction but mercer remained impassive this doesnt mean to say you cant handle it i know you can even though the danish government has pushed up our schedule this has been in the works for a year and bob is footing the bill thats why i said earlier that your application was rushed through the committee we dont have any other trips planned until next year if you want to wait until then i certainly understand what would my job be thats the other reason youd be perfect for the trip we can put you right on top of camp decade but youll need to pinpoint the main entrance before starting your tunnel down to it you have experience with portable subsurface radar sets as well as ice tunneling what are you planning on using to open the base thermal chemicals that melt ice and snow you are familiar with the technique we call them hotrocks i cant remember the exact chemical makeup but yeah ive worked with them before theyre tricky as hell to use and produce a godawful stench but they can melt about a foot an hour depending on the diameter of the hole problem is you need powerful pumps for the water runoff or the chemicals become too diluted to melt the snow apart from you and marty there will be two others ones an old friend of martys an army colonel with some arctic experience and the others a guy i recommended hell be responsible for the pumps and generators there was no doubt in mercers mind that he would go charles could have offered him the latrine diggers job and he would have done it still he was curious how this would work thats an awfully small team to unbury an entire town camp decade is actually a large hshaped building everythings connected all you need to do is dig your way to the main entrance and you should gain access to the whole facility four guys alone on the ice ive done a lot of stupid things in my life but this sounds like an invitation to a suicide party youre forgetting how we got invited to go in the first place the danes want teams working in the same area rather than spread across the ice georesearch is the umbrella organization for the entire trip we are joining up with them plus another group doing some sort of meteorological work everyone in one location which reduces the chance of accidents i get it now were piggybacking onto their expedition how many people in total about forty i think since georesearch is bringing a full support staff for their scientists well pay them for your room board and any additional labor you need the germans are furious about the arrangement by the way because our expedition is site specific the danes told them they had to work near camp decade to accommodate us it shouldnt really matter to them in terms of global warming research one patch of greenland is pretty much like all the others but they wanted to work about a hundred miles north of our destination and the other team you mentioned they couldnt care less just as long as they get their work done charles knocked back the last of his drink and set the waterford tumbler on the desk we pulled a few strings to get the danes to force georesearch to agree to our location mercer cocked an eyebrow inviting an explanation one of the societys armchair explorers like myself happens to be the us ambassador to denmark some members buy their way in with money and others with position bryce then added with a smile because of his geology background herbert hoover belonged to the surveyors society long before he went into politics you can imagine the bloody murder we got away with when he became president for the club prohibition ended at his inauguration not when roosevelt repealed it in not that we took much notice anyway mercer smiled with bryce any lingering problems with georesearch there shouldnt be any difficulties by the time you arrive georesearch has had a couple of months to calm down about the change even if there are problems our part of the expedition shouldnt last for more than a couple of weeks after you leave the japanese who were kicked out last year are going to replace you what do you know about georesearch ive had a runin with an environmental group before that id just as soon forget theyre not tree huggers if thats what youre afraid of georesearch is dedicated to hard science not flavorofthemonth crusades theyve been around for about six years contracting their ship and services to various governments and universities charles looked at mercer levelly do you have any other questions you havent said even if you want to go fighting to keep the grin off his face mercer set his empty glass next to bryces his murky gray eyes were bright the only question i have is when do i leave congratulations and welcome to the surveyors society charles pumped mercers hand vigorously i knew youd do it in fact weve already submitted your name to georesearch and your participation was posted on our web page a few weeks ago am i that easy you have a choice as to when you leave you can join georesearchs ship njoerd in reykjavik in three days and sail with her to ammassalik greenland where shell be offloaded for the trek to the camp or you can leave about a week later when the base camp has been established when is the rest of our team leaving mercer noted he was already using the possessive in reference to the expedition he was truly excited about this it was a tremendous opportunity on so many levels the geologist in him wanted to explore one of the largest ice sheets on the planet and the romantic in him loved the idea of joining the society theyre opting for the sea voyage ill bring my shuffleboard stick because he worked on a contractual basis mercer could easily shift his schedule to accommodate the trip it was nearing four in the afternoon by the time mercer left the societys headquarters lunch had ranked as one of the finest meals hed ever eaten and the company around the table had been fantastic theyd dined with the billionaire herriman and several others who regaled mercer with slightly embellished stories about expeditions theyd financed or been part of with a threeday window before the flight to reykjavik mercer decided to spend the night in the city and visit the natural history museum the following day mercer explained his plans to charles and ten minutes later dobson the steward whod met mercer at the door had arranged for a town car to take him to the carsyle where a room was waiting dobson had also booked him on the following evenings shuttle to washington charles bryce waved to mercer from the stoop and went back inside in the borrowed office of the assistant administrative director he threw himself behind the desk and reached for the phone he had the number memorized paul its charlie bryce he said after getting past a legion of secretaries how did it go asked the cultured voice from the other end of the line mercers on board charles said with a trace of bitterness hell meet the ship in iceland and sail with them to greenland good job i told you recruiting him wouldnt be difficult i dont like this mercer should know what hes getting into charles you dont even know what dr mercer is getting into you know what i mean bryce snapped i dont have a lot of friends and i hate using the few i have without at least warning them first this operation is compartmentalized on a needtoknow basis and at this point mercer has no need besides hes just a backup chances are he wont even know whats happening in greenland hell enjoy his stay there open that base for bishop and thatll be the end of it what happens if something does go wrong you might know the public side of mercer charles but there are things he hasnt told you like how he took time off during his doctoral studies to help the defense department by going into iraq with a commando team prior to the gulf war to see if saddam hussein had been mining uranium ore or how he had a hand in averting the terrorist attack against the alaska pipeline last year if for some reason something happens that puts our mission in jeopardy philip mercer is more than capable of looking after himself and our interests at the same time i didnt know about that other stuff and it sounds impressive bryce persisted but he doesnt know the full story hes going in blind if the time comes he will be informed but that is my decision to make your part in this is over the line clicked dead im sorry mercer bryce whispered to the empty office i wish i hadnt gotten you involved the vatican rome italy it seemed to outsiders that the white smoke signifying the election of the first pope of the new millennium was barely out of the chimney of the apostolic palace when leo xiv the rd man to take the seat of st peter began changing the holy see those who worked within the vatican knew this wasnt exactly true but it was close enough and many were stunned by what the former cardinal giuseppi salvi was planning to do salvi had been was seen as a temporary compromise between factions within the curia politicking during the electoral conclave had been rampant and the election dragged on for ballot after ballot with no end in sight after five days it became apparent that neither of the two principal contenders would ever receive the twothirds needed so each side began to play a waiting game hoping that the final ballot on the twelfth day when a simple majority would take the election would see their man victorious the reasons for this loggerhead were varied but the church was at a crossroads changes in the world had to be addressed issues that the curia had put off for decades could no longer be ignored and a leader for the twentyfirst century was needed some cardinals felt it was time for catholicism and the papacy to modernize while others believed a more conservative and in some instances reactionary hand was needed on the eighth day several of the more diplomatic cardinals realized that the bitterness infecting the conclave would likely spill over and infect the new popes reign the church must show a united front they felt a compromise was needed a third candidate was put forth a man who could act as a temporary solution while the church decided its future cardinal salvi was seventyfour years old and in poor heath his reign as pope they knew would be a short one giving each side time to further debate points of doctrine a week after giuseppi salvi became leo xiv he was in the hospital and the cardinals feared their solution had been too temporary much like the first john paul whod been pope for just over a month in however tests confirmed that his ill health was not a grave concern instead doctors found he suffered from gastric reflux a condition hed never discussed surgery for his malformed stomach valve was performed and within a few weeks he had made a nearmiraculous recovery it was at this point that leo xiv began to change the church reshaping it into his vision of what it should be with a vigor that stunned the hardliners whod elected him he appointed his closest friend the liberal cardinal peretti to the secretariat of state the vaticans number two position leo had always been considered a moderate but this crucial appointment loudly stated that the status quo was about to end he made it clear that the topic closest to him and thus all of the church was raising religious tolerance around the world and stamping out fanaticism rather than issue papal decrees on the subject he decided to go directly to the bishops who oversaw the dioceses he called for a special synod of bishops and such was the importance he placed on this meeting he made peretti its president in another unusual step leo xiv invited other religious leaders to attend though they would have no voting rights he wanted them all to understand the vaticans position on the subject of tolerance eastern orthodox patriarchs and bishops were common at synods but leo also wanted jewish leaders from israel and the united states prominent buddhist monks including the dalai lama influential mullahs and imams from both the sunni and shiite branches of islam shinto priests from japan the archbishop of canterbury who headed the anglican church and hundreds of others gathering this great body fell on cardinal peretti and the sheer logistics were staggering an ordinary synod took a year to organize and the pope had given him only six months not only to bring together one hundred and seventy bishops from the catholic church but all the others as well dominic peretti was a native roman sixtyfive years old and something of a curia outsider because of his modernist views on artificial birth control like leo he believed that some form of population control was going to be crucial for the sustainability of civilization as pope leo couldnt openly declare such a belief but by giving peretti power within the vatican his intentions were clear the synod on tolerance was a planned first step to bring the church closer to other religions so that at some point this other topic may be discussed the vatican was a twothousandyearold institution that moved at the ponderous pace of the worlds largest bureaucracy incremental change was the only way to get the church to reform and even the synod was seen as a radical departure peretti was sitting at his desk on the second floor of the apostolic palace when a priest knocked at his door forgive me cardinal peretti his holiness has finished with his lunch and will see you now grazie peretti removed his reading glasses and slipped on his allpurpose pair hed tried bifocals but they gave him a pounding headache he stood and stretched at six foot five inches he was the tallest person in the vatican excluding a few of the corpo di vigilanza the holy sees police force and a couple of the ornamental swiss guards as a boy hed been something of a basketball star and on rare occasions he would still shoot a few baskets with some of the vaticans lay workers his face was remarkably unlined except for a deep crease on each side of his large hooked nose behind his steelrimmed glasses his eyes were dark and possessed captivating intelligence he grabbed up two bundles of papers and left his spacious office although the palace was a place of opulence and quiet dignity peretti moved through it with a looselimbed gait that was only now beginning to slow he climbed the marble steps to the papal apartments and found the pontiff in the gilded library with him already was bishop albani relator for the synod on tolerance he would act as a facilitator for the discussions and make sure that a consensus was reached at the events close you look tired the pope greeted his secretary of state i am peretti agreed and took a chair across the desk from leo this has been a trial another week and well convene the synod dominic the pontiff said with genuine sympathy our relator here will take over and you can get some sleep while ive limited the time allowed for opening remarks to quicken the pace youll have a few quiet days before anything of significance takes place before albani could mutter a protest that the opening discussions would be important leo xiv raised his hand the sunlight streaming through the windows glinting off his fishermans ring one of the many symbols of his office im joking of course weve given ourselves only two weeks for the synod half the normal time and not a moment will be wasted have there been any lastminute delays hundreds peretti sighed but im dealing with them if i may speak frankly many of the other religious leaders are acting like prima donnas on opening night some want more time to address the bishops others want better control over their meals still others resent the cabin assignments for men and women who dedicate themselves to the spiritual salvation of others they seem inordinately preoccupied with their own corporeal needs there are many dietary and cultural customs we must be sensitive to the pope reminded those i can understand however my office has been deluged with other requests why an american minister needs to bring his wife with him ill never know but he telephones me every day repeating his displeasure that she wont be allowed to join him i finally relented and told him she could come who is it tommy joe farquar hes a former car salesman turned evangelist with a substantial television ministry how america puts up with some of those charlatans ill never understand albani said how about the ship because of the international scope of the synod on tolerance the pope had wanted it in rome as was tradition however several of the key invitees refused to come to vatican city jerusalem would have been his second choice but that turned out to be even more contentious than rome it was perettis suggestion to avoid the question of territory altogether rather than deal with political squabbling he recommended that the synod be held at sea on a cruise ship large enough to accommodate the two thousand people attending the vessel they had leased the sea empress was one of the newest cruise liners in the world having so many important people on one ship had created other sets of problems not the least of which was security the swiss guards were responsible for checking every member of the ships crew and the attendees they would work with the individual security specialists from dozens of countries getting the group safely on board was the biggest single concern once the ship was in international waters she was well beyond the reach of all but the most sophisticated terrorists still the pope procured the services of the italian navy to provide an escort for the modern ocean liner a destroyer that would follow behind the sea empress on her voyage the ship is ready with one week to go before we depart the crew has been sequestered aboard her no one not already checked by interpol and the swiss guards is allowed anywhere near her shes provisioned then asked albani with everything from champagne to dog food for the bombsniffing dogs that sail with us dominic youve done a remarkable job this meeting is as much a testament to your organizational skills as to the need for world understanding peretti demurred i will gladly fade into the background if we can get just one person to stop killing in the name of religion we will my friend the pope said with unwavering faith how about the items we are returning to the other faiths are they at the ship yet everything has been put aboard the sea empress already the response weve gotten has been tremendous i might add i thought it would john pauls mea culpa in march of was a first step the church should have made such a formal apology to the world decades ago some of the atrocities carried out under our banner were unspeakable the inquisition crusades pogroms and our failure to counter fascism are just the most notable saying we are sorry was not enough i thought it necessary to give back something tangible and what better than the thousands of religious texts and artifacts belonging to other faiths that the vatican has accumulated over the centuries these items should have been returned long ago has there been a final count of items we are returning albani asked peretti i need to know for my speech to the assembly cardinal peretti rifled through one of the batches of papers hed brought to the meeting seven thousand eight hundred books mostly jewish texts and torahs that we hid during the war islamic writings that were captured during the crusades and eastern orthodox material that weve held on to since the council of chalcedon in thats it the popes eyes widened at such a low figure you gave us only six months to prepare it was fact not complaint there are two million books in the vatican library as well as manuscripts this doesnt include the seventyfive kilometers of documents in the archives weve only begun to comb through to find material that belongs to others im sorry leo smiled forgive me what else is being given back to the proper owners five hundred icons that belong to the eastern orthodox church they will decide what particular group gets what there are also forty statues about two hundred paintings and a great many religious pieces such as candlesticks menorahs ornamental crosses and reliquaries in all weve shipped eleven containers to the docks in belgium ive already drawn up a manifest of what goes to whom and weve kept some of the more symbolic pieces separate so you can give them out directly and you say that the worlds interest in this step is high despite the best efforts of our press office many journalists are focusing on the restoration more than the synod which by the way we cant seem to dissuade them from calling the universal convocation it is our synod but it is also a universal gathering the pope countered i actually prefer the title theyve bestowed on the gathering a synod smacks of secrecy what we want is an openness that has never been seen before this meeting is not about religion it is about people and how to get them to improve relations with each other albani who would be leading the synod picked up the thread modernism is dividing the world into fanatics or secularists evangelism has become such a bitter battle that many religious leaders have lost sight of why we spread our various beliefs souls have become a commodity no different from oil futures or stock shares suddenly the pope laughed aloud and it took him a moment to recover im sorry albani in my head i heard a radio announcer quoting religions like a stock ticker he deepened his voice in todays trading catholicism is up two points judaism up a quarter and buddhism down an eighth he laughed again before the reality of his joke hit him he became subdued once more we have to put an end to this way of thinking i hate to think what will happen if we dont politics and race breed fanaticism on their own the world does not need its religious leaders adding fuel to such an incendiary mixture munich germany anika klein spent her morning packing for her trip she was leaving tomorrow monday to spend a few days in iceland before the rest of the team assembled for the ship to greenland her domestic chores took her longer than expected but still she went for a run after lunch and returned to her apartment an hour and a half later after a long shower she spent thirty grudging minutes in front of the mirror attending to beauty details shed put off for too long her eyebrows were particularly bothersome since they hadnt been tweezed in three months the ritual left her eyes swimming in tears she purposely kept her glossy black hair trimmed almost like a mans with short bangs and just a little length at her neck a dollop of gel and a quick slash with a brush was all it took to tame it her face was angular with large almondshaped eyes high cheekbones and a sharp chin her mouth was wide luxurious except on dates shed learned to not wear lipstick because of the distraction her pout caused her ears were tiny with a total of nine rings five in one and four in the other anika was thirtysix years old but had the style of someone half that age and she could get away with it studying her reflection closely she decided she could maintain the ruse for a few more years because shed rarely allowed herself to tan her skin which would eventually give her away had yet to show lines she gave her reflection a smile it was only then that her face lost the intensity she showed to the outside world her smile made anika look like a teenager her exhusband had often compared her beauty to audrey hepburns shed done little to dissuade him of that opinion normally she wore all black in a pseudogothic look that hadnt yet gone out of fashion in europe for today she was meeting someone for her grandfather so she threw on a bright but modest skirt a creamy silk blouse and flats she was comfortable enough with her height to wear heels only when necessary in the kitchen on her way out of her apartment she grabbed a liter bottle of water from the fridge and a container of oily kalamata olives she had chewing gum in her car for her breath later her purse was a small leather backpack anika tossed the water inside fished the keys to her battered volkswagen golf from the bottom and popped a handful of the rich olives into her mouth her car was in the garage under her building it started after a mere five attempts the town of ismaning was only about a half hour from her apartment which worked well for her grandfather had this otto schroeder hed asked her to speak with lived any farther from munich she would have postponed the interview until after her trip to greenland opa jacob had insisted that she visit him before heading north but he treated everything about his work as a matter of urgency anika did what she could to help he knew she would never take up the crusade but by assisting him when she could anika hoped that opa knew she wouldnt forget either hed often said that people arent truly dead until they are forgotten hed told her that the first time when her own father opa jacobs soninlaw died from a heart attack as long as she remembered her father he was alive that was why jacob worked so hard as long as he remembered the six million were still alive and if anika could carry even a part of the memory then the victims would not fade for another generation the traffic was heavier than she expected shed forgotten that road repairs were under way even on the weekend the volkswagens air conditioner had not worked since shed bought it thirdhand and heavy blasts of hot air percolated from the asphalt anika felt constricted the seat belt like a band of iron across her chest the back of her blouse was sticky she tried to take a deep breath and managed to inhale a dose of diesel exhaust from the truck idling next to her the frustration pricking her skin was only partially due to the delay shed hoped the distraction of driving would banish thoughts of work but the constant starts and stops served as a reminder was her career going to go forward or end the choice was hers she dug out her water bottle and took a gulp forcing herself to calm down rather than deal with the decision she fumbled through her bag for the directions to otto schroeders farmhouse that opa jacob had dictated a few days ago from vienna she knew from the research shed done for him in the past not to be surprised how he had tracked the former military officer jacob eisenstadt could find anyone it seemed once he put his mind to it on the sheet of paper with the directions was a list of questions jacob wanted answered anika had read through the list once after writing them down and found herself more intrigued with this interview than the previous ones shed done it appeared that schroeder might know the whereabouts of a huge shipment of gold spirited out of russia in according to jacob this wasnt one of the fabled lost shipments that had never been recovered until very recently neither he nor theodor weitzman had even known of its existence they were convinced that they were on the trail of something completely new anika doubted that anything would come of her interview opa had learned that schroeder had been a career soldier from before hitler came to power he hadnt been part of the nazi elite in fact he hadnt even been a member of the party it wasnt very likely that he would be privy to secrets of stashed gold or anything else for that matter she had said this to opa jacob and he had reminded her that even if otto schroeder was simply another link in the chain it put them one link closer to their goal his absolute dedication and unshakable faith was something anika knew she could learn from she was sorely lacking in both in the center of ismaning stood a tall stone tower a medieval leftover whose original purpose was lost to time she turned right and very quickly the urban congestion vanished it was as if shed traveled a hundred kilometers from the city plowed fields and dense forests flanked the narrow road with farmhouses nestled at the end of long crushed stone driveways she felt herself relaxing anika loved the country the clean air the open vistas and especially the lack of people she checked her directions again she had to stay on this road for eight kilometers and then veer to the left for another three there she would find otto schroeders house according to her grandfathers report schroeder owned the land but no longer worked it that was leased to local farmers while he stayed on in the isolated house living out the last of his years the sun dipped below the layer of smog covering munich and the reddened light made the fields of wheat look like sheets of dancing flame anika found her turn and popped a stick of gum in her mouth to mask the taste of the olives shed been munching the road this far from ismaning was little used and there was even grass growing across stretches of it she noted a single set of tire tracks had cut grooves through the patches of green she feared it meant that otto schroeder had just recently left his house possibly for a sundaynight beer in town doubtful he was near ninety years old she was just going to dig into her bag for her cell phone to call schroeders number when from around a copse of huge oaks she saw the house a black mercedes sedan was parked in the drive next to an ancient opel the house itself was unremarkable one story and built of dressed and mortared stone it looked in poor repair several of the porch roofs support columns had settled into the ground giving the facade a wavy look it was the incongruous presence of the mercedes that gave her pause of course they were common all over germany but out here on the very night she was to interview an obscure exsoldier who might know something about missing gold anika was suddenly very alert she eased her volkswagen to a halt well short of the house she slung her bag onto her back and in one arching bound was across the narrow irrigation ditch fronting schroeders property the air was still the wind that had moved through the fields earlier was gone and the night insects had yet to come out she could hear the mercedess engine pinging in the silence as it cooled she thought about the car it was possible that it belonged to a welloff child out to visit his father yet would a child let an elderly parent live in such isolation something wasnt right here but she couldnt place what she kept to the lengthening shadows as she approached the house she reached the front door without spotting or hearing anything out of the ordinary she chuckled silently her feeling of vague anxiety faded so much for her sixth sense it might work while climbing a sheer mountain face but it was worthless on the ground she was about to knock when an agonized scream pierced the night a high keen that rippled up her spine like static it came from the back of the house not from within as much as her training urged her to rush to its source she held her ground it wasnt a question of if she would back away rather she had to determine the best way to proceed stepping off the porch she peered around the corner of the house a stone wall extended beyond the back of the building as part of an enclosed backyard she heard a sharp moan and knew the cry had come from there the wall was four feet tall capped with flat blocks of slate guessing there would be a gate at the back she moved along the fence keeping low her acute sense of balance more than made up for the poor traction of her shoes on the loamy soil halfway down she heard voices muted at first but clearing as she got to the far end around this corner she could see a rotted wooden gate hanging open on one hinge it is a simple question mr schroeder a mans voice snarled we know you were a combat engineer during the war and we know that you were attached to the pandora project what we dont know is who youve told who else knows about pandora after a moments pause the answer came in the form of another screeching wail much louder than before otto schroeder was being tortured anika felt paralyzed she turned to look behind her she couldnt see her car but knew she could reach it in seconds she even took her key ring out of her skirt pocket and got the ignition key centered between her fingers but she could not move the longago war that had claimed most of her family and drove her grandfather was continuing just a few feet away ive told no one this had to be schroeder the words came out between wheezes of pain the secret of what we did dies with me you had better hope so said a third voice lower than even schroeders and menacing there were two of them maybe more anika had only one option her cell phone was in her backpack all she needed to do was move far enough away so her call to the police wouldnt be heard she took a cautious step backward and then another the pain came suddenly and was unlike anything shed ever felt a hand had come over the top of the wall and buried itself in her hair the thick fingers threading down to her scalp she was nearly lifted off her feet her skin felt like it was about to be ripped from her head she cried out batting at the arm but even a small movement made the agony even more unbearable ive got someone it was yet another male voice one that sounded younger than the first two a woman the pain forced anika onto her toes and still the man pulled her higher held immobile she began to scream the gate was wrenched open and a man approached her with an automatic pistol in his hand he was tall and fit with blond hair and a dark expression only when he was behind her with the pistol pressed against her back did he speak okay karl ive got her let her go the strain on her hair vanished and anika would have dropped to the ground had the gunman not propped her up with one hand while keeping the weapon screwed into her kidney he forced her forward with a savage prod the walled garden was overrun with weeds and the uneven flagstones were slick with moss there were a rusted iron table and a couple of mismatched chairs next to the door that led to the house otto schroeder lay on a chipped concrete bench with two men standing over him one of them must have been karl the one whod grabbed her a fourth figure stood back in the shadows anika guessed that he was the leader of the group she couldnt see his features but somehow he seemed older than the others she focused her attention on schroeder and when she realized what they had done to him hot vomit shot into her mouth fear had stripped away her ability to remain clinical one of schroeders legs had been flayed open and a large slab of tissue had been carved away blood pooled in the gruesome wound and spilled over onto the patio anika looked into the old mans gray face and was amazed to see defiance in his watery eyes at some point in his torture hed bitten into his lip or tongue because more blood dripped from his face who are you the man who had grabbed her karl asked he was a near copy of the one with the gun big and blond with shoulders like an executioners gallows his partner was holding a long knife in the fading light anika saw crimson on the blade her silence was from fright not resistance she knew that since shed seen their faces they would never let her live the man with the knife had a container of salt in his free hand and he poured a measure into the long gash in schroeders thigh the old soldier tried to fight the pain and failed his scream echoed in anikas head all the trauma experience in the world couldnt inure her to this kind of human suffering she prayed unconsciousness would spare him the agony who are you or do i dump the rest of this into his leg it doesnt matter the man in the shadows said so quietly that anika almost didnt hear him kill her karl had taken one step toward her when suddenly he flew back as if jerked on a string fragments of gore exploded from the side of his head the sound of a shot came at the same instant the man holding anika pushed her away and wheeled toward where he thought the gunfire had originated she fell heavily and tried to scramble under the bench schroeders blood smearing against her skin and clothes another shot rang out and a piece of stone above the bench exploded the torturer whod poured the salt into schroeders leg had been at that spot a fraction of a second earlier he had drawn his own weapon a small machine pistol that had been under his dark jacket he fired a long burst over the wall the gun buzzing like a saw hot brass arced from the weapon in a tight necklace anika pressed her hands to her ears as more shots rang out high whipcracks of rifles the deeper boom of handguns and the staccato ratchet of the machine pistol chips of stone filled the air carving visible streaks through the thickening gunpowder smoke a fresh spray of blood landed on her and she knew schroeder had just been hit yet the former soldier hadnt reacted it was either a fatal shot or his body was now beyond pain she peered into the smoky gloom and saw the leader of the torturers he was backed against the house a weapon in his hand he spotted anika and the pistols aim dropped to her position closing her eyes was a reflex she never heard the shot a frantic burst of rifle fire covered all other sounds she did feel the impact a razor slash of fire that tore along her outer thigh the fusillade pouring into the garden had distracted the leader and thrown off his aim crying out and clamping a hand over the long wound she wriggled deeper under the bench her body was drenched in sweat she was sobbing and didnt care a bullet ricocheted against a metal chair and a burned ember of steel fell into the blood sizzling obscenely as it cooled out of the gloom the torturer lurched toward her his body spasming as the rifles found their mark he took half a dozen hits before falling to his knees and then collapsing to the ground his eyes were fixed in death anika noticed that his knife had fallen just out of her reach she twisted to see if the leader was still there and saw two silhouettes running through the haze racing toward the open farmhouse door bullets pounded into the building after them sparking more shrapnel from the stone an instant later a cars engine rumbled to life and the big mercedes pulled from the house just as quickly as the firefight had started it was over the echoes of gunfire faded even as anikas hearing returned she spat the taste of gunpowder from her mouth not knowing if she should move from her hiding place she wanted to lie there forever then she heard schroeder moan above her and knew she had to tend to him it was instinctive okay ak move painfully she rolled from under the bench clutching at the oozing wound in her leg nothing happened when she raised her head no gunfire no shouts the bullet had caught otto schroeder in the lower chest the blood bubbling from the neat hole appeared carbonated a lung shot fatal if he didnt get attention immediately she looked into his face schroeder stared at her with the certainty of his own death help anika shouted into the twilight hoping to draw the attention of whoever had fired into the garden with rifles the people whod just saved her life help us please there was no response from beyond the garden walls a minute might have passed she didnt know whoever had just saved her by killing two of schroeders torturers and chasing off the others was not coming anika was on her own ignoring the throb radiating from the gash in her thigh she turned to the old man schroeders breathing became more shallow and less blood was coming from his injuries even if she called an ambulance right now she doubted it would arrive before he died she knelt gingerly next to his head taking one of his big farmers hands into hers all she could offer was comfort youll be okay mr schroeder her sympathy felt flat both knew it was an empty platitude i was told someone would come for me schroeder breathed through bleeding lips but i beat them they didnt get what they wanted who were they despite everything that happened anika wanted to know i dont know a call one week ago said people were coming to question me it was a warning i ignored then i got two more calls but nothing was ever said anika thought that one of those calls must have been opa jacob it was a favorite trick of his to make sure his quarry was around just ring and hang up at hello the other call could have been the torturers doing the exact same thing but who are they she pressed fearful that he would die before she understood what had just happened my past schroeder coughed up a clot of blood that anika wiped away with her sleeve i was warned a week ago that it wouldnt end with me i thought i was the last to know know what mr schroeder the truth even with death rapidly approaching he wouldnt reveal why he had been tortured inspiration struck her about the gold they wanted to know about the gold didnt they pain had pulled his face in on itself but he managed to open his eyes wide and stare at her his voice quavered how do you know about that are you with the people who warned me anika ignored his questions the men who did this to you knew about the gold and wanted to know what happened to it is that right the gold is only a small part of it he dismissed and then fell silent for a moment anika thought hed died but then he squeezed her hand they wanted to know if ive told anyone about the rest of it have you i always knew the secret was worth killing for he smiled a bloody smile i just never imagined i would have to die for it what secret anika asked frantically he wasnt making sense she had another minute or two before he was gone what secret mr schroeder pandoras curse i have prayed my entire life that the nightmare would end with me but now i know it wont its going to continue what is pandoras curse schroeder closed his eyes tightly fighting death by force of will they told me there is a man who can help the people who warned you about these torturers they told you someone can help the old man nodded vaguely who who can help schroeders chest rattled and he coughed another larger mass of blood an american philip mercer he wheezed the words no more than a whisper his grip on anikas hand relaxed his arm fell off the bench and into the pool of their mingled blood he was dead anika wasnt surprised to feel tears on her cheeks somehow this old soldier had kept a horrible secret and at the end of his life his silence had killed him she slumped next to the body the smoke had cleared and the full horror of what had just happened was splashed against the garden walls and leached into the dirt between the flagstones with an effort she firmed her jaw and forced herself to separate herself from what had just taken place anika had to think like a doctor and not a victim okay ak get to work there were three dead from multiple gunshot wounds and one injured her wounded leg was the first priority the pain was something she could work through but she would need stitches to close the gash that meant a hospital she knew that calling an ambulance would put her in the middle of a police investigation and that was out of the question once she explained her presence here it was only a matter of time before schroeders torturers learned her identity and judging by their savagery she would be killed long before they were apprehended the nurse with the apartment next to hers could suture the wound and anika herself could get the drugs she needed for infection and pain if necessary using the rough stone wall as a crutch to gain her feet anika swayed until her head cleared it wasnt blood loss accounting for the dizziness she thought it was the shock of schroeders death and the others she had to get out of here pausing at the gate she considered the possibility of driving all the way home and knew she wouldnt make it once she reached ismaning she would call her neighbor to come get her she had to get her car away from the scene and knew that was something she could handle anika was panting by the time she got to her car she grabbed a towel from the backseat and tied a rough bandage around the footlong slash with the strap from her backpack the last of the water was like a flash flood on a dry desert when it reached her throat cooling and nourishing and desperately needed she used another towel to wipe the worst of the blood from her face arms and legs in the rearview mirror her eyes shone with equal measures of fear and resolve anika took one last look at the house a single lamp in a front room casting a feeble glow into the night she was certain her being here at the same time as the torturers wasnt a coincidence she dialed her opas number but cut the connection when she heard his gruff hello anika sagged he was all right shed feared that the gunmen had learned about schroeder through jacob eisenstadt using the same techniques theyd employed against the former soldier if the information hadnt come from opa it had come from another source when she was up to it shed talk to him about it but not tonight and that was only one of the mysteries that needed to be solved that she needed to solve who had tipped off schroeders killers who had saved her life by chasing them away she felt they had to be the same people who warned schroeder a week ago but she didnt know how they knew to be here tonight who was this person he mentioned mercer and how could he help finally and possibly most tantalizing what was pandoras curse she put her car into gear and pulled away needing all of her concentration to keep the vehicle on the narrow road one other question worked into the back of her mind what could possibly be so valuable that schroeder had dismissed an enormous shipment of gold as only a small part of it arlington virginia because his overnight stay in manhattan wasnt really planned the airline had held mercers luggage from pennsylvania for him at reagan national he presented his identification and baggage claim checks when he deplaned from the new york flight and a skycap retrieved his bags from storage he had little trouble finding a cab to take him home the flight to washington had lasted an hour and it felt good to sit again his legs were sore from hours of wandering the natural history museum it was nearing ten oclock at night and traffic was light as the taxi threaded around arlington cemetery and hooked up with i hed lived in arlington for a little over seven years and the amount of growth near his neighborhood was astonishing it was only a matter of time before the ten blocks of row houses around his brownstone were replaced with highrises and strip malls from the outside his building was similar to all the others on the quiet street it stood three stories tall and was faced with ruddy stone that was corbeled over the windows and the front door the entry steps were cement flanked by wrought iron railings under the streetlights he recognized two of the cars parked behind his black jaguar the battered plymouth fury belonged to paul gordon a retired jockey and the owner of a neighborhood bar called tinys and the ford taurus was mike oreillys one of tinys regulars mercer left his bags on the sidewalk and fished his car keys from his pocket chirping open the locks as he approached the sleek english convertible he peered in to check the odometer the last three numbers were exactly as they should be and the tenths wheel was between the six and seven ill be damned mercer said aloud he was certain harry white would have taken the car for a spin while he was in pennsylvania which is why hed memorized the mileage before leaving then he noticed that the odometer had rolled over a complete thousand miles right down to the last hundred yards oh you sneaky old bastard he chuckled without malice mercer grabbed up his matching bags and mounted the stairs the front door was unlocked while the outside of the brownstone was conventional the inside was something else entirely the whole structure had been gutted and rebuilt according to plans mercer himself had drawn up the front third of the building was a marblefloored atrium that soared up to the roof with balconies overlooking it from the secondfloor library and the third floor where the master suite was located connecting the levels and partially blocking the view of the kitchen was a spiral staircase the railings on the balconies had been custom made to match the antique stairs on the ground floor behind the kitchen and the laundry area were his home office and the dining room he used for a redtopped pool table the unused dining table sat in a corner of the entry foyer in what should have been the living room he heard a roar of laughter from the second floor this was where he had his version of a family room only it was closer to an english pub with wainscoting on the walls an oak wet bar fronted by six stools a couple of couches and chairs and his entertainment center he left his bags at the base of the spiral stairs and climbed up to the library the cigar smoke wafting from the bar through the connecting french doors was as thick as a fire on a tobacco plantation the couches had been pushed aside to make room for a folding table and seated around it were harry tiny mike oreilly and mikes brotherinlaw john pigeon the table was littered with ashtrays halfempty glasses and poker chips the forestgreen carpet beneath the table looked pale from all the spilled ash theyd been here for hours maybe days for all mercer knew youre pushing it harry youre really pushing it mercer tried to put some anger in his voice but failed he didnt care that harry had let someone chauffeur him around in the jag or had the guys over for cards hed expected no less hey mercer welcome back harry boomed he might be eighty but his voice carried the power of a train wreck with half the charm got any cash on you mikes cheating and i think ill figure out how if you lend me a hundred you mind telling me how you managed to put a thousand miles on my car in two weeks mercer noticed that paul tiny gordon had two encyclopedia volumes on his chair so he could sit at the same height as the others oh that well tiny and i decided to go to atlantic city for the weekend thats only four hundred miles roundtrip twice harrys attempt to look contrite appeared more selfsatisfied than anything and the other two hundred miles errands tiny cut in shouldering some of the blame i wanted to catch a few races at belmont the former jockey said besides we needed to roll your car over to an even grand i hope to god you drove paul when the diminutive gordon laughed he looked and sounded like a gnome i had blocks installed on the pedals of my car so i can drive it to reach the gas in your jag id have to crawl on the floor and use my hands mercer looked back to harry horrified that the octogenarian would drive that far you you need to have the tires rebalanced harry suggested mildly it started to shimmy at a hundred miles an hour oh christ mercer rubbed his forehead he went behind the bar to get a beer from the rebuilt locklever refrigerator next to the ornate back bar while youre back there harry called jovially mind making me another jack and ginger yeah grab me another beer mike oreilly added might as well mix up another margarita this from john pigeon before answering mercer slid his wallet from his pants pocket and counted his cash which totaled nearly three hundred dollars despite the late hour and his exhaustion his decision was an easy one get an extra chair pidge and ill make it a pitcher on one corner of the bar mercers mail lay stacked in a pile that was in imminent danger of spilling onto the floor the deal with harry was that he could stay at the house whenever mercer was away as long as he got the mail and took care of phone messages the deal didnt include opening the mail however mercer shook his head in mock frustration one item caught his eye a long skinny tube like those used for shipping posters the one thing that was for you he said holding it up for harry to see and you didnt open it i thought someone had mailed you a snake actually its your birthday present only its a couple months late mercer made the drinks set them on the bar for john to dispense and passed the tube to harry what is it he asked suspiciously an anorexic anaconda just open the goddamned thing not one to stand on ceremony harry crushed out his cigar and tore the tube apart like a kid inside was a walking stick a custommade cane of black walnut capped with an ornate silver grip harry white had only one leg hed lost the other during his years as a sea captain following world war ii he didnt have a noticeable limp but mercer had seen him wince a few times when he walked and knew it was time for his friend to bow to the inevitable this aint bad harry admitted mercer took it from him twisted part of the handle to release a secret catch and pulled a gleaming thirtyinch sword blade from the cane harrys face lit up all right and the best part mercer said and twisted the sword near where the tang went into the handle the blade came free leaving a nineinchlong wand with a screw cap set in the top end mercer opened it and gave it an appreciative sniff the cane maker had gotten his final instructions before shipping his creation harry took the handle smelled its open end as mercer had done and laughed the canesword was also a flask filled with harrys version of mothers milk jack daniels harrys eyes were bright blue and they were usually filled with mischievous sarcasm now they clouded over unguarded and showed how much mercers gift meant to him he looked up thanks mercer he rasped quietly this is something else happy birthday mercer handed over five twentydollar bills and took a seat muttering you still have to pay back the hundred they played poker until midnight talking mostly about mercers upcoming trip mike was the only driver sober enough to get behind the wheel so he said hed give tiny a ride back to his condo after dropping off pidge he offered the same service to harry but hed already staked his claim to the couch harry lived only a dozen blocks away yet he slept at mercers at least once a week and never used either of the small guest rooms at the back of the house orphaned when he was twelve and raised by his grandparents who were now also dead mercer had no family which made his friendships all the more precious his father had been a mining engineer as well and he and mercers mother siobhan had died in one of the countless uprisings in central africa during his training for the iraq mission an army shrink had told mercer that his early loss had created in him an acute fear of abandonment and an overdeveloped sense of loyalty and responsibility mercer agreed and knew that despite the more than four decades separating them he valued harry more than anything else in his life mercer usually woke at dawn however he slept an hour later the following morning he showered quickly threw on a pair of shorts and a tshirt and went down to get the washington post from the stoop hed set the timer on the coffeemaker behind the bar last night the brew was thick as tar and the steam rising from it was strong enough to scald his eyes he poured the pot into a carafe and made more coffee for harrys less masochistic tastes do you mind not making those pounding noises over there harry grumbled as he came awake thats not me its your head sitting up harry looked around the room his mouth scrunched up as he tasted the aftereffects of a pack of cigarettes a couple of cigars and more whiskey than was strictly necessary he coughed viciously yeah you might be right before getting off the couch harry rolled up his pants leg and strapped on the fleshcolored prosthetic limb he slid his thin arms into the sleeves of an overlaundered blue oxford buttoning it over the undershirt hed slept in ive always wondered mercer said pouring a cup of coffee for his friend and adding several spoons of sugar if you slept in your clothes at home only on those nights i pass out every night huh lets just say most nights and leave it at that harry went off to use the guest bathroom and mercer scanned the newspaper a scandal involving washingtons school board couldnt hold his interest for more than the headline because so much of his work took place overseas mercer was more interested in international news he read about the upcoming universal convocation the article had a photograph of the sea empress the ship the pope was using for his meeting although the vessel was the largest cruise liner ever built she was as sleek as a race yacht with raked decks and funnels on each of her two hulls somewhere hed read that a lap around the enormous catamaran was half a mile harry returned as mercer was finishing another piece about a german company that had agreed to pay billion in reparations to slave laborers they had used in their factories during the war hey last night you never said when you were leaving for greenland harry sat at the bar near mercer hed taken the time to shave the silver stubble from his lantern jaw tomorrow afternoon mercer replied sliding the crossword puzzle over to him seated or standing the two men were the same height but this news made harry slump in disappointment he preferred mercers company more than the use of his house he took a gulp of coffee and lit a cigarette i know the timing kind of sucks mercer added this is an opportunity i just couldnt pass up i guess i cant blame you joining the surveyors society must be a hell of a thing for you how many childhood dreams really do come true the question was asked seriously besides losing your virginity not many harrys wrinkled face broke into a smile im glad for you but i dont envy you whats that place like this time of year believe it or not spring is just starting july is when the ice packs that surround greenland break up well probably be one of the first ships over this year the weather should be in the low twenties though i think storms can blow up at any time and the temperature can drop below zero in about five minutes youre nuts mercer laughed but didnt argue while harry worked at the crossword mercer grabbed a sheet of paper and a pen from his office and began a list of things he wanted to bring for a job he usually knew exactly what items were needed this was the first time in a while however that he would work in such harsh conditions and he wanted to be prepared ten down harry white interrupted a fiveletter word for friend middle ones o mercer looked at him pointedly mooch bastard try crony an hour later as harry thumbed through the rest of the washington post mercer was getting together some of the equipment on his list later he would need to go to a specialized outfitters store for the things hed need but many of the small items he had lying around the house some were elusive though harry have you seen my glacier glasses twisting on his bar stool the octogenarian shot him a withering look and his voice dripped sarcasm dont you remember i borrowed them the last time i climbed mount everest just for that im going to lock up my liquor when im gone and ban you from smoking in here such clean living would probably kill him in a week hey i was kidding harry backpedaled quickly theres no need to get nasty when youre done today you going over to tinys its twoforone night which means doublefisted drinking no i want to do some research on the internet id like to find out more about project iceworm and this camp decade were going to reopen during his lunch at the society charles bryce had also told mercer about an air force plane that had crashed a few months before the base closed the search for the wreckage had been extensive and it should have been easy to spot the plane on the ice but no trace was ever found he hoped to find something about that as well just for curiositys sake suit yourself harry said grabbing his new cane for the walk home you leaving from dulles or national dulles you mind giving me a ride thats why i asked thanks come by around noon harry left and a few minutes later mercer went on his shopping trip considering the list of items and the work he had to do tonight he realized that he shouldnt have stayed in new york for an extra day however anything he forgot here could most likely be purchased in iceland before they boarded the njoerd for the run to ammassalik greenland he also trusted charlie bryce about georesearch being a firstclass outfit surely theyd take care of him reykjavik iceland since mercer was a geologist this small island in the middle of the atlantic fascinated him formed a mere eighteen million years ago by subsea volcanoes that were still active today iceland was living proof of the turbulent nature of our planet earthquakes were a daily occurrence and one of the many volcanoes dotting the country erupted every couple of years the landscape was littered with incredible geologic features geothermal vents ancient craters and a mountain valley that was the only place where the midatlantic ridge crossed dry land by contrast greenland its huge neighbor to the west was once part of pangea the supercontinent that formed as the earth cooled the rock there was upward of billion years old and geologically dead that didnt mean that mercer was too keen on the place as a tourist iceland was rather desolate half of the population of a quarter million lived in and around the capital reykjavik if not for the geothermal plants that provided hot water for heat and electricity the sustainable population would have been only a fraction of that number also its isolation ensured that everything was sickeningly expensive reykjaviks international airport sat on an open plain blistered by the radar domes of an adjacent american military base as mercer stepped through the revolving exit door of the futuristic terminal he was hit by a blast of cold wind shrieking off the north atlantic the gulf stream the river of warm water that flowed from florida to europe passed along icelands south coast and warmed the island enough to make it habitable but by no stretch was it comfortable even in summer the sky was leaden with low tumbling clouds that seemed to hang just a few hundred feet off the ground a distant beam of sunlight made a faroff mountain glow neon green mercer zipped up his bomber jacket and donned a khaki baseball cap while he waited at the curb with his two large bags the air smelled fresh sharp with the scent of the sea and it only added to the unreality of his position eight hours ago harry had dropped him at dulles with the promise that he wouldnt use the jag and now he was here though he traveled constantly the thrill of being in a new place never wore off it was like a flicker of lightness in his chest mercer had also asked harry to forward his mail to the satellite office georesearch would maintain in reykjavik to transship mail and supplies to the team in greenland once a week while downloading the two hundred email messages from his server mercer had come across a cryptic note from a lawyer in munich about some documents being sent to him on behalf of an unnamed client mercer had no idea what it was about and had sent a query back there hadnt been a reply by the time he and harry left for the airport so mercer asked his old friend to keep an eye out for it and make sure it reached him mercer had been waiting for five minutes when a toyota van pulled up to the building the burly passenger rolled down his window dr mercer da his accent was russian im mercer the russian threw open the door with a big grin even without the bright blue parka he was huge taller than mercer by at least a foot and broad across the shoulders and chest to judge by his florid face he appeared to be in his early fifties but he looked like an outdoorsman and might have been younger welcome to iceland i am igor bulgarin mercers hand vanished in his grip thank you are you part of georesearch nyet they are all germans i am from russian academy of science but i am lone russian on expedition all others from my group are from western europe he spoke in a flood of words as if fearful they would dry up the driver got out of the toyota he was mercers age and about the same build his sour expression seemed to be a permanent feature and he had slow watchful eyes mercer made the quick assumption that the two were not working together bulgarin had the jocularity of an excited puppy while the blondhaired driver seemed overly taciturn this is ernst neuhaus igor introduced he is head of georesearch support office here in iceland oh how do you do mercer said good evening dr mercer neuhaus replied briefly shaking hands without first removing his glove his voice was sharp and lightly accented youre the last of the societys people to arrive in fact everyones here except for one person from igors group mercer turned to the russian is there a problem we have medical doctor coming she is german who studies stress but not part of georesearch she had accident back home and will join us on greenland i thought your group were all meteorologists nyet three of them investigate sunspots i look for meteorite fragments and dr klein looks at us i never asked you igor neuhaus interrupted why go to greenland to look for meteors meteor doesnt hit ground meteorite does igor bulgarin corrected we search on ice for same reason polar bear is white white bear white ice no can see black meteorite on white ice find easy meteorite in desert looks like all other rocks very hard to find mercer decided quickly that he liked the animated russian his less than positive reaction to neuhaus was irrelevant since the german wasnt going to greenland are you guys my ride to town da others wait at hotel very boring i volunteer to come with ernst for something to do mercers luggage was tossed into the cargo section at the rear of the van and he jumped into the seat behind neuhauss im surprised marty bishop didnt come to pick me up hes getting drunk igor bulgarin scoffed last night he learn that friend of his not coming on trip lastminute crisis cause him to cancel you mean theres only going to be three of us opening camp decade mercer had thought that four was ludicrous but losing martys buddy meant they would be even more shorthanded mr bishop has already taken care of that neuhaus said georesearch is sending thirty people to the ice hes made arrangements to use some of our workers as needed plus we have enough equipment and provisions to last a couple of months for anything else you may need da is true igor admitted with a grunt four snocats with trailers a land cruiser with special tires and many many preformed buildings that are supposed to go up like house of cards how are we getting all that equipment to camp decade mercer asked its too much for choppers bulgarin twisted in his seat so he could look at mercer although his smile was missing a tooth it conveyed his boundless energy from dock in ammassalik everything is transferred to ice by blimp mercer must have made a surprised sound because ernst neuhaus elaborated its a heavylift cargo airship that georesearch leased for the job i guess its only been flying a few months believe it or not i know something about it mercer said its got a semirigid body that supports four engine pods with tiltrotors that can pivot from horizontal like an airplanes to vertical like a helicopters its similar to the system used in the marines v osprey this type of dirigibles a modification of frank piaseckis illfated helistat the owners call it a rotorstat neuhaus steered the van off the airport grounds and on to route for the drive to reykjavik it will ferry the vehicles to the ice directly inland of ammassalik where you then drive them to the camp the heavier stores and prefab buildings will be flown to the site by the time you arrive an advance team will have one building ready for your use while you erect everything else sounds like this is going to be one hell of a trip mercer had always been fascinated by airships they represented something special in the world of aviation an evolutionary branch that was as elegant as it was shortlived modern materials and computeraided design as well as the use of nonflammable helium were creating a minor resurgence in these flying behemoths that flicker of anticipation hed felt since arriving was burning a little brighter now look igor pointed to a road to their right away from where the ocean was pounding icelands black volcanic coast that is way to blue lagoon geothermal hot spring used as natural spa water in huge outdoor pool like lake very curative i went yesterday with a few of the germans the waters actually effluent from the adjoining thirtytwomegawatt svartsengi power plant ernst explained they use volcanically heated water to produce electricity it has the same salinity as seawater but it is high in silica which helps people suffering from psoriasis ive been to the old blue lagoon mercer said across the lichencoated lava field a white cloud clung to the ground just over the horizon it was steam from the power plant a few years ago i came to iceland for a conference i understand they built a new spa about a quarter mile from the plant yes yes very nice igor confirmed eagerly we must go tomorrow before ship leaves for greenland mercer shook his head sorry ive got a meeting in the morning he added nothing more and his two companions didnt pry they drove in silence and eventually the rolling hills of lava gave way to urban sprawl in icelandic reykjavik means smoking bay it was named for the steam that rose from the geologically active vents nearby the citys suburbs were newer with a distinctive european flair in the distance dominating the skyline sat the hallgrimskirkja a huge cement church topped by a foot spire locals nicknamed it the concrete cathedral for obvious reasons the tidy old town abutting the harbor was a jumble of narrow streets laid down randomly as though a giant had thrown a fistful of straws the older buildings were rustic and the newer ones were given historic architectural touches ernst neuhaus pulled up before the hotel borg a white stone edifice across the street from a small public park home for the night he announced and waited while igor helped mercer unload his bags i must return to georesearchs office i cant see you off tomorrow so have a great trip again icelands constant wind struck mercer when he closed the vans side door igor bulgarin didnt seem the slightest bit fazed by it and mercer suspected he had spent a great deal of his time in climates much worse than this is it this bad in greenland he asked the big russian laughed hefting one bag over his shoulder for the short walk to the hotel entrance they have wind there called the pitaraq is gravity driven like katabatic in antarctica it starts with small breeze from the south and then there is calm you have about ten minutes to find shelter then pitaraq hits from north at about two hundred and forty kilometers per hour ten years ago a man i was working with was picked up by such wind we find him twenty kilometers away he looked like he was dragged by truck clothes and flesh stripped from his body by contact with ice jesus da seeing mercers concern igor grinned again pitaraq is mostly in winter not so common this time of year but must always be prepared although it was approaching ten oclock at night it was still light out because reykjavik was only a hundred fifty miles south of the arctic circle according to mercers internal clock it was four hours earlier but he knew he had to acclimate himself to the time change and the best way to do that was to force himself to sleep he got his key in the retros lobby thanked igor for picking him up and took the elevator to his room he would meet with the surveyors society team at breakfast the room was small but functional and overlooked the park hot water would be a precious luxury once in greenland so he took a long shower to wash the flight from his skin he thought about his meeting in the morning while researching camp decade on the internet he had come across an old article about the downed c cargo plane and the subsequent search for survivors he read that stefansson rosmunder the son of one of the first men to climb mt everest had been part of the searchandrescue effort because rosmunder had been so young at the time mercer figured he would still be alive and he wanted to talk with the arctic specialist about his experiences he spent the better part of the morning before his flight to iceland on the telephone trying to track down rosmunder and finally reached his elderly mother just a few minutes before harry had come over her son shed told him in a remarkably clear voice had been dead for many years when mercer explained where he was going mrs rosmunder said that she would like to speak with him before they sailed to greenland she told him that she fed the ducks living in the small lake called the pond in the middle of reykjavik every morning at ninethirty and asked if he would meet her there of course mercer agreed just in case he overslept mercer put in one wakeup call for six and another for sixten and fell into bed he wasnt tired and the meal hed had on the flight was churning in his stomach so it was difficult to slow his mind and relax over and over his conversation with elisebet rosmunder replayed in his head he decided that it was her voice that had disturbed him rather than hearing sorrow for her dead son as he expected she had sounded frightened dark dreams made his sleep fitful he abandoned his bed thirty minutes before his first wakeup call and dressed the harbor was four blocks away a straight walk down posthusstreati post office street the sun was long risen he studied the merchandise in the windows of the tourist shops beautiful sweaters and woolens were piled on tables and cascaded off racks they would make an ideal gift for a woman he thought but the only one in his life at the moment was fay the wife of fbi director dick henna mercer and dick had been friends ever since the hawaii crisis a few years ago and he decided that he would buy fay a sweater when the expedition was over at the base of the street across a wide quay the georesearch ship njoerd lay low in the water of the protected inner harbor thick manila ropes securing her to bollards the wind was a constant force that stung mercers cheeks and made his eyes tear across the bay the snowcap atop mount esja seemed gilded the redhulled njoerd was a functional vessel about two hundred feet long with a large superstructure mounted well forward a coil of smoke rose from both her sidebyside funnels her aft deck was an open cargo area nearly hidden under the equipment that was going to greenland with them amid the pallets of stores and sections of the bases buildings mercer could just see the tops of the snocats over the gunwale an overhead crane mounted on rails that ran the length of the ship could shift her cargo as needed as well as offload her on some hostile coast placed transversely behind the funnels but still accessible by the crane was a large oceangoing powerboat that he assumed they used as a fast shuttle she also had a small helipad if not for her oversize superstructure that housed laboratories and accommodations for passengers and crew mercer thought she looked a bit like an oil field resupply ship the denmark strait separating iceland from greenland had a reputation for being treacherous but the njoerd seemed more than capable of handling anything the seas threw at her he was chilled by the time he returned to the hotel borg and the smell of fresh coffee and the breakfast buffet made his mouth flood in anticipation the mauvecolored dining room was full of georesearch people and members of the other two teams and the excited conversation made the room buzz mercer noted nearly everyone in the room had facial hair of some sort and guessed they cultivated a mountain man look because of what they did arctic research attracted a very specific type of person igor bulgarin waved when he saw mercer enter you are always late my friend he greeted i went down to the dock to check out our ship fine boat igor said her bows are hardened to break ice up to a meter thick im afraid this meal is a segregated one teams are eating only with each other that is marty bishop at the corner table with the other member of society team then i guess i should grab a plate and join them a group are going to blue lagoon in a few minutes sure you not come yeah im sure thanks anyway is okay see you on njoerd at noon mercer mounded his plate with eggs smoked salmon and sweet breakfast rolls before approaching the societys table one of the men looked at him suspiciously then got to his feet he was short and heavy across the gut about fifty years old and he had the pale look of someone who didnt spend much time outside an office his gray hair was thin at the top and along the front and it swayed with just a small toss of his head his neatly trimmed mustache was a few shades darker than his hair and was the only thing that gave his ordinary face any character considering his soft appearance mercer wondered how much of his being here was his idea and how much was pressure from his father marty bishop pleasure to meet you they shook hands bishops palm was as smooth as an accountants charlie bryce says youve got one hell of a reputation he exaggerates its good to be part of your team mercer said intentionally establishing his subordinate status bishop nodded obviously pleased that mercer understood who was in charge glad to have you on board he pointed to the other man at the table he was about the same age as bishop though had a harder look this heres ira lasko us navy retired lasko added laskos handshake was like a bear trap and mercer suspected that he had never been a pencil pusher eater maybe but not a pusher his hands had deep scars across all the knuckles and white pads of calluses at the base of each finger they were the hands of a worker he was about five foot seven and wiry the sleeves of his flannel shirt were pushed up and while his arms were thin ropes of muscle and sinew pushed outward from beneath his skin he kept his head completely shaved though there was a fringe of five oclock shadow circling just above his ears his eyes were murky brown under dark brows i understand were missing a team member mercer invited as he sat jim kneeland marty replied blowing out a long breath he was supposed to get time off from the national guard but was suddenly called back to duty kinda throws us off i asked my dad to consider postponing the search but he refused he shrugged considering his health i cant blame him charlie said hes in a wheelchair hes now in a hospital bed at home cancer doctors dont give him more than six months opening camp decade means a lot to him actually he rarely mentioned his time in the air force until about a year ago suddenly it was all he talked about when he asked if i was willing to come up here to make a video of the place i couldnt say no this is a hell of a thing youre doing for him ira said somberly mercer nodded it seemed as if marty hadnt thought about this situation from anothers point of view he started to smile yeah he agreed without conceit i guess it is what the hell it gets me out of the office for a while and this might actually turn out to be fun i was never told are you part of the surveyors society mercer asked lasko no but ive done some work for charles bryce before he recommended me to marty what do you do i used to teach snotnosed kids how to survive accidents aboard submarines now i run the garage at a truck stop my job here is to make sure all our equipment runs properly charlie told us what you do for a living why the hell do you live in a cesspool like washington mercer laughed my first job out of the colorado school of mines was for the us geological survey i actually liked living in dc so when i went out on my own i just stayed all i really need for my work is a computer and easy access to an airport have you guys met any of the georesearch people coming with us ira leaned across the table and spoke in a low voice theyre headed by a real asshole named werner koenig hes got a fistful of degrees and a real superior attitude bryce told you how the danish government forced him to bring us along and move his operation to conform to our mission so you can believe he aint too pleased with us his second in charge is greta schmidt marty bishop added with a smirk a real knockout in a nordic ice princess sort of way theyre sitting four tables over next to the bar mercer turned greta schmidt was easy to spot she was bent over the table passing a folder to someone her hair was whiteblond and fell past her shoulders he could see just a portion of her face and got the impression that she was indeed beautiful koenig was the man seated next to her he was speaking to another tablemate rapping on the table with his hand as he made a point he had a natural aura of leadership that mercer recognized even at this distance above his dark beard his face was weathered like old leather though he couldnt have been much older than forty his eyes were a cold blue like polished aquamarine dont even think about it bishop said incorrectly guessing at mercers interest i tried to chat her up two days ago frigid as an iceberg mercer suppressed a chuckle he loved how a man like marty bishop immediately assumed a woman was frigid when she rebuffed his advances the skin around the ring finger on martys left hand was pinched and slightly discolored where until recently a wedding band had covered it opening his fathers old military base wasnt the only conquest on bishops mind they talked all through the long breakfast forging the rapport that would sustain them for the weeks to come although there were forty people total mercers experience was that group dynamics quickly broke down when they were hit by the enormity of their isolation he wasnt concerned about himself or ira lasko isolation was nothing new to a submariner he did have some reservations about marty while mental character rarely showed on the outside he felt that bishop possessed an underlying weakness he suspected that martys father had seen it too and that this trip was more about having his middleaged son find whatever it was he lacked than taking pictures of a longabandoned air force base the meal broke up around nine everyone was going back to their rooms to pack up for the ship mercer wasnt sure how long hed be with elisebet rosmunder so he asked ira lasko to make sure his bags made it to the njoerd he was standing outside the hotel checking his bearings on a small map when a female voice called to him from the door you are part of the surveyors society the voice was german accented and throaty without looking he knew it had to be greta schmidt yes i am mercer turned and approached her she was his exact height and nearly as wide at the shoulders her hair was scraped back from her forehead revealing a widows peak above her widespaced eyes she wore too much lipstick he noted which made her mouth overly full as though her lips were swollen she was not as attractive as that first impression it was the eyes they lacked focus and depth as if there was nothing beyond her facade im philip mercer i am greta schmidt she said formally but made no move to shake his hand i will not tolerate the way you looked at me at breakfast you have the same bad manners as your mr bishop mercer took the accusation like an illdeserved slap like most men he had been caught staring at women many times however unlike marty bishop he never crossed the line between admiring and objectifying and in this case he had been doing neither you misunderstood my interest miss schmidt i had just asked marty bishop to point out the leaders of the georesearch team i wanted to assure myself that i wasnt trusting my life to a couple of incompetents at this her stare became even harder mercer was sure nine times out of ten she was right about what people thought when they saw her and he could understand her anger what disturbed him was that she enjoyed this anger seemed to need it he saw in her expression that she liked that her looks gave her a power to intimidate men and are we she asked in a brittle voice competent i dont judge people at a glance mercer said throwing her accusation back at her but after looking at your ship this morning i feel safe with georesearch greta schmidt studied him for a long moment her expression unreadable and then she reentered the hotel mercer went back to his map making an enemy this soon wasnt what he had in mind but hed done nothing to precipitate the confrontation the tjorn or pond was only a couple of blocks behind the hotel borg screened from mercers view by the town hall it was surrounded by buildings on three sides and divided by an automobile bridge about three hundred yards from the cobblestone shore ducks and geese filled the air and coated a good portion of the water they rode the windstirred waves like toys it was obviously a favorite spot for the elderly who fed the birds and for young mothers with their children scanning the crowd he saw a number of people who could have been elisebet rosmunder yet only one paid him any attention she was a tiny woman bundled in a long drab coat a wool hat covering her hair she sat on a bench near the waters edge a flock of birds within an easy toss of her position like most locals she looked scandinavian with sharp features and clear though heavily wrinkled skin her eyes were as sharp and blue as harry whites mercer guessed they were about the same age too mrs rosmunder he asked as he walked nearer there were a few unclaimed bread crumbs at her feet yes i am she the elderly lady said and indicated that mercer should sit by her side you are the man who phoned me yesterday dr mercer yes philip mercer thank you for seeing me dr mercer it was i who wanted to see you she reminded him in excellent english mercer didnt recall mentioning his title but he wasnt certain thats right you said you had something you wanted to tell me thats correct he didnt get a sense of fear from her like hed felt during their phone call instead she seemed almost relieved i also have something i want to show you as well mercer waited quietly while she threw a handful of bread into the water a pair of ducks squabbled to get the food and mrs rosmunder admonished them in icelandic do you work for your government dr mercer no maam as i said on the phone im part of a scientific expedition going to greenland i was doing research for the trip when i came across the story of a crashed airplane and how your son was part of the search because it happened near where were going i thought i would speak with him about conditions there greenlands east coast is a mystery to most people there are only a few native settlements and the danes heavily subsidize them where stefansson went to look for that plane is an area that even the native inuits dont bother with you are wise to want to talk with someone who has actually been there mercer said nothing it was the middle of august i dont remember the exact date when my husband received a phone call from the american military at keflavik air force base they told him about a plane crash and how they needed guides who knew greenland to help them in their search stefan had just returned from another failed attempt to climb everest and was in no condition to attempt something that strenuous however our son who was twenty at the time and every bit the arctic expert as his father agreed to go your government was offering unheardof wages stefansson was gone for two weeks as you probably know from the article you read they never found the plane and they searched by dogsled on foot and by airplane did they happen to go to a place called camp decade she looked at him sharply you have heard of it part of my mission is to reopen the base mercer said somehow knowing this news wouldnt please her you know what the base was supposed to be yes it was an experiment to create a town under the ice to see if such a place could be habitable she shook her head as though hed given her the wrong answer why would your government want to know if such a thing was possible have you ever asked yourself that question mercer hadnt which was unusual do you know why no but i want to show you something she made no move to show him anything she sat very still her mind elsewhere probably with her dead son finally she spoke camp decade was offlimits to the searchers they werent even supposed to know it was there though they did fly over it once stefansson told me he asked about it and was informed by the military pilot that he hadnt seen anything that was the height of the cold war mercer felt a need to explain his nations paranoia my government thought that everything should be classified top secret to look back now so much of what they did seems comical mrs rosmunder winced mercer wasnt sure what hed said to cause such a reaction she reached into her handbag and withdrew a leather wallet from inside she pulled out two blackandwhite photographs she handed one to him it showed a handsome young man in a thick rollnecked sweater his blond hair falling around his head in heavy rings he was smiling at the camera with the easy confidence of youth that is stefansson about two months before he left for greenland elisebet rosmunder informed him taking back the picture and staring at it before handing over the other this shot showed a skeletal figure lying on a bed with sheets drawn up to the neck so all mercer could see was an enormous head bony shoulder blades created sharp ridges in the covers whatever was wasting the person rendered its face sexless its eyes were sunken and it had hollowed cheeks and just a few stray hairs covering its skull dark splotches marred its skin mercer was reminded of pictures of holocaust victims mrs rosmunder held out her hand to take the photo back from mercer this time she didnt even glance at it before replacing it in her wallet mercer waited quietly for an explanation that was stefansson six months after returning he died a couple of days after a nurse took that picture i never wanted to be reminded what happened to him but i am grateful that she gave it to me anyway her eyes were filled with tears while her voice had tightened doctors told me it was cancer a very aggressive cancer that he must have had for quite some time but only showed itself in those final months you dont believe what you were told mercers voice was as gentle as possible it was certainly cancer she replied but i never believed that hed had it before going to look for that plane she spoke with absolute conviction yet mercer couldnt help but think shed fooled herself into believing that something other than cruel fate had stolen her son from her newspapers were full of stories about healthy people dying of cancer without having symptoms until the very end it was the most feared disease for that and many other reasons elisebet rosmunder turned so she faced him on the bench taking his hand into her birdlike fingers dr mercer you dont have to believe me i have long ago given up trying to convince people that there is something on greenland that killed stefansson my government never looked into it your military never looked into it and i would never allow my husband to go over there and search for himself i am certain that my son was exposed to some toxin or some radiation and that is what gave him accelerated cancer i also believe it has to do with camp decade she forestalled the question on mercers lips by squeezing his hand i have no proof there is no reason for me to think this and as far as i know no americans stationed there suffered the way stefansson did i just wanted you to know the suspicions of an old woman who lost her son in the same area you are now going to in good conscience i could not let you or your team go without warning you she turned back and tossed another handful of crumbs to the ducks mercer knew she had nothing more to say he stood thank you for sharing this with me mrs rosmunder youve given me something to think about when she looked up at him her smile was wan you are years older than stefansson when he died but you remind me a great deal of him not your looks well youre as handsome as he was but im talking about your spirit you both have the same confidence in your abilities mercer made a small gesture of denial it is true yet all the confidence in the world couldnt save my son but maybe the truth could have i wanted you to know the truth or as much of it as i know mercer took her hand im sorry for your loss as he turned to go she stopped him with one more comment dr mercer three months after the plane crash and failed search camp decade was abandoned your military didnt dismantle it and cart it away they deserted it on greenland for the ice and snow to bury no reason was ever given i think it is a mistake for you to reopen it mercer could understand now why hed detected fear in her voice when they spoke on the phone more disturbed than he wanted to admit he left elisebet rosmunder with her memories and her ducks as he walked toward the hotel he felt a creeping suspicion a sense of unease that hed felt all too often there was something to her story even if she couldnt provide any proof given the times mercer had little doubt the us government might have carried out some sort of experiment at camp decade with its isolation it would have been the perfect place to test chemical or biological weapons while the camp was powered by a small reactor he discounted nuclear testing or an accident because even a small atomic detonation registered on seismographs he also thought that if something did get away from them the area around camp decade would have been rendered safe by time and the elements otherwise the surveyors society would not have received permission from the military to reopen it mercer checked his watch the njoerd was leaving in an hour which left him just enough time for two stops if he hurried one stop was a liquor store despite georesearchs prohibition against alcohol at the greenland base hed bought a bottle of brandy at the airport duty free and if he was going to spend three weeks with them hed need at least one more the second stop was a matter of suspicion mrs rosmunders and his own mercer had built his career on risk and didnt mind taking chances as long as he had time to manipulate the odds first such was his concern that he headed to the second location before finding booze a move that would have stunned harry white or anyone else who knew him hamburg germany it was with an unnatural stillness that klaus raeder sat in the conference room his breathing barely made an impression against his suit coat and his eyes blinked at long regular intervals when the phone next to his elbow chimed his hand made a graceful gesture to pick it up almost as if hed paused between rings in fact hed remained motionless for more than an hour yes kara the board members are here herr raeder shall i show them in please raeder pressed a button on the console built into the blond wood conference table and the heavy drapes over the large picture windows swept closed obscuring the view of the alster river far below his secretary opened the door and stood aside for the six members of the board whom raeder had called in this afternoon he ignored them as they took their seats kara has gunther rath returned yet he got back from paris about an hour ago tell him i want to see him after we are finished here yes sir the secretary replied she closed the door behind her and raeder turned his head to regard his guests at the far end of the table sat konrad ebelhardt the seventyyearold chairman of the board next to him was anna kohl the daughter and only living relative of the companys founder volker kohl whose portrait stared down from behind ebelhardts back the others were of little consequence to raeder certainly they were wealthy and powerful but they took all of their cues from konrad and anna good afternoon gentlemen good afternoon anna how are you klaus the elderly anna kohl asked how are eva and the children shes taken them to the lodge in bavaria for the summer there was a twinge of loneliness in his voice the boys have been looking forward to it will you be joining them she persisted im planning on a weekend visit in a week or so he poured water from a carafe and took a long sip to discourage her from asking any more personal questions raeder folded his hands in front of him waiting while anna asked the others about their lives he wasnt deluded by her interest anna kohl was as tough as any of the men at the table with the possible exception of raeder himself she couldnt care less about the board members the spinster had nothing in the world except the company that bore her name i saw the quarterly projections konrad ebelhardt said to end the idle chatter he was broadly built with a heavy stomach and a blocky head he spoke with the deliberation of a prussian officer with our capital reserves as low as they are i dont like that we are so dependent on getting the eurofighters avionics contract if that deal falls through we will be in a vulnerable position the announcement for who will be supplying the nextgeneration computers for the eurofighter is still a month away but we have been assured that kohls electronics arm will be building them raeder stated in such a way that ebelhardt knew not to ask anything further the board members wouldnt want to know what their president had done to secure the multibillionmark contract does that mean we can forget about the french attempt to underbid us asked reinhardt wurmbach kohl ags chief legal counsel their bid is thirty percent higher than ours raeder said im going to increase our own bid price to cut that gap to ten percent well still get the contract and squeeze another two hundred million marks from nato do we have herr rath and his trip to paris to thank for this information raeder allowed a tight smile knowing it was expected of him my specialprojects director was instrumental in learning the amount of the french bid nothing too illegal i hope the lawyer tried to make light of industrial espionage the president of kohl ag said nothing in his devotion to the companys fiscal strength very little was beyond his scope and he would not make jokes about his business practices an uncomfortable silence stretched for ten seconds wurmbach stripped off his glasses to avoid raeders stare but he could not hide his bitterness toward the man financial magazines called uberkind superboy when kohls previous president announced his retirement eighteen months ago reinhardt wurmbach had worked tirelessly to become his replacement it was to be his reward for twentyseven years of loyalty and yet anna and konrad had passed him over in favor of raeder an outsider who had amassed a personal fortune buying up marginal companies in the former east germany and making them profitable in record time the sting of reporting to this handsome fortyyearold interloper was something wurmbach had not come to grips with and yet he couldnt fault the growth kohl one of the fifty largest companies in europe had enjoyed in raeders brief tenure you all know why i wanted to see you today raeder said to cut the silence the six members present represented the core of the board and sixty percent of the companys stock collectively they were kohl ag you are all aware that we are the largest company in germany yet to cooperate with the reconciliation commission seeking financial compensation for holocaust survivors and their families you also know that pressure to turn over documentation for the companys wartime activities is mounting by stalling for as long as we have public opinion which had been ambivalent has shifted away from our company and our products our secrecy has had the unintended effect of severely damaging our reputation despite a fiftypercent increase in advertising and marketing sales are down in nearly every division and most strongly in our heavyconstruction business no one is willing to use us until we are out from under the shadow of our legacy not cooperating with the reconciliation commission was your idea wurmbach said and others nodded our losses are your fault the outburst had no effect on raeder and it is a decision i stand by i would not expose kohl to billions of marks worth of lawsuits until i was satisfied that i knew everything the company did before and during the war for that i needed the time to study the old records its inevitable we will have to pay something wurmbach stated before the war kohl was just a small ironworks company with less than a hundred employees our expansion was due entirely to military and government contracts from the nazi regime we profited from the bloodshed just like seimens ig farben volkswagen and all the others and after the war we were a collection of bombedout factories and ruined equipment raeder replied evenly what profits we gained during the war were effectively nullified despite evidence to the contrary many believe that we are the same company now as we were before the war and must be held accountable i needed to know the full amount of our culpability and thus our liability putting a few hundred million marks into the collective pot is a lot different than facing an endless number of individual lawsuits worth billions he looked down the table at ebelhardt and anna kohl it is my riskmanagement skills that attracted you to me in the first place you knew a day of reckoning was coming and you hired me to protect you anna didnt deny it the question is can you yes raeder saw anna slump in relief for the past twelve months ive determined our strategy for minimizing the amount of money we will have to pay ive estimated that a payout of two hundred million marks wont interfere with our longterm growth while satisfying the commission that we are cooperating a wave of murmurs and sighs washed across the table i arrived at that number after a lot of exhaustive research raeder cut through the dissenting voices its the very minimum we can get away with have you prepared documents that we can give them that will lead them to this figure asked konrad ebelhardt everythings ready now ive had gunther rath and his staff gather one hundred thousand pages of correspondence shipping orders and the like its all original material carefully edited so that the commission will determine that we should be responsible for paying roughly a quarter billion marks in reparations you just said two hundred million well negotiate down to that number after they have made their findings public they would be suspicious if we didnt how much of our wartime activity are we keeping from them anna asked very little actually kohl certainly did profit from the use of slave labor at a few factories but the practice was not as widespread as in many other companies if it werent for one project in particular i would have felt comfortable disclosing everything to the commission raeder noticed the quick glance between konrad and anna he could even read her lips as she mouthed a single word pandora he paused waiting to see if konrad would dismiss the rest of the board he wasnt surprised that the chairman did gentlemen ebelhardt said looking around the table could you please excuse us for a few minutes anna and i need to speak with klaus alone wurmbach shot raeder a deadly look as he led the three others toward the door when they were gone anna was the first to speak my father intentionally shielded me from the pandora project klaus and i ask you to show me the same courtesy please dont mention specifics in my presence i cant believe volker left any records even remotely connected to pandora ebelhardts face was red with illdisguised fury the damned fool konrad he was my father anna i only read a bare outline of what was involved raeder said keeping his true sense of horror out of his voice even that little bit was shocking i have to agree with konrad that material should have been destroyed decades ago god it shouldnt have been written down in the first place we cant correct past mistakes ebelhardt leaned forward his sharp eyes boring into raeder we can bury them though raeder let his statement hang in the air all the paperwork linking kohl to the pandora project has been burned but i dont think thats enough what do you propose ive made arrangements to have the original site obliterated and any remaining physical evidence destroyed how do you know that by going back to ebelhardt glanced at anna by going back there we wont give away the secret ourselves its location is so remote and has remained undiscovered for more than sixty years risk management just because we burned our evidence doesnt mean there isnt some diary or journal written by somebody involved in pandora it could be lying in some musty attic right now waiting to go off like a time bomb our surviving war veterans are all in their seventies and eighties we cant chance family members discovering such a written record when they go through their fathers possessions by hiding pandora from the reconciliation commission now we have to make certain that even if a diary is discovered nothing remains to support the story by destroying the site all verifiable links to kohl are severed konrad looked unconvinced were about to lie to the reconciliation commission in order to conceal a despicable crime and we have to make sure that the lie is never revealed if the world finds out about pandora and our involvement in it kohls bankruptcy will be the last thing on our minds they would be fully in their right to seek criminal charges against all of us anna gasped is it that bad the pandora project i mean its worse than you can possibly imagine konrad answered placing one of his hands over hers i can make this work raeder stated i have to in the current environment we are liable for billions in reparations and if people learned what really happened during the war the company would lose every customer it ever had the alternative to covering up pandora and paying the two hundred million is losing everything our ten thousand employees would be out of work our shareholders would go broke its not that inconceivable that the shock waves of kohls collapse would severely damage germanys economy its not fair anna spat why should we be forced to pay for the sins of our fathers i was a teen when the war ended i didnt force anyone into slavery i didnt put anyone into a gas chamber ive done nothing wrong there isnt one person left in the company from those days other than a few old ladies none of our shareholders were alive then either konrad added none of us are responsible anna said petulantly its been determined that all of us are responsible anna raeder said how do you think i feel i have even less to do with this than either of you my parents were toddlers in when konrad and anna hired raeder theyd made him aware that kohl would need to negotiate a settlement with the reconciliation commission but they had not told him the depths of the companys nazi involvement they had specifically withheld pandora from him rightly fearing that he wouldnt have joined if hed known his reputation for ruthlessness in the business world was richly deserved but what hed read about in the old files went far into the realm of the obscene now he knew he was in too deep to walk away it was a matter of pride and ego he thought raeder was equally disturbed by what hed learned about kohl and by how easily hed been manipulated hed explore this circumstance once hed gotten the company out of its present crisis what kinds of steps are you taking to destroy the pandora site konrad ebelhardt asked abruptly and how sure are you they will work i dont think you need to know the details but i assure you that other than eradicating evidence of kohl ags culpability we will do nothing illegal no one will be harmed no nothing like that will happen raeder gave a sharp laugh my tactics stopped short of physical injury many years ago other than a minor setback my plan is actually nearing the final phase i bring this up because now is the time we can call the whole thing off and come clean as the americans say thirty million marks have already been spent getting everything to this stage a small loss compared to what would happen if we tell the reconciliation commission about pandora however that alternative is still open i can cancel the destruction of the pandora site he leaned back in his chair running a hand through his blond hair by skirting the morality of what they were doing and making this a purely financial decision raeder was confident that anna and konrad would agree with his plan raeder was no more pleased about this situation than either of them and yet hed cut through the emotions to make the right choice he had also had a few months to dampen his conscience do it anna shouted as if shed been listening to a raging debate in her mind and wanted it to end she didnt look at konrad when she continued confirming klaus raeders instinct that she was the real power behind the company destroy whatever remains to link us to pandora i wont allow anything to hurt kohl are you sure anna ebelhardt asked this is a dangerous gamble im convinced that klaus is right erasing our ties to pandora is the only chance we have to save ourselves from financial ruin youve made it clear that if the commission learns about it through our own disclosure or from some other source we are finished we have to make sure they never do very well raeder nodded it will be done the denmark strait the wave smashed into the bow of the njoerd like a torpedo strike blasting up an explosion of white froth that showered the forward windows and fell back to the deck pooling deep and green before racing for the scuppers the ship dropped into the following trough her steep bows cleaving a wedge of seawater at the very bottom before her twin props hauled her to the next crest mercer peered through the shimmering water still sliding from the armored glass in the ships wardroom ira lasko was at his elbow as his view cleared he saw that the sea was calm the wave had been a rogue whered that come from just mother nature reminding us not to get too comfortable lasko drawled waves like that are why i went into submarines twentytwo years in the navy and the only times i ever got seasick were on bumboats and sub tenders they turned away from the window marty bishop was at one of the formica tables with igor bulgarin and another of his teammates a german meteorologist named erwin puhl puhl was in his early forties but looked older because he was so tall and stooped little of his hair remained and what fringed his head was gray and poorly washed he wore thick glasses perched on a large bony nose his posture and features reminded mercer of a vultures and his gloomy mien did little to dispel the perception the georesearch people and offduty crewmen occupied the other tables in the brightly lit wardroom greta schmidt and werner koenig held court at a head table it seemed the segregation that had existed at breakfast would last a while longer all through dinner and the lecture that koenig had given afterward no one other than igor and his people had approached marty bishops team in fact mercer had noted the njoerds crew wasnt overly communicative with them either whenever an officer came to tell the expedition something like their sailing time to ammassalik he would go straight to koenig and have him make the announcement rather than simply telling the whole room it was strange scientific jealousy was nothing new to mercer but this continued secretiveness was getting ridiculous when soviet union was still a country igor said continuing the story hed started before the wave had sent a shudder through the njoerd and elicited a collective gasp from its passengers i was on research ship much larger than this one it was cooperative expedition with a dozen french scientists on board not only were we not allowed to talk to them unless a kgb watcher was in room but we had to report everything said if we happened to pass in the halls he looked to where schmidt and koenig were laughing at someones joke i know now how french felt is no room in science for egos or secrets all scientists should be as one mercer nodded its a nice thought igor but you know as well as i do that scientists are some of the most childish and vindictive people in the world da the big russian laughed at a memory we discover after expedition that french had stolen much equipment and all of our data what were you doing on a ship ira lasko asked over the rim of a coffee cup i thought youre some kind of astronomer looking for chunks of space rock i was meteorologist like erwin igor replied i give up weather research for planetary geology mercer cocked an eyebrow at him looking for the big one thatll wipe us out like the dinosaurs if it comes i want plenty warning many women i need to see before time runs out he laughed at his own joke tell me mercer marty invited changing the subject how do those chemical melters weve got with us work charlie said youre the real expert were going to have to hand dig down to the firn line thats the demarcation plane between granular snow and solid ice then we work with the hotrocks once our preliminary shaft is sleeved with plastic to hold back the snow i mix the chemicals at the bottom the trick is to layer the stuff so the ice melts evenly weights attached to the bottom section of sleeving keep it pressed down to the ice and hold the melt water in the tunnel pumps will take care of the water as the chemicals become diluted and lose their potency we make sure the shafts pumped dry and then repeat the process again why not just use hot water to melt the ice away too difficult to control without enough pumps you end up with a big coneshaped hole thats so wide at the base itll collapse in on itself also even if you use a hotwater heater suspended on a cable you need a massive amount of fuel to bore a shaft of any depth since camp decade is only about thirty feet down the chemical heat is the most efficient we need just a single pump no fuelhungry boilers and the chemicals themselves i counted twenty barrels on the deck when i came aboard which is more than enough and you think the three of us can handle it ira asked four would have been better since we can borrow someone from georesearch we should be okay mercer answered and glanced over martys shoulder to see werner koenig approaching when their eyes met koenig smiled broadly and put out his hand you have to be mercer willie haas said to say hello and remind you that the next time youre in hamburg youre buying dinner mercer laughed totally unprepared for the germans easy use of english and friendly greeting you tell willie that his taking me to mcdonalds the last time i saw him doesnt count for a real meal he shook koenigs hand how do you know him willie haas was a staff geologist for a german mining concern that had hired mercer for a consulting job a few years ago the two saw each other about once a year usually at trade conferences weve been friends since our days at university werner explained he told me you saved his company a fortune when you worked for them hes convinced you sold your soul to the devil for your geological insights i bartered my soul to escape hangovers mercer joked the insight comes from a ouija board whatever works werner smiled im glad to have you with us with greenlands surface covered by a few miles of ice there wont be much for you to study but i bet your skills will come in handy anyway in fact when we get our icecoring drill running i would appreciate if you took a look at the samples we draw up to the surface id be delighted mercer answered koenig was making the first effort to breach the gulf between his team and the others and for that mercer was thankful that task should have fallen on marty bishop since the surveyors society had ruined georesearchs plans but mercer didnt think bishop understood how important it was to keep all three teams as cohesive as possible koenig had a cloth bag in one hand and he reached in to extract a small green bottle of brennivin the icelandic version of aquavit commonly known as black death ive prohibited alcohol at the base camp for safety reasons however we wont reach ammassalik until noon tomorrow so sharing a few bottles tonight wont do any harm mighty neighborly of you bishop said taking the bottle and twisting off its cap he poured a measure into his empty coffee cup and passed the bottle to ira lasko koenig knelt next to mercer so only he could hear what he said next greta told me what happened this morning about your confrontation outside the hotel ah i wouldnt call it a confrontation just a simple misunderstanding yes well she can be difficult i have not seen her for about a year and she is very different from the woman i once knew the woman i almost he wanted to say married but couldnt anyway she was made number two person on this expedition over my objections and if she tries to overstep her bounds please tell me i thought you made all the personnel decisions for georesearch mercer said to cover his confusion koenigs admission wasnt something he had expected normally yes this trip is a little different you see i no longer own georesearch and my parent company wanted her along she is dating my new boss you know how it is he stood suddenly as if hed said too much enjoy the brennivin gentlemen he moved on to have a few words with those at the next table and give them a bottle of their own igor bulgarin eyed the carawayflavored liquor with a glassy look he stood abruptly i must wish you a good night this startled everyone but erwin puhl im afraid i like alcohol a bit too much one drink becomes ten and laughter becomes tears quickly my hands become fists is best i leave now but watch out for erwin turn your back and bottle gone he snapped his fingers just like that the dour puhls face split into an impish smile ive never taken that long to finish a bottle of anything after igor left the wardroom erwin poured himself a dram hes been sober for about a year its still tough for him to be around alcohol known him long before puhl answered his eyes swept the room as if he were afraid of being overheard eighteen years or so i studied at moscow university when east germany was still a soviet satellite and i worked at the soviet academy of sciences up until the wall came down in we have worked together a few times since then whats the goal of your team mercer asked we are at the end of a particular solar cycle that culminates in an event called the solar max a time of intense sunspot activity and the ejection of tremendous volumes of charged particles itll disrupt communications and power distribution all over the globe were going to measure the intensity of the particles as they follow earths magnetic lines so far north the activity should be particularly intense isnt there some big religious meeting on a cruise ship coming up this way to take advantage of the aurora borealis ira asked the universal convocation erwin answered at once the routes a secret but i heard theyre going to circle iceland from the north if they want inspiration from above theyre going to get it mercer wasnt really listening to their conversation he was thinking about what koenig had told him and decided to do nothing with the information he had enough to do without worrying about georesearchs internal squabbles now that he knew what to look for he could see an undercurrent of tension between greta and werner it was actually more a unidirectional thing greta seemed secure in her position it was werner who was uncomfortable mercer felt bad for him imagining what it must be like to work with a former lover especially since it appeared koenig had yet to get over her he finally took a sip of the brennivin and nearly choked this stuffs like drinking gravel as he spoke he adjusted his tag heuer back an hour to put it on greenland time im going to call it a night we should recheck our equipment before we reach ammassalik during a severe winter pack ice extended all the way from greenland to iceland a distance of about three hundred miles this ice wasnt the cause of the north atlantics famous icebergs those calved from glaciers on greenlands west coast rather the pack ice was a frozen surface accumulation that reached only a few yards in thickness it melted as it broke up and offered little hazard to navigation during summer the difficulty reaching greenland came from the fact that the deepwater fjords that ring the island like a necklace were ice choked until early july and refroze again in late september the threemonth window is the only time that ships can call on the few settlements on the eastern coast as the njoerd nosed her way toward the ammassalik fjord thin ice still layered much of the water which was dotted with huge bergs held immobile like white islands the ship rammed her way through none of the expedition members were allowed on the bridge during icebreaking operations so the best view was from the forward windows in the wardroom when mercer arrived the next morning he found himself alone except for the cooks preparing breakfast in the galley he poured a cup of coffee from the continuously refilled urn and took a seat in moments he realized that the ice was too thin and rotten to make an impression on the njoerd even at a slower speed she knifed through the pack without check if it werent for the scrape of ice against her hull plates and the occasional slab that showed above her bows before being thrust aside he wouldnt have known they had reached the pack morning ira lasko called as he entered the wardroom he went to the coffee urn before joining mercer looks like you need to shave ira ran a hand around the circle of stubble on his otherwise bald head and chuckled im thinking about letting it grow in hows the show icebreakings more dramatic on television if wed tried this even a month ago we wouldnt have made it anywhere near ammassalik how do people live up here most of the fifty thousand people on greenland are native inuits while theyve become dependent on denmark for a lot of their supplies i think theyd be fine if the danes left em alone too i was reading a guidebook on the flight from the states that said greenlands inuits can understand the native languages spoken in alaska theyre separated by a quarter of the world and fifteen hundred years of isolation and the languages are still recognizable remarkable when you consider that we need dictionaries to help us understand the subtleties of shakespeare and hes only been dead for five hundred years have you listened to a teenager recently i can barely understand them and its only been a single generation they laughed and lasko added speaking of teenagers i ran into marty in the hallway next to the bathroom last night and he reeked of perfume looks like hes going to have some fun even if he doesnt want to be here the dining room filled slowly as others came awake and went in search of coffee and food marty was one of the last to come to breakfast and all through the meal he kept glancing over at a young german girl who was georesearchs assistant camp cook when their eyes met the brunette would blush and look away demurely get enough sleep marty ira teased bishop looked wolfish no and i dont think ill get much tonight either after breakfast the society team went back to their cabins for their parkas and then met on the deck a steady wind blew across the ship carrying with it the clean smell of ice and sea the temperature was thirtyfive degrees but the sun was warm as they checked over their gear layers of clothes were stripped away while they were working werner koenig approached to talk about the potential dangers they could face on the ice and warn them about not allowing themselves to sweat if youre away from the camp and your clothes become sweaty your body heat will leach away so fast youll be dead before you know it that goes especially for your boots well be wearing moon boots on the ice and they heat up fast and take forever to dry out if your boots get wet from your feet sweating get out of them immediately or youre going to get frostbite it takes less time than you think so just get back to the camp and change he moved on to give the same advice to igor bulgarins team most of the loose equipment had been stored in the four snocats or their towed trailers the machines were big boxy vehicles resembling tracked moving vans painted red with a decal for georesearch affixed to their front doors their tracks were heavily notched like a bulldozers and extended beyond the cabins to give them a wide footprint that distributed their weight better over soft snow two of the trailers were basically boxes standing ten feet tall and about twentyfive feet long they were painted a matching shade of red and mounted on springcushioned skis the other two trailers were open and held sections of prefabricated walls for the basecamp buildings there were also a few preloaded pallets of gear fuel drums floors and roofs for the buildings the societys chemical heat and crates of food that would be carried directly to camp decade by the rotorstat why the hell dont they lug all this stuff right to the site with the blimp ira complained as he rooted through a trailer looking for lengths of hose for their pump cost and insurance marty said the rotorstat is still experimental and its owners arent willing to use it to lift equipment from a ship at sea liability issues if something goes wrong i imagine that means we have to be tied up to a pier and i guess its only rated to carry one snocat and trailer at a time fully loaded these rigs weigh about thirty tons georesearch wasnt willing to pay for that many trips from ammassalik to the base camp so they decided to drive the cats overland and have the rotorstat make only a couple of runs with the fuel and the other heavy stuff its a pain in the ass but saved about fifty grand and since were paying for the right to join their expedition he added the burden of driving the cats to camp decade falls on us georesearch is sending a few of their people with us arent they mercer asked yeah in case something goes wrong hey look at that ira had a digital camera to his eye what is it land ho he shouted handing the nikon to marty when it was his turn mercer could see a sheer rock peak smeared with snow and ice that rose from above the sea fog like a lonely sentinel it was one of the thousands of islands that dotted greenlands jagged glaciercarved coast to the others it was an uninspiring sight but mercer couldnt help but be intrigued the rock was certainly granite some of the toughest stone in the world and yet it had been ground smooth over hundreds of millions of years the tremendous pressure of greenlands ice sheet was a force that even the earth itself could not stop thats kulusuk island a crewman called from the bridge wing high over the deck kulusuk has an airstrip that was left over from the dew line station on the north part of the island ira lasko said the old distant early warning radar facility was dismantled years ago and the airport was turned over to the locals its only about an hour and a half flight from reykjavik i think were pretty close to ammassalik an hour later the njoerd was surrounded by towering ramparts of stone as she entered tasiilaq bay here the mountains were as sharp as glass black silhouettes that cut into the clear sky she wasnt the first ship of the season into the bay because a wide channel had been carved through the pack ice leading toward the town of ammassalik as they threaded their way deeper into the bay they passed more bergs twisted sculptures of ice that were as beautiful as fairy castles the newer bergs were blindingly white while those that had floated in the bay for a few seasons were shaded the pale blue of a natural gas flame the town of ammassalik appeared off the port side the first thing they saw was a wall of garbage sloping from the towns dump into the sea behind it was a tremendous trash fire not an encouraging sight erwin puhl said most everyone was at the ships rail watching the approach the natives were used to throwing garbage outside their huts igor said mostly bones that dogs ate after the danes moved them here and introduce western packaging they still do same thing not knowing metal cans and plastic wrappers dont disappear after one winter town used to look like junkyard is better this way past a clutch of huge fuel tanks a small inlet cut into the land and on the other side lay ammassaliks concrete pier backed by a large warehouse the inlet was full of ice chunks and tired fishing boats at its head a stream of melt water tumbled under a bridge and poured into the bay the town itself flanked the inlet rising above the waters on steep hills that were dappled with snow the houses were wood framed and colorful as if to make up for the monochrome blandness of the surroundings next to most of the homes stood rickety drying racks covered with fish and chunks of seal it was a forlorn and isolated place that sixteen hundred inuit and a handful of danish administrators called home coming in to the dock the ships air horns gave a long mournful blast that was answered by a chorus of sled dog cries welcome to greenland everyone werner koenig called happily greta schmidt was at his side her blond hair shimmering like white gold first part of our journey is finished the captain informed me that the rotorstat should be here in about thirty minutes so step number two can commence is everyone ready the surveyors societys all set marty answered equipments been checked and resecured werner looked to igor how about it da is all good excellent ive been asked to have everyone leave the ship or stay in the wardroom until the snocats and land cruiser have been carried up to the ice sheet ive posted a manifest in the wardroom so youll know which cat is yours for the trek to camp decade since the rotorstat is still considered experimental shes not allowed to carry passengers well use helicopters to get us to the ice mercer unzipped the nylon shell he wore and plucked a pair of brandnew polarized sunglasses from an inside pocket i cant wait to see this he said to no one in particular both ira lasko and marty bishop gave him a smile his excitement about the rotorstat was infectious the airship arrived on schedule announcing its approach with a deep droning sound that echoed off the bay for ten minutes before it floated into view there was a defiant serenity to the mammoth dirigible as if it was immune to the laws of gravity unlike the squashedlooking goodyear blimps the rotorstat was torpedo shaped but flattened along her top and bottom at over four hundred feet long she was also twice the length of a blimp her bow was shaped like a sharks snout and her tail had a long taper that supported four cruciform fins because of her partial internal skeleton the four streamlined engine pods were mounted along her flank so that noise and vibration wouldnt disturb those in the twentypassenger gondola slung under her nose the carbonfiber skin was white which made her look like a cloud she was so new exhaust had yet to darken the sections behind the engines it was an unworldly sight and mercer felt himself grinning as her shadow crept along the bay like an advancing ink stain jesus ira exclaimed thats something you dont see every day mores the shame mercer said the expedition members joined a growing throng of awestruck locals on the pier when the rotorstat came to a hover above the njoerd her engine pods transitioning from forward flight to stations keeping with the pods tilted skyward her massive props beat the air like a helicopters but until she took on a cargo load her million cubic feet of helium kept her aloft the rotorstat maintained enough altitude so the mooring rope dangling from her nose would not interfere with the heavy steel cables that were lowered from the cargo bay amidships deckhands on the research ship quickly secured the four cables to the skid placed under the first snocat and trailer coordinating their efforts with the airships pilot via walkietalkie when the signal was given the throb of the rotorstats engines deepened as her twentyfivefoot blades took greater bites out of the air the slack in the lines vanished and the cables vibrated with the strain of the thirtyton load as gently as a mother raising a child from a crib the airship lifted the tracked vehicle from the deck a gasp went up from the crowd and the expedition members cheered the rotorstat continued to climb vertically the snocat was too big to be drawn fully into her hold so it continued to hang about twenty feet below the dirigible she pivoted in place pointing her nose westward toward the main bulk of greenland in unison the engine pods tilted forward giving the great ship some forward momentum while still providing lift it was then that mercer realized her hull was shaped like an airfoil that would provide supplemental lift at speed vastly improving her fuel efficiency to the west a wall of mountains three thousand feet tall separated ammassalik island from the greenland massif the rotorstat steered for a notch in the mountains gaining altitude and speed with each passing moment in ten minutes she was lost from view theyll be back for the second snocat in less than an hour werner told them the top of the hann glacier is our staging area on the mainland its only about twenty miles away provided nothing goes wrong marty said that puts everything in place at seven tonight bit late to start out dont you think ive already considered that well sleep on the njoerd tonight and head out tomorrow at dawn the small advance team leaving from reykjavik will arrive a day ahead of us which gives them more than enough time to set up the first building we will use until everything else is constructed once the base is habitable youll send for the rest of your scientists mercer asked werner nodded itll take about two days to put together our buildings and stow the provisions and then your obligation to us is completed and you can begin to unearth camp decade and dr bulgarin and his people can begin their own research the rotorstat returned to ammassalik for the last time at pm having made its first of two runs to camp decade two hundred miles north of the town the floors and roofs of the base buildings were too bulky for the snocats and had to be flown up the last trip was to haul food the hotrocks and the fuel then the airship would head back to europe it would return in september when the entire base was to be dismantled by order of the danish government mercer was on deck when the airship faded into the twilight hed been watching a white smear of light clinging to the distant mountains he knew instinctively that it was the reflection of the setting sun on the vast ice sheet he felt a deep pull in his chest and was more relaxed than hed been in a long time when he was prospecting in the field mercer was always the expedition leader and he was forced to deal with the hundreds of details that cropped up on a daily basis it wasnt an ego issue he actually preferred to fade into the background but when a mining company was paying him thousands of dollars a day sitting back wasnt an option they expected results on this trip it was refreshing not to have that kind of responsibility mercer wouldnt have to deal with the burden of command that fell on werner koenig who seemed more than qualified to handle any emergencies and marty bishop who was starting to show interest mercer took a deep breath feeling the burn of icy air in his lungs it was so clean it left his head spinning for an instant this was one of those moments of pure happiness a precious and rare feeling that he savored with each moment it lasted he laughed aloud as the glow of reflected light faded to blue and then vanished altogether hann glacier greenland standing atop one of the snocats so his view wouldnt be interrupted mercer swept the vista with a pair of binoculars except maybe on the ocean he couldnt imagine a place with a more distant horizon the line between ice and sky was as straight as a laser beam it was only to the east toward the coast twenty miles away that the line blurred just slightly as the massive glacier began its threethousandfoot plummet to the sea to the west lay square miles of frozen nothingness now that the alpha air jetranger had shuttled the last of the team to the glacier and flown back to the heliport at ammassalik an eerie silence descended over the clutch of vehicles the occasional muttered word sounded as out of place and blasphemous as a curse in a cathedral the wind was a constant whisper not even strong enough to stir snow off the ground but the temperature was ten degrees below freezing mercer kept his hands gloved and the hood of his nylon shell pulled tightly over his head beneath it was his leather jacket a sweatshirt and two tshirts over his long underwear and jeans he wore nylon overpants and insulated hiking boots since theyd be driving for the next twenty hours or so he didnt need the heavier arctic gear packed in his luggage including the pair of padded moon boots ira lasko was at the back of the snocat making sure their groundpenetrating radar sled was secured for the rough overland trek what was that line about the moon magnificent desolation something like that mercer lowered the binoculars ive been on a few glaciers in alaska but nothing like this there was awe in his voice the variety and beauty of the earths geography never failed to amaze him they say if the ice covering greenland were to melt sea levels around the world would rise about twentyfive feet youre forgetting that the weight of this much ice has actually sunk the interior of greenland about a thousand feet below sea level the oceans would rise twenty feet and this place would become the basin for the largest freshwater lake in the world last time i trade trivia with a geologist ira muttered goodnaturedly laughing mercer scrambled down the ladder bolted to the back of the snocat anytime you want you can stump me about submarines tall marker flags had been attached to the lifting pallets so when the snocats returned to be retrieved by the rotorstat they could be found under the new snowfall certain to bury them werner koenig also got a fix from a handheld gps and wrote the satellitederived coordinates into a notebook he carried in his parka were ready to go lets saddle up marty bellowed and gave a cavalrymans closedfist gesture the toyota land cruiser would drive point since it was the most maneuverable and fuelefficient vehicle in the convoy georesearch had hired a former european rally racing champion named dieter to drive it werner greta and igor bulgarin who had the most experience on the ice out of anyone on the expedition would ride with him their job was to scout for the easiest routes when the ground became too broken the surveyors society team was assigned to the first snocat and each member would take turns driving it the vehicles controls were nearly the same as any truck with the exception of the steering wheel to change directions the cats had levers that activated brakes on the tracks as team leader marty took the first turn in the drivers seat with ira next to him mercer sat on the large bench seat behind them the rear portion of the cat was accessible from the cabin but was packed to the roof with personal gear and the radar sled get the goddamned heater cranked ira complained im freezing already the turbodiesel fired on the first turn of the key surging for an instant before settling into a powerful growl a white jet of exhaust burst from the back of the toyota over the sound of their own vehicle they could hear the other three cats come to life dieter gave the suv a burst of gas and her bulbous underinflated tires dug into the snow marty jammed the snocat into first gear and they began crawling forward keeping to the tire tracks left in the land cruisers wake he worked the levers to test the snocats steering response its like driving a tank because of the loads each cat towed their speed was limited to fifteen miles per hour the ride in the cabin was smooth if monotonous after the first hour everyone but mercer had lost his sense of wonder like a frozen sahara ice stretched flat and featureless in every direction broken only rarely by humps of yet more ice the sun made the landscape dazzle like a world of diamond chips without their dark glasses the reflection would have blinded them all strung out like elephants in a circus parade the four snocats doggedly followed the trail laid down by the toyota with the weather clear it was easy to keep to the track but as the morning wore on the wind picked up and a whiteout developed with a suddenness that startled them all one moment everything was normal and an instant later the visibility dropped to zero as a swirling maelstrom of ice particles and snow whipped around the cabin the storm screaming over their heads was strong enough to rock the massive vehicle jesus is this normal marty shouted louder than necessary ira chuckled according to igor this is nothing the radio under the dash crackled to life how are you doing back there werner was checking on his people igor says this should die out in a minute or two or it will go on for a few days ira plucked the microphone from its bracket were hoping for the first option a new voice came on the radio this is erwin im in the last snocat and the winds already dying down well be ready to go in just a minute the wind dropped just as abruptly as it had risen but in its wake the men were subdued this had been just a taste of the arctics fury after a lunch of military mres ira took over the driving the terrain became more fractured jarring ridges of ice and snow that the cat hit with kidneypunishing regularity their speed dropped to ten miles per hour two hours later werner koenigs voice came over the radio this is a call to all snocats i just got word from the njoerd they have reached a position off the coast close enough to camp decade for them to launch the helicopter carrying the advance team and the materials to construct our first home on the ice if we reach the base tonight we will have a more comfortable place to sleep than these snocats ira grabbed the radio from mercer then lets get the lead out marty just took his boots off and i dont think we can stay in the cat tonight without gas masks at six they took a vote to stop for dinner or suffer through tepid mres again werner estimated that they were forty miles from the base and if they stopped theyd be forced to spend the night in the vehicles grumbling but unanimous they decided it was meals ready to eat one more time mercer took the snocats drivers seat and marty pushed himself into a cramped position between the front seats so he could talk with ira and him the suns fading light caused the ice to glow as twilight crept over the caravan the skys soft pastels of purple and rose were mirrored by the landscape cut only by black shadows cast by frigid hummocks it was clear enough to see a stars reflection like the night before it remained light long after the sun had vanished the western horizon was lit as if it hid a vast city below its rim when the halfmoon rose its iceborn twin doubled its illumination perhaps a half mile away the beams of the toyota headlights cast two funnels of light on the ice it was reassuring yet illustrated their total isolation the vehicle was the only puddle of light on the ice a tiny beacon in a land where man was an unwanted interloper iras earlier reference to moonscape was uncannily accurate the thermometer on the dash showed the outside temperature was degrees celsius or about zero degrees fahrenheit gps says were about ten miles from the camp werner announced an hour later but as you can tell the ground is pretty broken again the range of mountains and hills below the ice sheet had distorted the terrain so the vehicles were continuously ascending or descending icy upthrusts the ride was more even than the earlier fractured zone but still their progress was slowed dieter needed a few attempts to find the best gaps between the ridges and the snocats were forced to stop when the toyota scouted for level passes each pause seemed to take longer than the last with the base so close everyones frustration mounted and yet werners prompts kept them focused and alert mercer was just reaching for the microphone to suggest that they should stop for the night when igors voice filled the snocat on other side of this last ice wall is base camp we just saw it we are coming back for you now hot meal and warm bed in fifteen minutes like a wraith the land cruiser came out of the swirling snow ice dust caught in the corona of its lights dancing on the wind dieter who had to be exhausted from nineteen hours of driving executed a uturn when mercer flashed his headlights the last dash to the camp was surreal mercer was tired and should have turned over the driving to marty he had to fight to keep himself alert the falling snow mesmerized him drawing his attention to individual flakes with alarming frequency he squeezed his eyes closed shaking his head to clear it you gonna make it ira asked mercer shot him a crooked grin if i dont you dont the first camp building erected by georesearchs advance team stood alone constructed in sections of insulated plastic it had been snapped together like a childs toy once they all got to work in the morning this building would be the mess hallcommunications shack for tonight it was their communal bunkhouse around the building were pallets for the four tenperson dormitories two roomtemperature laboratories and two ambient labs used to store and study ice cores the disassembled icecoring drill tower was in one of the trailers i just hope werners a deep sleeper mercer told ira why because when we get inside im having a drink and i dont want to hear him complain well join you marty said ive got bourbon and ira brought a bottle of scotch dawn broke crisp and clear after a breakfast of powdered eggs and coffee werner koenig handed out work assignments and the crew set themselves to building their camp while the georesearch team all sported matching black snowsuits with their companys name and their own stitched in gold over their hearts igors people and the societys group wore a mishmash of arctic gear some of it army surplus and some of it storebought the only thing they all shared in common was the heavy moon boots they were cumbersome but with so much fresh snow on the ground they were also necessary after running the snocats over a wide area to compress the snow the floors of the buildings were laid out in a rough circle with the mess hall at its center then the cat hauling the wall sections made a circuit of the camp and the numbered pieces were dropped at each base it was a matter of standing the walls onto the insulated floor and locking them with a special tool provided by the manufacturer roofs were placed with a crane mounted on one of the snocats in all the whole process took three hours per building the early energy that sustained the crew waned as the frigid air sapped their strength and yet they slogged on by five in the afternoon the last cold lab was finished they ate in silence that night after loading two of the dormitories with their personal gear the following day was spent storing all the provisions and stocking the laboratories the work was easier than the previous days and the temperature had risen above freezing the steadily drifting snow turned into a constant drizzle that soaked anyone outside in a matter of moments the compacted snow became ice as flat and slick as a hockey rink mercers suggestion to use a snocat to corrugate the crust with its tracks was met with remarkable success at dinner werner thanked everyone for their work praising each one by name for their contribution he said that georesearch would finish the last few chores in the morning freeing up the others to begin their work the scientists would arrive by a skiequipped cargo plane in the afternoon and he asked igor and marty for a list of any additional equipment that they felt they needed so it could be put aboard oh igor i have a communication for you from dr klein he handed a piece of paper to the russian igor read it and grunted looks like bad news mercer said stacking the dishes on the table for ingrid the cooks assistant that marty had bedded aboard the njoerd to pick up da she wont make tomorrows flight here she must wait two days for the first helicopter resupply what happened to her anyway i dont know some accident is all i was told i dont blame her for wanting to miss the construction party marty bishop said with a tired sigh i do not think she is shy of work igor defended i have not met her but her application to join my team was impressive she has climbed the tallest mountains on four continents including the vinson massif antarcticas highest point and almost made it to the top of everest she works as a trauma doctor in munichs largest hospital and has published several papers on survivors stress when i contacted her references all gave her highest marks sounds impressive to me ira said igor grinned she also sent picture with her application you want impressive wait until you see her he bunched his fingers and kissed them away like an italian beautiful the sled weighed nearly two hundred pounds and had been designed to be towed by a vehicle when they started their search the third morning they tried using the land cruiser but the uneven terrain made it too difficult to control it fell on the men to push the groundpenetrating radar unit an exhausting task since their search grid was on a long slope the uphill legs left the men panting and dangerously overheated all were thankful that the area wasnt larger than it was because camp decade had been secured to an underice mountain it had remained stable as the glacier flowed around it the surveyors society had requested georesearch establish their new base within a quarter mile of where camp decade lay hidden on the fourth pass with the sled they found a corner of the base a discovery met with cheers but they knew that was only part of the battle now they had to map the entire facility and locate the main entrance where they would sink their shaft camp decade was laid out like a huge letter h one long leg contained storage areas and a cavernous garage that once had a ramp to the surface the other leg was designated for crew accommodations and laboratories with the bulk of the administration area connecting the two segments there were countless side chambers attached to the complex as well as a long tunnel running from the garage that led to the small nuclear reactor that had powered the facility the air force had assured the surveyors society that there had never been a single incidence of radiation leakage and the reactor had been one of the few things removed when the camp was abandoned as mercer watched the monitor attached to the radar set reveal dark shadows thirtyfive feet below them he kept a surreptitious eye on the geiger counter he had borrowed in iceland the unit was an old victoreen model cdv a that he had cajoled from thorsteinn jonsson the director of reykjaviks small geology museum he hadnt seen jonsson since the volcanologist had hosted the conference that first brought mercer to iceland years earlier and jonsson had been reluctant to lend out his only counter until mercer gave him a hundreddollar rental fee the photograph of cancerravaged stefansson rosmunder was too compelling for mercer to trust the air forces assurances before first light hed gotten up and walked the entire area sweeping the ice with the geiger counter the machine hadnt uttered more than a few clicks which indicated normal background radiation there was one spot presumably over where the reactor had once been buried that sped up the counter but the levels were far below anything dangerous he didnt tell the others what he had done nor did he reveal the counter as they worked now hed seen people panic at just the presence of one of these little machines to the uninformed the slow clicks of ambient radiation sounded as dangerous as the tail shake of a rattlesnake he kept the counter in a pack hanging from the side of the sled and wore the earphones that thorsteinn had given him since he was the only person who knew how to operate the radar unit no one questioned the extra equipment if hed found something he would have told them immediately but after completing half of this slower sweep he felt that the military had told the truth about the site there was no hazardous radiation anywhere near camp decade at noon mercer downloaded the raw data they had accumulated onto a laptop computer that would create a digital version of the base because of the thick ice the resolution was poor and the images were grainy and blurred but there was still enough detail for him to pick out individual features the radar had penetrated through the roof of camp decade so the pictures resembled an x ray inside the facility he could see wall partitions and even furniture it was eerie because he was the first person to see inside the camp in fifty years he was also very relieved while the facility was anchored to bedrock and protected from glacial pressure by a peak of rock on its upflow side he had harbored the fear that the entire place had been ground to debris by the shifting ice the radar scans showed it had had little problem weathering the past five decades all right lets wrap this up for now mercer said shutting off the radar and checking the computer and gps system that was part of the sledge well compare this data with the original drawings done by the engineers who built this place even without the additional georesearch scientists the mess hall was crowded for lunch and they had to wait until afterward to clear enough room on one of the tables to spread out their findings the original drawings had been scanned into the computer so mercer brought up the shadowy images recorded this morning and overlaid them with the neat architectural sketches instantly they had the orientation of the base locked down and saw they had only mapped a third of the sprawling complex still it was enough for them to extrapolate the location of the main entrance and determine its gps coordinates mercer pointed to the spot on the computer screen x marks the spot you sure do you think i want to dig two holes out there with your permission marty we can start tunneling through the snow to reach the base thats what were here for bishop replied why dont you go out and mark the area over the entrance ira you go get the snocat with the crane and plow attachments and haul over the plastic sleeves and hotrocks ill tell werner that we need one of his people for a while that sounds like a plan mercer agreed how goes your search igor bulgarin had appeared with erwin puhl at his side both men had just entered the mess hall and were covered in snow oh god ira made his face into a frightened mask its the yeti roaring with laughter the russian placed a huge arm on the much shorter puhl and this is my yetette weve already located the entrance igor were going to start digging right now so quickly bulgarin sobered you americans i dont know how you do it i take it youre not having any luck finding meteorites he laughed again is success if i find one or two this trip hows koenigs group coming mercer asked all morning they work to mount the drill tower on one of the trailers to make it potable portable erwin corrected beverages are potable this coffee isnt da portable is not going well i think he frowned germans are supposed to be good engineers these people bah like children with legos how about you erwin mercer asked whats the weather forecast that i cant tell you puhl removed his coat but dont expect the satellite phones or radios to have the best range for a while atmospheric interference the scientist nodded and its just beginning in another four or five days we can forget about contacting the njoerd except for a few periods of calm when the solar wind dies down erwin thinks some communications satellites in orbit are going to be kaput because of radiation igor added marty stood then lets bust a hump i want to be able to call my father and tell him weve reached the base before this gets worse it took a few minutes to sort out their coats and boots zip up properly and secure the velcro straps around their gloves it wasnt cold enough to need face guards but each man leaving or entering the mess hall had all but a bit of his eyes exposed from under hoods and neck gaiters mercer put on his glacier glasses and threw open the door then leaned into the wind that lifted a dense fog of snow waisthigh guide ropes had been strung between the buildings he noted to help people during whiteouts it was not unheard of for someone to become lost during a storm and die just a few yards from camp after staking where he wanted to drive the shaft mercer studied the snowfield while he waited for the others judging the angle of the hill and testing snow in his hands he realized they could use the cats plow to drag away much of the accumulation on the wind he could hear his longdead grandfather a quarry foreman from barre vermont never do work yourself that a machine can do for you mercer smiled at the memory scraping away much of the surface snow would save them days of backbreaking labor to reach the firn line where they could employ the hotrocks when ira and marty arrived with bernhardt hoffmann a young georesearch worker mercer told them what he wanted to do by taking thin bites out of the snow they began digging a trench over the entrance removing about half a foot of grainy ice with each pass to keep the slopes gentle the trench grew to over two hundred yards long like a tractor plowing the same part of a field the cat dug deeper and deeper until the walls of ice flanking the excavation were taller than the vehicles roof mercer stopped the work and used a shovel to dig into the walls testing their strength while he was more familiar with soils and rock he was confident that the trench was stable enough to continue for another few vertical feet he would use some of their stiff sheeting to line the trench for added support before boring with the chemicals at one point that afternoon an old douglas dc cargo plane fitted with skis lumbered over the camp low enough to make mercer duck unconsciously as he stood on the lip of the trench the aircraft banked away sunlight sparking off its windows before returning upwind it lined up with the makeshift landing strip werner koenigs people had packed down with the other snocats the plane was at least sixty years old and yet roared flawlessly flaps down nose pitched high and dragons breaths of snow billowing up in the wake of her radial engines her skids hissed against the snow and the pilot had to fight to keep the plane centered as she slowed it was like a scene in an old movie mercer thought as he watched her pivot for her taxi run back to the camp the engines remained at idle as the rear door was thrown open and people began jumping to the ground they wore the matching georesearch snowsuits they unloaded supplies from the plane with an economy of movement more befitting a welltrained army than a group of scientists a mound of crates and boxes was stacked on the ice before the door was closed and the plane raced back to the runway even as she lifted into the air two snocats trundled to the waiting people and the cargo was loaded into the trailers in all the plane was on the ground for less than ten minutes they may not be able to fix their drill rig but they sure can unload an airplane ira said standing at mercers shoulder i guess he replied looks like we get fresh vegetables for dinner and maybe our first mail call expecting good news from home mercer didnt answer something bothered him about what he had just watched something he couldnt name before he could pull together the thought another roar shook the site he caught movement out of the corner of his eye and turned the mountains that separated the camp from the coast were fifteen or twenty miles away and yet the air was so clear he could see an avalanche on the flank of one peak begin to build in momentum a white wave of ice and snow tearing through a narrow valley like a solid wind look at that marty had a telephoto lens on his video camera the avalanche continued to accelerate in undeniable violence as it careened through the valley its bulk slaloming with each twist in the topography in seconds it reached the bottom of the mountain and fanned out onto the snowfield slowing finally as it expended its gravitational force a cloud of powder remained suspended above the area is that normal bishop asked last night i asked erwin about avalanches ira said he said hed be surprised if we saw any global warming has altered the environment up here he said theres less snowfall than ever and fewer and smaller icebergs aerial surveys of the mountains north of us show patches of rock that havent been exposed for hundreds even thousands of years at six marty called a halt for the day the trench was fifteen feet deep and the pressure of snow had compacted the material at the bottom enough for mercer to begin melting operations the next morning with the addition of the georesearch scientists there wasnt enough room in the mess for everyone so dinner was served in two shifts halfway through the meal greta schmidt approached the table a bundle of papers in her hand mercer had seen very little of her since the njoerd and when they did bump into each other he found her demeanor hadnt improved since that first confrontation at the hotel borg hed also noted that many of the georesearch people deferred to her more than werner her relationship with whoever had bought the research company from koenig had given her a great deal of power the plane carried mail this is what came for you she dropped the letters and envelopes on the table keeping one in her hand also a letter with an american postmark came but i do not recognize the name on the envelope mercers guts slid he knew it was for him and who sent it whats the name she checked the address max e padd ducking his head as the others laughed mercer held up his hand for the thick envelope sent to him by harry white schmidt sensed she had been made fun of and strode away quickly whos it from ira asked a friend of mine is forwarding my mail mercer noted his name was written in tiny script under the boldfaced max e padd for years ive tried to convince him hes not funny when he tipped the large envelope onto the table a cascade of junk mail fell like confetti there were credit card solicitations sweepstakes entries catalogs from companies mercer had never even heard of and five parking tickets issued since hed left washington in the packet harry had also included his own bills as well as a strongly worded past due notice for the rent on his apartment a few blocks form mercers house at the bottom of the pile was a handwritten note chuckling as he read it mercer tried to decide what if anything was teasing and hoped to god it was the postscript dear mercer sorry i didnt know what was important so i sent along everything youve gotten so far i was rushed when i did this so some of my bills might have gotten mixed up with your stuff if you dont mind go ahead and pay them and ill pay you back trust me also you ran out of jack daniels again so i forged a check at the liquor store you do have four hundred dollars in your account dont you by the way i wouldnt have gotten those tickets if you had a handicap sticker for your jag something to consider dont let your balls freeze off harry ps tiny said hed pay to have the scratch buffed out of your car it was late the next afternoon when they reached the entrance to camp decade the hotrocks had worked flawlessly and the single pump theyd brought to the ice was more than capable of drying out the fivefootdiameter shaft as it filled with meltwater the most timeconsuming part of the dig was sleeving the hole with plastic to prevent caveins mercer and bern hoffmann spent most of the time at the bottom of the shaft wearing rubber boots that allowed the cold to leach into their legs but protected them from the water ira and marty kept up the supply of hotrocks and made sure the pump was fueled mercer had worked it so the shaft dropped about a foot in front of the entrance to camp decade that way the ice wall would act as a barrier to keep meltwater from flooding the facility through the distortion of twelve inches of ice he could see the corrugated metal siding of the entrance and make out that there was a crude sign nailed to the door were just about set he shouted up the vertical tube i want to lay one more load of hotrocks down her to give us a sump below the level of the base our body heat is going to melt some of the ice and we could have a flooding problem okay marty replied ive got another drum in the sling its on its way down mercer looked up water dripping from above fell like rain the heavygauge plastic that lined the shaft held back the ice but the joints werent watertight drops pinged methodically off his hard hat making him feel like he was at the bottom of a wishing well above the shafts lip the snocat with the crane was backed right up to the hole and a fortyfourgallon drum hung from its unspooling cable reaching upward with a gloved hand he grasped the bottom edge of the drum as it came into range guiding it down those last few feet okay marty weve got it they had done this so many times now their actions were almost habitual while bern cracked open the lid mercer positioned the pump hose into an intentionally deeper part of the shaft meant to collect the last of the water the young german was a quick study at spreading the blue granular chemicals they had to work quickly for no sooner did the first handfuls land on the ice than they began to melt their way into the floor in moments the entire sump was covered in blue water percolating upward and draining down into the hole the chemicals smelled like fertilizer as they mixed with water the pump was at full power and quickly drew the melt to the surface mercer expected that the mixture had produced a foul blue stain at the pumps discharge outlet only fifteen minutes passed before the pump began sucking drafts of air another six inches of ice had vanished up the hose well i guess were ready mercer took a drink of gatorade from a large thermos because there was virtually no humidity on the ice sheet dehydration was one more constant threat he cupped his hands to his mouth to shout up at marty theyd already decided to have some walkietalkies brought in on the chopper flight carrying anika klein send down the chain saw were set to open her up why dont you come up and let me open the base martys voice echoed back i need bern to hold my video camera though for my fathers tape lower the bucket mercer would have loved the honor to be the first one in camp decade but it was right that marty had the privilege his father had been stationed here and he was paying the bills snow blew in a constant sheet in the narrow ribbon of sky above the trench howling just above the snocat yet when mercer got out of the empty barrel they used as an elevator the cut protected him from the shrieking fury ira handed him a silver flask still warm from where it had rested against his body mercer took a pull of the scotch gasping at its smooth burn good job down there ira said thanks mercer took one more snort before returning the liquor to ira marty should be able to use the chain saw to cut through the ice in ten fifteen minutes the whine of the saw was amplified as it reverberated up the shaft sending shivers down mercers spine as its blade chewed into the ice it was worse than a dentists drill when the chain saw finally cut off ira hollered down can you open the door yeah just a second im recording the sign on it whats it say mercer asked camp decade united states air force below it some joker handpainted give up hope all ye who enter here once we get the outer door open you guys can come on down just say the word mercer could hear marty talking below him and guessed he was saying something he had prepared for the video some words for his father a minute later he heard a screech of protest a sound of metal tearing against metal were in marty whooped its a vestibule of some kind theres another set of doors about ten feet in front of us the walls all look good just a little buckling how about the floors theyre a little uneven and theres ice in places but they look good none of the wood has rotted can we come down ira demanded yeah berns on his way back up dont forget the flashlights once bern hoffmann reached the surface mercer used the cranes remote controls to lower himself and ira back down the pipe light spilling down the shaft barely reached the vestibules far doors so they each turned on the fourcell maglites coat pegs lined both walls of the passage and below them grates had been placed to help melted snow drain off boots this had been a staging area for the crew before venturing onto the glacier a sign on the wall warned the men to make sure their socks were dry before stepping outside beyond the far door would be the camp proper go ahead marty ira prompted his breath clouding in front of his mouth lets do it just a second bishop faced his crew his minicam shut off you know its funny i didnt want to come here at all i thought my dad was being a pain in the ass for asking me but now that were here about to enter the base im really glad i did this his voice was thick with emotion i want to thank all of you for doing this with me ira i know youre getting paid for this but youve already done more than your share and mercer he said with a smile without you wed still be on the surface trying to dig our way down here with snow shovels the second door opened as if it had been oiled just the day before their flashlights cut puny slashes through the gloom marty had a powerful lamp attached to his camera but there was still more shadow than light the thin crust of ice on the floor was frozen condensation the icy legacy of the men who had breathed here all those decades ago it was so silent they could hear every footfall they made each of them was subdued by what they were doing and their chills were not entirely caused by the freezing temperature it was eerie inside the base everything felt muted as though it was happening at a slower pace than reality time had forgotten camp decade and yet they half expected to hear voices or see someone approach from the shadows and demand to know what they were doing here it was a place for ghosts beyond the entrance lay a short hall that branched at a tjuncture the camps entrance had been in the center of the administration area to the left would be the garage storage and reactor room to the right would be the dorms and laboratories without the need to take a vote the party turned right the walls were painted plywood backed with a layer of insulation and corrugated metal in the few places where they had been torn by ice piles of snow had accumulated on the floor there were also a few areas where the roof had given way slightly allowing ice and snow to form solid mounds that nearly blocked the hallway many of the blockages were small and could be easily stepped over but one nearly choked the entire hallway forcing the men to clamber over on their bellies they stopped at each of the doors they came across and flashed their lights around the offices they found time warp ira commented once the air force had left a lot of equipment behind like old manual typewriters a mechanical mimeograph machine and furniture that dated to world war ii my dad told me it was cheaper for them to leave this stuff here than fly it back to the states all they took was their personal effects the reactor and the five snocats kept in the garage marty clarified youre sure about the reactor ira asked half joking of course mercer said sarcastically this is the government were talking about they reached the juncture that bisected one leg of the base turning left marty led the trio toward the dormitories there were eight of them on each side of a central hallway each was an identical room about thirty feet by thirty feet with rows of matching bunk beds the soldiers who were stationed here had taken their footlockers but there were still a great many personal articles left behind near a few of the beds were pinups of women who today would be considered plump and whose bathing suits showed less skin than the average cocktail dress the men passed through a mess hall and another space that had been the enlisted mens rec room which included several pool tables and card tables beyond the rec room the door at the end of the hallway ended in a tiled bathroom large enough to provide for the needs of a few hundred men the officers must have been stationed in another part of the base ira stated the obvious thats right marty said chiding himself with a shake of his head we passed a door where we turned onto this corridor thats where they had their quarters my father lived in room twelve mentally mercer adjusted his map of the base where the center of the letter h met the right leg there would be an additional line extending outward backtracking marty rushed to the first juncture check it out he pointed to the sign on a door they had passed but ignored officers only he led them down the corridor reading numbers off the doors on each side as he went mercer lagged behind he understood that marty wanted to see the room his father had occupied but it went against his instinct to rush headlong he continuously trained his light on the ceiling and walls to make sure they were solid and took a moment to peer into any of the open rooms they came across the officers rooms were luxurious compared to the enlisted mens dorms but still they were small each had a single bed a desk and a freestanding closet as marty paused in front of room twelve to address the camera for posterity mercer craned his head into room ten and froze this looks exactly the way my father described he heard marty tell ira lasko pushing open the door with his shoulder and centering his light on the bed mercer turned to the two men does that include this corpse the body of a darkhaired man lay on top of the bed clothed in a leather jacket he had been freezedried like a mummy my god who is it mercer studied the body for a moment longer noting the embroidered wings on the furtrimmed jacket gentlemen meet major jack delaney the pilot of a c that crashed three months before camp decade was closed hamburg germany sweat pouring down his face klaus raeder leapt back as a callused fist brushed past his jaw missing him by a fraction of an inch he pivoted raised one leg and fired a counterkick that his opponent swept aside gracefully continuing with his spin raeder let the first leg drop cocked the other and landed a bare foot into the midsection of his adversary the man doubled over his breathing so ragged that for a moment raeder feared hed caused injury he dropped his guard wiping his hands on the baggy pants of his martial arts gi his opponent saw the momentary lapse and instantly exploded from his position swinging his arms and feet in a flurry of blows raeder was forced to retreat in the face of such an onslaught blocking shots by pure instinct for they were coming too fast to actually see instinct told him he was nearing the mirrored wall of the dojo when the next punch came at his face he captured the fist in his crossed wrists torqued his body so his adversary was pushed off balance and rammed his knee upward lifting his sparring partner from his feet he had been too close to defeat to care about injuries now he executed a perfect throw tossing the other mans twohundredpound frame with ease rolling with the throw he came up on his knees grabbed a handful of the supine opponents gi and prepared to punch his teeth through the back of his head give gunther rath croaked raeders eyes were glazed with bloodlust his mind empty of everything but absolute victory he was so close to administering the killer blow that he had to jerk himself away pounding a palm against the padded carpet to vent a portion of his raw aggression just as quickly as the berserker fury washed over him it faded he stood and extended a hand to his specialprojects director a triumphant smile splitting his handsome face for a second there i thought you had me for a second i did rath replied an injury to his throat during his years as a professional judo instructor had left his voice box severely damaged each word rasped as if spoken over sandpaper his tortured voice oftbroken nose and large build combined to make rath appear menacing a man others intentionally avoided people also thought him slowwitted because of his bulk but he had a street cunning that klaus raeder had identified early in their relationship he had found rath in east germany during a particularly difficult corporate takeover in raeder was trying to buy a factory that made industrial hotwater boilers but a nascent union movement would not agree to terms putting the deal in jeopardy the delay caused raeders purchase price to spiral to the point where the purchase no longer made economic sense yet he would not give up never one to let legality interfere with his plans raeder went in search of a specific type of problem solver a few discreet inquiries led him to gunther rath a former olympic medal winner in judo working as an enforcer for an underworld leader when they met the first time raeder saw a potential in rath that went far beyond the petty intimidation hed been using the lawless scramble following the demise of communism opened unprecedented opportunities if one had the vision and the will raeder had little difficulty imagining the profits to be wrung from east germany and he saw that gunther rath with his shadowy contacts could help provide the means raeder made him an offer break the union and he could have a permanent position in raeders company rath had never considered his particular skills could be used in the legitimate world so he jumped at the chance to escape his current situation it was an opportunity for a new beginning and an escape from the mistakes that had tumbled him from the olympic podium to the streets the labor problem came to a quick end following an arson attack against the labor leaders house that nearly wiped out his family during his years in the east klaus raeder relied on rath to be his blunt instrument of corporate coercion however by the time klaus raeder came to the attention of kohl ag the two had tempered their tactics since their reputation alone was enough to intimidate while reinhardt wurmbach kohls legal counsel questioned raths suitability in such a prestigious firm raeder would not have accepted the presidency if rath werent brought in as his specialprojects director after a few moments of rest the two squared off again gunther rath had begun teaching raeder martial arts early in their partnership raeder excelled very quickly becoming his teachers equal in the past few years hed actually become better than rath something he delighted in proving the two had sparred thousands of times and yet their workouts had never become stale because each had such drive it was a contest of ego and desire as much as skill before the first punch was thrown a buzzing phone interrupted them raeder bowed to rath and turned away the dojo was in the basement of raeders blankesene district villa a hundredyearold home the size of a castle in hamburgs best neighborhood raeder had purchased the house soon after joining kohl renovating the musty wine cellar into a modern gymnasium the mirrored room was ringed with exercise equipment and benches of free weights the phone was on a table near the stairs leading to the ground floor raeder herr raeder its ernst neuhaus the head of georesearchs support office in reykjavik sounded agitated yes what is it raeder looked at a wall clock noting it wasnt yet six in the morning it would be five in iceland and another hour earlier in greenland sir weve had communications problems from greenland otherwise you would have been informed last night what happened raeders stomach tightened neuhaus was being obsequious never a good sign the americans have already opened camp decade and they discovered a body thats been frozen there for many years whose he snapped dreading what he was about to hear the news if it was what he feared would instantly nullify his carefully laid plans it appears to be the body of an american air force pilot thank christ raeder sagged had the corpse been of one of the others kohl ag would have been destroyed in hours gunther rath approached his superior when he saw the fleeting look of panic on his face raeder waved a hand to indicate that everything was all right he was a survivor of the cargo plane crash in thats what they think yes neuhaus answered quickly the americans speculate that he survived out on the ice by living in the plane and eating provisions meant for thule air force base some discussed the possibility that he also ate his crewmates as well has anyone done a detailed analysis of the body raeder didnt honestly believe that anyone could have survived the accident in the pandora cavern and ten years of isolation but he had to make certain not yet neuhaus said the corpse is still in camp decade the americans want to contact their air force about how to proceed no raeder shouted that cant be allowed to happen there are already too many people at the site the us air force will want to send in a full forensic team as well as soldiers to escort the body home he paused thinking furiously the surveyors society group must be prevented from contacting the outside use the communications problems as an excuse that wont be much of a stretch neuhaus said the solarmax phenomenon has made the satellite phones at the base worthless and the radio works only sporadically good make sure they remain isolated no one is to use the radio other than our people that was one problem solved at least temporarily i still want that body examined that may pose a risk none of our people have a legitimate excuse to inspect it tell them to do it in secret irritation strained raeders voice neuhaus should have seen such a simple solution i dont want an autopsy performed just a quick examination to confirm that the man is really who the americans believe because of the compartmentalization of this project men at neuhauss level did not know who else could have infiltrated the longabandoned base raeder couldnt afford to say whose body he initially feared had been discovered without compromising security just pass on my orders yes sir neuhaus paused ah herr raeder there is one more thing what we learned the identity of the woman mercer spoke to here in reykjavik raeder heard his employee snap open a piece of paper elisebet rosmunder who is she her son was involved with the failed search for the c back in the s rosmunder herself is more than eighty years old are you having her watched yes sir as far as we can tell her routine hasnt changed since that meeting shes had no visitors nor has she gone to meet anyone do you want us to tap her phone raeder considered for a moment he doubted her interest in greenland went beyond the plane crash but what of mercers interest in her with no link between the crashed cargo plane and pandora the mining engineer was looking up a blind alley no you dont need to tap her phone maintain a loose surveillance for a few days and if she does nothing suspicious let it drop i believe shes a dead end that reminds me of something ernst the last member of the expedition is due to arrive at the base tonight right anika klein arrives tomorrow morning neuhaus corrected okay im sending gunther rath to greenland the day after that i dont know how big our search window will be so i want to get working as quickly as possible thank werner for me on the excellent job hes done setting up the base it went better than any of us predicted tell him that as soon as rath arrives he will be taking over command of the operation once raths there well find some pretense to evacuate all nongeoresearch people from the base yes herr raeder neuhaus learned who mercer met with gunther rath asked as soon as raeder hung up the phone a nobody named elisebet rosmunder her son was part of the search for the missing c considering whats at stake is it wise to leave her alive raeder couldnt believe hed heard correctly jesus gunther why the hell would you ask that this whole operation was designed so no one gets hurt and you casually suggest we kill an innocent woman what are you thinking rath gave no physical reaction to the quick rebuke klaus this operation goes beyond what weve ever done before we are more in my old world than your new one we need to go to extraordinary lengths to protect ourselves you may have convinced kohls board that removing evidence from the pandora cavern is just a business decision but we know thats bullshit saving the company a ton of money doesnt negate the immorality of your plan immorality is a far cry from coldblooded murder raeder countered no matter how much money we save kohl i would never condone such an act shes a loose thread in this situation she could prove to be dangerous to us havent i taught you anything gunther early on your tactics were what we required to get what we want but those days are long past despite what you think our plan to clear out the pandora cavern is a business decision pure and simple we are not going to resort to violence theres no need for it raeder saw that rath still looked unconvinced yet said nothing he had conditioned rath for unquestioning loyalty and wondered why his orders were now being questioned his answer came quickly i cant go to greenland until early next week rath said the partys holding an executive committee meeting in essen sunday night i have to attend the corners of raeders mouth turned downward in annoyance gunther rath had made tremendous progress shedding his criminal image he favored savile row suits dined at fine restaurants and had even given up his proclivity for prostitutes to settle down with one woman yet all of raeders efforts to make him give up his most dangerous trait interest in the nazi party had failed for as long as theyd known each other rath had been an active member of the fascist organization and worked tirelessly for the cause just recently hed been promoted to an executive committee near the very top of the neonazi movement raths belief in fascism had its roots in his youth his father had been a sergeant in the eisatzstab reichsleiter rosenberg the professional looter squads charged with plundering europes jews during the war it was estimated that this littleknown organization stole billion from holland alone and their total for all of europe approached billion in inflationadjusted dollars fully one fifth of the worlds recognized western art had passed through nazi hands during their systematic pillage unrepentant for what hed been a part of raths father had raised his son to believe that what the nazis had done had been fully within their right beginning in his teens gunther rath had strived to restore the fascist nightmare that once dominated the continent in a bizarre twist of irony klaus raeder knew from the nowburned corporate records that the gold kohl ag had used in the pandora project had come from a plunder squad similar to the err that followed behind the advancing german army in the soviet union you were away for a meeting early this week raeder admonished what could have changed in the past few days to necessitate another gathering that was an actioncouncil meeting rath said stiffly raeder shook his head slowly his eyes filled with patronizing amusement action council executive committee you sound like a bloated group of leftwing rebels ive never heard of an organization that meets more and does less had this come from any other man gunther rath would have mauled him but he respected his employer too much he also had to agree in part the neonazi party spent more time quibbling among themselves than taking their message to the streets still it was difficult to hold his tongue or his fists harassing turkish immigrants and salting green party rallies with your thugs is good for a few headlines raeder continued to mock but at this pace itll take you a thousand years just to build your reich for christs sake gunther give it up fascism will never come back people wont give up freedoms like that again theyre too comfortable today to be impressed with fiery oratory and flagwaving spectacles besides nazism was a personality cult not a real political movement that was the mistake rath challenged hitler made it a personality cult and when he could no longer sustain the cause it collapsed the cause collapsed because american bombers pounded our cities into rubble which allied tanks then overran raeders tone became conciliatory i have failed to teach you that capitalism is a preferred method of governing to national socialism i suppose i can live with that but until you obtain your dream you live in my world and will operate by my rules right now i need you in greenland if the pandora cavern is discovered before we empty it the horror of what your beloved party did sixty years ago will play on every television on the planet with that many bodies down there antinazi public opinion is going to soar to an alltime high you wouldnt be able to rally enough people to hold a game of solitaire raeder climbed the stairs to the master suite on the third floor of his villa the fury rath had directed at him was not lost on the industrialist in the marble shower with its multiple water jets raeder wondered if his old friend was the right person for this particular job raths loyalties divided between raeder and the nazi party had the same goal in this particular instance but rath was acting as though his interest and thus his tactics lay with the party proof being his suggestion to kill elisebet rosmunder the corporate rath never would have made such a proposal stepping from the shower raeder realized that gunther had never questioned one of his orders he was thinking like a nazi thug and raeder worried that once his specialprojects director reached greenland he would become even more defiant when this operation was over he hoped rath would again return to normal but for as long as it took to erase part of kohls nazi past raeder would have to keep a tight rein if he wanted to avoid bloodshed georesearch station greenland mercer was sitting on his bed going over the computer maps from their survey when the dormitorys main door crashed open though his room was at the far end of the structure he felt a noticeable temperature drop mercer mercer marty bishop shouted are you in here back here mercer called thank god igors dead stunned by those words mercers guts gave a hollow slide igor dead injury or even death wasnt unheard of in the dangerous world of polar exploration but igor bulgarin he was the most experienced person in the camp somehow mercer was not surprised it was the big russian coming on the heels of their discovery of major delaney yesterday and mercers findings this morning he knew something was very wrong with this entire expedition it being igor who died seemed like the appropriate third link in a chain of bizarre events quickly before his thoughts became clouded mercer set aside his personal feelings of loss and suspicion there would be time for that later his relaxing dontneedtobeincharge vacation was over martys coming to him in such an obvious panic meant that the leadership of the surveyors society team was about to shift to him mercer didnt hesitate he owed it to igor and he owed it to the surveyors society he was on his feet and zipping up his coat by the time bishop appeared at his bedroom door what happened his voice crackled with the authority hed intentionally hidden from the others marty paused looking mercer in the eye for an instant he resisted answering knowing that he was supposed to be in charge and should be demanding explanations yet he had rushed here pushed by instinct to report their discovery to the man who was the natural leader of the group he could not sustain mercers steady gaze and rather than resentment his voice was filled with gratitude when we went into camp decade this morning bern hoffmann and i found there had been a cavein overnight part of the roof collapsed in the main corridor right beyond the area that was already partially blocked by snow remember where we had to crawl to get to the barracks and officers quarters mercer nodded just past there about ten feet of the hallway was filled floor to ceiling with ice and snow we were using shovels to clear away the mess when we found igor at the bottom of the pile he must have been right under the avalanche when the ceiling let go he was frozen solid show me outside the sun was hidden by clouds so thick there were no shadows the wind was a raw force that knifed its way through the few gaps in mercers arctic clothing he drew his hood tighter and refastened the velcro at his sleeves to prevent the icy air from reaching inside his gloves he snapped a lead from the safety line to his coat and began trudging across the snow toward camp decades entrance it was impossible to hold a conversation in these conditions so marty walked silently in his footprints mercers mind raced with speculation because igor had the room next to his mercer had heard him leaving the dormitory in the middle of the night assuming he was headed for a latenight snack or possibly a romantic encounter mercer had quickly fallen back asleep when he awoke igor wasnt in his room and mercer guessed hed already gone to the mess for breakfast he put the incident out of his mind working instead on a problem hed discovered with their subsurface radar survey now the russian meteorite hunter was dead killed by an avalanche that shouldnt have happened in a section of the camp he had no right to be in mercer couldnt shake the feeling that had he questioned igor last night bulgarin wouldnt be dead this morning there were a great many deaths on mercers conscience mostly trapped miners hed been unable to rescue but there were others too soldiers refugees friends and even without knowing the full truth yet he added igor bulgarin to the list behind him marty shouted for him to slow down but mercer ignored him lengthening his stride in a futile race to reach the snocat poised above the tunnel a race igor had already lost mercer didnt pause before climbing into the waiting bucket and lowering himself into the ice marty would have to recall the makeshift elevator when he reached the cat he leapt from the bucket as soon as it touched bottom his boots splashing through accumulated meltwater hold on marty called down from the rim of the shaft start the topside pump mercer shouted savagely theres too much water down here you should have done it first thing this morning when he reached the second set of doors he heard the low thrum of a portable generator running somewhere in the maze of the complex mercer cursed under his breath fury sparking behind his slate eyes he checked his watch and calculated that marty and bern had been working down here for a few hours at the first intersection he turned right and saw the glow from several portable spotlights rigged to the ceiling farther down the corridor the sound of a small generator grew with each step toward the light so did the reek of exhaust the young german didnt hear mercer approach he was at the far side of the generator shoveling chunks of ice and compacted snow into an empty office mercer grabbed up a flashlight left on the floor next to the portable generator and flicked off the gasolinepowered engine the floodlights dimmed to orange before failing completely the beam from mercers flashlight was nearly swallowed by the darkness whos there who shut off the generator hoffmann peered into the flashlight mercer fought to keep his anger in check get the hell out of here right now this drive is fouled with carbon monoxide unconsciously mercer switched to the vernacular of hardrock mining where a tunnel was called a drive didnt mr bishop tell you igors dead and you will be too if you dont get out of here mercer grabbed bern by his collar heaving him to his feet where he swayed for a moment pressing his gloved hand against a wall to hold himself steady whoa he slammed his eyes as a blinding headache raged inside his skull your lungs are full of gas didnt you smell it ja but i thought wed be okay bern could barely stand so mercer continued to drag him by his jacket maneuvering him toward the exit in the spill of light coming from the surface his face was gray and his eyes weeped the fresh cold air made him cough in fits so powerful that he vomited marty mercer yelled up the shaft wheres ira during breakfast greta asked him to help fix the engine on one of the snocats that explained why these two had been so stupid ira lasko would have known not to run a generator inside the base because carbon monoxide was heavier than air the gas had pooled where the men were working and had been slowly suffocating them in a sense mercer saw that igor bulgarin had saved their lives had marty not gone to get him he and hoffmann would have been asphyxiated as they attacked the blockage and their corpses would have been found next to the russians go get him and tell him we need to rig wiring into the base for lights then come down here and give me a hand wrestling the generator back topside marty didnt argue bringing the honda generator into the tunnel had been his idea listening to the georesearchers racking coughs he knew what a deadly mistake that had been mercer turned to reenter the facility clamping a hand on berns shoulder just stay here and keep taking deep breaths to clear your lungs in a few minutes martyll give you a hand getting back to your dormitory the floor of the hallway was covered in water melted from the snow that had broken into the base he didnt know how many btus the little generator pumped out but it was more than enough to cause a pretty good flood once they had the sump in the main shaft drained he wanted a hose snaked in here to get rid of this water too it would refreeze soon and make working conditions dangerous he moved slowly as he neared the cavein stepping over the silenced generator and the shovels and other tools brought down to clear the passage in the sharp beam from the light he could see the gaps in the roof where the relentless pressure of snow had broken through the structure it was logical that this would be the area that let go part of the ceiling had already collapsed in the years since the camp had been abandoned and yet he couldnt think why it had failed at the very instant igor bulgarin walked underneath it the odds were too long he studied the twisted metal and jagged teeth of torn plywood wondering if igor had done something to the roof to precipitate the failure that made no sense either and what was bulgarin doing down here in the first place he trained the flashlight on the body igor lay facedown on the floor wearing his blue parka with the hood pulled down the lower half of his body was still buried under the ceilinghigh snow although marty and bern had removed much of the snow around him mercer could see where blood had stained the ice near the back of his head he knelt to examine the spot it looked like a large slab of ice had hit him at the base of his skull he could see a thin but deep depression in the bone under his matted hair depending on the force it could have easily been a killing stroke mercer had seen enough head wounds to know how much they bled and there wasnt enough blood to make him believe that igor had survived the blow the first impact had most likely killed him instantly he hadnt suffered for that mercer was thankful he could easily imagine igors agony if hed slowly frozen to death in the dark hey are you all right ira lasko had approached silently only announcing his presence after mercer stood and brushed off his gloves yeah he answered how are marty and bern martys lungs cleared when he went to get you but berns back in his room sicker than a dog hell be fine in a few hours iras expression soured its my fault i never should have let them come down here alone marty doesnt have the common sense of a boy scout he said you were fixing one of the snocats greta grabbed me at breakfast said they needed help with a clogged fuel injector dieter and a guy named fritz are still working on it what happened here hanging wall let go mercer used a mining term for the roof then he swept the flashlight to show where the ceiling had collapsed igor was right underneath it when the snow came pouring in it looks like a chunk of ice caught him in the head he didnt have a chance this place has been pretty secure for fifty years what could have caused it we did mercer answered come again we caused it the climate down here had been stable until we entered the base by us moving around and the heat we gave off by working and breathing yesterday its likely that the ice above this area shifted just enough to rip through the roof so igor was in the wrong place at the wrong time yes what was he doing down here in the middle of the night i heard him leave his room and i think it was more like early morning than late night mercer corrected but i didnt know he was coming down here nor do i know why he could have come down anytime he wanted with one of us ira remarked like mercer hed seen too much death to be rattled doesnt make sense mercer agreed absently noticing that igor bulgarins arms were stretched out in front of him as though hed been walking with his hands touching the ceiling he wondered if that was an important detail and decided it probably wasnt the body mercer looked at ira understanding what he was asking its possible he wanted to check it out but why would igor be interested in a dead pilot and why come down here secretly booze that was my first thought mercer said sadly he didnt like to think the worst of bulgarin maybe he didnt want anyone to know hed fallen off the wagon so he came here to get drunk he bent to pat down the body but couldnt feel the distinctive shape of a bottle could be he stashed it someplace when he decided to leave lot of ground to cover to prove it mercer flashed the light down the tunnel to make certain marty hadnt returned yet he felt that ira with his experience on submarines could handle what he was about to say but he wasnt sure about marty he spoke in a low voice weve got another problem too its not important why but i brought a geiger counter with me from iceland he paused waiting for a reaction ira made a gesture with his hand for mercer to continue mercer was correct about the former navy man nothing got to him when we were using the radar sled i also made a radioactivity map of the facility none of the radiation i detected was dangerous it was mostly ambient background noise but there was an area that spiked a bit i assumed it was where the old reactor had sat on another hunch this morning i compared the radar sled readings to those from the geiger counter and found that the spike occurred over the room with the pilots body nowhere near the old reactor site that got a reaction the bodys hot call it warm yeah mercer nodded just enough to tickle the counter now but back when he died he would have been glowing like a neon sign ira knew that radioactive contamination didnt cause a person to physically glow but he understood what he was saying he looked at mercer skeptically youve got some pretty accurate hunches mercer shrugged and told him about elisebet rosmunder and her sons search for the downed c and his subsequent death from cancer i guess you could call it more of a warning than a hunch he concluded if there was something that radioactive on the plane the government wouldnt have stopped until it was found ira said after giving the problem a moment of thought there was quite a flap when the air force lost a couple of nukes from a bomber off the coast of spain in and again when an armed b crashed over in thule in i remember for that one they hauled off nearly a million cubic feet of ice snow and debris no the air force would have moved heaven and earth to locate that plane and clean up any spill mercer regarded lasko for a minute you could be right i dont know but the evidence suggests that the c was carrying radioactive material that leaked when the plane crashed poisoning jack delaney and later killing stefansson rosmunder so what do we do ira asked finish unburying igor and bring his body to one of the cold laboratories and then try to contact the air force again maybe the communications are back up what about delaney ira turned hearing someone approaching down the corridor it was marty well keep that to ourselves mercer said quickly the bodys not hazardous to handle but until we hear from the military he should be off limits agreed ira said out the corner of his mouth before addressing bishop bern okay he took some aspirin and is asleep right now marty bishop looked ravaged by guilt his eyes were dull and he spoke as if each word caused him pain mercer ah listen i ah it was my idea to bring the generator down here this whole thing wouldnt have happened if i had talked to you or ira first i nearly got us killed youre right mercer said mildly not letting marty flinch from his responsibility it was a stupid thing to do and you two were lucky this hallway is probably still full of fumes so for the next twentyfour hours i want the entire facility offlimits mercer caught iras eye making sure he would agree with the lie the base would be safe in just a few hours thats a good idea lasko agreed that should give us the time we need to notify the air force too okay marty said i think im going to lie down for a while myself i feel like shit go on ahead well take care of igor two hours later igor bulgarins body had been placed in one of the cold laboratories mercer and ira had also wandered through camp decade looking for evidence that the russian had gone there for a drinking binge other than some old bottles hidden fifty years ago in the enormous garage they found nothing neither man was surprised there were tens of thousands of square feet of rooms and passages and closets where igor could have hidden an empty liquor bottle giving up they used a length of chain and a padlock from the snocat to secure the bases main doors no one would be able to enter camp decade without them knowing it mercer and ira met up with erwin puhl in the mess hall the german scientist was still in shock over igors death he sat in an almost catatonic state his eyes unfocused and unblinking he hadnt even bothered removing his parka or gloves a cup of coffee in front of him had gone cold the only words hed spoken were my brother it was obvious that he and igor were a lot closer than anyone thought he seemed inconsolable greta schmidt was at the back of the hall speaking with some of her people after an appropriate amount of time had passed she approached the table dr puhl erwin looked up into her blue eyes the juxtaposition of her vibrant beauty and his desolation was unsettling i just learned how long you and dr bulgarin have known each other it is a terrible thing to lose a friend i am very sorry for you erwin said nothing but continued to stare at her his lower lip quivered she placed a hand on his shoulder as soon as we reestablish communications with the njoerd ill have a helicopter sent to remove his body and make arrangements to have him flown back to moscow st petersburg erwin said softly he was from st petersburg yes of course how could i have forgotten she glanced at ira and then her gaze settled on mercer is it safe for your people to be working in camp decade it will be mercer replied this was the first sign of any tenderness hed seen from her and it was surprising ive closed it for twentyfour hours to let the gas fumes dissipate and to let the avalanche that struck igor settle tomorrow well go back in and shore up the ceiling where glacier movement has weakened it werner and i have already discussed calling the surveyors society and asking them to cancel your expedition in light of dr bulgarins death we feel the base may be too dangerous the gentleness shed just shown erwin had vanished there was a challenge in her voice mercer responded in kind that will be up to marty bishops father and charles bryce you cant order us to leave i can dr mercer and if it becomes necessary i will she executed a militarystyle snap turn and stormed away talk about beauty and the bitch ira mumbled it might be best if we did leave erwin said igors death his voice trailed off not even when brunhild there tells me to ira snarled nodding as greta retook her seat at the other end of the mess hall i dont like to leave a job unfinished neither do i mercer agreed but im beginning to wonder what our mission really is he spent the remainder of the day with his geiger counter traversing the snow piled on top of camp decade to get a more accurate fix of any radiation readings mercer didnt expect to find anything new but he needed the hours of solitude he tried to put what had happened in some sort of perspective and found there wasnt any igor was dead and no amount of thought would change that fact he could only hope that when he discovered why the russian had gone to camp decade he would be able to dispel his misguided feelings of responsibility every few hours mercer returned to the mess hall to inquire about the communications problems each time he was told that they had only received broken transmissions from the njoerd and absolutely nothing from the office in iceland the technicians doubted that their own signals were getting out and all agreed that the problem would persist for a few days at least it was at dinner that the first clear call came through mercer and the rest of his team were trying to keep erwins mind occupied by playing lazy games of poker over stale coffee when the shortwave transceiver in the corner of the room burst to life even through the squawking distortion of static everyone could hear the hysteria in the voice ayday mayday georesearch base camp eore rch camp is inbound helo from njoerd i am ixty kilometers east turbine is ailing we are oing down the comm officer scrambled to get his headphones on around him a dozen people clustered shoulder to shoulder inbound helo this is base camp we understand you are sixty kilometers east of our location and are declaring an emergency ank god the pilot of the helicopter screamed through the ether storm approaching tried to beat it engine o heat i cant keep us in the mercer pulled werner koenig away from the group of anxious listeners so his voice wouldnt disturb the radio operator the georesearch supervisor was shaken by what he was hearing not wanting to add to werners distress mercer spoke calmly reassuringly you still have snocats out there right yeah koenig couldnt tear his eyes away from the radio his concentration on the drama that was unfolding too quickly for him to comprehend there are two teams on the ice where when werner didnt answer immediately mercer grabbed his arm allowing his voice to rise slightly where ah team one is coming in from the south he looked at his watch they should be here in another twenty minutes and the other team werner suddenly understood why mercer was asking about the cats he sounded miserable because the answer was one he did not want to give theyre due west of us maybe fifty kilometers away damn it any chance of a successful rescue depended on each second mercer could gain wheres your rally driver dieter hes with team two what are you going to do thinking furiously mercers brain shifted back to the pilots strident call titude down to one thousand feet dr klein says smoke air vents that did it his moment of hesitancy evaporated there was a passenger on board the pilot had made the choice to fly through a storm but anika klein was different she was simply along for the ride deep down he knew he would have gone even if the pilot had been alone ira get on the other radio and keep me updated ill be in the land cruiser mercer was at the door before anyone realized hed moved he didnt bother with the moon boots his sneakers would have to do he thrust his arms into a lightweight outer jacket that was the topmost coat on the rack near the exit dr mercer greta schmidt shouted running toward him i forbid you to go we will organize a proper search and when youre done you can follow me he snapped jerking the zipper to his throat ira you with me the wiry mechanic had already muscled his way to the shortrange set they used to coordinate communications with the snocats move your ass no you will wait greta grabbed mercers sleeve in a fierce grip that felt like it went all the way to the bone this is a wasted gesture wait until we know where they land going alone is suicide mercer had just a second before two more georesearch workers joined her though he had never struck a woman he was sorely tempted to break that rule why couldnt she see that the only chance the pilot and anika klein had was if someone left now he yanked free and reached the door the pressure of wind slammed it open when he turned the handle the wind was a solid force that made him stagger back until he got better traction hunched his shoulders and bulled his way forward the blowing snow and gathering dusk swallowed him despite her fury greta made no move to follow she slammed the door closed again her body shivering with just that brief contact with the frigid gusts she stepped over to ira her expression one of illdisguised contempt that was the most stupid thing i have ever seen no need to tell me ira said with a smirk but at least hes doing something get your damned search party ready and follow him a few minutes later mercer came over the radio ira you there nice and snug he drawled how about you im going to need the jaws of life just to get my testicles to drop according to the thermometer in the cab its fifteen degrees below zero out here any word from the chopper theyre still in the air and still heading this way pilot said the gps puts him twentyone miles due east hows your speed im pushing it now doing twenty take it easy out there i dont think gretas gonna stop for you if you get stuck shell never see me mercer replied with a graveyard chuckle visibilitys pure shit i cant see more than fifty feet in front of me how do you expect to find a crashed helicopter ira asked alarmed tell the pilot to have dr klein fire a flare just before they crash he didnt need to add that neither would likely be in any condition to do it afterward roger good idea ira was shouting into the microphone because mercers transmission kept fading his radio had much less power than the choppers im telling the comm officer to relay your message now it took two minutes for the pilot to acknowledge the request but even if they were able to do it ira had doubts that mercer would see the flare the helicopter was down to three hundred feet and mercer was still between five and ten miles away ira kept his misgivings to himself mercer the pilot will comply he estimates he can hold her aloft for another five minutes he heard nothing but static mercer do you copy over there was a small window above the radio sets it was dark but with the floodlights on he could see how the wind raced first in one direction and then another the captured snow and ice looked like it was caught in a tornado ira estimated the gusts at forty miles per hour he prayed mercer brought back the pilot so he could kill the stupid son of a bitch for daring to fly in this kind of weather no resupply mission was worth it mercer do you copy over the comm officer was listening hard to his own earphones talking with the pilot in easy tones despite the fear they all heard from the speaker ifty feet iring flare now it was a cruel twist of atmospherics that the last seconds of broadcast from the helicopter came in so crisply that it sounded like the pilot was in the room with them his scream was piercing enough to shatter crystal mercer choppers down choppers down they fired the flare did you see it ira mashed the earphones to his head mercer are you receiving over nothing he tried again every thirty seconds for the next half hour and the results were always the same mercer was gone rotterdam holland amid the rusting tankers bulk carriers and container ships the sea empress gleamed like a new rolls royce parked in a junkyard her upperworks were snowy white trimmed with black and gold with twin raked funnels topped by aerodynamic wings not much smaller than those on a private jet she was longer than most of the ships around her and her eightstory superstructure towered above every vessel in the busy port designed as a catamaran her two hulls were nearly a thousand feet in length and each had a ninetyfoot beam the cavernous gap between them was used to lower any number of watercraft from twohundredpassenger lighters to glassbottomed excursion boats to jet skis she could comfortably accommodate four thousand passengers as well as her fulltime staff of three thousand her list of world records for a cruise liner included everything from number of restaurants thirtynine to casino square footage to having a fourhole pitchandputt golf course her cost too was a world record likely to hold for years billion despite the ascetic beliefs of many of those who would be sailing on her few could help but be awed by the sight of her snugged against a concrete pier the sea empress was a high expression of the beauty mankind was capable of creating because of the tight security surrounding the universal convocation the quay was quiet except for the guards posted all along the length of the ship harbor patrol boats buzzed along her starboard side and overhead military helicopters kept the roving media choppers at a safe distance so far there hadnt been a single credible threat against the ship or her passengers but with so much world attention focused on the greatest religious meeting in history the authorities were taking no chances after lengthy interrogations her crew had been sequestered aboard for the past week and she was searched daily with bombsniffing dogs getting the ship ready and secure had been a massive operation and now that the passengers were embarking those in charge of security had redoubled their vigilance each passenger from the pope down to the lowliest secretary was escorted through unobtrusive metal detectors calibrated to allow nothing bulkier than religious medals to pass through the latest generation of chemicalsniffing devices was also used to detect the most minute amount of gunpowder even if someone sneaked a ceramic pistol past the metal detectors traces of gunpowder from the bullets would be picked up on these machines it had been agreed earlier that only the popes swiss guard would be allowed to carry weapons on the sea empress there had been some difficulty with the thirty sikhs attending the convocation since their tradition demanded each carry a small knife at all times the pope had gladly given them permission to maintain the practice neils vanderhoff was a guard at a manifest checkpoint assigned to verify each of the lesserknown passengers against a master list authenticating their identity with a computer database of photographs compiled from six different sources the pictures dated back at least a year before the convocations announcement to prevent terrorists from using carefully built false legends to slip aboard in front of him now was a tall middleaged man wearing a shiny suit that cost more money than vanderhoff made in three months his face was deeply tanned and smooth and he had the whitest teeth the dutchman had ever seen he sported a diamondencrusted rolex and an elaborate ruby pinky ring while his hair was thinning and silver at the sides on top it was as dense and jet black as a sables pelt neils wondered why the man spent so much on his wardrobe teeth bleaching and jewelry yet wore such an obvious toupee clutching his elbow was a sight vanderhoff would never forget the mans wife might have been pretty once but her fight against time had been a long bloody campaign that had left the battlefield in ruins she wasnt that much younger than her husband but her face had been so frequently lifted that it was as tight as the head on a snare drum she looked like a poorly cast wax model of herself behind black false lashes her eyes bulged from one too many tucks her makeup was as overvibrant as that applied to a corpse by a colorblind mortician above her eyes were thick slashes of blue and yellow her cheeks were so rouged they looked sunburned and her collagenpuffed lips had been troweled over with layers of frost white her big hair was brass blond and piled six inches high she had maintained her figure or possibly had it maintained for her but still her hips and backside strained against a skirt sized for a woman fifteen pounds lighter her breasts were silicone fantasies that threatened to spill over the top of her lame blouse in her arms was a nervous pekingese that yapped continuously the woman made no move to quiet her rodentsize dog she popped a piece of chewing gum as her husband passed over their passports tommy joe and lorna farquar from nashville tennessee usa as if neils couldnt tell they were americans he stared at the caricatures slackjawed i know what youre thinking son tommy joes enormous teeth flashed like a mirror pointed at the sun and he spoke as if addressing a crowd of ten thousand youve seen my ministry on television and you cant believe youve gotten a chance to meet me honey they dont carry our show in europe cause they dont talk american here lorna farquar had a littlegirl voice with an adults ignorance do they pookie they havent been saved yet no they havent the pekingeses whine was deeper than its mistresss sure they do lorna its on satellite feed dont you remember im sure i dont she simpered her eyelashes tangling like fighting spiders when she blinked up at him neils vanderhoff shook off his amused incredulity and typed their names into his workstation instantly a series of pictures appeared on the screen mostly publicity shots of the couple at a blue satin altar adorned with the words miracles of jesus christian ministries he noted wryly that mrs farquars bosom had been noticeably smaller last year craning her head to see what the customs man had chuckled at lorna wailed oh sweet jesus those pictures are from before i had my titties done there there dear tommy joe patted her hand vanderhoff checked to see the most recent entry stamps on their passports as per his orders he was on the lookout for any suspicious travel since the convocation had been announced the farquars passports had numerous stamps to caribbean islands but nothing in the past six months he handed them back without a word praying they would move on without braying at him again the next person in line was a large man traveling alone and by the dark robes he wore heavy silver cross hanging from a chain around his neck and his full beard neils recognized him as a member of the eastern orthodox church the priest must have heard the exchange so vanderhoff gave him a conspiratorial smile the blackrobed figure didnt change his stony expression he handed over a russian passport feeling rebuffed the customs agent noted that father anatoly vatutin had been in germany before coming to holland for the convocation he punched up the name comparing the fierceeyed cleric in front of him to photographs taken a few years earlier at an eastern rites meeting in istanbul vatutin had more gray in his beard and hair now but time had not softened his hawkish features giving back the passport vanderhoff felt a chill when the intense priest nodded in acknowledgment anatoly vatutin slid his passport back into his battered shoulder bag and hurried along the corridor before reaching the exit he passed the obnoxious television minister who had stopped so his trashy wife could let her dog lift its leg against a wall a dark puddle formed on the carpet and the woman scooped up the pekingese before its feet became soiled the thought that these people worshipped the same god he did made vatutin wince unlike many who had preceded him father vatutin did not pause when he got his first look at the luxury liner he paid scant attention to the guards either head down and cheap shoes clomping he moved across the pier toward one of four embarkation points his expression one of anxious determination the sun soaking into his black clothes was only partially responsible for the sweat that caught in his beard and trickled down his flanks he presented his ticket to a uniformed woman at the top of the gangway not returning the cheery greeting you are in cabin e father vatutin the assistant cruise director said in passable russian thats on the starboard hull go straight into the ship and when you reach the first atrium youll see a broad hallway to your right thats the champs elysees one of four main throughways connecting the two hulls when you reach the atrium on the other hull another attendant will direct you to the elevator bank closest to your cabin spesiva vatutin grunted clutching at his shoulder bag as if afraid the bubbly attendant would take it he moved quickly through the ship pausing for a flicker of a second to gaze upward when he reached the lofty glasscrowned atrium that was the centerpiece of each side of the vessel the balconies ringing the upper floors dripped with flowering plants reminding vatutin of an artists rendition of the hanging gardens of babylon he found the long corridor called champs elysees then threaded through clusters of people conversing in excited bursts he noted that the men outnumbered the women by a factor of fifty at the next atrium he again presented his ticket and was directed to an elevator bank near the stern of the vessel where he took one of the cars downward to the lowest of passenger decks while his spartan cabin had a small porthole it presented a shadowy view of the channel between the hulls the cabin pulsed with the vibration of the sea empresss engines he paid no attention to the view or the vibration his heavy antique wooden chest had already been delivered and sat in the middle of the tiny room taking up so much space that vatutin had to tuck his legs under the bed to face it he checked the lock carefully relieved to see that it hadnt been tampered with he had no idea what kind of scrutiny the luggage was given and he had been concerned that if the contents had been examined he wouldnt have a ready explanation for what lay within he used a brass key on the lock and lifted the lid the case was a clever disguise meant to look solid and heavy when in fact it was made of wood veneer over an aluminum shell that weighed just ten pounds it was what was at the bottom of the trunk that gave it such weight below the few items of clothing and toiletries that vatutin needed for the twoweek cruise were a pair of gloves a hood a type of smock and a specially designed metal flask the gloves almost looked like medieval chain mail except they were crafted of tightly woven gold thread and werent yet a hundred years old each one weighed three pounds he knew from experience that they were clumsy and awkward to wear and even harder to work with next to them was a long hood similarly fashioned of gold thread two eyeholes were woven into the mesh and over them a special flap could be drawn down to completely cover the eyes if necessary fortunately for vatutin the cowls original owner had had a larger than normal head so he could slip on the hood without difficulty he set the glittering gloves and hood aside and strained to withdraw the last item of clothing this was a recent addition to vatutins collection because the original smock had long since disappeared this one weighed almost ninety pounds it was composed of leadimpregnated cloth with hundreds of small lead plates sewn in place to form a solid shield extending from the waist to the throat the sleeves were banded with lead rings of various sizes that allowed limited movement at the shoulder and elbow anatoly vatutin wished that the brotherhood could have afforded to assemble the garment out of gold like the original but they no longer had anywhere near that kind of money as it was if they failed in the next two weeks the brotherhood would not have the funds to continue their work a highstrength stainlesssteel flask was left at the bottom of the trunk though it was the same size as the trunk and about a foot tall only half its volume was filled its liquid contents had been smuggled at tremendous cost from the chernobyl nuclear plant before its closure he looked at it with dread before lowering the smock back into the chest and replacing the gloves and hood he had just started a prayer of thanks that his secret was still safe when there was a knock on his cabin door his heart slammed against his ribs oh god no it had to be the swiss guards coming to question him either he had been betrayed or they had xrayed the trunk not now that i am so close he cried silently to god please this is your work i am doing frantic he threw his other clothes into the trunk slammed the lid and turned the lock again moment please he croaked in english father vatutin a man called from the other side of the door i am from the pursers office please open the door i am on the toilet vatutin improvised eyeing the porthole as a possible escape route it was much too small of course trapped he resigned himself to trust in god to see him through i am coming on the way to the door he had the presence of mind to reach into the closetsize bathroom to flush the toilet maintaining his thin veil of deception if there was only one of them outside the door vatutin wondered if he could kill him for what he needed to do on this trip taking the life of a purser was a small price he had the element of surprise and even without a weapon he was formidable at six foot three inches tall and two hundred thirty pounds he composed himself wiping sweat from his face the door swung smoothly and standing in the corridor was an innocentlooking young man wearing a white uniform and holding a bunch of flowers father vatutin these are compliments of the cruise line he smiled and offered the flowers to a befuddled vatutin when the sailing arrangements were made your bishop bishop olkranszy assured us that you wouldnt mind being on the lowest deck however we felt brightening your cabin with flowers was the least we could do the cabin is fine vatutin stammered his relief immeasurable they knew nothing perhaps you can give the flowers to the person in the next cabin we have them for all guests staying on the inside of e deck father the young man said and smiled again ah thank you then vatutin closed the door leaning his back against it as he tried to slow his breathing he wished he had brought along something to settle his stomach he wanted to vomit get hold of yourself anatoly he thought he felt like he was having a heart attack no one knows why you are really here he knew he would not relax until he took possession of the icon being presented to bishop olkranszy by the vatican and confirmed what lay hidden behind its golden cover anatoly gave little thought to his own death if he mishandled the relic just as long as he accomplished his mission it was little wonder that knowing the secret of satans fist had driven the brotherhoods founder insane grigori efymovich had handled dozens of such icons while vatutin was responsible for only one it would be days before he received the icon and the tension was already tearing him apart east of the georesearch station greenland over the anemic throb of the helicopters faltering engine anika klein could hear her grandfathers voice in her head go to greenland liebchen there you will be safe she could never remember a time when opa jacob had been more wrong the chopper lurched again a sickening plunge that made her restraining harnesses dig into her shoulders the pilot a young dane contracted by georesearch fought to keep the dying craft in the air the grim set to his jaw and the undisguised fear in his eyes told anika that he wasnt likely to win the fight around them the storm that the njoerds meteorologist promised wouldnt hit for another six hours raged with banshee fury anika had been on enough helicopters to know that even if the engine wasnt about to let go they had little chance of reaching the research camp the snowstorm was too intense for the hundredth time she cursed herself for flying cursed the daredevil pilot for thinking he could beat the storm and cursed opa jacob for convincing her shed be safer in greenland than at home pursuing otto schroeders killers while she had lost all details of the drive from schroeders house to ismaning where her friend had picked her up to bring her home anika vividly recalled everything that had come before that the gunfire the blood the pain and most of all the anger that had grown to a fever pitch as a doctor she had dedicated herself to the preservation of life and witnessing the torture schroeder had endured sickened her to the very core she vowed to see that the man responsible the man anika admitted she hadnt really gotten a good look at was convicted for his unspeakable crime when she had phoned opa jacob after a full day of recovery she had related everything including the presence of the unknown snipers and the fact that schroeder died believing he possessed a secret more valuable than gold she also asked if the name philip mercer meant anything to him ive never heard of him jacob eisenstadt had said this is someone schroeder mentioned yes he said a mysterious caller a few weeks ago told him that this american could be of help does he do what you do opa not that im aware of but he could be new to the field or work for someone else like wiesels peace and justice center well schroeder was convinced he could help and what about the pandora project he mentioned does that sound familiar ive not heard of that either eisenstadt confessed but i bet its the code name for a specific nazi looting program remember that schroeder was an engineer not a soldier so it could even be the name given to an attempt to build a secure stash for art and precious metals like they did at the salt mines in austria the idea was an alluring one so what do we do now anika had asked the scent of treasure added to her desire for justice we jacob thundered do nothing i will continue working and you get out of germany you arent safe there you said yourself that the men who killed schroeder have seen your face and could at this very moment be learning who you are you should go on your trip to greenland you will be safe there and by the time you get back in a few weeks i will know enough to go to the police and get you proper protection the following argument lasted nearly an hour with opas partner theodor weitzmann and frau goetz the housekeeper joining in on the other phones at the institute they were unified in their appeal which was a first as far as anika knew that day anika had called georesearchs main office and told them that she would not be able to make the rendezvous in reykjavik due to an accident she didnt add that she would spend the days letting the bullet graze in her thigh heal after the plane ride to kulusuk and a chopper to the njoerd here she was on another helicopter that was minutes away from crashing yet her thoughts werent on her situation she thought only of the guilt opa jacob would feel when he learned she died following his recommendation it very well might kill him theres a rescue effort under way right now the pilot shouted into the headphones they want you to fire a flare when we get close to the ground theyre in an emergency pack under your seat anika was in the copilots seat and had to loosen her shoulder restraints to reach under her chair she waited until the gyrating craft stabilized for a moment before attempting the maneuver as her fingers brushed against a plastic case the chopper bucked suddenly dropping farther into the raging clouds of snow blowing by them like random tracer fire her head hit the control stick deepening their dive which forced the pilot to jerk back hard hitting her once again schiesse she cried rubbing the knot already forming under her hair she checked her glove to make sure she wasnt bleeding on her second attempt she brought out the orange box and retightened the straps before she could be thrown bodily out of the seat the flares were in individual firing tubes that could be activated by pulling a short lanyard at their base she gripped one firmly getting ready to open the small window next to her tell me when no not up here you have to go in the back the pilot told her jerking a thumb over his shoulder at the cargo compartment the flare will destroy my night vision from her vantage she could see there was an operable window in the holds side door okay she pulled off the headphones since the cord wouldnt reach then she unbuckled all her safety belts there was no pattern to the helicopters erratic flight so there was nothing she could do as gravity either tossed her toward the roof or crushed her to her seat as if she was mountain climbing anika maintained three contact points at all times only moving a limb when she was certain the other three had a secure purchase in this fashion she crawled over her chair and slid into the only open space in the choppers hold bracing herself by pressing her back to the floor and jamming her feet against a builtin shelf on the forward bulkhead can you hear me anika screamed testing whether she would be able to hear the pilot when he gave his order to fire the flare yes his reply sounded as if it came from outside the aircraft about five more minutes tops okay ak this is it as long as the engine held together they had a chance to find a break in the storm and land safely she kept that hope alive by praying to god who had kept her safe in situations like this she thought of the time when a climbing rope had parted twothirds up eiger she recalled when a whitewater raft shed been paddling had been split open in the middle of class rapids dumping her and three companions into a liquid maelstrom then there was the case of food poisoning that had forced an end to a hiking expedition in peru anika had eaten the same native stew as the four others with her and while they had to be choppered back to iquitos for medical treatment she hadnt felt the slightest ill effect she liked to brag about her outdoor skills but she knew so much of what she had survived was due to luck an ally she sometimes disdained not now she was terrified and would need whatever last shreds of good fortune shed managed to preserve reaching up she slid open the small plexiglas window she gasped at the raw blast of air that sucked her breath away as if the chopper had just gone through explosive decompression intellectually she knew if they survived the crash they wouldnt last more than a few hours on the ice but that didnt impair her desire to see the chopper down safely she would worry about rescue afterward the wind rattled the tub of mail left near the door in the worst bit of irony about this whole illfated trip shed noted when the crate was put aboard that the topmost envelope was from new york city and had been posted to none other than philip mercer the odds that the man mentioned by otto schroeder was on the same trip as her were too long to be coincidental the anger that had begun at the isolated farmhouse nearly exploded though she immediately knew shed been set up she didnt know if it was by schroeder his killers or the snipers or maybe even by philip mercer himself until the storm struck the helicopter she had been quietly brooding about this development determined to find the truth get ready the pilot yelled from the cockpit anika stuck the end of the flare out the window stripping off one glove so she could get a better grip on the lanyard from her position she couldnt see outside and this was better let the crash come as a surprise she thought if she didnt know it was coming her body wouldnt tense involuntarily now she jerked the string and the glowing ball of fire arced into space its red corona flying away like the spectral trail of a meteor ten seconds later the choppers skids slammed into the ground the collision was like a full swing of a sledgehammer against anikas spine momentum made the crafts nose pitch forward its blades sliced through the granular snow until they hit solid ice and came apart the engines torque continued to spin the unbalanced rotor head with enough power to slam the helicopter over on its side anika was thrown into the door her body pinned by boxes forced loose by the first impact the ragged bits of blade left on the main shaft chewed into the ground tefloncoated shrapnel exploded off with each contact with the ice the smaller tail rotor hit the snow digging in before it too disintegrated in a deadly swarm of fragments most flew away harmlessly but several cut through the choppers thin skin one slicing by close enough for anika to feel its passage she screamed the engine finally died when it became starved for fuel the sound of the choppers frenzied destruction was replaced by the noise of the storms full force it assaulted anikas ears like a hurricane with hailsize chunks of ice rattling against the fuselage battered but unhurt she began to shift bundles of clothes and boxes of food off of her it seemed that the more she moved the more the gear shifted and wedged around her it was like trying to dig in quicksand the agony radiating from her back wasnt helping then she remembered she hadnt heard anything from the pilot hello she called are you okay she got no response and called again and again raising her voice until she was shrieking and tears were spilling down her cheeks get a grip on yourself ak she said aloud wiping her eyes hes gone this time she attacked the pile of equipment with deliberation thinking through each move before executing it there was a small amount of light spilling from the cockpit and she balanced her need for caution with the urgency to get to the radios when the batteries died so would her chance of contacting the base camp twenty minutes later with cargo balanced precariously around her anika was almost free when the cockpit lights faded to nothing darkness enveloped her she had to fight to keep panic at bay and was succeeding when a gust of wind slammed into the chopper upsetting its center of gravity enough to topple the cargo back on top of her this time she could not stop the tears they came in salty waves even as she again began to work her jaw clamped tight to prevent her teeth from chattering without power the radios were worthless there was no need to move from where she sat since there was little chance of a rescue the moment of pessimism passed and left her infuriated with herself she would not give up life was too precious to squander because of personal weakness it took another hour to extricate herself from the helicopter anika confirmed that the pilot was indeed dead killed by the piece of rotor blade that had narrowly missed her and fired the last flare into the darkness on her walk around the chopper she didnt smell any fuel and assumed the selfsealing fuel bladders had not ruptured she knew her luck was still holding when she found cans of jellied cooking fuel to keep herself warm propped up in the hold anika klein tucked her head into her arms and prepared to wait out the storm she had to remain awake so she could light new cans of fuel when they went out but the struggle became too much after only half an hour even as the first can guttered to a weak blue flame her eyes closed she jerked herself upright cursing her weakness and lit another one her exhaustion was deeper than simple fatigue she fingered the knot on her head again and decided that she had a mild concussion hope of rescue was the only thing keeping her going it would be so easy to just lie back and let the inevitable overcome her to sleep is to die she said aloud mesmerized by the little tin of fire next to her to sleep is to die she kept repeating the mantra unaware that each utterance was a bit quieter her voice more slurred and the pauses longer she fell asleep with only ten minutes of heat remaining when that second can burned out the temperature in the chopper crashed to the ambient temperature of the greenland ice sheet minus fifteen degrees fahrenheit nearly fifty degrees below freezing something woke her an hour later she found frost coating the front of her parka and her body had stiffened she didnt dare open her eyes to look at her hands she could feel they were frostbitten as were her ears the tip of her nose and her cheeks she felt more tired than she could possibly imagine and knew that she was dying shed survived the crash and the first few critical hours only to succumb to exposure she sniffled once and winced her nasal membranes were frozen still she could detect a faint odor a musky fragrance that was completely out of place with her predicament it smelled like a mans aftershave something subtly masculine and diluted with the scent of the wearer himself anika smiled at the smell it was like a last treat before she died if you dont mind me saying dr klein your smile makes you look like a pixie the voice galvanized her she opened her eyes and saw a grinning man next to her he had entered through the shattered cockpit the noise she had heard must have been him crawling into the hold she was too emotionally wasted to react to his presence she merely looked at him in the glow from his flashlight studying the planes of his face and how his gray eyes were shielded by dark brows ice glittered in his hair like gems he was handsome in every sense of the word looks like youve built quite a nest for yourself in here the man said noting the blankets piled on top of her and the cans of sterno shed neglected to keep lit if you want to stay ill understand but i think youd be more comfortable in the land cruiser the heaters cranked and the base camp is only about an hour away who are you anika managed to ask philip mercer at your service other than that touch of frostbite on your face are you all right anika was thankful that her face was frozen so she could not show her shock this was the very man she was looking for yet she was in no condition to question him she had no idea who he was or whose side he was on but if he wanted her dead he wouldnt have driven through the storm to rescue her meekly she held out a hand when she tried to say thanks her lips couldnt form the word a minute later mercer had lifted her from the chopper and led her to where the toyota was idling nearby he got her buckled into the passenger seat before swinging around to the drivers side by the time he stepped into the rugged crosscountry vehicle anika was sound asleep her head cocooned in the hood of her parka without the need to replace a tire that had shredded about two miles from where hed seen anika fire the second flare and with the storm all but over mercer made it back to the camp much quicker than the drive out the whole time he was behind the wheel he couldnt get the gratified smile off his face anika klein would not join the list of people he felt he had failed the following morning mercer roused ira lasko at sunup and the two of them commandeered one of the snocats to return to the site of the crash the couple hours of sleep had done nothing to alleviate his exhaustion so he let the former submariner drive while he dozed in the passenger seat ira navigated by driving in mercers tire prints from the night before which were already being obscured by the constant wind because the tracked vehicle was much slower than the land cruiser it took them two hours to reach the downed helicopter we there yet mercer asked blinking sleep from his eyes when ira tapped him on the shoulder i told you to pee before we left young man ira quipped i didnt have to then the humor vanished from iras voice when they saw the helicopter sitting forlornly on the ice like an overturned insect hard to believe anyone survived that mercer just grunted and opened the cats door other than a few bits of debris the snow around the crash site was a clean white blanket that hid the violence of what had happened but when he looked closer mercer saw footprints that circled the downed helo and then vanished off to the north for a split second he thought that the pilot hadnt been killed in the crash and he had abandoned him out here last night he knew that couldnt be true he had seen the chunk of rotor blade sticking through the mans neck and the frozen blood that coated his flight suit the pilot had been dead long before hed found the chopper because the footprints were nearly buried by snow he couldnt tell where they originated or what size feet had made them it was possible anika klein had made them but that made as much sense as the dead pilot pulling a lazarus act she had been near death herself you thinking what im thinking ira asked when he saw what mercer was studying i dont know what im thinking mercer admitted did someone beat us out here this morning to check out the crash i didnt see any tracks besides yours but its possible maybe they left right after you got back but why the pilots body was still strapped in his seat his recovery being the principal reason mercer and ira had come out something on the chopper they didnt want discovered ira offered lifting his feet to clear the powdery snow accumulated on the ground mercer started following the trail of prints he was back at the crash site in just a few minutes they disappear about fifty yards away blown clean by the wind what about a stowaway i was thinking that myself the helo had a rear door that opened at the back of the cargo hold it was sealed now but it was possible someone had exited through it following the crash and closed it afterward to hide their presence given her injuries and the noise generated by the storm anika might not have heard anything ira said after examining the door but we dont need to worry about it whys that you think someone could still be alive out here after twelve hours mercer considered the question given the right gear yeah they could but theyd be in for one hell of a long walk you want to go look for him not in the slightest mercer growled he wanted to get away so badly hed abandon an injured woman i say let the son of a bitch keep going lets load up the pilots body and anything else we can stuff in the snocat and get back to the base they were ready fortyfive minutes later the pilot had been wrapped in a plastic tarpaulin and every square inch of the snocats cargo area was filled with boxes of perishable food anikas luggage and anything else they felt was needed back at the camp despite his earlier vehemence mercer steered a zigzag search pattern for the first hour of the drive while ira scanned the monotonous surroundings through a pair of binoculars they saw no footprints or track marks left by another snocat if it had indeed been a stowaway who had walked from the helicopter he wasnt headed toward the research station ira put away the binoculars and reached for the mail bucket shuffling through the parcels and envelopes looking for anything addressed to him he sniffed appreciatively at a letter from his wife that still carried traces of perfume she must have sprayed on the paper sorry nothing for you doesnt appear that anyone loves you did you check for names that didnt sound quite right mercer asked remember my last letter was sent to max e padd ah here we go ira held up a large envelope its from arlington virginia thats me mercer winced when he asked ira to tell him the name juan tzeks withasheep it took mercer a second to decipher harrys lame joke want sex with a sheep youve got one warped friend there mercer tell me about it open it up and lets see what he sent a confirmation for your new playgirl magazine subscription a couple receipts from a strip joint in washington another envelope forwarded from munich and a police citation for a noiseordinance violation mercer wondered what was in the envelope from germany and was about to ask ira to open the envelope when he remembered the mysterious email he received before leaving for iceland this must be the material the lawyer said he was sending for his unnamed client he thought it was best if he opened that in private when our communications are back up i think ill call the arlington police to report a squatter has taken over my house thatll show the old bastard oh thats mean if you knew some of the crap hes pulled over the years youd know hes getting off light mercer replied there was a crowd waiting for them when they got back to base and halted the snocat near the mess hall not everyone was happy to see them werner koenig and greta schmidt stood apart from the others scowling leading the group who cheered them on was marty bishop and a much recovered anika klein lets keep those footprints to ourselves mercer said when he killed the engine people find out all the secrets were sharing theyre going to get jealous ira said in a singsong voice mercer threw open his door mail call greta schmidt pushed through the crowd to confront mercer that is the second time you have taken a vehicle without authorization she snapped which makes it two times ive done your job he replied with a mocking smile he noted that again it was schmidt not koenig who was the most upset by his foray and he wondered exactly which one was running the expedition relax for christs sake marty boomed he saved dr kleins life last night i am aware of that but there are procedures discipline must be maintained i am going to report you all to the surveyors society with the recommendation that you be airlifted back to iceland immediately this is no place for cowboy heroics she stormed off your rescue was illadvised but appreciated werner shook mercers hand when greta was out of sight i dont think i will be able to stop her from ordering your evacuation im sorry he followed in her wake marty turned to mercer dont sweat it when we have the radios up again ill square it with my old man thanks marty mercer said but i doubt itll make much difference with the chopper crash coming so close to igors death i wont be surprised if georesearch has their entire operation shut down by the danish government neither man had noticed anika klein had moved close to them and overheard what mercer had just said igor bulgarin is dead she cried mercer turned stunned that no one had told her and guilty that hed mentioned it so casually even though she was in moon boots the top of her head was below the level of his chin her eyes were wide with shock and he was struck again by how much she looked like a mythical imp a tough resilient imp to be sure im sorry dr klein i didnt know you were there he stammered yes igor died in an accident yesterday morning she just stared at him for a moment her gaze wary i didnt know it came as a shock to us all marty said extending his hand im martin bishop i head up the surveyors society contingent here anika klein she replied absently her mind far away from social niceties mercer took her hand when she offered it i doubt you remember much from last night im philip mercer i remember she answered cautiously you came out to get me thank you for what you did that was brave it was foolish but youre welcome he studied her for a second looks like it wasnt frostbite after all anika touched her cheeks and nose where the color had returned to near normal if youd been any later it would have been im glad youre okay she didnt seem like someone meeting her rescuer mercer thought she seemed almost afraid of him whats that anika pointed to the manila envelope in mercers hand huh the odd question threw him oh its just some junk mail from a friend unlike the night before this time anika couldnt hide her surprise she eyed the package for a long moment before dragging her focus back to mercers face you probably want to go read it im sorry for delaying you no actually id like to talk with you are you sure youre all right anika stiffened yes im fine then her shoulders sagged just a fraction thats not true i have a vicious headache and i keep thinking about the pilot tell me more about igors death how did it happen there was a cavein inside camp decade mercer said he was struck by falling ice we dont think he suffered anika immediately grasped the part of the story that had bothered mercer since the accident what was he doing there he was a meteorite hunter mercer was right about her resilience a helicopter crash last night a delayed rescue that left her half dead and now the shock of her team leaders death and still her mind cut incisively we dont know he admitted ira lasko had been helping others unload the snocat during the conversation they were done except for one item and he approached the trio begging your pardon maam mercer do you want me to put the pilots body in the cold storage lab with igors yeah thatll be fine i just spoke with erwin ira continued the radios are still out so theres no word yet from the air force about the body you found in camp decade another body anikas eyes bored into mercer an air force pilot lost in the s hes still down in the camp where we found him id like to examine him her voice had firmed as she came to grips with the past few minutes regaining the professional edge she used in the emergency room camp decade is sealed until we shore up some of the roof marty said we feel its too dangerous to go down there in an effort to impress her marty was trying to reclaim his control over the group by answering her request anika wasnt fooled shed already realized that philip mercer was in charge of these men she addressed him directly i would consider it a favor if you would let me examine him as well as the body of igor bulgarin i can let you see igor but the base is offlimits for a while he doubted her examination would detect that jack delaneys corpse was radioactive but until he had some answers no one was getting near him when she was disappointed anika had the habit of sucking on her lower lip while not a calculating gesture it had a certain effect on men before the air force comes mercer relented i promise you a chance to check him out thank you may i examine dr bulgarin in a couple of hours id like to get something to eat and then sleep for a while longer mercer rolled back his glove to look at the tag heuer slung around his wrist ill meet you right here at marty bishop followed after anika when she started off for the mess hall leaving mercer alone with ira lasko what do you think ira i think thats one tough little lady he said thoughtfully and i also think shes one scared lady too i noticed that as well any guess why no idea this whole thing has been screwy since the word go i shouldnt be surprised that our latest addition is a mystery too why does she want to examine igor ira asked mercer had no immediate answer i wonder if maybe she knows something about his death like why he was in camp decade when he shouldnt have been how would she know that when we dont this time it was iras turn to remain silent yesterday this trip had seemed like a great vacation for mercer and hed been enjoying himself but since igors death that had all vanished and his frustration had mounted hed paid little attention to the small inconsistencies since his arrival here and now they plagued him he doubted that anika klein would shed any light on what was happening in fact her demeanor and requests added to his concern this trip is one snafu after another he muttered amen you think the danes are going to pull us i hope to god they do georesearch station greenland at the appointed time mercer saw anika approaching the mess hall from the direction of the dormitories she was bundled in a red onepiece goretex snowsuit with a hood pulled tight around her face with her back to the wind snow dusted the knapsack over her shoulder for the past hour he had been sitting with the radio operator trying vainly to get a message out to reykjavik other than static and a burst of conversation that sounded like it came from the njoerd they had received nothing the electronic interference from the suns massive coronal ejections ensured the base was completely isolated when he saw anika through the steamclouded window mercer thanked the radioman pulled on his parka and stepped out into the gale how are you feeling he shouted over the wind fine lets go mercer led her to the coldtemperature lab at the far end of the camp first making sure she was clipped to the guide rope the blowing snow swallowed their feet with each step so they appeared like legless torsos gliding through the swirling ice once georesearch got geared up the cold lab would house ice cores and snow samples for now it held just the two bodies the building was made of plastic with a couple of windows on each side drifts had grown on the windward flank piling almost to the eaves but the structure had been placed in such a way that the entrance was mostly clear of snow like all the buildings there was a widebladed shovel clipped near the door and after a few minutes of digging their path was cleared mercer didnt need to worry about warmth escaping the lab so he held the door for anika to enter first he snapped on the overhead lights long banks of fluorescents that provided plenty of light but generated little heat that could damage frozen samples under tarps at the far end of the room two recognizable shapes were laid out on adjacent worktables out of the wind mercer and anika pulled back their hoods and shook snow off themselves she ignored his gesture to sweep snow off her back in a rush to reach the bodies the first tarp she drew back covered the pilots corpse and after just a second she replaced the shroud she already knew what had killed him she said nothing as she uncovered igor looking first at his ghastly white face before beginning to examine him with singleminded intensity it was as if mercer wasnt there starting with his booted feet and moving upward across his stillclothed body she ran her hands over every part of him mercer had no idea what she hoped to accomplish since the body was as stiff as the table beneath it because igors mouth was open she pulled a penlight from her knapsack and explored his teeth and gums grunting when she saw something of interest what is it mercer asked russian dentists these are the worst fillings ive ever seen igor had to have been in constant pain she removed her thick outer mittens and replaced them with a pair of surgical gloves probing his mouth with her finger from deep in his throat she withdrew out a bit of frozen saliva mixed with snow she studied it for a second before dropping it on the table without a proper lab to examine the material it did her little good to keep it next she bent close to look at the deep scrapes on his nose and forehead grunting again but this time mercer kept his silence he was fascinated by her with her eyes narrowed and her brows pulled down in concentration she looked like a child worrying at a particularly tough school problem but she was an adult examining a corpse and he was captivated by the dichotomy of her appearance and profession he imagined that shed been underestimated many times in her life and pitied the people who did it finished with igors face she ran her hands over his skull pressing various points with her fingertips can you give me a hand she asked without looking up what do you need mercer moved to her side i want to roll him over they did and because igor bulgarin was so heavy and broad it was like flipping a kingsize mattress when mercer retreated again she combed aside the frozen knots of blood and hair at the base of his skull tracing the wound with a finger she scowled and reached into her bag for a magnifying glass there was a palpable tension in her as she scrutinized the wound under the glass her face so close to igors head that her breath snaked through his hair like steam after two minutes anika straightened and looked around the room intently what did you find mercer closed the gap between them infected by whatever had so unsettled her she said nothing moving by him to grab a crowbar left on another of the worktables she looked at the piece of steel for a moment feeling its weight not caring that the metal was freezing her hand unsatisfied she dropped it unceremoniously and rummaged under the table where more tools had been left in plastic crates she came up with a twentyinchlong handle from a portable screw jack it was only then she remembered mercer was in the room with her she looked at him clinically as if weighing a decision and nodded when he passed some sort of unspoken test she couldnt hide the fear lingering in her eyes but she spoke in a calm tone igor was murdered she stated he was then dragged from where it happened and left in a place where someone could stage an avalanche to cover the killing on some intuitive level mercer wasnt surprised somehow it made sense to him though hed not voiced them not even to himself hed had misgivings about the entertaining russian but his professional skepticism wouldnt allow him to accept her statement without proof how do you know she hefted the jack handle carrying it to the body this is a little thinner than the murder weapon shorter and lighter too i would guess but itll give you an idea what happened she placed the handle into the long wound at the base of igors skull as you can see it fits almost perfectly in the gash a straight impact line that runs from side to side beneath the occipital bulge this wound wasnt the result of ice hitting him its too symmetrical he was killed by a very strong person swinging such a tool like a baseball bat the blow would have crushed a portion of the cerebellum and the medulla spinalis killing him instantly mercer peered at the injury quelling his uneasiness he lifted the handle and then placed it back in the wound as anika had done he had to admit that it was indeed a pretty damn good match if you notice the scrapes on his face all go in the same direction add the fact that he rigored with his hands over his head and its logical to conclude that someone dragged him by his hands facedown over a rough surface like a wooden floor the snow i found jammed down his throat is consistent with this hypothesis mercer remembered thinking how strange it was that igors arms had been over his head when they found the body at the time hed assumed the cuts on igors face had been from falling ice hitting him but now she presented a plausible scenario as he looked at anika his eyes asked his next questions i dont know why he was killed mr mercer or who did it its dr mercer actually but everyone just calls me mercer he said automatically who would have done this a strong person she had said that description fit nearly everyone at the camp if the timing had been different he would have considered the stowaway whod left the tracks around the helicopter but the crash occurred well after igors death he was left with the unpleasant option that apart from everything else going wrong there was a killer in their midst now he knew where anikas fear had come from he shared it youre getting your wish he said after a moment wish you wanted to examine the corpse we found in camp decade thats the only thing of even remote interest in the facility if igor was killed for a reason i bet that bodys it you said the base wasnt safe you just told me that someone caused the avalanche to cover igors murder if youre right the ceiling in camp decades still structurally sound what if i am wrong suddenly it seemed the thought of going into the underground base wasnt quite as appealing to her you should trust your instincts mercer said considering what youve just discovered id say theyre right on leading anika once again he made his way across the base this time walking into the wind the flying ice felt like glass shards when it hit his face below his tinted goggles and no amount of tugging could tighten the hood enough to eliminate all the gaps it was like being attacked by a swarm of wasps they reached the long trench carved over the entrance of camp decade and once they were below ground level the punishing wind would release its hold they could walk upright again and hold a conversation before you left the njoerd did you learn how long this winds supposed to last mercer climbed into the snocat to fire the engine and power the winch all day today and they think theres only a couplehour gap tomorrow before an even stronger storm front hits erik the red was one hell of a salesman mercer joked anika looked at him quizzically when the old viking was banished from iceland in ad he sailed west and landed here he wintered someplace on the east coast when he returned home he told people about the beautiful island he had discovered calling it greenland to describe its lushness that probably wasnt the first marketing lie ever told but it certainly was one of the most effective he convinced twentyfive ships worth of settlers to follow him back he jumped down from the cat and reached across the twentyfoot void to grab the dangling bucket they used to get to the bottom of the shaft anika stepped in without a moments consideration with mercer right behind her not afraid of heights he asked as the bucket started its slow descent i climb mountains for relaxation i could probably climb down this tube faster than this contraption of yours mercer didnt doubt her at the bottom he checked the chains he and ira had used to secure the doors after removing igors body it didnt appear they had been tampered with so he jammed home the locks key and twisted once inside he handed one of the flashlights left there to anika and kept another for himself cutting through the darkness their powerful beams were like lances the feeling that ghosts were watching him was stronger this time memories of igor bulgarin flooded mercers mind he led her toward the officers quarters where jack delaneys body had lain undisturbed for five decades when they had pulled igor out mercer and ira had cleared a lot of the snow that had once clogged the passage but still they had to clamber over heaps of ice even in her snowsuit anika moved with fluid efficiency not slipping or misplacing a hand or foot as she climbed mercer was having a harder time he was used to tight spaces like this made his living in them but he wasnt as deft at judging the slick surfaces once they cleared the final obstacle they trained their lights at the floor anika got on her knees for a better look and spotted what shed expected the claret streaks on the floor were blood igor bulgarins blood the faint marks continued down the dark passage you were right mercer said not knowing how he felt about that so were you igor was checking the body they reached the officers annex in a moment and passed down the hallway until they came to room number ten jack delaney looked as he had when mercer first found him his face was gaunt to the point of starvation drained of all color except around his mouth which was a lighter shade almost gray his hands were clutched at his chest skeletal fingers interlaced as if hed been praying at the final moment of his death it took no imagination to think of the bitterness he must have felt after surviving for so long only to discover camp decade had already been abandoned the loneliness of his death was in the vacant stare of his longdead eyes does he look like hes been disturbed anikas question snapped mercer from his grim reflections no he checked the floor and found more blood a few drops scattered near one wall he could tell by the pattern and their tearlike appearance that they had sprayed from the wound igor died in this room either attacked by someone preventing him from examining the body or murdered to cover up someone elses investigation but before he could do anything to the body anika persisted yes neither person appears to have touched the corpse thinking about the timing igor would have gotten down here at about in the morning his killer could have been a few minutes behind seen him in here bludgeoned him and immediately started hiding the evidence since people get up about six that only gave the murderer an hour and a half barely enough time to stage the avalanche and get back to his dorm before anyone noticed were lucky anika set her knapsack on the desk next to the bed as with igor bulgarin she began her examination at delaneys feet and slowly worked her way up mercer stood at her shoulder following her hands with his flashlight so she could see what she was doing when she reached his mouth and studied his teeth she called him closer look at this delaney had only a few teeth remaining in his mouth black stumps so cracked it was doubtful the airman could have used them to chew his gums looked like raw meat for a few seconds anika tried to find traces of dentistry but there was nothing left hes very thin considering what hed been through im not surprised anika said nothing and took a tape measure from her bag delaney was just five feet six inches tall in his boots awfully short mercer thought but since he didnt know what kind of height restrictions the military maintained for its pilots he didnt say anything next anika pulled up delaneys sleeves you shouldnt move him until the air force arrives mercer admonished but not very sternly he was just as curious as she was he checked his watch theyd been here for ten minutes he would give her five more before leaving he was conscious of the bodys mild radioactivity he realized that could have explained the tooth loss and the fact that under his woolen hat delaney was completely bald another symptom of acute radiation poisoning what do you think anika pointed to a rectangular scar on his left forearm looks like a burn more like a brand mark she countered but theres nothing to it except scar tissue no symbols or words when she tugged his sleeves down again a piece of paper that had been clutched in delaneys hands came loose a small corner showing from under one long finger whats that mercer asked good eyes i would have missed it she used a pair of surgical forceps to slide out the folded piece of paper careful not to dislodge the original position of delaneys hands the smoke hit them as she handed it to mercer it came in a solid black wave sweeping through the underground base dense and impenetrable in moments the beams from their maglites were nothing more than feeble spots of light unable to cut more than a foot into the roiling haze what the anika started coughing before she could finish the question mercer pushed her to the floor where the air was marginally cleaner anikas eyes were red rimmed and weeping her lungs convulsed for a few more seconds until she could purge the worst of the smoke what happened she gasped fighting not to throw up fire i dont know weve got to get out of here how mercer crawled to the door even through the pall of smoke he could see the dancing glow of a fire at the exit of the officers quarters the fire appeared to grow in ferocity in the few seconds he stared transfixed on the other side of the advancing wall of flames was the only way out of camp decade anika joined him at the door were trapped mercer didnt need to voice his agreement everything was happening too fast for panic to be a problem his mind was sharp and ready to figure a way out but as he watched the growing flames inspiration remained beyond his grasp youre trapped underground by fire theres one way out and its blocked the flames have plenty of fuel considering this whole place is made of wood and it wont starve for oxygen before youre cooked like a natural chimney smoke would be billowing up the access shaft at the same time the fire sucked down more air to keep itself going mercer youve been here before he reminded himself at different times and at different places how did you get out he knew the answer to that was an unlikely solution the underground fires hed faced before had been in coal mines where teams of trained experts battled the inferno to save him you know how to get out of this youve done it before how it came to him air shaft he shouted over the noise of camp decade being consumed from within its in the middle of the fire anika choked we wont make it not the main shaft we came down with this much smoke well never find it we have to go all the way through the fire to reach the garage on the other side how run like hell why not try to find the exit doors anika theres nothing down here that could have started this fire it was intentionally set by whoever killed igor to stop us from proving his murder a paroxysm of coughing racked her when she gasped we cant risk stopping in the middle of the blaze to search for the doors because they are most likely blocked we have to reach the far side there will be air shafts in the garage used to vent engine exhaust when the military stored snocats there its our only chance mercer shuffled to the bed holding delaneys body and unceremoniously shoved the corpse aside to strip away the blankets hed been lying on the encroaching fire had melted a tremendous amount of ice and snow so water rippled down the hallway and past the bedroom door mercer dumped the blankets in the stream soaking them through the water was near freezing and burned his exposed hands like acid take off your snowsuit he ordered are you nuts he turned to face her yes take off your snowsuit as she did what he asked mercer took off his own parka sloshing it in the torrent of meltwater before he put it back on he dropped onto his back gasping when he came in contact with the icy river even as he splashed more water on his legs he could feel crusts of ice forming and breaking with each movement well freeze to death he splashed handfuls of water on his face and hair id rather freeze than burn he took anikas red suit and soaked it motioning her to douse herself in the water as he worked her lips were blue by the time she was done her jaws chattering uncontrollably mercer imagined he looked as bad if they made it through the fire they would have only a few minutes before hypothermia overcame them he handed her the onepiece and worked his arms back into his dripping parka the garment weighed at least ten pounds more than it had he could only hope it retained enough water to insulate him the fire roared only fifteen yards away by the time they were dressed again their delay caused by numb fingers that refused to work properly assuming that it spread evenly they would need to run through a sixtyyard gauntlet before reaching open air again he pulled his hood around his face covering his eyes with his goggles and making sure that anika was similarly protected be careful when we reach the middle of the fire i dont know if all that snow has melted completely so there could still be piles of it what happens if the fires bigger than you think mercers gallows humor didnt fail him then all those people whove told me to go to hell will get their wish are you ready no mercer gave her a reassuring smile and draped a few wet blankets over her well make it okay ak lets do it anika said softly and watched mercer launch himself down the hallway like a javelin she waited for a heartbeat and went after him mercer kept his eyes open for as long as he dared when the heat hit him full blast he pulled his own blanket over his head hunched his shoulders and ran as fast as hed ever run in his life behind his closed lids and through the nowsteaming blankets light still danced against his vision ragged swirls of flame that licked upward from the floor over the raging inferno he could hear the blankets sizzling as the water boiled away ten yards into the blaze the heat intensified he hadnt considered that parts of the roof would be collapsing at any moment creating obstacles that could trap them in the middle of the fire twenty yards and he knew he was approaching the avalanche that had buried igor bulgarin his boots sloshed through a thick slurry of snow and water that pulled at each step it was like wading through liquid mud yet he started to drag his feet pushing aside the slush to clear a path for anika somewhere behind him he heard a rumbling crash a portion of ceiling had succumbed to the flames and given way if anika was on the other side of the blockage he would never be able to reach her he continued to run the blanket felt like it was starting to smolder mercers foot hit a snow pile at full stride pitching him forward had he not been prepared for it he would have sprawled headlong as his center of balance shifted he tucked his shoulder still clutching the blanket around him he hit hard shoulder rolled and heaved himself back to his feet his momentum was too much and he was about to go down again when a steadying hand grabbed his arm miraculously anika had been running even faster than he had she saw what happened and was ready to keep him on his feet mercer chanced opening his eyes it was like standing at the very bottom of hell flames encircled them racing up the paneled walls to meet at the roof in shimmering sheets the heat seared his breath he managed to regain his orientation before a veil of smoke closed off his vision saving him from seeing that they had covered barely a third of the distance side by side they ran onward spurred by the primal fear of fire the water saturating mercers clothes began steaming he could sense anika klein at his shoulder running hard in the few seconds theyd been in the conflagration mercer had become accustomed to its consuming roar so when the sound receded behind him he knew they had cleared the fire he didnt dare stop but he let the blanket fall from his shoulders and opened his eyes he saw nothing but blackness smoke anika get down he shouted diving like an all star for home plate she followed his slide and at the floor they found fresher air although her blanket was smoldering her snowsuit seemed untouched together they crawled onward finally reaching a set of heavy doors at the end of the corridor once through they slammed them closed even without light they could tell by the way their coughs echoed that the garage they stumbled into was huge the air mercifully hadnt yet been fouled by smoke are you all right anika wheezed when she regained her breath she snapped on her light mercer nodded his head down tarry smoke coming from his mouth with each cough i have a friend he panted he smokes two packs a day i bet he would have gone through that and had a nicotine craving afterward getting to his feet mercer began to undress retrieving his flashlight before discarding the parka next went his sweaters and shirts you know we have to he said when anika hadnt started doing the same it cant be below freezing in here because the snow covering the base acts like insulation we can stand that for a while as long as we minimize heat loss wet clothes will draw heat away from us many times faster than the air i know anika started to strip i was just wondering about the bullet scar on your shoulder oh that ancient history the furrow cut into the top of mercers shoulder was from an assassins bullet years earlier thanks for what you did back there if i had gone down i wouldnt have gotten back up were even a trace of a smile lifted the corners of her mouth do you think well be okay until they get the fire out not unless we let them know were here remember we didnt tell anyone we were headed for camp decade wearing nothing but boxer shorts with his breath condensing around his head mercer tried to organize his thoughts fighting not to let the cold sap his energy he couldnt help but feel vulnerable and he imagined anika felt even more so in her cotton panties and sports bra she didnt appear to be selfconscious about her lack of attire first things first mercer hadnt spent much time in this section of the base but he recalled that there were a few lockers located next to a small washroom snapping open the doors he found what he wanted because so much equipment had been left behind in the s there were still some mechanics overalls in a couple of the lockers he grabbed four of them and tossed two to anika you knew about this she asked gratefully pulling on the stained garments other than the reactor that powered the facility the snocats and the mens personal gear everything was abandoned here i wasnt sure wed find these but i knew thered be something we could use a minute later he found some boots he started to feel like they had a chance he handed anika a cigarette lighter dont tell me you smoke she scowled with disgust never but i carry a few when im on an expedition like this boy scout training can you make us a fire while she got to work he wandered around the garage he noted that in one corner of the room sat a large fuel cylinder for the militarys snocats he rapped it with a hammer left on a workbench the dull thud indicated it was at least half full a long coil of rubber hose with a standard nozzle hung from a bracket welded to the tanks support cradle at the far end of the workshop was a series of wide doors that had once led to snow ramps to the surface next he played his light on the trussed ceiling fifteen feet over his head discovering several large air vents they were more than big enough for what he had in mind all he needed now was a ladder and a long pole like the center post for an army tent he found both items in a utility closet the smell of burning wood was becoming distracting it would take a while to reach a dangerous level but it was a constant reminder that on the other side of the fireproof doors was an outofcontrol blaze anika huddled next to the fire shed built from packing crates cupping her hands as if receiving a gift from the flames strange to think this would feel good after the run through the hallway she joked were not done yet its time to put an old adage to work she shot him a questioning glance fight fire with fire after he explained what he had in mind she had only one question how do you know the diesel will still burn fuels dont lose their combustibility over time just their efficiency once we drain the sediment and water from the bottom of the tank wed be able to fill our own vehicles with it and suffer just bad mileage and burned piston rings that was an exaggeration he knew but it was close enough lets do it anika got to her feet convinced because mercer seemed so certain hed said earlier that he trusted her for now she had no choice but to reciprocate mercer set his ladder near the largest of the air shafts climbing up to remove the circular grate protecting it the vertical tube was more than large enough to accommodate him and anika flashing his light upward he could see the vent had been battered and dented by glacial movement but it was still clear for a good fifteen feet before becoming clogged with ice he estimated that there would be ten additional feet of snow above it before he could see daylight anika spent her time unfurling the fuel hose using some rope shed found to secure the end of the flexible pipe to the tip of the tenfoot tent pole her knots were tight and professional while mercer checked the spigot attached to the tank she used his pocketknife to cut the gas nozzle from the hose the rubber was brittle but remarkably resilient demanding all her strength with the tank resting four feet above the polished concrete floor mercer knew it was gravity driven rather than relying on a mechanical pump to fill the vehicles that were once stored here without the restricting nozzle an arcing jet of diesel would spew from the hose once he opened the tap are you ready for a test mercer asked anika who was fifteen yards away silhouetted by her flashlight okay she pointed the open end of the tube away from her not knowing how powerful the stream would be here we go mercer needed both hands and the considerable power of his shoulders to crack the initial seal on the spigot once the wheel began to turn it spun freely jesus anika screamed in surprise prompting mercer to close the tap quickly he raced to her side well she raised the focus of her flashlight following the shimmering wet streak staining the floor the trail led for fifty feet before it vanished beyond the lights range powerful enough for what you had in mind overkill mercer laughed delighted that his idea might just work he sobered quickly when a thick wave of smoke reached them the temperature in the garage was starting to climb the doors segregating the garage from the rest of the base werent nearly as fireproof as mercer had hoped get on the ladder anika said already in motion ill operate the valve mercer moved the ladder away so he could hold the hose under the air vent while staying away from the fuel that would be pouring back down high above the floor the air was fouled with smoke he pulled the collar of his coveralls over his mouth but the musty cloth was ranker than the air just give me the word and ill start the fuel flowing anika yelled her voice echoing mercer heaved the pole into position resting the tip into the vent shaft to balance it the hose tied to it dangling to the floor and away toward the storage tank bracing himself against the sturdy ladder he could maintain a firm grip without the poles weight becoming too much to hold steady by pressing the end of the pole into his stomach he managed to free one hand once anika turned the tap he would need that hand for only a moment open her up through the pole he could feel the attached hose pulsate as diesel fuel surged toward the outlet forced across the garage and upward into the vent shaft by the tremendous impetus of its own weight his makeshift flamethrower shuddered nearly dislodging him from his perch before he got a better grip in a rush diesel climbed the hose and exploded up the shaft splattering the underside of the ice plug like it had exploded from a fire hydrant as soon as the fuel started falling back to the floor mercer snicked open the zippo lighter and tossed it into the incendiary liquid raining from the roof the fuel ignited in a concussive whoosh an explosion of orange and red and black that blinded him before he could turn away it looked like the exhaust from a rocket motor even from ten feet away the heat was intense and mercer felt sweat begin to pour into his eyes beneath him the widening lake of fire found the gutters cut into the concrete and began to run in rivers to underground waste tanks amid the flaming fuel draining from the vent water too began to flow ice that had melted under the brutal thermal onslaught mercer had no way to judge how quickly the ice plug was being dissolved but each second brought an acceleration to the amount of water diluting the fiery pool its working he heard anika shout over the noise of the fire did you have any doubts mercer grinned down at her he looked like a demon backlit against the pillar of flames swept up in the euphoria of the moment anika returned his cocky smile not for a second with the burning fuel ducted into the drainage hollows under the floor mercers fear of starting a fire worse than the one they had just escaped were unfounded he let the flaming jet of diesel bore into the ice for five minutes before shouting to anika to kill the flow they didnt need to wait for him to move the ladder under the vent to see they had been successful shining into the puddle of flames on the floor was a perfect circle of daylight they were through it took a few minutes for the fire on the floor to extinguish itself completely and as it died they could see smoke being drawn up the vent from deeper into the base its just a matter of time before someone fighting the fire at the main entrance sees smoke billowing out of this vent and comes to investigate mercer said looking up at the sky he turned to anika she had an enigmatic smile on her face a mixture of astonishment and respect she placed her arms on his shoulders and drew him down planting a feathersoft kiss on his cheek thats twice you saved me now i owe you mercers heart tripped he believed she was going to kiss him on the mouth he thought he had recognized that look and for a selfish moment he wished she had but he was glad she hadnt shared danger did strange things to people created instant bonds and hed learned that such passions werent real the emotions were usually nothing more than the aftereffects of adrenaline and relief he recalled some of her accomplishments that igor had mentioned realizing that she probably handled this kind of stress much better than he did it was his own relief hed seen reflected in anikas expression not hers were even his gruff tone covered his embarrassment from above a voice called hello it was erwin puhl startled that their signal had been seen so quickly mercer checked his watch thirty minutes had passed since the fire had started more than enough time for the expedition members to begin combating the subterranean blaze at the facilitys entrance erwin its mercer when you werent leading the firefighting efforts we feared you were trapped down there is dr klein with you no one has seen her in a while yeah shes with me can you lower a rope the smoke is getting pretty thick and the heats rising back in a minute hurry once the flames break through the fire doors protecting the garage theres going to be one hell of an explosion mercer eyed the diesel tank hulking behind the wavering glow of anikas campfire also warn the others who are working at the main entrance to clear the area ten minutes later they were pulled up the air vent by the winch mounted on the front of a snocat ira had driven out to rescue them everyones back at the base camp ira said as they jumped into the boxy vehicle lets go weve only got a few more minutes the fire doors cant hold much longer and it must be over a hundred degrees in the garage already the drop in temperature from inside to out had left mercer lightheaded and trembling ira didnt need to hear anything further he put the snocat in gear twisted it around on its axis and tore off across the ice feathers of churned snow blooming from under its treads he circled around the long access trench near camp decades entrance smoke streamed from deep underground and a huge swath of snow was stained with soot he braked once they reached the mess hall a quarter mile away mercer was just stepping down when out across the frozen plain the fuel tank erupted like a volcano vaporizing a ragged eightyfoot circle of glacier chunks of ice the size of automobiles blasted into the sky propelled by a towering column of flame the concussion hit a second later rocking the snocat on its suspension and tossing mercer onto his backside powdered ice drifted for many minutes before falling back to earth when the last of the snow finally settled smudge continued to billow from the hole smearing the pristine horizon what the hell were you two doing down there ira asked sharply after hauling mercer back to his feet mercer fingered the scrap of paper theyd retrieved from jack delaneys dead fingers im not sure yet aboard the sea empress as if enraged that its power could not rock the great cruise liner the north sea surged ferociously generating huge waves that would have swamped a commercial fishing boat or pitched the largest freighter because of her widespaced twin hulls and tremendous length the sea empress had several distinct wave patterns under her at any moment and their opposing crests and troughs canceled each other out this phenomenon allowed her to sail serenely under the pewter skies as if the swells were nothing more than ripples father anatoly vatutin had spent the first days of his journey safely in his cabin having an occasional light meal sent to him rather than venturing to one of the many restaurants or eating in the vessels four enormous dining rooms hed left word with bishop olkranszy his superior that he hadnt felt well since the ship had gotten under way that wasnt far from the truth vatutin had come from peasant stock with farmers hands and shoulders like a plow ox yet his imposing size fierce countenance and unwavering strength masked the fact that he possessed a delicate stomach even the ships gentle motion made him ill such was his dedication to his mission that he rode waves of nausea stoically spending hours either in his bunk or hunched over the toilet bowl he skipped the universal convocations elaborate opening ceremonies and what some said had been the most beautiful papal blessing ever given his rare forays to the deck to get fresh air were all under the cover of darkness and he intentionally avoided any of the attendees he saw vatutin had become a nonentity at the most famous meeting in history and he was glad for it he had only one thing in mind the icon other than the waiters who brought him broths and bread and calls from bishop olkranszy inquiring about his condition the only person vatutin had spoken with was a cardinal named peretti who was the popes secretary of state the vaticans number two man peretti had been charged by the pontiff with returning thousands of religious artifacts belonging to other faiths that the catholic church had in its possession he was the only person at the convocation that vatutin cared about because of the sheer volume of items being returned only a portion of the hoard was actually on the ship these were the most precious relics ancient texts rare books the most valuable statues and icons perettis shipboard office had been deluged with requests from various people to obtain an item early in the voyage rather than at its end which had been the plan in the name of cooperation and fellowship peretti had granted all such requests detailing a dozen floreria members of the vaticans technical services department to search through the shipping containers stored in the vessels holds perettis office had finally gotten to father vatutins request and now he found himself following the broad back of a floreria the workman wore crisp coveralls and had a pair of white gloves tucked into his belt for handling the more fragile objects while the worker strode with armswinging ease vatutin shambled down a carpeted hallway with one hand brushing the wall for balance although the ship was rock steady his mouth brimmed with saliva they descended into the working section of the liner where the hallways were sterile and narrow and the lighting came from institutional fluorescent fixtures affixed to the ceiling the air had a humid chill that told vatutin they had moved below the water line at a set of large watertight doors the floreria exchanged a few words with the swiss guards stationed there and produced a ring of keys from his pocket a sign on the door proclaimed this to be cargo hold as the workman unlocked and then opened the door one guard made a joke that vatutin believed was at his expense and the others laughed he didnt care his chest felt hollow and as he stepped into the vast hold his pace involuntarily slowed he couldnt believe he had come this far in a few moments he was about to end his lifetime quest vatutin couldnt possibly put into words what he was feeling everything he saw took on an added dimension of holiness it didnt matter that the dimly lit hold was like an industrial warehouse that managed to smell musty despite its newness he felt he was walking into the greatest cathedral in the world a sacred place because of what lay within the floreria spat on the floor and vatutin almost struck him before realizing that this man had no idea what he was about to give back to its rightful owner no anatoly thought there is no rightful owner except satan himself i am nothing more than a temporary trustee checking a large manifest the worker guided the priest through the rows of containers and boxes perettis organization had been impeccable the manifest detailed everything from the largest painting to the smallest set of prayer beads after a moment they were in front of a steel shipping container the floreria produced his keys again and unlocked the mammoth crate he waited while vatutin unfolded the seventyyearold photograph of the icon he was here to recover the picture was stained in one corner with brown spots that even the priest didnt know was blood taking the photo and motioning vatutin not to enter the container the workman ducked inside snapping on a small flashlight hed carried in his other pocket he returned in just a few minutes the icon was only about two feet long and one foot wide yet the floreria staggered under its weight it was nearly six inches thick vatutin knew immediately that this was the relic he sought the workman laid it on a nearby table although vatutin took back the photograph he didnt need it to verify the pieces authenticity he knew the icon better than any man alive he could reproduce it in his mind any time he chose from where it had been created near the city of vanavara anatoly vatutin had traced the artifacts centurylong journey to st petersburg to stalingrad to berlin and finally to rome it had entered a thousand dreams and kept him awake on a thousand nights he knew it better than his own face unlike most icons this was no wooden painting covered by a gold veneer the relic was almost solid gold he traced his finger over the basrelief of the virgin mary holding her crucified son noting the distinctive drape of her robe and the vividness of christs wounds especially the blood that leaked from his side he bent close to study the mark over marys shoulder verifying that it was indeed a faint comets tail anatoly vatutin fell to his knees his seasickness and every other hardship hed endured for the past forty years forgotten he prayed harder than at any time in his life giving thanks to god christ mary and brother grigori his decades of exacting research had been correct the icon had ended up in the vatican following the second world war given to them by a mistaken american soldier working for a repatriation commission it had been one of thousands of items looted by the german army and returned to the wrong owners after the war he was physically exhausted by the time he got back to his cabin his muscles aching from the effort of carrying the icon from the hold his spirit however had never felt more invigorated he laid the icon on his bed the mattress springs protesting at such a dense object tossing aside the clothes at the top of his trunk he removed the chainmail garments fashioned for brother grigori first he opened the special flask at the bottom of the chest the liquid inside was as clear as water it was actually heavy water or deuterium a substance used for handling the most dangerous elements on earth he could only hope it would add protection for him from an element that was not of this world lying in the deuterium bath was a hammer and a sixinch molybdenum awl he went to the bathroom and retrieved an item from his toilet case the fact that a man who hadnt shaved since his teens owned an electric razor was one more inconsistency he was thankful had not been noticed of course it wasnt a razor at all he needed to strip to his undershirt to put on the leadarmored mantle he used a liberal amount of petroleum jelly to work his hands into the golden gloves before donning the priceless gold hood he tested his grip on the hammer and awl and made sure that the golden plug that hed had in his pocket matched the diameter of the spike he was ready he pulled the icon off the bed and groaned as he lowered it into the pan at the bottom of the trunk ensuring that the artifact was fully awash with deuterium he brought the cordless razor close to it and turned it on satisfied when nothing happened hed know in a moment if his crusade was successful again he prayed placing the metal spike over christs heart at the center of the icon anatoly vatutin lowered the hoods visor over his eyes took a deep breath and brought down the hammer with all his strength quickly he checked the razor again dismayed that it hadnt reacted hands trembling he replaced the tip of the spike in the dimple his first blow had created and hammered it again this time the razor emitted a steady series of clicks coming so close together they sounded like a continuous tone the instrument was a disguised geiger counter and it had just encountered a radiation source unlike any on the planet considering the origin of the radiation anatoly hadnt been sure if the device would work balanced between elation and fear he fumbled for the small plug and set it in the scar bringing down the hammer to seat it properly the geiger counter fell silent once again father vatutin chanced rolling up his visor so he could accurately tap the plug more firmly in place only then did he look at the counter through three inches of gold the second densest natural element in the universe and several more inches of a fluid meant to absorb radiation the device had registered a dose that equaled a lifetime worth of x rays he swept the geiger counter over the trunk and the cabins walls as predicted by grigori and later proved by another brother leonid the radiation had not been absorbed by inorganic material it was only when he pointed the counter at his own hand that it began to click again the exposure had been less than five seconds yet would likely rob vatutin of a few years of life enshrined within the icon and protected by an abnormal reaction it had with gold was a fragment of what the brotherhood called satans fist anatoly knew that hundreds maybe thousands of people had been victims of this piece or the others like it the realization that he now possessed the power to kill everyone on the sea empress made him shudder from brotherhood records anatoly knew that before brother grigori was murdered he had amassed fifty such icons in vanavara and all but one had been destroyed later by brother leonid this was the last one he tidied the cabin hiding his protective clothing in the trunk once again he was too emotionally wasted to finish his mission in fact he was ravenously hungry and checked his watch thinking that maybe he would finally venture out for dinner before he took care of his bodys needs he had to pray thankful for his success anatoly vatutin knew that his mission would be a wasted gesture if another endeavor far from the exclusive confines of the cruise ship failed the brotherhood didnt yet have all elements of satans fist there was still one other source georesearch station greenland this is not a point of debategreta schmidt snapped if you had been here when the communication window opened you would have heard that the danish government is calling for your evacuation it is not a georesearch decision marty bishops face reddened another shade and im sure you did everything in your power to argue our case he said sarcastically what case she scoffed while her arms were crossed in a defensive posture her attitude and tone were belligerent werner koenig was at her side as they stood over the dining table he said nothing two people were almost killed this morning and camp decade your whole reason for being here is a smoldering hole in the ice we can still go down there once it cools marty sputtered mr bishop there is nothing left she seemed to be enjoying herself as she showed more and more control over the expedition in the past days her once attractive features had turned as hard as the ice outside in contrast koenig seemed to have physically shrunk since establishing the base the fire dr mercer accidentally started destroyed it mercer had told that lie shortly after their rescue as a delaying tactic anika had agreed to go along with the deception because she was equally determined to discover the real arsonist and murderer had they told werner and greta that it had been intentionally set they were certain that georesearch would have ordered them from the ice as a safety precaution which as it turned out was happening anyway mercers expression remained unchanged when she looked at him her face made ugly by a superior smirk then why he asked deliberately are you also sending away erwin puhl dr klein and the other members of their team the loss of camp decade doesnt affect their research without igor bulgarin to lead them dr puhl has done nothing but sit in his room the other two meteorologists havent accomplished much of anything either and dr klein has no function here no real job except for some foolish interest in stress research with you and puhls team gone she has nothing to study besides she is only here because of bulgarins insistence mercer opened his mouth to reply but stopped himself that last fact was something new igor had made it sound like anika had been the one to petition him to join their expedition schmidts statement meant it was the other way around while he hadnt gotten the impression that she knew more than shed admitted he wondered again if she did when he thought about it she hadnt told him much of anything about herself or her interest in coming to greenland werner spoke for the first time there is no reason to continue this conversation tomorrow morning the weather is going to clear for a few hours and the dc that came out a couple days ago will return to take you back to reykjavik i am sorry this according to the same weatherman who sent a chopper into a hurricane ira asked sardonically greta glared mercer wondered what werner koenig had ever seen in her he was easygoing and caring and seemed like a dedicated scientist she strode around the camp like a dictator he suspected that dating the new owner of georesearch had somehow changed her because he couldnt imagine a guy like werner ever loving the woman she was now he cleared his mind of unnecessary speculation and concentrated on the problem at hand he cocked a questioning eye at marty this is your show what do you think my father shelled out a ton of money for this expedition he wont be happy but since camp decades gone theres no real reason to hang out here ira because ira knew more about what was going on mercer was confident how the exnavy man would vote lasko cracked his knuckles before answering i say we get back to reykjavik have ourselves a decent nights sleep and call mr bryce in new york i think hell have us back here in a matter of hours theres still a lot we can do not all the base was burned greta watched the vote but didnt wait for mercer to voice his opinion this isnt a democracy you are being ordered back to iceland the plane will be here in the morning you will be on it when it leaves she turned to go werner paused for a second looking apologetic he was about to speak when he closed his mouth and followed her out of the mess hall the societys team was left to themselves at their table there were a few others scattered around the mess mostly scientists whod shown no interest in the argument mercer went to get a cup of coffee ingrid the cooks assistant who was sleeping with marty motioned him into the kitchen when no one appeared to be looking standing with her was hilda brandt the other assistant chef a heavy woman shed learned her craft in the german army but her skills had improved since then both looked anxious i heard what just happened ingrid said in her delightful lisping accent that witch is also sending away the contract employees me and hilda you dont work for georesearch no only the head chef is their employee we work for a commercial catering company the implication was clear after tomorrow the only people left here are actual georesearch staff ja just what the danish government wanted to avoid mercer thought thanks for the info he returned to the table accepting a shot from iras flask to fortify his coffee he was quiet for a moment his gaze lost in the black pool swirling in his ceramic cup you with us mercer ira asked for what its worth i think iras idea has the most merit they looked at him waiting for him to continue the fire that leveled camp decade and nearly killed anika and me wasnt an accident you started it on purpose marty cried nearly coming out of his chair quiet down mercer said i didnt start it anika ira asked she was with me the whole time mercer shook his head it was started deliberately by the same person who murdered igor bulgarin jaws dropped around the table igor was murdered marty finally gasped mercer explained anikas findings concluding that the fire was most likely set by the murderer to cover his trail he had probably seen mercer and anika headed toward the underground facility realized that they might be trying to prove the murder and started a fire that would trap them ira did you get a chance to check the doors leading into the camp when you were fighting the blaze i suspect they were chained shut to prevent us from escaping if we somehow managed to reach them there was too much smoke coming up the access shaft we never got down that far before you were found by erwin damn that would have been the proof i needed sorry none of us were looking for evidence it was my fault mercers voice was thick with selfrecrimination i forgot to go back after the diesel tank blew up if theyd been locked the killers had plenty of time to remove the chain whyd you say my idea has the most merit because ingrid just told me that she and hilda are being evacuated with us georesearch is going to have this whole place to themselves a situation theyve wanted all along when we land in iceland im calling charlie bryce hes got the leverage to get us back out here why bother marty said none of this has anything to do with us i dont like leaving unsolved mysteries mercer replied and i especially dont let people trying to kill me get away with it because of the solarmax effect we cant communicate with anyone which means until im in reykjavik i cant get the answers i want georesearch isnt what its pretending to be and charlies the only person i know who can find out who they really are and just because igor was a virtual stranger doesnt mean i wont find the son of a bitch who murdered him mercer decided he would also contact dick henna he hated using his friendship with the director of the fbi but since he was looking into a murder this was more than a personal request if bryce couldnt find out what georesearch was up to henna certainly could what are you now a cop or something no i just dont hide behind my father while people are dying around me the fury in mercers eyes made marty look away guiltily it wasnt bishop he was particularly angry with in other circumstances he would agree with him but this situation had mercer on edge and anxious marty was just a convenient target to vent some of his bottled emotions you dont want to come back thats fine i am im with you ira said directing a long look at marty he was silent for just a few seconds but the change in him was profound mercer had hit his most vulnerable spot his fear that he couldnt live up to his father the accusation stung for his entire life marty bishop had argued that he didnt mind being under his fathers shadow and he would have shrugged off mercers comment but for the first time he was prepared to face it and himself here was a chance to go beyond what was expected of him and he wanted to take it shoulders squared he met mercers gaze and nodded looks like were both with you ira remarked having shepherded many young recruits onto the path of responsibility he poured a congratulatory dram from his flask into martys coffee that bishop was learning this lesson at fifty and not twenty was fine many people never learned it at all thanks before they returned from iceland mercer would tell marty about everything elisebet rosmunders warning the radioactivity in jack delaneys body the stowaway on the chopper and his own misgivings concerning igor bulgarin he wouldnt blame marty if he recanted his decision to return to the base the front door blew open and a bundled shape was propelled into the mess hall it was anika klein she shook snow off her parka and danced from foot to foot to remove her moon boots after slipping on a pair of sneakers and filling a coffee cup at the urn she came over to the table looks like i came at a bad time were being kicked out of here marty said she glanced at mercer because of the fire he nodded youre leaving too along with erwin and the others with him what why her dark eyes went from sympathy to anger in an instant the fire has nothing to do with my work they cant make me leave i paid georesearch nearly ten thousand dollars for my part of the expedition im not going anywhere whose idea is this greta claims its by order of the danish government is the radio working again she asked quickly not anymore the communication gear in the corner of the mess had been abandoned georesearch hadnt posted an operator to listen if the constant static that had assailed them for days would lift they had even locked the cabinet to prevent unauthorized use of the equipment as mercer studied the stack of electronics in the plexiglas case it occurred to him that only georesearch personnel had been around when any messages had come through his jaw hardened ira wheres the closest snocat the one i used to save you is parked between here and the main lab all the others are out on overnight survey for werners people be right back mercer stood and left the mess donning his parka but not bothering with the cumbersome moon boots his work boots would do for the thirtyyard walk he returned in a few minutes carrying a pair of heavy bolt cutters from the snocat strode right to the radio cabinet and snipped the lock as though it were tissue paper what the hell are you doing it just occurred to me that the radio only works when none of us are here could be a coincidence or maybe not he sat at the operators station and flicked on the main power switch the set was stateoftheart and came to life instantly one of the technicians whod been on the dc flight came over and grabbed mercers shoulder you cannot do this mercer smiled disarmingly wont be a minute i promise nein it is not permitted the radio returned nothing but white noise anika came over and said something in german to the irate lab worker a shouting match quickly developed mercer used her distraction to begin scanning frequencies he had a minute at most and every time the scan function paused at a frequency static burst from the speakers the georesearch technician saw and heard what mercer was attempting and reached over to kill the power he called to one of his own people mercer heard his name and that of greta schmidt the other worker threw on his coat and raced for the door i was done mercer said pushing back from the radio you didnt need to send for your den mother something about this crop of germans had bothered him from the time they stepped off the plane and now he saw what it was as scientists went the man standing over him had to be the toughest hed ever seen polar research was a hard field but this guy looked more like a soldier than a lab rat he was beardless and his brown hair wasnt much longer than a military buzz cut he had wide shoulders a deep chest and a rather dim expression he scowled down at mercer as if inviting a physical confrontation after a moment the german spat a curse and walked away mercer turned to anika i assume he just insulted my manliness yours and a few past generations also in case her walk back here hasnt cooled her off im going to my room before the abominable greta comes storming in i think we should all call it a night ira agreed their dormitory was on the opposite side of the mess hall from the one the senior georesearch people used so they didnt run into her mercer asked ira to tell erwin puhl about the evacuation and walked down the buildings central hallway to his room once hed decided he needed sleep his exhaustion nearly overwhelmed him his stamina had held him together through anikas autopsies the fire and the escape but he was at his limit for whatever reason georesearch didnt want anyone at their base and they were playing their final hand by forcing the two teams thrust on them to leave greenland mercer was determined to learn why he harbored the suspicion that this evacuation had nothing to do with the danes he wasnt convinced that his failure to pick up any broadcasts meant the radio was being blocked by atmospherics it could have been altered somehow to stop others from reaching the outside world he was impotent until they reached reykjavik there were no locks on the dorm room doors so he pushed against his and crossed the threshold he stopped dead while not exactly torn apart his quarters had been thoroughly searched his bed had been stripped and the mattress pushed off its frame the contents of his luggage lay strewn around the space the geiger counter was left on the single plastic chair as if the searcher had studied it before leaving stunned mercer knew there was no way this was random the vandals had been looking for something specific and he was sure they hadnt found it from a compartment in his wallet he removed the folded piece of paper hed recovered from jack delaney it was a map of sorts with accurate lines of longitude and latitude in the center was a pencil drawing of the crashed c and off to the left was another drawing of what appeared to be camp decade as it had been fifty years ago with a number of chimneys and air vents poking from the snow on the right side of the map was an x with a drawing of a mans hooknosed profile above it the distance from the mysterious mark to the plane was given as twentyeight kilometers in a direct magnetic heading of degrees if the map was done to any sort of scale delaney had walked nearly three hundred kilometers from the plane to camp decade on the same azimuth an amazing feat of endurance the only other item mercer had that could interest anyone was the bundle of papers forwarded to him by harry white which he also carried in the inside cargo pocket of his parka because they were written in german the only thing mercer had managed to decipher from the pages was their authorship by a man named otto schroeder his first thought that someone from georesearch had rifled his room dissolved as soon as it came to him the undeniable fact was that anika klein was the only person whod shown any interest in the bundle of papers she was also the only one other than him to know about the scrap of paper even if she hadnt yet learned it was a map ira mercer shouted down the hall yeah can you come over here whats up did the vodka fairy visit and leave you a present just pop over and bring erwin coming dear ira appeared at mercers side and peered into the ruin that was his room i like what youve done with the place wish i could say i did it myself but this was someone elses decorating job mercer turned to puhl how are you doing erwin oh ah fine puhl mumbled he looked terrible what little hair he had was awry and his glasses hadnt been cleaned in a while his breath reeked of stale alcohol what happened here i was hoping you could tell me mercer said gently recognizing how fragile the meteorologist appeared his grief over igor bulgarins death had deepened youve been here for most the night did you hear or see anyone enter my room looking like he was about to lie puhl thought better of it ive been in the bathroom for a while he admitted i got drunk a while ago and wanted to sober up i think i used everyones hotwater ration thats fine mercer soothed you didnt hear anyone over the sound of the shower i dont think so i dont remember i fell asleep for a while erwin looked down miserably ashamed actually i passed out dont worry about it mercer smiled touching the scientist on the arm why dont you go pack for tomorrow ill give you a hand in a minute poor guy is reeling ira said after erwin returned to his room when i went in to tell him were being booted he just sat there staring at his bible i never saw him and igor as being that close theres no proper way to mourn mercer stated i get the impression youve been there a few times yourself yeah a silence hung for a second since it wasnt the vodka fairy making a delivery any other suspects mercer gave a quick laugh thankful that ira had broken the black mood coming over him my list includes our arsonistmurderer but im betting on the lovely though enigmatic dr klein what about the stowaway from her chopper i dont believe there was a stowaway after all so who left those footprints at the crash site i think anika did when she went to bury something out there im guessing some mail that was actually addressed to me mercer held up the envelope that harry had sent with the joke name on it she missed this one because ive got a friend who fancies himself a comedian ira was quiet as he absorbed this if youre right what does that mean about the rest of her actions here i mean if she steals your mail and ransacks your room lying about igor being murdered would be a much gentler crime mercer looked down the hall to make sure erwin was still out of earshot the last thing he needed in his brittle state was to learn the truth about bulgarin i dont know should be an interesting conversation on the plane back to iceland though ira chuckled if you think you can talk on a dc its obvious youve never been on one those things are louder than hell and thats before you get airborne mercer turned serious i want to thank you for backing me in the mess hall and for everything else youve done so far youve had no reason to trust me and yet you have lasko looked abashed dont sweat it twenty years in the navy trained me to follow an officers orders but ive never been an officer mercer pointed out which means ira said you actually know what youre talking about thanks mercer guessed that receiving a compliment from ira lasko had the same odds as winning a lottery what about you what was your rank when you got out nothing but a lowly chief the submariner dismissed clean up your room ill give erwin a hand pulling himself back together and find the two other guys from his team whore getting the heaveho ira turned to go then paused at the door mercer yeah you have any idea whats going on here honestly mercer didnt need to think about his answer no clue roaring in from the east the antique dc dakota shattered the peace of the morning the weather had cleared for the first time in days the sky was nearly cloudless and the wind was a negligible caress according to the experts the calm wouldnt last for more than an hour or so it was barely eight which meant the pilot must have left iceland before dawn to reach the base so early those leaving for reykjavik were assembled in the mess hall and had a view of the makeshift landing strip werner had had a crew out at first light to plow aside the drifts of snow that had accumulated overnight no one from georesearch was waiting with the evacuees it was as if they had already left our chariot awaits ira said trying to make light of the situation but the attempt fell flat i hate leaving so much gear behind marty complained for the tenth time werner had spoken with him that morning about the need to load the plane quickly and assured him that once they had a proper weather window the plane would return all surveyors society equipment to iceland koenig had said the delay wouldnt be more than a day or two and georesearch would pay any additional fees incurred by the arrangement well be back by noon tomorrow mercer said if were not anika klein chimed in im suing georesearch for my money we all are marty agreed his fathers investment was twenty times hers ingrid approached the crowded table not sure how to greet marty outside her bedroom guten morgen morning marty boomed adding a significant look you all packed up and ready to go ja hilda und i are ready but neither is happy welcome to the club we were just deciding the lawsuits but it is danes who said we have to leave not georesearch hilda heard radio earlier this morning when greta schmidt spoke with office in reykjavik you heard them mercer asked leaning forward intently he directed his gaze at hilda brandt whom he saw standing a little behind the younger slimmer cook she blushed ja ingrid answered for her friend she heard her speaking to a danish official from their embassy in iceland it sounded like danes want entire facility shut down for good mercers immediate reaction was to think the conversation had been faked greta could have easily been speaking to one of her own people pretending to be a danish diplomat staging the conversation so hilda would overhear it would help convince the societys team that she was innocent of ordering their removal from greenland and then he thought he was being paranoid even if the evac order is legit he said at last im still going to fight it when we get to iceland anika was at the window for a better look at the landing the planes down and i can see werner motioning to us then i guess this is it mercer got to his feet and everyone followed their luggage had already been ferried to the landing strip so they trooped out like a defeated army trudging through newly fallen snow in the worn paths even at low idle the sound from the planes engines was deafening a blizzard of ice particles blew around the spinning props both pilots were on the far side of the aircraft relieving themselves in the snow once they reboarded the aircraft mercer saw bernhardt hoffmann the young worker nearly asphyxiated in camp decade and a passenger he didnt recognize jump from the rear door even with his feet encumbered by tall boots the stranger moved through the snow as if born to it like a wolf greta schmidt cried out when she saw him and ran into his embrace this had to be the sometimeboyfriend werner had mentioned greta who was nearly as tall as mercer vanished in his arms the man was huge he had the hood of his black snowsuit down around his wide shoulders so mercer could see that his nose had a misshapen look that only came from being broken they stayed away from the evacuees as they waited for their turn to climb the ladder into the plane werner koenig did come over to mercer to relay the message greta had gotten that morning from the office in reykjavik about the danish attache if he was lying about the conversation his performance was oscar quality the danes are adamant about nonessential people leaving until they can send someone to determine if our facility is safe he shouted over the growl of the old dakotas radial engines what about your team mercer held his mouth close to koenigs ear most of them are out with the core drill taking samples im hoping a safety inspector will be sent soon so i dont have to recall them and lose a few days of work so were your sacrificial goats to denmarks bureaucracy werner shrugged im sorry my hands are tied if he was telling the truth mercer could understand koenigs position all right he said no sense blaming the messenger anika was right in front of him at the boarding ladder when mercer turned to take perhaps his last look at the camp if not for traces of cooking smoke rising from the back of the mess hall and the generator enveloped in its own exhaust the base would have looked completely deserted the only motion came from the breeze lofting wisps of snow like dust in an old western movie mercer felt like whistling the theme from high plains drifter greta schmidt caught his eye she must have said something to her companion because he strode over to the plane cutting the distance in a few strides in a burst of vindictiveness mercer went up the ladder so the german would have to stand in the buffeting prop wash if he wanted to speak with him he tapped anika on the shoulder before the georesearch official reached the hatch would you save me a seat id like to talk to you anika stared at him for a second a shadow of apprehension behind her fixed smile okay you are philip mercer the germans accent wasnt bad but he spoke in a low rasping snarl as if afflicted by a terminal case of laryngitis im mercer neither man made a move to shake hands there was an instant antagonism between them it was instinctive the coming together of two rival animals im gunther rath i recently had a nice talk with elisebet rosmunder she gave me something to give to you its taped to the bulkhead behind the cockpit before slamming the door closed the man gave mercer an ugly smile and said have a good flight what the hell was that all about mercer turned to find a seat and slammed into anika who hadnt yet moved from the entrance she looked terrified im sorry he tried to help her to her feet at the same moment the pilot gave the engines a burst of power to begin taxiing they both fell back into the slush left melting on the cabin floor the pilots voice came over the tinny speaker mounted in the ceiling his icelandic accent made more unintelligible by the motors thunderous bellow sorry about that with another weather system moving in i want to get back in the air as quickly as possible there isnt even time to unload the supplies we brought as the dc bounced over the uneven glacier mercer fought to get anika and himself into a seat and belted in he thought hed hurt her when they bumped because her normally pale face was as white as the snow outside and her eyes refused to focus he took her hand and found it quivering anika i know that man she said as if in a trance i recognized his voice i dont think he realized who i am then she broke out of it the wellspring of determination hed seen during the fire in camp decade rushed back her grip tightened did you get the package from otto schroeder mercer blinked stunned that she all but admitted her guilt so it was you who searched my room yes anika replied defiantly did you get it as a matter of fact i did it suddenly occurred to him that she couldnt know who had sent the package because it hadnt left his sight since harry had forwarded it how do you know otto schroeder anika paused as the planes skis came unstuck from the ice and the dc strained into the air i watched that man back there order his death georesearch station greenland as soon as the hatch closed and the dc began lumbering across the ice greta took gunther rath by the hand and led him toward her quarters at an urgent pace he knew by the predatory gleam in her eye what she wanted and his need surpassed hers however now was not the time he snatched his arm away after a few steps later greta his voice was made harsher by the suppression of his own desires we dont have time yes we do she breathed her hand reaching for his groin not caring if others saw it has been far too long not for me he snapped with intentional cruelty which only seemed to inflame her more ive had to deal with werners sulking for a week were going to my room right now and you are going to screw me until i cant walk keep this up and im taking you back to your room to slap you unconscious you can do that too she simpered demurely reveling in the presence of his overwhelming strength it was the old game they were playing and invariably she would win she knew his needs far outstripped hers and the longer he held out the more violent and satisfying was their eventual sex the heat between her legs grew with anticipation touching his groin again she could feel him swelling this time rath couldnt stop himself he grabbed her by the arm which is your dorm building greta knew not to gloat she lowered her eyes and pointed she wondered who had seduced whom last year when the company gunther represented negotiated to buy georesearch at the time she had been with werner for nearly two years happy and yet couldnt explain why she was putting off his marriage proposals they lived a vagabond existence aboard the njoerd working wherever his contracts took them in all it had been satisfying but somehow she felt she was being rushed to normalcy werner wanted children and a home to come back to from his voyages greta had mouthed she wanted those things too and knew she was lying she didnt know what she wanted and then gunther rath had come into their lives with a blank check and the promise of noninterference in the company hed said purchasing georesearch was merely an investment for kohl ag a way for them to defer taxes shed known from the first that the expensive suits he wore hid something far different from his corporate image he retained the unstudied social disdain of the wannabe rebels who had thrilled her and her girlfriends as teenagers but grownup and with a lot more to offer than exciting rides on shoddy motorcycles and small bags of lowgrade marijuana at that first meeting when werner stared wideeyed at the figures rath was willing to pay for georesearch greta found herself showing off nothing obvious nothing that werner would even detect but gunther had known it the way a lion can sense a female in estrus whenever the three would meet in the weeks it took to sign over the company greta had thought she was just playing a game to see how far she could push the flirtation but like any game without rules she had to act more brazen to elicit the same animal reaction shed felt the first day she believed she was controlling him with her ploys not once realizing she was manipulating herself into what he wanted in the end when she was nearly throwing herself at him he had finally sought her out allowing her to think that she had done the seducing but now a year later knowing what their relationship had become she realized he had gone to her only to prove his dominion the relationship was almost that of master and slave and she found herself greedy for any degradation he heaped on her at the dorm she first made sure the building was empty a minute later they were naked in her room with no others around to hear the slaps or the cries of pain and climax raths practiced hands did not leave marks where they were visible but it would be a while before greta could sit comfortably while she cleaned up in satisfied euphoria gunther rath searched for werner koenig and found him in the mess hall with dieter the rally driver whats the status of the search werner looked up feeling the old pang of jealousy he could tell by raths expression that hed just taken greta since the day shed left him werner had held out hope that some vestiges of his former lover remained he knew now that wasnt the case rath had reduced her to nothing more than a vessel for his warped dysfunctions the oncesweet greta had become a whore yet he continued to mourn the loss of the woman who might have been his wife making it worse rath had insisted she come along on this expedition to be his eyes and ears werner suspected that rath enjoyed this humiliation more than anything else it was the kind of primitive behavior that would appeal to his neanderthal mentality three teams have been out for a few days now but as you suspected we are too far south to find anything with the others gone gunther said we can end this charade and move a portion of the base northward i passed on the fake weather report to the pilot of the dc so theyll swing far to the north before turning to iceland theyll never see the rotorstat flying in to ferry us how is that possible the airship is under tight flight guidelines until it receives its certification because its owned by one of kohls subsidiaries we can do anything with it we want it should be here in another couple of hours there actually is a fog prediction for this area thatll last for at least a day so moving a building and the cats is going to be tricky it should be a good demonstration of the airships capabilities with the surveyors society out of the way we have two and a half weeks until their replacements arrive and we have to return everything back here damn danish government dieter said he was actually a longtime kohl employee if they hadnt amended our permit none of this would be necessary we should have fought them harder when they told us to move our operation to camp decade to accommodate the americans if wed argued they might have barred us from greenland completely by his tone it was clear rath didnt want to debate the point again pressure against kohl in europe is mounting we have to find the cavern werner didnt want to hear how the recent buyers of georesearch had perverted his company for their own ends he had agreed to sell at the overvalued price because rath and a battery of kohl lawyers had assured him that georesearch would continue to operate as it had in the past he was told they would do nothing to damage the hardwon reputation hed built for clear scientific research that promise had lasted until this mission just one year later trapped now by a moment of greed he and georesearch were being corrupted by gunther rath and his boss klaus raeder for a mission werner didnt fully understand he had no idea why they were searching for a cavern or what was inside nor did he care he just wanted the operation to be over so they would give him his company back and leave him alone werner you dont look well rath mocked i was just thinking how glad ill be when you are gone it wont take us long once we finish clearing out the cave our interest in georesearch is over your company will continue under the kohl umbrella but in a much less handson role what happens if you dont find the cavern before the next team of researchers arrives from japan for their sake lets pray we do rath looked out the window in the direction the dc had vanished go make preparations to move a dorm building and snocats bern hoffmann was stationed in the communications alcove a pair of sleek headphones covering his ears hed just finished rewiring a couple circuit boards and was replacing an access panel at the back of the set rath walked over and touched his shoulder to draw his attention have you fixed our solarmax problem just about gunther while he used raths christian name there was subordination in hoffmanns voice like most of the people at the base he was actually part of raths security force there are legitimate atmospheric problems but nothing like what we led the surveyors society to believe we can communicate with the njoerd just fine and youre sure the planes radios are dead while the pilots were outside the aircraft rath had watched as the young technician sabotaged the radios i doubt the pilots will realize theyve been wrecked until theyre halfway to iceland which is as far as theyll get anikas statement extinguished any anger mercer had been harboring even when they were facing the fire in camp decade he hadnt seen such naked fear she was like a raw nerve exposed and pained by admitting that she had searched his room he no longer had a reason to doubt her she hadnt gotten the name otto schroeder from him which meant she had additional information from another source information that he needed he said nothing studying her with his depthless gray eyes a patient nonjudgmental scrutiny that invited her to continue emotion continued to play across her face as she struggled to regain her composure he knew she was deciding how to overcome her natural suspicion and take him in her confidence only the forward half of the dcs open cabin had seats the rear portion was given over to cargo which lay under mesh netting secured to eyebolts in the floor mercer and anika were in the rearmost seats forward sat marty and ingrid who were talking with their heads almost touching ira was a couple rows behind them looking around nostalgically obviously transported to another time and place by the utilitarian aircraft the remainder of the passengers either stared out the square windows or had already settled in to a book anika please mercer said as gently as the rattling aircraft would allow i think between the two of us we know whats going on but alone we know nothing we have to share if were going to figure out who killed igor and why he had already assumed a connection between bulgarins murder and otto schroeders anika looked into his face searching for the strength she hoped he possessed because hers was gone everything had come full circle too quickly hearing schroeders killer outside just now had abolished any desire she had for justice she wanted to run from all of this to go to vienna to be with her opa he would know what to do i hadnt heard of otto schroeder until i opened the package from germany mercer continued his gaze never leaving anikas eyes although the plane pitched and vibrated i was warned by an email before i left the states that something was being sent i had no idea what it was i still dont this journal schroeder sent me is written in german you havent read it anika asked it was a neutral question one that gave nothing away i can barely read english mercer joked but anika didnt respond all the german words i know are either food related or naughty what did that man say when you got on the plane there was a sudden urgency in her voice she had a premonition that this wasnt the time to compare notes not yet anyway there was a more pressing issue there were now two murderers at the base camp and she was beginning to see conspiracies behind everything he told me his name is gunther rath and wished us a good flight we dont have time to go into the whys wheres and hows but that man put a bullet in my leg last week and presided over the torture of otto schroeder an old soldier i was interviewing for my grandfather just before schroeder died he mentioned your name and said you were someone who could help it cant be a coincidence that you me and rath are in the same place at the same time weve all been manipulated does rath know schroeder was going to send me something no hed been driven away by snipers mercers eyes widened remind me to ask you the whole story sometime rath probably didnt recognize you because everyone looks the same under ten layers of clothes yet you still think hes a threat dont you mercer did but he didnt know how immediate a threat it wasnt a great leap of deductive reasoning to guess that rath was working with igor bulgarins killer greta schmidt possibly but unimportant right now he put himself in their position and knew the murderers first priority would be to eliminate all traces of the crime the physical evidence igors body lay unguarded at the base and the only two people who had firsthand knowledge of the killing were on the same antique plane with another convenient fire in the cold laboratory and a plane crash the killers would be in the clear mercer didnt forget that gunther rath had been on the dc while the pilots were peeing in the snow and then he remembered rath mentioning elisebet rosmunder he unstrapped his seat belt and ran for the cockpit if his sudden hunch was wrong no harm done but if he was right taped to the bulkhead was a manila envelope he tore it away from the wall unsealing it with trembling fingers he tipped out the contents photographs the first was the shot of mrs rosmunders son stefansson before his illfated trip to greenland the second was the one a nurse took shortly before his death and the third picture mercer balled in his fist after just a glance the bullet hole in the old womans forehead was like an obscene third eye the rage began someplace deep inside and he let it come let it grow until it filled every fiber and nerve he vibrated with it for long seconds he allowed it to consume him like an internal fire waiting for that moment of transmutation when rage became hate and it came too sharper than any hed felt before unfocused anger was corrosive worthless but the hate was a weapon he could control the ability to harness it was the gift that had allowed him to face so much ugliness in the past without destroying his soul he looked down the length of the cabin knowing that his responsibility lay here his revenge for mrs rosmunders murder would come once he was sure these people were safe the door separating the cockpit from the rest of the plane was open out the windscreen mercer could see that the black ocean far below them was dotted with icebergs as murderous a sea as hed ever seen the pilots were both young icelanders dressed in vintagelooking bomber jackets have you been in touch with anyone on the radio mercer asked his voice calmer than it had any right to be if communications had been intentionally blacked out at the camp he was sure rath would have interfered with them here too sir you should be in your seat the copilot said automatically this crate wasnt designed for stability just tell me if your radios work mercers urgency prompted the pilot to dial reykjavik tower papa sierra to reykjavik come in please the headphones he wore prevented mercer from hearing the reply but when the pilot repeated his call he knew there hadnt been one the pilot tried a third time before dialing another station and then another and another his glance at his copilot told mercer everything he needed to know the radios are dead arent they could be the solarmax effect weve been having problems for a while the attempted reassurance sounded flat dont bet on it mercer replied grimly how far are we from iceland about two hours with this head wind mercer doubted they had that much time not an option whats the closest airport kulusuk is a bit closer but were flying northeast to avoid a storm front we were told about at your research base in a few minutes iceland will be closer the trap had been set and theyd flown right into it there was no storm it was another fabrication like the danish evacuation order okay mercer think they didnt have time to damage the engines or contaminate the fuel supply so how would you crash a cargo plane with perhaps the greatest safety record in history the answer was as obvious as it was chilling a bomb theres no storm front he said forcing the terror out of his voice keep on course for iceland but be prepared to turn back because we may not have the time mercer returned to the cabin and prodded ira who had slumped against a skeletal frame member as if it were a pillow wake up we could have a problem stewardess forget your drink i think theres a bomb on the plane mercer didnt care that the others heard him they would know soon enough their search was systematic and quick after checking under all the seats and behind any removable panels in the cockpit and cabin they began shifting the stacks of cargo in the rear of the plane marty and anika were helping by this point while everyone else had been ordered to their seats their frightened stares never leaving the searchers mercer unhooked the netting over the last cargo pallet a neatly stacked pile of boxes at the very rear of the hold the cabins heaters couldnt overcome the chilling drafts and yet he was covered with sweat it felt like a lead weight had settled in his stomach he checked each box thoroughly before lifting it from the stack to hand to ira had the bomb been motion activated the plane would have exploded as soon as it began moving across the ice so his biggest concern was a booby trap around the device ira and anika were carefully examining the tape seals on the boxes to see if any had been opened but they hadnt found anything mercer reached the last carton he nearly missed the filament of wire running from a tiny hole in the cardboard to a bulkhead where it had been glued to the steel it was an antitampering wire designed to detonate the bomb if the box was moved got it he called both relieved and sickened the tape on the boxs lid had been slit open ira held the box steady while mercer lowered himself until the top of the carton was at eye level gingerly he opened one flap mindful that there could be another trip wire attached to its underside it appeared clear so he opened the other side anika gave a startled gasp and he nearly jostled the box rath had made a hollow in one corner of the container by removing a bundle of paper towels in their place was the bomb it consisted of six dynamite sticks bundled with tape and a hightech detonator held in place by wires and more tape the trip wire attached to the plane disappeared into the side of the activator so mercer couldnt tell how it was pretensioned cutting the wire or moving the bomb could conceivably obliterate the plane the led numbers spinning backward in a window at the top of the device read sixtyeight minutes twelve seconds eleven seconds ten seconds you can deactivate it right anika asked hopefully youre a mining engineer you know all about explosives ah no mercers voice caught in his throat and he had to swallow heavily to clear it i dont know the first thing about bombs ira any suggestions land marty go tell the pilot we have a bomb on board and well never make it to reykjavik have him turn back to greenland what happens when we return to the georesearch camp anika asked raths trying to kill us now whats to stop him from just doing it later mercer made sure that ira had a firm grip on the box before he stood bracing himself as the dc went through a steep banking turn because were not going back to the base give ira a hand packing stuff around the bomb so it doesnt shift and pull the trip wire were not out of this fight yet the plan was a desperate one but as mercer reached his seat he felt there was a slim chance of hope because the dc was equipped with skis he wasnt worried about landing what concerned him was the amount of time they might be stranded on the ice once the bomb went off he doubted there would be enough of the plane to protect eleven people from the elements he had to find them shelter mercer had a location in mind but finding it depended on a man whod been dead for fifty years he unfolded the map hed recovered from major delaney and studied the figures the airman had penciled in mercers immediate urge was to tell the pilots the heading delaney had used to reach camp decade from the crash site finding the wreck would have been a simple geometry equation and it would have been wrong a fact largely ignored by modern navigators because of global positioning satellites and other artificial aids is that the magnetic north pole is not a stationary point it can migrate up to fifty miles in a single day and averages a northwestern drift of approximately nine miles every year earths iron core which generates the magnetic field is slightly out of phase with the rotation of the crust creating this observable movement to find the plane mercer had to factor fifty years worth of drift to delaneys heading a difference of about four hundred and fifty miles with a calculator and a pen he did the math as quickly as he could aware of the bombs remorseless countdown he could do nothing about delaneys estimate that hed walked three hundred kilometers to reach the abandoned air force facility once they established themselves above his route and began backtracking mercer could only hope they would spot his plane erwin had said a few days ago that the region around where mercer believed the c had crashed had less snow cover now than at any time in decades that was just one of the many lucky breaks they would need he felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up it was erwin puhl anything i can do get martys satphone erwin shook his head marty already tried it he cant get a lock on any satellites its the solar max in that case are you a praying man i am now me too the pilots didnt question mercers orders when he told them the new course to fly because he was the only person who had an idea how to save them he returned to the rear of the plane where ira marty and anika had buried the bomb under as much cargo as they could pack around it it was a makeshift redoubt but any bit would help how much time ira checked the timer on his digital watch fortyfive and a half minutes well be feet dry over greenland again in fifteen and over our target area a couple minutes after that doesnt give us much time marty pointed out if we dont find delaneys plane well still be able to put down and hope theres enough of this one left to sustain us we pulled some of the better food stores camping supplies and cooking fuel away from the bomb ira explained we can each grab an armload when we make a run for it good idea i hadnt thought about that dont thank me it was dr kleins idea mercer smiled at anika intelligent brave and quick thinking do you have any faults i get drunk on a single glass of wine you call that a fault mercer chuckled trying to reduce the gloom that had permeated the cabin i call that a reason for a weekend together in the napa valley anika made a face of mock horror ugh you americans sicken me the loire valley or nothing the banter didnt last the enormity of their situation overshadowed everything once they cleared the ramparts of the greenland coast mercer had everyone at a window watching the snow and ice and rock below even though they had a few more minutes before reaching delaneys reported path he wanted them accustomed to the rough topography so they were better prepared to spot anything anomalous to intercept delaneys route they had to fly thirty miles into the hinterland before swinging northnortheast back toward the coast at a shallow angle their altitude reduced to a thousand feet above the ground hunched between the pilots seats with the geiger counter in his hands mercer estimated they were about forty miles south of where the plane went down watching the terrain scroll under the dc everyone kept a lookout for a flash of sunlight striking a metallic surface or any unnatural straight edges like a wing as erwin had predicted there wasnt anywhere near the amount of new snow here as had been around the georesearch camp large patches of bare rock appeared at irregular intervals jagged peaks that showed above the ice there were still enough snowcovered sections to land the plane which also meant there was an increased possibility that the c had been buried as deeply as camp decade theyd know soon far ahead he could see a fjord carved deep into the ice sheet protected on all sides by sheer mountains a quick guess put the plane wreck just south of where the narrow bay terminated mercer checked his watch they had ten minutes before he would call off the search and order the pilots to land hed cut the margin as close as he could balancing the need to locate the wreck with the time it took to find a safe landing site mercer it was one of erwins teammates wilhelm treitschke seated immediately behind the lavatory ahead about four kilometers just before that rock that looks like a shark fin looking out the windshield mercer spotted the feature will described and concentrated on the shadow staining the clear ice in front of it for an instant he thought theyd found it the size was right and it had an airplanes cruciform shape but as he looked closer he could tell it was just a rocky projection that hadnt quite broken through the surface his mouth turned bitter good eyes but thats not it keep looking a minute later the copilot hit mercer on the shoulder with the back of his hand and pointed there near where a wall of mountains rose before falling off into the fjord was a piece of debris sticking up from the ice like a tombstone battered and bent by decades of glacial movement it was still recognizable as a section of an aircrafts wing there was another piece of wreckage sitting on top of a low ridge of stone maybe a hundred yards from it the shape of the mountain looming over the wreck indicated that the plane had had the added misfortune of coming down in an avalanche channel he imagined that when the c crashed in the s its impact must have triggered an avalanche that buried it hiding the wreckage from both air and ground searches but now with temperatures on the rise and record low snowfall the aircraft had melted out of its frozen tomb since this part of greenland went largely unexplored it was possible the plane had lain exposed for years the dial on the radiation monitor hadnt twitched since hed turned it on but mercer was still concerned that the old plane was contaminated hed earlier instructed the pilot that if they did find the aircraft to land no closer than three miles from it he looked at his watch again two minutes remained on his search timetable which gave them only twelve minutes to land and get clear of the dc he tapped the pilot pointed to the ground and went to the rear to strap in we found it he announced as he reached his seat were landing now everyone tighten your seat belts he sat next to anika in the last row of seats accepting a bundle of clothes to use as a cushion when they assumed the headdown crash position im scared she said as the pitch of the engines changed you shouldnt be what are the chances that you survive a helicopter crash only to die in a plane crash how can you be so calm im faking it dont forget this plane is designed to land on ice and snow and the pilots know what theyre doing well be fine a moment before the landing the copilot ordered the passengers to brace themselves mercer tucked his head into his lap grabbing the back of his thighs as tightly as he could he knew the landing would be rough and he thought he was prepared he wasnt none of them were flared nose up the dc skimmed the ground for a moment its skis hissing and banging across the uneven surface then one of them hooked into a hardened piece of ice the plane slammed hard a jarring impact that nearly tore the fuselage apart no longer moving in a straight line the aircraft skipped and skidded scrubbing off airspeed in a rapid deceleration that pitched the tail high amid the screams of the passengers was the explosive sound of the windscreens imploding a solid wall of snow filled the cockpit and erupted through the connecting door the two seats behind the bathroom tore free from the floor and launched themselves into a bulkhead wilhelm treitschke and his companion gert kreigsburg were crushed against the metal wall their necks snapping in identical pops as its momentum expended the tail of the dc dropped to the ground in a wrenching crash that bent the airframe and blew open the rear hatchway the plane finally came to an uneven stop the lash of cold air whipping into the cabin revived mercer he looked behind him ira had done a remarkable job securing the cargo despite the violence of the crash the stack of crates hadnt shifted under the netting and pulled the trip wire mercer unbuckled his lap belt and stood swaying against a wave of nausea the sounds assaulting his ears were pitiable several people were still screaming in pain and fear while others sobbed uncontrollably worse was the silence from the front of the plane the wall of snow filled the door leading to the cockpit buried somewhere inside were the pilots weve got two minutes mercer bellowed hoping to galvanize the survivors with his voice each word felt like a hammer pounding against his temples he ached everywhere anyone who can move grab a bundle of supplies and get the hell away ira lasko was the first to find his feet he had to lift erwin puhl from his seat and hold him steady for a moment before they each took handfuls of gear and disappeared outside come on anika youre next mercer tugged at her seat belt freeing her im okay she said groggily a trickle of blood escaping from her hairline where shed hit her head against the seat back in front of her weve got to add lucky to your list of attributes we made it mercer said before turning serious can you get out on your own i think so it was clear that she couldnt ira mercer yelled out i need a hand in here ira dashed back to the plane to help anika and unload more gear while mercer went forward to check on marty ingrid and hilda he didnt need to check the two meteorologists or pilots their fate was all too apparent lets go marty mercer shouted when he reached his seat and then fell silent marty had pushed ingrid back in her seat and was trying to get her head to remain erect he couldnt the delicate bones in her neck were as pliable as rubber she was dead he looked up at mercer blankly mercers voice dropped we cant help her marty im sorry i think she looked up just as the plane hit he spoke with an unsettling monotone i even think i heard her neck break the clock was ticking can you get out by yourself yes i ah yes he stood and walked toward the rear exit as calmly as a seasoned passenger coming off a regular flight he was in shock the heavyset hilda who mercer recalled could move fiftypound bags of potatoes with one beefy arm was still folded over in the crash position her arms dangling to the floor he suspected she was dead until he saw that her shoulders were shaking there were only a few seconds left he roughly pushed her back in her seat and unhooked her belt the woman neither helped nor hindered his efforts she was unconscious and she weighed about two hundred pounds bending so he could dig a shoulder into her ample belly mercer heaved her limp body into a modified firemans carry and strained to straighten again his body had been pummeled by the accident and it protested every inch he rose but he managed to stand staggering to find his balance oh jesus he groaned moving down the aisle in a faltering lurch did you have to sample every dish you prepared on the way out the door he grabbed his leather sample bag by its strap ira had returned to the plane once again and helped mercer jump to the snow together they hefted the inert chef away they made it fifteen yards before the beeper on iras watch went off down he shouted and fell flat collapsing the woman and mercer the explosion was muffled by the cargo stacked around it and its detonative energy was concentrated on the far side of the aircraft still the concussion hit with enough force to suck the air out of mercers lungs bits of debris and a hail of snow pelted him as he lay over hilda to protect her from the worst of the blast the bomb was far enough from the fuel tanks that there were no secondary detonations which had been mercers biggest fear he looked over his shoulder as the rumble died away the entire tail assembly was twisted away from the remainder of the fuselage and the roof above the bomb had vanished such a blast during the flight would have dropped the dc out of the sky like a brick thankfully the explosion wasnt powerful enough to completely destroy the aircraft enough remained to provide shelter until they were rescued if they were rescued mercer felt something warm and wet on his cheek and he turned his head quickly the chef lying beneath him was awake and her mouth was pressed to him in a grateful kiss her voice was muffled but he could hear her muttering danke danke the harder mercer tried to lift himself from her the tighter she held him in an embrace she had a pleasant face he noticed and tears made her soft eyes look liquid but her mustache was thicker than his if he skipped a day of shaving she planted a long kiss on his mouth easily smothering his struggles to free himself taking advantage of a woman in such a vulnerable state ira teased when mercer finally regained his feet i expected more from you mercer smiled relieved at being alive despite the awful deaths of the pilots and the three others he would not give in to survivors guilt you okay lasko stood and brushed snow off his spare body i will be as long as she doesnt realize i helped save her we lost five ira including ingrid and we saved six the exsubmariner replied sagely dont think of the names just consider the numbers its the only way anika klein approached limping slightly shed smeared some of the blood on her head trying to stanch the flow she studied the wreckage before turning to mercer ive got a feeling that one of us is jinxed and i think its me if you knew what ive been through in the past couple of years youd know im the one with the bad juju mercer was only half joking hey ira can you check over the plane and make sure nothings on fire erwin how about an inventory of everything weve got thatll help us you got it what about me anika asked as the only doctor in our ranks who can actually doctor people youre in charge of our medical needs which begins with yourself your heads still bleeding then check on marty ingrid died in the crash and hes i dont know just check on him mercers next words were cut off by a shout from ira lasko he was kneeling on the halfburied nose of the plane scooping away snow as fast as he could one of the pilots is still alive marty bishop reacted quicker than any of the others racing to the entombed cockpit he pushed aside ira and attacked the snow clogging the windscreen as if frenzy alone could somehow expunge whatever he felt about ingrids death in moments he was able to thrust his upper body through the shattered glass and touch the leatherclad arm thrusting out of the snow and ice from the position of the arm it was the copilot who grabbed on to martys offered hand and refused to let go mercer and ira swung around the plane and approached the cockpit from the cabin using pieces of torn fuselage as shovels they began the laborious digging whenever they paused they could hear marty reassuring the stricken aviator through the snow it took twenty minutes to clear away enough of the frozen debris for anika klein to worm her way into the cockpit to administer whatever aid the copilot needed mercer she called from the hollow they had dug i need two lengths of metal or wood for a splint his arm is broken also get my bag ive got medical supplies in there ill need hilda had already retrieved the kit and passed it forward the next ten minutes passed in anxious silence punctuated once by a single shrill scream when anika reset the arm it seemed the despair over the deaths of the others had been suspended while she worked slowly anikas backside emerged from the cockpit as she half led half dragged the wounded man from where hed been trapped his arm was bandaged and strapped to his chest and the countless lacerations on his face had been cleaned shed already stitched closed the worst his skin was stained with antiseptic hes going to be fine ive got him pretty doped up she said hes got to be kept warm to minimize shock she turned to marty who had just entered the cabin from his vigil outside i need someone to stay with him are you up to it marty looked from the prone figure on the floor to where ingrid still sat under a blanket erwin had draped over her his voice was iron ill take care of him nice job mercer told anika when they were outside with the copilot and with marty hes stronger than you give him credit for only he doesnt know it so neither does anyone else she used snow to clean her hands ira came up to them whatever mental trick he had used to get over the horrors of the past hour had worked he seemed as unruffled and composed as always whats our next move i need to check on the crashed c i want you to get this wreck site into shape its going to be our home for a while make sure martys satphone is okay so that when the solar max lets up we can get ourselves rescued once everyone was organized and working mercer decided it was time to go he made sure he had his geiger counter and a few protein bars stuffed in his sample bag before beginning his walk to the other plane crash he also took an ice ax a silver space blanket and a small can of sterno in case he couldnt get back before nightfall the trek was brutal each step broke through the crust of snow sinking him to his knees it was an exhausting process to lift his foot clear to take another pace and quickly his motion more resembled wading than walking the wind scouring the flank of the mountain range hit him full in the face as he walked oftentimes powerful enough to arrest his forward progress he began sweating and his breaks became more frequent at each rest stop he would check the geiger counter mystified that it had yet to show any radiation he began to wonder if delaneys contamination had come from another source although the wreckage of the c stratofreighter was only three miles away it took him two hours to reach it from the air they had seen only part of one wing and a scrap of fuselage but as he approached he could see other pieces of debris a landing gear assembly a section of the retractable flaps and a blade from one of her four props fifty years of ice movement had obliterated any semblance of order to the debris field and mercer was surprised to find as much as he had two hundred yards beyond the wing fragment the geiger counter began to click mercer clamped his hand to the earphones checking the display on the handheld unit the amount of radiation was barely detectable and his heart slowed again using the counter as a guide he searched for the area that showed the highest readings in this fashion he found the bulk of the plane it lay in a saddle of rock wedged in place and nearly covered by ice only the stump of its vertical stabilizer sticking from the ice was exposed he swept the geiger counter along the length of the plane noting the readings were strongest where he estimated the cockpit would be why there he wondered aloud if there was a radiation leak on the plane surely it would come from the cargo section at the rear under the mantle of ice he could see places were the fuselage had been ripped open by either the crash or avalanche that once covered the plane he selected one of these darker shadows close to the cockpit and began working with the ice ax soon he had settled in to an easy rhythm he rested every hour aware that the sun could go down before he got back to the others but he had to make certain he didnt get overheated an ironic condition considering the temperature had dropped below freezing by three in the afternoon hed chopped his way to the aircrafts metal skin the rip in the aluminum wasnt large enough for him to crawl through forcing him to hack at it with the ax strips of metal tore away each time he heaved back on the handle it took a further half hour to open a largeenough hole the slightly elevated radiation reading when hed penetrated into the plane was still well below a dangerous level all the time hed been working hed mentally prepared himself to enter the plane yet now that he was ready apprehension struck he didnt know what he would find inside or what it would mean to the survivors relying on him resigned to the task mercer lowered himself into the aircrafts belly the interior was dim and he flicked on a small penlight it revealed a rubycrusted corpse staring at him sightlessly mercer scrabbled backward tripping over his feet and falling heavily he remained on the floor ignoring the pain of freezing air in his lungs as he hyperventilated hed known there were bodies on the plane but he hadnt been ready when he was calm again he levered himself upright and flashed the light at the body that he assumed had been the radiomannavigator the ruby effect that had so startled him was the result of frozen blood around the mans mouth and splashed over his flight jacket it looked like hed also bled from the nose and mercer leaned closer jesus his eyes he had bled from his eyes there was more blood in the snow on the cabin floor pools and strings of it like some obscene abstract painting he flicked the beam toward the cockpit nearly all the windscreens had been smashed in by the crash fifty years ago the snow forced into the cockpit had solidified into a misshapen block of ice the copilot was strapped in his seat his head turned away as if the light could still bother him the snow piled up to his chest was stained crimson he too had mysteriously bled out mercer had been right with the navigator in his seat and the copilot focused in the beam of light the body hed found in camp decade was the pilot jack delaney he flicked the light to the pilots seat to make sure what he saw made him stumble back again major delaney sat there as if still flying the plane his cap still in place although he no longer wore his leather coat much of his face had turned gray and shriveled over the years so his dazzling teeth looked particularly gruesome a deaths head smile with aviator glasses on the ice anika didnt know how many times she had checked her watch or cleared the condensed breath from the window the routine had become automatic although with the setting of the sun her pace had increased her lower lip felt raw from constant chewing mercer hadnt said anything about staying at the other wreck until the next morning nor had he taken enough supplies to sustain him the thick ground fog that had settled in the past hour only served to increase her anxiety since they could be stranded for weeks they couldnt waste anything for a signal fire and if mercer lost sight of his footprints coming back hed never find the dc initially shed told herself her concern had come solely from the fact that philip mercer was the undisputed leader of the group his actions had saved them all and his absence even for a few hours had left the others sullen and pessimistic their dinner had been eaten with a minimum of conversation and everyone had retreated to separate areas of the fuselage to sleep anika had stayed awake to check on magnus the thirtyfiveyearold icelandic copilot marty had been by her side until he too had succumbed to exhaustion ira lasko had remained awake the longest falling asleep only an hour ago and telling her she should do the same hed also assured her that mercer knew what he was doing she wasnt so sure while shed never been to greenland shed spent more time in harsh conditions than any of the other survivors she knew the dangers of hypothermia had seen the effects of deep frostbite and knew how fragile a lone man was outside with the temperature down well below freezing now that she was in the second hour of her lonely vigil anika allowed her mind to wander to the other reason for her concern a more personal reason she didnt know mercer well enough to think beyond the physical but on that level she was attracted to him his was a natural masculinity that other men strove to attain through bravado and swagger yet there was a selfdeprecation in him as if he tried to hide his talents he was a year or two older than her but he was like a buoyant teen who hadnt yet gotten used to becoming an adult it was charming anika remembered the look hed given her after they had run the gauntlet of fire it had been a reflection of her own desire experience told her to temper her feelings because of the drama surrounding their first meeting and everything since shed taken lovers whom shed shared dangers with mostly fellow rock climbers and every relationship had crumbled under the weight of the subsequent normalcy while it was unfair to compare mercer to these other men she suspected the results would be the same still it was fun to think otherwise she didnt know shed fallen asleep until a noise startled her awake the survivors had built a snow wall to screen the gaping hole at the rear of the aircraft fashioning a crude door at the bottom with a section of bent metal they used tarps found in the remaining cargo to cover the other holes in the fuselage as a result the plane though chilly was warm enough to keep them alive it was the door being pushed aside that woke her the apparition who entered in the faint glow emitted by their single gas lantern looked like some mythical creature it was covered from head to foot in snow with icicles dangling from the scarf covering its mouth the fur trim around its head was a solid halo of ice as it moved knots of snow fell away like it was shedding its skin it was mercer without a word he lumbered down the aisle and doused the lantern plunging the cabin into total darkness mercer what is it anika asked confused and still half asleep quiet his labored breath sounded as though hed run a marathon then she heard it a steady and deep thumping that seemed to come from every direction at once she didnt recognize the strange sound but the others whod been roused by mercers entrance did its the rotorstat ira said at last i heard it about half an hour ago mercer unwound his scarf and pulled down his hood i was afraid you might have a signal fire going so i ran back as fast as i could even with the fog i could see the lantern through the window a good way off what is it doing here erwin could be heard fumbling for his glasses looking for us they dont know were here mercers parka was so ice crusted it remained erect when he dropped it on the floor and i think the airship is miles away were just hearing its echo ricocheting off the mountains then why is it in the area marty asked chills racked mercer before he could answer his body quaking so strongly that he had to clamp his jaw i assume its moving georesearchs base northward like they wanted all along are they looking for delaneys downed stratofreighter ira had a towel to hand to mercer whose hair was a mass of frozen sweat i think theyre searching for something else considering jack delaney and the rest of his crew are still sitting in the plane mercers bombshell was met with a collective gasp in the following silence the sound of the dirigible began to fade it was ira who finally asked the question on all their minds if delaneys in his plane whose body did we find at camp decade he let the question hang for a moment before turning to anika you want to answer that one anikas stomach gave a sickening slide and she had to grab on to a seat to steady herself earlier shed thought that hearing gunther rath at the base camp had brought everything full circle that hadnt been quite true then but it was now this had started with her grandfathers search for hidden nazi treasure and an interview with a man who had been an engineer the two together meant a secret cache someplace obviously in greenland since rath mercer and she were here until this instant shed never considered whom the nazis had forced to dig their repository and never imagined that any of them could have survived on this bleak wasteland long enough to reach camp decade ten years had passed from the end of the war until the base was abandoned and yet there was no other explanation her voice was barely above a whisper he was the last victim of the holocaust mercer relit the lantern setting it to a weak flicker and crawled into his sleeping bag tell us what you know my grandfather has spent his life trying to recover property looted from the jews during the nazi occupation of europe recently he received some information from an unknown source in russia about a shipment of gold taken from stalingrad and sent to hamburg the documents also revealed that an engineer named otto schroeder had played a role in this transfer an operation i learned was called the pandora project as she got further into the story anikas voice firmed and her outrage returned stronger than ever up until ten days ago schroeder was living outside of munich i went to interview him about the gold when i arrived at his house he was being tortured by a group of men led by gunther rath the man who planted the bomb on this plane with his dying breath schroeder said that the gold and im talking about tons of it was only part of the operation and that philip mercer was someone who could help me she looked to him searching for an answer in his eyes as to why around this time mercer said i received an email from a lawyer in munich telling me that an unnamed client was sending me a package of documents he dug them out of his sample bag and held them close to the lamp for the others to see until this journal arrived id never heard of otto schroeder nor do i know why he would send it to me and since its written in german i have no idea whats in it anika picked up the tale again just before i left the njoerd i learned that mercer was at the georesearch base i knew that somehow we had been set up right after the helicopter crash i went through the mailbag and buried anything addressed to him i couldnt take the chance that schroeders information might be passed to someone i didnt know or trust i had planned to go back later to retrieve the letter id hidden a hundred meters from the chopper ira looked at mercer our stowaway wasnt a stowaway after all she told me just before we discovered the bomb mercer shifted in his sleeping bag because of a practical joke played on me by my friend harry she never got the letter she was looking for i suspect the envelope anika took was from charlie bryce he indicated that she should continue because schroeder was an engineer my grandfather and i believe that he was involved with creating a secret storehouse for nazi plunder far from where the allies would find it an enormous hoard of treasure was recovered in old salt mines at the close of the war but there are still billions of dollars worth of art antiques jewelry and gold bullion that was never found schroeders statement that the gold we sought was only part of the project made us think we had stumbled onto another of their hidden depositories here on greenland marty bishop asked seems a bit excessive even for the nazis i would agree if mercer and i werent here with rath how did schroeder know the two of you were coming here i dont know anika admitted it was part of the setup mercer took a sip from his brandy bottle which had survived the crash the russians who sent the information leading anikas grandfather to otto schroeder chose him rather than betterknown nazi hunters because they already knew the gold is on greenland and that anika was coming here im willing to bet that they were the ones who told schroeder that anika could trust me youre right she cried he said that he received a mysterious call about you a few weeks before his murder that doesnt explain how they knew mercer would be here ira pointed out either they got that information from the surveyors society web site and just chose to include me mercer said a dark implication came clear and he hesitated or because charlie bryce engineered it so that i was here at the same time as anika that would mean charlies part of this too marty said doubtfully ive known him for years hes not a nazi hunter or anything like that ive known him a long time too mercer agreed as unlikely as it sounds thats the only explanation that works so what did you mean that the body at camp decade was the last victim of the holocaust hilda asked because she didnt speak english erwin puhl had been translating the conversation for her i think he was a jewish slave laborer used to excavate some sort of cave for the germans to hide their plunder tears welled in anikas eyes somehow he was left behind and managed to survive for ten years until he discovered camp decade i cant imagine the horror and isolation he endured only to find his one chance at rescue had already been abandoned the bitter irony left a long vacuum in their discussion each thinking about the terror of such a death he could have been a german soldier ira offered after several long minutes no mercer replied the evidence was on his arm anika sniffled and wiped her cheeks you noticed i didnt think anything of it at the time but now its significance is apparent everyone hung on his words the body we found had a scar on the inside of his arm as if hed been burned i think it was selfinflicted to erase the identification number the nazis tattooed on his skin when he became a victim of their final solution is there any proof to this marty asked if there is itll be in here mercer handed schroeders journal to anika figure out what you can weve got other problems to discuss moving close to the lamp anika took the leatherbound manuscript and began thumbing through to the relevant sections so what about mercer cut ira off well get to the other questions later with georesearch moving their operation up this way we cant risk staying with the plane theyre going to spot it once the fog lifts the number one rule of survival is staying with your vehicle marty reminded we dont have a choice mercer countered him if rath finds us were dead our only option is to keep moving how long do you think well last without shelter marty snapped hed been prepared to fight georesearch to return to greenland but ingrids death had once again sapped him of his drive he didnt care about nazis and looted treasure and holocaust survivors he wanted this nightmare to end longer than wed survive if rath finds us mercer flared before checking his irritation he had to remind himself how far the survivors were out of their league he studied the others and saw fear reflected in their eyes sorry none of us deserve whats happened but that doesnt change the fact that were in this together weve managed to hold on this long and i think i know a way to keep us safe how it all depends on what anika finds in that journal mercer answered its pretty clear that georesearchs scientific cover story is just that a story they or whoevers behind them are on greenland to find the treasure now in order to save themselves thousands of manhours i suspect that the nazis expanded an existing cavern for their warehouse rather than mine a whole new chamber its my experience that if theres one cave in an area there are bound to be more we can hide out in one far from the one the nazis used until rath and his merry band leave or we get the satphone working again sounds reasonable to me ira looked around the dim cabin for agreement how far do you estimate we are from the cave erwin asked anxiously about thirty kilometers mercer said and just then realized something hed overlooked earlier the distances on the map hed discovered in camp decade were written in the metric system an american pilot would have used standard or nautical miles he shook his head in selfreproach he should have noticed such a discrepancy immediately hed already calculated the deflection in compass headings so the navigation had been done his earlier foray told him that they were in for a grueling march can you lead us there hilda asked through puhl no mercer wasnt going to risk their lives by pretending he had all the answers but anika has experience in these conditions i trust her to get us to safety weve got a problem anika looked up from otto schroeders journal her eyes pinched from the strain of reading in such low light i havent finished the whole thing yet but i have something that makes your plan unfeasible whats the problem otto schroeder was a combat engineer in the german army before that he had trained as a mining engineer he was sent to greenland in as part of the pandora project to help expand a network of caverns discovered under a glacier the orders had been cut by hitler himself he never knew what became of his work because two months into the project he was caught in a rockslide and had to be evacuated he says in his journal that a thousand jewish and gypsy slaves were being used in the excavation and that the scope of the mining was increasing he also said that they were dying off at an average of ten a day the figure was sobering with his intimate knowledge of mining practices mercer had a better grasp at the unspeakably brutal conditions those poor souls had faced anika continued schroeders principal task before tunneling commenced was to mine an air shaft to the surface through an estimated thousand feet of ice hold on her statement didnt make sense mercer thought shed read it wrong are you sure he had to mine an air shaft first that would mean they started underground and worked their way up thats the problem anika paused the cavern is buried under a mountain at the end of a fjord and was accessible only by submarine after completing the air shaft schroeder was to create a dock for the supply submarines and hack out more space in the cave for dormitories and other work spaces mercer cursed the air shaft is what rath is looking for anika nodded which means there arent any other caves for us to hide in and we havent addressed one issue that we need to ira shot mercer a significant look mercer knew what he was about to say and nodded we didnt tell you that the body we found in camp decade is radioactive he may have picked up the contamination from the c when he took delaneys flight jacket but mercer and i already discounted the idea that the us military would leave atomic materials lying around i checked the plane mercer interrupted readings were the same there as in camp decade its not the source that means the radiation came from the cavern were going to be humping our way toward ira concluded since he still gave a reading on the geiger counter after fifty years whatevers down there has gotta be hotter than hell mercer looked to where erwin puhl huddled silently in his sleeping bag the lantern glow reflecting off his glasses like tiny sunbursts how about it erwin are you ready to drop your cover story and tell us what you know it was such an unexpected question that they all turned to the german meteorologist for his part erwin tried to look shocked but hed experienced too much trauma in the past few days to sustain the facade how did you know he asked simply your friendship with igor bulgarin mercer said erwin knew what he meant but the rest waited for an explanation when igor and i first met he told me he was coming to greenland to search for meteor fragments the only problem with his story is that finding meteorites on greenland is next to impossible they do it in antarctica all the time because theres so little precipitation that much of it is considered a desert chunks of space rock can lie around for years waiting to be picked up here theyre usually buried in minutes he looked around the cabin i read about an expedition in that spent six weeks on greenlands west coast looking for microscopic bits of the kangilia meteor that one weighed an estimated one hundred tons and there was a video and satellite information telling them where to look they didnt find a trace theres no way that one man walking around the ice could ever hope to find extraterrestrial debris mercer returned his gaze to erwin i figured that since you were friends for years you already knew that igors cover was bullshit and knew what he was really doing here puhl didnt deny the accusation mercer took his deductions to their obvious conclusion he must have known about the nazi cache and gone into camp decade because he suspected the body might have come from the cavern someone in georesearch knew what he was doing and murdered him to keep it a secret erwins lack of reaction told mercer that the meteorologist had already figured out igors accident was premeditated murder his nearcatatonia in the past few days was likely due to the fear that his friendship with bulgarin meant he was next do you know who killed him ira asked mercer since igor was struck on the back of the head the murderer had to be someone he didnt suspect and would turn his back to the killer also had to be strong enough to bludgeon a man who was the largest in the camp and finally the killer dragged the corpse out of officers area and abandoned it when he reached the first major obstacle this means he wasnt strong enough to actually carry the body makes sense so who was it the only person who fits all three criteria is greta schmidt mercer answered and received a number of dubious looks i think hes right erwin said after a moment although igor and i didnt think georesearch knew who we really were and why we were on greenland we did discuss people we should be careful about neither of us considered that greta could be part of this erwin do you know if georesearch is affiliated with a company called kohl anika asked schroeder mentioned the name in his journal as the company given the actual contract to dig the cavern he was among a handful of military experts sent to help kohl bought georesearch last year so they could hide behind their scientific credentials and execute their true aim which is the recovery of the gold marty asked erwin echoed schroeders words the gold is only a small part of whats going on what were the germans hiding they werent hiding anything they were trying to recover something something that was never meant to be on this planet mercer put it together quicker than the others a radioactive meteorite that landed here in not quite erwin said most of it slammed into russia in the sudden insight came to mercer in a rush and despite the horror surrounding this search and the loss they had already felt he couldnt help but be excited they were talking about one of the greatest scientific mysteries of the twentieth century there was a hushed awe in his voice tunguska yes dr mercer the nazis were looking for a piece of the tunguska meteor that exploded over siberia on june how why puhl looked at the blank faces of the others for those of you who arent familiar with it the tunguska explosion has remained an enigma since it occurred some theorized it was an asteroid others a comet or black hole some even believe it was the detonation of a ufos nuclear power plant what everyone does agree on is that it leveled a thousand square miles of forest although trees at the very epicenter were left standing like certain buildings in hiroshima after the atom bomb seismographs as distant as washington dc registered the shock wave and an unearthly glow was seen as far away as copenhagen furthermore eyewitness accounts say that a portion of the object was observed continuing in a northwesterly direction and was actually gaining altitude after the explosion to answer mercers questions as to how and why the germans were searching for the wayward fragment those witnesses saw i have to give a bit more history erwin accepted the brandy bottle when ira passed it to him the first scientific expedition to search for the site wasnt conducted until by a man named leonid kulik he is important to remember because he was captured by the germans and died at a prison camp in during weeks of brutal interrogation he revealed everything he knew about the mysterious impact after they learned the truth about the blast the germans spared nothing to secure his research notes in fact they sacrificed thousands of troops in what became one of the most desperate battles of the entire war just to find a couple of notebooks he paused again more contemplative than dramatic when the war broke out kulik had sent his more secret findings to an associate in stalingrad are you saying the battle of stalingrad was all about a couple of notebooks marty scoffed give me a break no but hundreds of commando teams were sent behind russian lines during the fighting to find them thousands of men died in the search when it came to hitlers obsessions fact is a lot stranger than fiction let me tell you another story to illustrate this erwin lectured as if to a child in april of he sent a team of scientists equipped with stateoftheart radar gear to rugen island in the baltic sea to test a new theory that he had hitler had become convinced that while the earth was indeed round we didnt live on its outer surface but on the inner curve of a hollow sphere like insects in a salad bowl the scientists spent weeks beaming radar waves into the sky hoping for a rebounded signal from the british naval base at scapa flow you must realize at the time germany lagged far behind the allies when it came to radar equipment and yet der fuhrer puhl mocked the title wasted valuable resources on a quest doomed to fail whats this have to do with tunguska not all of the ludicrous scientific avenues the nazis pursued during the war were such dismal mistakes the pandora project was much more successful as i said the first official investigation into the tunguska blast didnt occur until however there had been a great deal of local interest the first unofficial search was sent out a year after the celestial impact although they were turned back because of weather and the sites inaccessibility it wasnt until two years after that in that anyone saw the devastation first hand while tunguska is one of the most remote tracts in the siberian taiga news of this success reached the imperial capital of st petersburg in because so many of the explorers died in the forest or shortly after their return from the site their deaths were horrifying a mysterious disease that dissolved the flesh from their bodies they ended up as nothing more than skeletal figures mercers mind flashed to the photograph of stefansson rosmunder lying in a hospital bed in reykjavik knowing now what had killed him the peasants believed puhl continued that the devil had punched the forest leveling the trees and it was his residual evil that killed their men some returned from the impact zone with pieces of a strange rock that was warm to the touch claiming it was pieces of satans skin entire settlements where this unknown rock was stored died of the same wasting disease usually just days after the explorers homecoming priests called in said they knew what dark forces were at work and had all the samples encased in golden icons confident that they would contain the evil that had killed an estimated one thousand people their idea worked his statement was met with skepticism until mercer spoke that was a hell of an idea even if they didnt understand why if the rocks they collected were radioactive fragments from the meteor gold would act as an effective shield because of its density not as good as lead but efficient nonetheless erwin nodded his head kuliks research later proved that gold dampened the radiation much more effectively than lead he was never able to explain why this radioactivity behaved so differently and in his defense little was known about radiation at this time it was a mysterious force only a few were even aware of mercers scientific background allowed him to see the hole in puhls story how is it such a potent radiation source didnt kill all the men who went to the impact site kulik knew that all radioactive material decayed in what is termed halflives his theory was that the meteor pieces decayed unevenly from the outside in and as the surface becomes inert in a few months it shields itself from more decay he believed this phenomenon was caused by a reaction with our atmosphere or perhaps an effect of solar radiation breaking down something within the fragments neither he nor anyone else is really certain he guessed that only those chunks the peasants handled roughly and broke away the nonreactive coating were the ones that caused the deaths noting a number of flaws with this theory mercer held his tongue he wasnt a planetary geologist they were talking about an element that had never been seen on earth before and had never been examined by modern science he didnt know what fantastic substances could be swirling around the universe on the backs of interstellar comets every few years scientists working with particle accelerators added new elements to the end of the periodic table it was possible that the meteor was composed of some stable element we hadnt yet discovered okay back to my story erwin said and the group became attentive again few of them understood or cared about the physics they just wanted to hear the rest of his enthralling tale in czarina alexandra sent her most trusted emissary to vanavara the city closest to the blast to discover what was killing her people the man had a religious background and quickly adopted the idea of sealing the fragments in golden icons he had teams sent into the forest to scour for more bits of satans fist as he called it ill be damned mercer exclaimed that explains why nothing of the original meteorite has ever been found at tunguska someone cleaned the site before kulik or any subsequent expedition ever reached it precisely erwin agreed even with protective boxes to seal the meteorites as soon as they were discovered hundreds more perished in the task this priest had a golden suit made for himself so he could work with the samples making sure that they would never again harm another soul who was the priest ira asked his given name was grigori efymovich novykh anika klein was so wrapped in the story it took her a second to realize she knew that name or at least the more famous one the man was known by rasputin yes rasputin was the czarinas emissary and he spent two years at tunguska recovering the meteorites upon his return to st petersburg he refused to tell anyone about what he had found world war one had just begun and he feared that his discovery would be used as a weapon even when the germans first used poison gas at bolimov in january he would not divulge the presence of this extraordinary killer as the war dragged on rumors surrounding what hed found grew and he knew it was only a matter of time before he was tortured to reveal what had killed the villagers in tunguska with pressure against him mounting rasputin formed the brotherhood of satans fist enlisting a few trusted priests so they would continue to protect the secret after he was gone rasputin was murdered in december of not because of his influence over the royal family as the history books record but because he wouldnt tell certain military men what he knew so he wasnt the psychotic demon people think he was erwin chuckled with dark humor oh he was that too tales of his debauchery are if anything milder than the truth but those in the brotherhood saw him as a man who might have saved humanity from its own destructive impulses so how does this involve the nazis the first russian revolution swept through st petersburg a few weeks after rasputins murder and those who knew the rumors about satans fist were exiled or executed interest in the tunguska blast waned the brotherhood hid the fifty icons containing the meteorite fragments in various churches and monasteries around the country moving them often as communist forces either confiscated or razed the buildings and as members grew older new people were brought in leonid kulik was one of them the first who wasnt a priest he was asked to join so he would not reveal some of the anomalous findings he had made at the impact site like the fact that he knew others had been there before him how many members were there at any given time mercer asked like the others hed already deduced that erwin puhl and igor bulgarin were part of the brotherhood usually never more than six or eight our small size helped ensure our anonymity it was kulik who determined the true nature of what the brotherhood safeguarded and it was his recommendation shortly before germany invaded the soviet union that the icons be destroyed he would not allow this horror to be unleashed on the world much more was known about radiation by then and he feared that physicists could build an atomic bomb from the fragments all but one icon were encased in cement and transported far out to sea where they were dumped because gold wont corrode in seawater they will remain dormant forever at the same time this was going on kulik calculated the trajectory of the piece of meteor that eyewitnesses said skimmed off the atmosphere and vanished his next goal was to track down this other piece to ensure it didnt get discovered by anyone else that is when the nazis launched their lightning strike into the soviet union kulik was captured before the last icon could be shipped from the isolated abbey where it had been hidden and before he could organize an expedition to find the other fragments which landed here yes erwin soothed his throat with another sip of brandy the nazis eventually learned of the missing icon from kulik sent a commando team deep into russia to steal it and secured his notebooks from stalingrad which gave the coordinates to where the last piece of satans fist had landed anikas dark eyes shimmered with the same passion that so infected her grandfather then they launched the pandora project using looted gold to build their own storage boxes for any radioactive material they discovered once they found the meteorites they sent otto schroeder to dig them out of the ice nodding erwin polished his glasses by this time the allies were regularly flying over greenland in aerial convoys ferrying aircraft to england the lost squadron we were talking about earlier was just such a flight mercer added yes the radioactive heat generated within the stones had melted the fragments down to bedrock because of these flights the germans couldnt risk tunneling to them from the surface so they approached from the sea in submarines eventually finding a cavern under a glacier that was within five miles of where the meteor landed they planned to use the cave as a staging area before driving a long tunnel through ice and rock to reach the fragments erwin looked over to anika who still had the journal open on her lap you dont need to finish schroeders journal ive already read it they had completed the air shaft and pier for the sub and had just commenced the tunnel to the cache when schroeder was injured he didnt know what happened here after he was injured do you marty asked no one knows except the poor slave mercer found in camp decade something puhl had said struck anika her brow furled and her thin eyebrows arched her tone was accusatory when did you read schroeders journal erwin looked away pained shortly after you went to interview him he said evasively how shortly her anger rose because she was pretty sure of the answer we found it in his house after driving off rath and his neonazi thugs anika exploded those snipers were your people you son of a bitch you were there the whole time and you let schroeder die you let me get shot and then everything else came clear it was you who set this whole thing up my opa me you fucking bastard she lunged from her seat and would have reached puhl had she not gotten tangled in her sleeping bag and fallen mercer dove to pin her to the deck holding her arms over her head so she couldnt squirm free she was a foot shorter than he eighty pounds lighter but for a few desperate seconds he was afraid shed beat him fury augmented her strength so she was like an enraged animal anika stop it mercer pleaded his teeth gritting against the pain as she bit his shoulder she got a hand free and went for his eyes her fingers cocked like talons mercer ducked his head and felt her try to tear a piece of skin from his cheek and then it was over anika went completely limp mercer opened his eyes confused wondering what had calmed her chef hilda stood over them massaging one fist she said something over her shoulder for erwin to translate she knew you would never strike a woman so she did it for you hilda gave mercer a proud smile and a wink danke he replied checking on anika she had a growing bruise under her left eye but otherwise shed be fine he moved her back to her seat secured her seat belt to stop her from charging the instant she woke and leveled a gaze at erwin shes right you know you are a son of a bitch what gives you the right to drag innocent people into your fight in this fight no one is innocent the brotherhood of satans fist has spent nearly a century protecting the world from what we know i think for that kind of dedication we should be allowed to involve others if we need them but why involve anika and her grandfather or me i will answer your second question first erwin said calmly we did not get you involved you were already scheduled to come to greenland with georesearch it was just luck on our part we mentioned your name to schroeder as a possible ally in case something went wrong with our plans you have a reputation for being a very capable man mercer remained unconvinced but if erwin was revealing the truth about the cavern and anikas grandfather why would he lie about him i dont know this charles bryce you mentioned earlier puhl continued so i think his invitation for you to join the expedition to camp decade was legitimate and anika we sent information to her grandfather that would lead him to schroeder in the hopes that he would be able to expose the kohl company and the pandora project it wasnt until we followed anika to schroeders house that we realized our security had been compromised gunther rath who is the specialprojects director for kohl somehow learned about schroeder and had beaten us there we suspect that anikas grandfathers office in vienna was bugged igor and i chased off rath and his group well igor and another brother chased them off i dont know the first thing about guns we broke into schroeders house and found the diary he kept hidden we gave it to a lawyer in munich to forward to you the operation was falling apart and once we reached greenland we feared we would need your help considering raths brutality by this time anika had vanished so we couldnt warn her off i didnt know her whereabouts until we heard the sos from that helicopter we never intended for anyone to get hurt none of us were supposed to be here georesearchs expedition would have been canceled had anika been able to reveal what we intended her to learn his voice trailed off mercer sat back in his seat trying to absorb everything it would take a while he knew maybe forever it was an amazing story meteors radiation secret brotherhoods rasputin nazis neonazis nazi hunters and a planeload of innocent people trapped on a glacier between a gunther rath and his goal what do you think ira since we kicked ass in ww two we can assume that the germans never got the meteorites which means theyve been down there for the sixty years since the start of the pandora project go on makes me wonder why this rath character is so hot to find them now this things been in the works for a while considering kohl bought georesearch to spearhead their hunt a year ago what i want to know is what happened last year to make this such a priority any ideas erwin we dont know he admitted ah guys marty called this has been very interesting but it doesnt help us weve survived one murder attempt but i doubt well survive the next if we stick around we should try for the air shaft mercer said looking at puhl rath knows that igor bulgarin was part of the brotherhood because of his interest in the body do you think hes aware youre part of it too since they didnt kill me at the base i doubt it there have been only a few brothers who werent russian and rath knows im german when igor set up our being here he falsified some of my records so it didnt show i had studied in moscow when east germany was their vassal state rath has nothing to connect me to the brotherhood mercer remembered erwin making certain that none of the georesearch people were in earshot when he explained how he knew about igors alcoholism aboard the njoerd in retrospect his secrecy seemed well warranted better and better rath doesnt know were aware of the cave when he finds this plane abandoned hell assume we made a run for the coast our only logical choice if we can reach the air shaft before him we can seal ourselves inside and wait until he gives up looking for it he cant search forever because georesearch has obligations to other scientific teams coming to their camp in a few weeks we can make it until then how marty asked that cave is full of deadly radiation for christs sake no it isnt and the survivor we found at camp decade proves it he lived down there for ten years eating supplies left by the nazis no doubt until loneliness or madness forced him to leave and how do you know a sudden radiation leak didnt force him out erwin said that russian villagers exposed to the radiation died within days if hed been dosed he never would have made it to decade okay but why do you think we can beat rath his company dug the damned air shaft the rotorstat is probably moving them there as we speak i doubt it remember they brought four snocats here as well as the land cruiser theres no need for that many vehicles if they know the vents exact location they need to search for it and thanks to the map i found at camp decade we know right where to look youd make a good detective it was anika shed been awake listening but hadnt stirred are you okay concern lowered mercers voice to a whisper yes im sorry about that she included mercer and erwin in her apology i just i dont know it was all too much for a second you had every right erwin said i am more sorry than i can ever tell you ira scraped some snow off the wall and bundled it in a handkerchief for anika she gratefully pressed it to her swollen eye who hit me hilda germanys finest combat chef if her wiener schnitzel doesnt get you her right cross will switching to german anika addressed the stout woman with a smile remind me never to insult your cooking and get you really angry its nearly midnight mercer announced if we leave at first light well only need to spend one night on the ice to reach the cave i for one am exhausted im usually in bed by ten on days im in a plane crash when mercer had been returning from the c crash scene the survivors had slept far from one another with him back now they huddled close drawn into a cohesive group by his strength this didnt go unnoticed by him and he was glad for it because as much as they looked to him for leadership he needed them for the encouragement to keep going they had been through a lot together and he knew the worse was yet to come he also noticed as he settled into his sleeping bag that anika was at his side her delicate face turned to him anika he whispered and her eyes fluttered open can you do me a favor im pretty sure hilda has a crush on me do you think you could be my bodyguard she suppressed a laugh my hero then her expression turned serious a worried frown pulling at her mouth im thankful for what you said earlier about me being able to lead us to the cave but i dont think i can do it mercer could see how much this admission cost her it was in her eyes the defiance she normally showed the world had evaporated why she was wrenched by such doubt that she questioned the very thing she had always believed defined her when i go mountain climbing or hiking in some rain forest i think im being daring she said but im really just pretending none of its real its makebelieve with a rescue chopper only a radio call away im never in any actual danger unless i do something stupid this is different lives depend on us reaching the cavern i cant take that kind of responsibility ive been kidding myself to think im brave mercer im a fake a fraud he snaked a hand out of his bag to stroke her short hair anika weve barely met and yet i can tell you that youre one of the bravest people ive ever known youve already proven that you are cool under fire literally you can think on your feet and he touched the red mark on his cheek where shed raked him you have unbelievable determination to me thats the definition of courage only a fool goes in search of danger a brave person avoids it when he can but faces it when he has to your hobby is dangerous to be certain but thats not what makes you brave youre brave because you know the difference between fantasy and reality and when reality hits you you strike back i wont patronize you by tossing around platitudes like im sure youll do fine because i dont know however i believe you can do it for me thats enough she simply said thank you because there was no phrase that fully expressed her gratitude youre welcome mercer said because any other reply would have betrayed how much he wanted to kiss her anika fell asleep with a trace of a smile on her lips and he wondered if she already knew on the ice the following morning mercer found marty bishop standing over the graves the team had dug while he was investigating the air force stratofreighter the others were preparing for the trek packing everything from sleeping bags and extra arctic clothes to a cooking stove propane cylinders and as much food as they could carry there had been a few arguments over items individuals felt they had to bring martys videotapes for his father erwin puhls thick journal even hildas personal recipe book mercer won them all they stripped themselves to the absolute essentials and even then they were dangerously overloaded only magnus the icelandic pilot with the broken arm would walk unencumbered mercer made up for him by carrying the heaviest pack at sixty pounds i didnt really know her marty said when he felt mercers presence ingrids tombstone was a piece of metal with her name scratched on one side doesnt matter for a few days she was part of your life thats more than enough time to feel grief we were just having some fun you know it would have ended as soon as we got to iceland he wiped his cheeks with a glove i would have walked away now i cant no you cant mercer agreed shes going to be with you for a long time nothing is as casual as wed like to think especially people ive never spent much time thinking about consequences i have a feeling youll be thinking of nothing else for a while mercer put a hand on his shoulder ill give you a couple more minutes then we have to go thanks while the fog had lifted the tracks mercer had left on his trip to the c had been nearly obliterated by greenlands constant wind for this he was grateful it meant that by tomorrow thered be no trace of their trek no trail rath could follow they reached the stratofreighter before noon and spent a couple of hours burying what pieces of wreckage were exposed no one wanted rath to make the same discovery mercer had about major jack delaney because he knew the route to the plane mercer led but when they started the long march to the air shaft each member of the team took a turn at point trailblazing in the deep snow was exhausting work that only he and ira could maintain for more than an hour at a time anika spent the day behind the leader keeping track of their course with a handheld compass taken from the dcs emergency kit when not at the head of the column mercer walked with marty as he helped magnus anika had found a balance of painkillers to keep the aviator alert yet comfortable for the march he was young and strong and could maintain their pace despite being unbalanced by his slinged arm protected in the latest foulweather gear they had no problem handling the cold it was exhaustion that slowly ground them down because of her size hed expected hilda to have the greatest difficulty but it was erwin who needed the most encouragement by five the group had covered only a third of the distance and their pace was a quarter of what it had been when theyd commenced mercers plan to spend only one night in the open wasnt going to happen rather than push them beyond their level of endurance he decided to find cover for the night mercer was at point when he made the decision and he veered toward the jagged mountains on their right hoping to find protection from the strengthening wind it would have been too much to hope for a cave but a natural windbreak would have been sorely welcome it took another hour of marching to stumble across a vshaped outcropping of rock that would shield them from the gusts gathering storm clouds created a false twilight taking a lesson from sled dogs they began to burrow individual holes in the snow on the rocks leeward side not like that anika cautioned when the work began we need to double up to share body heat we wont survive the night if we dont she had removed her tinted goggles and her eyes met mercers as the group began to pair off the invitation was there but she had a duty to her patient magnus youre with me the pilot was ashen from the ordeal but managed a cocky grin i knew breaking my arm would have a benefit anika spoke to hilda and the chef began expanding her burrow so it would have room for the three of them together she then whispered to mercer ill make sure she doesnt sneak over to you while youre asleep even with the added snow insulation the night was miserably cold if not for their deep exhaustion none of them would have slept sometime after midnight the wind reversed directions and quickly stripped the snow cover from their dens they scrambled to dig new ones on the other side of the low ridge this time they hollowed out one large chamber and slept in a tight uncomfortable ball at daybreak it took several minutes to tunnel back to the surface through the two additional feet of snow that had accumulated above them they continued onward after a meager breakfast of protein bars and snow melted on their single stove the wind was driving at their backs behind them their footprints vanished like a jetliners dissipating contrail scoured away by the relentless gusts hour after hour they marched north mindlessly following the person in front of them it was a demonstration of faith in anika as their navigator and in mercer as their leader that was why he pushed himself the hardest taking point when the snow became deeper or the trail more difficult the responsibility was a weight the others didnt carry and for him it was far heavier than the overloaded pack on his shoulders at eleven they came across the first really tough terrain the ice was broken with pressure ridges that had to be climbed and long crevasses measuring at least fifteen feet deep while some could be jumped others had to be crossed by descending into the glacier and climbing up the other side with ropes slung to assist magnus most polar expeditions carried lightweight ladders to cross such formations but mercer and the others didnt have the luxury their pace was cut in half yet no one complained openly their frustration and pain were evident in every movement but no one said theyd had enough these five men and two women strangers until a few days ago were willing to suffer indescribable agony and deprivation for one another because the others were willing to do it for them surrounded by ice and bitter cold few of them expected the raging thirst they felt not only were they sweating from the exertion dangerous in itself but every breath expended precious fluids because the air was desert dry devoid of all but a trace of humidity they kept canteens close to their bodies to prevent them from freezing and still they had to stop every couple of hours to boil snow to replenish them when they found shelter that evening an hour later than the first night on the ice mercer estimated they hadnt yet covered the second third of their trip erwin puhl seemed to be suffering the most from the exposure the wind had found a chink in his face mask so the tops of his cheeks were showing frostbite when anika had him remove his boots several toes were an unnatural pale white dont play hero she said angrily as she began to work on him if your feet freeze call a halt to warm them again if you get severely frostbitten we wont be able to carry you but our pace is too slow as it is erwin countered through gritted teeth as pain splintered his warming toes i wont be the one to let the others down you will if we have to leave you anika snapped as she rubbed the blood into his feet high above the clouds that had hidden the sky for two days finally cleared the night exploded in a dazzling display of northern lights dancing curtains in an otherworldly light show on the scientific level mercer knew the ribbons of color were a result of the solar wind striking certain molecules in the atmosphere red for nitrogen violet for ionized nitrogen and green for oxygen but it was the aesthetics of the borealis that made him gape with the others the aurora was visceral pulsing and seemingly alive they watched the show for five minutes before mercer realized the wind had died the pitaraq is a gravitydriven wind it starts from south and then there is calm you have about ten minutes to find shelter it was igor bulgarins voice mercer heard in his head everybody find cover now mercer was in motion even as he spoke like the previous night when the wind had shifted their hideouts would be on the wrong side of a ridge when the pitaraq struck mercer dumped the food he was cooking cinched his pack and lunged over the rocky crest he tumbled down the other side until he landed in deep snow quickly he began to dig scooping out armfuls of snow in a frantic race a few seconds later the others joined him mercer didnt bother to explain his actions his frenzied digging was enough to galvanize them they tunneled into the snow burrowing toward the protection of the rocks mercer had no way to judge how deep they needed to be even when he heard a gentle whisper of wind whistling across the entrance to his tunnel he continued mining snow trying to pack it behind him as he dug downward he flipped on a flashlight and glittering snow crystals reflected the light like jewels for an illusionary moment he felt safely cocooned in the snows embrace his breathing was ragged and his hands felt stiff and frozen hed dug his tunnel without his gloves he donned them massaging his fingers to get the blood flowing again can anyone hear me his voice was deadened by the weight of snow yes anika replied she sounded like she was many yards away but was doubtlessly much closer can you reach me yes i see your light through the snow that was the last voice mercer heard for the rest of the night even when anika bored her way to him and ira and erwin found them a short time later a few feet over their heads the millions of tons of air that had been blowing northward to form a massive highpressure area came back in a screaming fury the transition from a dead calm to a hurricaneforce gale was measured in seconds snow and ice that had accumulated for years was whipped away exposing rock that hadnt seen the surface in decades if ever the noise was a banshee cry that scraped along nerves like an electric current even though they were screened by layers of snow it was still impossible to speak into the shrieking onslaught anika burrowed into mercers arms her body pressed to him as if he could somehow protect her if the wind found them ira was mashed to mercers other side and by the other mans movements mercer could tell he was clutching one of the others marty was on the far side of anika lost in hildas panicked embrace no power on earth could sustain the amount of energy the wind carried for very long and after five minutes mercer was certain the storm had expended itself the sound seemed to be fading he could just barely hear anika crying then the true wind hit them the first gust had merely been the prelude to the actual pitaraq driven by its own weight the collapsing highpressure front acted like water pouring across the ice ripping away everything in its path at a speed approaching a hundred and fifty miles per hour torn and tortured the glaciers surface came alive with raking barrages of snow and ice and rock they could feel the ground shudder as large chunks of ice slammed into the wall of rock protecting them ice cracked like exploding artillery shells mercer pressed his gloves to his head trying to save his hearing from the sound of ten thousand steam whistles erupting at once it went on without letup for an hour then two then three screaming just above them with a rapacious hunger unlike anything they had ever heard nestled below the surface mercer knew that if the wind found them hed never know it theyd be pulled from their burrow and tossed miles before the act could register it would be a quick way to die and by the fifth hour he was wondering if death would have been preferable to the relentless fear of surviving the storm slowly slowly it began to register that he could hear anika again she was mumbling a prayer perhaps but what mattered was that her voice could be heard above the storms screech mercer sagged in relief he pulled her face from where it was buried under his arm her eyes were enormous and yet he could see determination in them the winds dying she nodded in understanding barely able to hear his voice her grip relaxed to a hug that in any other circumstance mercer would have enjoyed he reached across her and felt for martys hand giving him a reassuring squeeze before turning so he could speak to ira think we can chance digging ourselves out the submariner asked before mercer could pose the same question erwins on the other side of me and it turns out hes claustrophobic i dont want to be here when he regains consciousness what happened to him he held on until about an hour ago and then he freaked out i had to put a choke hold on him mercer was impressed by the unorthodox cure you learn that trick in the navy in the glare of the flashlight ira flashed a wry smile actually i did the current captain of the attack sub tallahassee owes his career to me for getting him over his fear of cramped spaces as the pitaraq subsided mercer and ira began to claw at the surface of their den compressing the fallen snow to the side or beneath themselves as they expanded the burrow in ten minutes they could kneel upright and in twenty they could stand using the hollows where theyd waited out the storm for the waste snow i feel like a goddamn mole ira said you go a few more days without a shower youll smell like one too mercer felt they were almost to the surface any idea about magnus i lost track shortly after the storm hit while im digging see if you can find him you got it by mercers watch it was a quarter of three in the morning when the tunnel face collapsed on him he thrashed against the snow and suddenly found himself free he stood quickly shaking snow off himself like a dog after a water retrieve not realizing how warm the tunnel had become until he tasted the crisp arctic air once again in the dim light of a hidden moon he looked around it appeared as if nothing had changed but the drift that had entombed them was substantially deeper and longer than it had been other than that the snow ripped from the ice had been replaced by identical snow from farther up the coast even in the face of such an awesome force as the pitaraq greenland remained virtually unchanged erwin was the next to emerge clawing his way out like a monster in a s b movie and then came the others marty was the last to crawl out of the hole while mercer dug they had spent the past hour in a vain search for magnus mercer feared the worst a hundred yards south was another outcropping of rock similar to the one that had protected them its windward side was cleaned of all traces of snow mercer fished a pair of binoculars from his pack but there wasnt enough light to discern details on the ridges shadowed face he told ira to reorganize the remaining gear and started out swimming through the snow as much as walking twenty yards from the crest he saw what remained of the pilot the pitaraq had plucked magnus from his tunnel like a raptor snatched its prey and slammed him into the rock the wind had acted like a sandblaster stripping him nearly naked and ripping away much of his skin so that frozen blood pooled around the crumpled body from a distance mercer could see that the pilots skull had been flattened by the collision returning to the tunnel entrance where the others had gathered mercer told them that the pilot had been killed by the storm they slept for the remainder of the night in the tunnel and this time mercer didnt make any excuses for anika not to rest in his arms it felt too right not to let it happen he drifted off with the memory of her lips on his cheek and her whispered you saved six of us dont think about the one you didnt she knew he would take magnuss death personally they emerged from their underground shelter when the sky was still a shimmering canopy of stars by the looks on their faces many of them had already come to grips with magnuss loss rather than dwell on their failure they took strength from knowing the icy island had thrown the worst it had at them and they had survived they had another twelve miles to cover just before they started out again marty took mercer aside his face a mask of shame i lost the satellite phone he mumbled i was testing to see if i could get a signal when the wind hit us i managed to keep my backpack but the phone im sorry mercer remained silent there was nothing he could do or say to change what had happened they had just lost their only means of communication and the odyssey facing them had become doubly difficult it was no longer enough to evade rath until he abandoned his search for the pandora cavern now they would have to trek back to civilization again once anika had navigated them back to their original course the painracked journey continued without cloud cover the temperature dropped dramatically and every breath was like inhaling acid it froze tender lung tissue and caused nosebleeds if air was drawn through unprotected nostrils mercer had to continuously rotate his scarf when the fleece became clogged with frozen mucus and condensation wheres that global warming we were promised ira grumbled at lunch the terrain eased some quickening their pace but it took its toll legs that seemed fresh following a break began aching after only a few steps and they constantly had to adjust their clothing as frigid air found tiny entrances piercing right to the flesh before they could recover themselves urinating was done only when absolutely necessary the women suffered the most during the act but the men made a bigger deal out of it ira had the best line when he described the process as making a dickcicle his humor and positive outlook helped keep the exhaustion at bay at four that afternoon mercers estimate put the air shaft a half mile ahead he could see that their march had led them to the mountains thrusting through the glacier at the head of the fjord hed seen from the cockpit of the dc the mountains bald round hills really were a thousand feet high and had been so ravaged by glacial movement that their domed sides were riven with scars he was looking to the west toward the interior of greenland to survey the surroundings when he suddenly dropped flat to the snow screaming at the others to do the same if the sky hadnt been free of clouds he never would have seen the distant speck it was the rotorstat plying its way serenely northward knowing the clarity of polar optics he guessed the dirigible was five miles away bury yourselves like a beached seal mercer paddled snow onto his back struggling to camouflage his red parka and green pack his heart pounded painfully and he took a bite of snow to moisten his dry mouth jesus that was close he peered over his shoulder and saw the team had followed him without question in seconds they were nothing more than six innocuouslooking lumps in the snow he couldnt chance reaching for his binoculars because the suns reflection off the lens would flash like a beacon since the airship was continuing past his estimated position for the air shaft mercers earlier opinion that rath didnt have its exact location was true they were moving their secondary base too far north this would buy mercer the time they desperately needed be thankful the weather has been so rotten he said when the airship vanished around a promontory its delayed them as much as it has us how much time do you think we have anika asked brushing snow off his back i dont know mercer replied absently watching the spot where the rotorstat had disappeared not as much as id like figure theyll bring three snocats up here and at least one building ira said four roundtrips six hours flight time an hour loading thats a little over twentyfour hours if they fly around the clock or half that if theyd already moved stuff before the pitaraq mercer added with a renewed urgency they continued walking mercer had the point and pushed at a brutal pace his legs burned from the strain of clearing a path for his people and yet he maintained a gait not much slower than a trot he kept watch for the rotorstat and studied the rock formations as he moved the mountains were like a string of beads impeding the glacier from reaching the sea and as they rounded one more in the long line a wicked smile split mercers chapped lips anika you still have that map yes take a look at it and tell me what you see above the x looks like the profile of a face a face with a big nose kind of like the one on the side of that mountain up there mercer pointed at a natural design cut into the stone by aeons of erosion it looked remarkably like a human face in profile the lips were out of proportion but the nose was unmistakable as were the deepset eyes the formation loomed like a sentinel high above the ice my god she breathed the last piece of the puzzle mercer grinned i wondered about that drawing when i first saw it now i get it it was the laborers way of telling us exactly where to look with a little imagination you can even think the face up there is jewish if youre referring to the nose thats an ugly stereotype im jewish its okay you ought to see the beak on my grandfather she smiled up at him you think the air shaft is beneath the face well know soon enough before mercer let them proceed he spent a few minutes with the geiger counter checking for radiation as they followed far behind him he kept his eyes on the monitor fearful that the counter would peg over at any second so far it was giving just faint chirps of background radiation a hundred yards from the nearvertical mountain the geiger began to tick a little more rapidly mercer held up his hand to halt the others and paused to see how far the readings would go the level was slightly higher than hed encountered in the c but a few weeks worth of exposure would be below the danger level provided no one got xrayed for a while there were certain fears mercer couldnt purge from his brain and radiation was one of them he hated it it reminded him of firedamp gas in coal mines invisible in its touch and insidious in its death there was no defense except avoidance he walked slowly the snow near the base of the mountain had become ankledeep slush he wondered how close stefansson rosmunder had been to this very spot fifty years ago during his search for the c close he estimated considering the dose needed to kill him so swiftly not knowing the halflife or dissipation rate of an extraterrestrial element mercer proceeded with deliberation like he was walking through a minefield tick tick tick tick tick tickticktick mercers eyes dropped to the geiger counter twentyfive rads about a quarter of the dose needed to cause radiation sickness or about eight times the average yearly exposure people received from background radiation they would be safe for a while but each moment brought an increased possibility of cancer later in life nothing around him looked like a likely radiation source there was no meteor impact evidence on the side of the mountain nor were there signs of otto schroeders air shaft no tailings of waste rock from their mining he looked up and saw he was still ten yards to the left of the face moving laterally and trying to ignore the clicking counter mercer knew he was close the ice had become even more watery as if heated from below erwin had told them that pieces of the meteor kept in the russian villages melted snow even in winter without warning the ground opened up and swallowed mercer in a wet rush he fell about ten feet and landed heavily on his backside in a small ice cave it was an antechamber at the head of the nazi air shaft ahead of him was the long tube descending into the glacier a wall of icy slurry surged down the eightfootdiameter tunnel had this cave not had a level floor it would have carried him headlong into the earth as though hed been flushed down an enormous drain the moment of terror that had tripped his heart gave way to awe as he surveyed his surroundings he wasnt even aware of the pain from the fall then he saw the body it was badly decomposed merely a skeleton dressed in gray rags adorned with brass buttons and piping and medals he recognized the rotted insignia on the corpses uniform he had been a sailor in the german kreigsmarine specifically the uboat service if mercer needed any more proof that erwin puhls story was true here it was but that wasnt what filled him with wonder it was what lay next to the seated body the twofootsquare box of pure gold stamped with the swastikaclutching eagle of the third reich ill be a son of a bitch he breathed superstitious ripples charging his skin like static the nazis had called their operation the pandora project meaning he was looking at a true pandoras box its contents as deadly as the evils the mythological one once contained mercer are you all right anika yelled from above her voice strained by concern yes he replied stay back the geiger counter had been turned off by the fall and he flipped it back on the meter thankfully registered the same dosage as hed found before his sudden plunge he held the probe first to the box and then the corpse finding that it was the sailors body emitting radiation and not the container of satans fist the reading was significantly higher than from the survivor hed found at camp decade meaning this man had received a much more powerful dose fatal in minutes rather than weeks but what about stefansson rosmunder and the crew of the c mercer wondered how strongly had they been hit was it exposure to the corpse or the meteor itself that killed them rosmunder had lasted six months after returning from this area so mercer guessed it was an acute dose of residual radiation from the body considering how they had all bled out he presumed the airmen were killed by a radioactive blast from the fragment sealed in the box the sailor must have opened it killing the flight crew and himself why after surviving for ten years did he commit suicide and murder madness desperation mercer put his hand on the gilded crate noting that its surface was warm to the touch then he realized why the shaft hadnt been buried any deeper the environment and the box had come to a kind of balance melting away much of the snow that fell here but leaving enough to cover the tunnels entrance that was why there werent hundreds of feet of ice blocking the shaft it wasnt until he came along that his added weight overcame the equilibrium between arctic cold and radioactive warmth and exposed the air vent eventually as the meteor fragments decayed the heat would diminish and the glacier would forever seal the tunnel he gave the box a shove and realized that while it was heavy it wasnt solid straining to gain traction on the slick floor he pushed it against the corpse pressing the disintegrated pile of bones into the wall of the excavation partially shielding the space from its deadly rays the geiger counter dropped noticeably next he unfolded the thermal blanket from his pack and draped it over the box to reduce the amount of heat it radiated he would use the other blankets each person carried to further dampen the warmth so when they blocked the entrance the container wouldnt melt away their effort hey down there whatd you find it was ira whats left of a german sailor and part of his set of golden luggage mind tossing me a rope have you out in a second back on the surface mercer changed his wet parka and snow pants for the spare ones theyd brought for an emergency and he told the others what hed found the idea of walking past the radioactive body had a chilling effect on them even after he explained that their exposure wouldnt be too dangerous like him they were all terrified by radiation it took a half hour to pile enough snow near the opening to seal the hole and erase their presence with the pandora box as mercer already thought of it covered by the space blankets the slush would freeze to concrete hardness in a few hours rath would need weeks and a lucky break to find them both of which mercer mused grimly he would no doubt have they lowered each other one by one into the antechamber until only mercer remained on the surface he mounded snow around the hole shrinking the aperture until it was barely large enough to admit him he took one last look at the setting sun and allowed himself to fall into the ice his landing cushioned by waiting arms below flashlights had already been snapped on their beams vanishing into the bowels of the glacier we ready he asked brightly hoping to dispel their apprehension ive got a bad feeling about this marty said as he looked down the stygian air shaft it drives me nuts when they use that line in the movies mercer stopped and turned his eyebrows raised in a mocking expression marty do you think any of us have a good feeling about walking through an oversize nazi sewer pipe that leads to a radioactive chamber filled with god knows what together they started the long descent into the unknown headquarters of kohl ag hamburg germany klaus raeder waited a moment before answering reinhardt wurmbachs question he carefully unlaced his fingers and placed his hands palms down on the tabletop fixing his stare as if pondering his response no he said at last no you wont agree to pay the reconciliation commission two hundred and twentyfivemillionmark settlement or no you wont counter with two hundred million like you promised before no to both raeder replied delighting in the veins that bulged like tumors on wurmbachs forehead tell the lawyers that well consider one hundred and seventyfive million damn it raeder what are you doing the lawyer did nothing to hide his anger we agreed at the last board meeting that we would pay out the two hundred and consider ourselves lucky why make this more difficult by prolonging the negotiations with the jewish groups because we have a fiduciary responsibility to pay as little as absolutely necessary what about our moral responsibility asked reinhardts deputy counsel katrine groener our shareholders dont pay us for that raeder answered annoyed that the woman would ask such a ridiculous question too bad if we offend some delicate sensibilities this is a business decision which is costing the company money katrine persisted our increased expenditures to marketing and advertisement have yet to stem the loss of customers and in the past week weve seen nato cast doubts over kohl receiving the contract to build the computers for the eurofighter unless we come to a quick resolution with the reconciliation commission raeder remained impassive refusing to betray his anger over the possibility of losing the eurofighter contract that had come as a complete shock a week ago when a friend at nato headquarters in brussels had telephoned with the confidential decision now the deal was being openly discussed in capitals all over the continent the french especially were putting pressure on nato to pull the contract from kohl a company they screamed had yet to make amends for its nazi past the irony was that the electronics firm in toulouse that would fill the order if kohl lost out had made a fortune selling radio gear to the wehrmacht right up until d day katrine groener waited for raeder to respond and when he didnt she continued our warehouses are filling with products we have no buyers for as our market share diminishes kohl heavy construction has no new work lined up for the remainder of the year and she sifted through some pages in front of her ah here it is while the corporation is hemorrhaging money ive found weve spent roughly twenty million marks on a project with an accounting number i cant find in any of our books wurmbach did a poor job hiding his astonishment that she knew about he wasnt even sure what the code signified only that it was being handled by raeders pet fascist gunther rath katrine thats a special project still deemed too secret to put through normal channels it ah has to do with ah a new steelmilling process he improvised lamely forget you know about it fine whatever she said looking from the sputtering reinhardt to the glacially cool raeder just to satisfy your curiosity raeder said when he saw that the young attorney wasnt impressed with reinhardts pathetic explanation there will be no further expenditures on as to the eurofighter contract were not out of the running yet once we come to terms with the reconciliation commission well get that deal if they wont go for the one seventyfive reinhardt will give them two hundred million and theyll leave us alone its my decision to wait them out a little longer and save ourselves money we sorely need and in the meantime in the meantime well be denounced by fringe groups and lambasted in the media for harboring nazi secrets but in a few weeks no one will remember any of this raeders confidence wasnt forced he was as certain of his plan now as he was when it had been conceived his intercom buzzed yes kara herr raeder i know you asked not to be disturbed but herr rath is finally on the line from greenland thank you put him through he clamped his hand over the mouthpiece to address wurmbach and groener excuse me please he didnt speak again until the two lawyers had left his office gunther what the hell is going on out there ive been getting panicked calls from ernst neuhaus at the georesearch office in reykjavik the plane with the surveyors society people and the other team is two days overdue what happened to the evacuation the evac went as planned raths voice was faint as the solar max stripped power from the radio he used to patch through to the njoerd and then on to hamburg raeder couldnt be sure of the emotion in his specialprojects director but it sounded like defiance they left right on time where are they raeder feared what he was about to hear there was an accident on the flight back to iceland the plane was lost with all hands the full horror telescoped in on raeder so quickly he felt like he was going to be ill he knew there had been no accident gunther rath had killed those people murdered them in cold blood oh god it isnt supposed to be like this raeder and rath had done many illegal things in their career together but nothing approaching murder yes there had been that arson early on but that was the only time and since then their tactics had lost any trace of brutality industrial espionage and veiled threats were one thing but this what have i done raeder finally saw that he didnt control gunther rath never had thinking he was using raths special propensities in the business world raeder had allowed the neonazi into corridors of power hed never known existed showing him the real meaning of strength now rath was turning the tables unveiling to raeder what depravity actually lurked in his heart and raeder had handed rath the tools he needed to execute the plans of his fascist masters we are proceeding with the rest of the operation rath continued misunderstanding raeders silence as tacit approval for his actions from corporate records we have the general area of the air vent but a weather front has delayed our establishment of the northern base using the rotorstat and snocats well find the tunnel in a day or two what is the man talking about hes killed a dozen people and thought that everything was going according to plan how could i have possibly thought that i could civilize a man like rath hes an animal who worships a cult of evil and death raeder knew he had to put a stop to this he couldnt let rath continue not like this he made his decision quickly it was an effort to keep revulsion from his voice when he spoke im leaving for greenland immediately gunther why we havent found the cavern yet watch what you say this is an open channel like facing a rabid dog raeder had only one choice put the animal down he would send rath back to germany and take over the recovery of the pandora boxes once that was done he would decide what to do with his specialprojects director i will be there sometime tomorrow raeder snapped i dont want you to take any more actions until i arrive is that clear klaus im close you dont need to be here he had another agenda raeder realized the only thing that made sense was that rath wanted the boxes for his nazi bosses hed told them what was in that cavern and was under orders to recover them so they could either be used or sold either option was too horrifying to consider raeder softened his voice he had no idea what the neonazi hierarchy had in store for him if he interfered i know i dont need to be there my friend its just that i want to be ill see you tomorrow he killed the connection before losing control of his emotions he raced for the private bathroom next to his office because he thought he was going to vomit he heaved and heaved but nothing came out responsibility and remorse couldnt be so easily purged he studied himself in the mirror above the goldandmarble vanity he looked the same his hair was in place his complexion smooth his teeth brilliantly white it was in his eyes that he saw the corruption get through this and youll be fine he told himself he liked how that sounded so he repeated it adding i didnt kill those people he did it was his choice not my order no matter what i am not a murderer well pay the commission destroy all the pandora boxes and ill fire rath hell remain silent because to reveal what he knows would be an admission of guilt hes trapped himself he drank a palmful of water and went back to his desk hitting the intercom kara is reinhardt still out there yes herr raeder would you like me to send him back in no tell him to pay whatever the commission is currently asking for i think its two hundred and twentyfive million marks then page our pilots and have the company jet ready for an immediate flight to iceland have my car brought around to the front of the building yes sir raeder dialed his summer house in bavaria hoping to reach his wife his elevenyearold son jaegar answered the phone papa the boy cried before restraining his emotions as his father had taught him how are you sir squeezing his eyes at hearing how hed turned his son into an automaton raeder needed a moment to answer when this was over a lot of things in his life were going to change oh god please let me see them one more time i miss you i miss all of you is your mama home no she went shopping with frau kreiger from next door fatima is watching willi and me willi was jaegars sixyearold brother fatima their turkish housekeeper i need you to take a message for me tell mama that i had to go away this weekend on a trip you arent coming to bavaria the boys engrained reserve could not contain his fierce disappointment im sorry son i just cant when will you be coming reader considered his reply knowing a lie would only add to his familys disillusion not for a long time im afraid i love you jaegar im sorry tell your brother that i love him too and your mother god this hurt give her a big hug for me raeder knew his uncommon burst of concern would confuse the boy but if things didnt go as planned in greenland hed be glad hed made the call it could be the last his family heard from him on his way out of the office he opened his safe to retrieve his licensed pistol a holdover from the kidnapping threats hed received before coming to kohl the pandora cavern the flashlight beam pushed back the gloom for only a few dozen yards before being swallowed by impenetrable darkness with mercer in the lead the group chased the retreating ring of light marching downward at a steady pace protected by a thin bubble of illumination in an otherwise cold black realm otto schroeder had engineered the sloping tunnel so those walking through it would never lose traction on the icy floor and every hundred feet the entire shaft leveled out for a yard or two in case someone did fall without the wind the air was a constant thirtytwo degrees and after so long in belowfreezing conditions many of them had unzipped their parkas none of them were yet comfortable enough to speak the walk through the passage was punctuated only by the rustle of equipment and the slap of their boots even the geiger counter in mercers free hand had remained silent since theyd slipped past the corpse at the tunnels entrance they continued ever downward wending through living rock and glacial ice after thirty minutes mercer estimated they had walked nearly two miles into the mountain and had descended a thousand feet he knew they had to be approaching sea level suddenly the light that had cocooned them no longer brushed the walls it had vanished into an enormous gallery mercer stopped checking the floor to see that it had leveled out the ground was bare rock mined smooth during world war two i think weve reached the bottom training the light upward he could just barely see the underside of the cavern an ugly mixture of ice and rock hanging fifty feet above them others snapped on their own lights and more details emerged the cavern was roughly circular at least five hundred feet in diameter and domed all around them huge tongues of glacial ice were being forced into the cave through fissures in the stone in a few centuries the ice would eventually reclaim the space that the nazis had carved for themselves ahead the floor dropped off to still black water mercer imagined that somewhere across the water was another entrance to the cavern a submerged grotto accessible only by submarine he strode across the cavern to the waters edge by the hightide lines staining the edge of the quay he knew that the path to the open ocean had remained clear after all this time must be the tides that keep it open ira said as he approached if you look closely you can see currents in the water mercer dropped to his belly so he could reach over the side of the pier that otto schroeder had built and dipped his hand in the frigid water he tasted it and spat back into the pool typical salinity it hasnt been diluted by ice melt i bet if we had a submarine we could get out of here without rath ever knowing it mercers attention was fixed on a large gray shape in the water at the far side of the pier ill be goddamned wishing it makes it true ira lasko had to jog to catch up mercer called to the others with lights and they converged at the waters edge close to one side of the chamber i cant believe it low in the water sat a german uboat that looked like shed just slipped down the ways the paint on her upper works seemed freshly applied and there were only a few streaks of surface rust along the side of her outer hull her conning tower stood about twelve feet above her flat deck ringed halfway up by a tubular steel railing her designation u was stenciled on her tower and she looked as sleek and deadly now as she had generations ago no deck gun ira said after a moments examination what this is a type vii the most widely constructed version over seven hundred if i remember correctly she should have an mm cannon just forward of the conning tower he rubbed the sprouting beard on his chin i think this is one of the special torpedo resupply subs the germans built she wouldnt need armament if they were using her to transport cargo in and out of this cave notice the rubber membrane on the conning tower thats tarnmatte an antiradar coating she was built for stealth im glad i never took up your trivia challenge about submarines mercer said impressed by the breadth of laskos knowledge when you spend your life in one of these monsters its good to know their history the gangway spanning the narrow gulf between sub and shore was a short distance away ira shot mercer a look lets explore the rest of this place before we board her you have a plan mercer grinned always a good one rarely for the next hour they split into teams and scoured the chamber there were four separate caverns carved off the main cave as well as a long tunnel bored parallel to the air vent this shaft did not rise up into the glacier but ran level for eighty yards until ending abruptly in a pile of loose boulders and chunks of ice obviously the result of a cavein one of the side chambers had been a machine shop for repairing mining equipment such as generators pneumatic drills lights and small utility loaders ira lasko remained in the workshop while the others continued their exploration another cavern about half the size of the central one had been a dormitory and was filled with rows of bunk beds stacked four high mercer confirmed the slave laborers had used it when he found a star of david painstakingly carved into the underside of one of the beds there were enough bunks for five hundred people double or even triple that if the workers were forced to sleep in shifts most were neatly made the single blanket stretched taut a few were rumpled and he could see the outline of the last person to sleep there that was all that remained of the man or woman an impression it was all that remained of any of them fists clenched he backed out of the dormitory refusing to turn away until he returned to the main cavern buildings for administration planning and housing of the nazi overseers had been erected in the central chamber walking through them was like stepping into a museum uniforms hung neatly in closets dishes were stacked in cupboards and a deck of cards had been left on a table as if the players had just stepped away for a moment where are the bodies marty bishop asked when they left the germans dorm im not sure mercer had been scanning everything with the geiger counter and had yet to find any trace of the pandora radiation hey mercer erwin puhl was at the waters edge standing between a storage dump of fortyfourgallon fuel drums and crates of other cargo as he approached mercer could see that erwin had stripped a tarpaulin from a pile of boxes when his light fell on the topmost a golden reflection flashed back at him pandora boxes he estimated there were at least thirty of them and all were larger than the one they had found at the surface these measured about five feet square and were three feet tall he waved the counter over the neat stack detecting nothing the germans had obviously learned how to properly seal the meteorite fragments there was a palpable amount of heat washing off the gilded crates meltwater dripped from the ceiling high above them running off the pier and into the sea look at this erwin indicated the top box and mercer climbed the pile this one did not have a lid and he could see that the interior was baffled with diminishing sized boxes like a russian nesting doll though all were made of sheets of pure gold any idea why they made them like this erwin asked heat dissipation mercer replied jumping back to the ground he felt along the edge of another box where its internal structure would be attached to the outer shell and found it was warmer there than on the flat sides they couldnt make the boxes solid for cost and weight reasons so they used as little gold as possible designing them this way so the whole thing didnt become too hot to handle clever bastards marty remarked sardonically a shrill scream pierced the air mercer led the two men as they raced across the chamber to where hilda stood with anika klein the chefs face was pale and tears were running down her rounded cheeks anika stroked hildas hair trying to calm her what happened in there anika gestured to a small aperture in the towering rock wall that mercer hadnt noticed before tensed as he ducked into the hole mercer held the geiger counter at the ready he moved through the cramped space twisting his body as he scraped along the rough stone the beam of his light showing nothing the passage ended at a ledge overlooking another cave the bottom of which was littered with tens of thousands of cans and a heavy scattering of bleached white bones closing his eyes and taking a deep calming breath mercer braced himself for a more careful examination he studied the bones for a moment and fell back against the wall a wave of relief momentarily robbing him of energy he backed out of the passage to rejoin the others its a garbage dump hilda saw bones in there and thought they were human theyre not theyre seal bones seal to supplement the food the germans brought here the two survivors hunted seals that ventured into the cavern through the submarine tunnel thats how they survived for ten years down here ira said wiping grease from his hands the provisions couldnt have lasted from the war until i bet they could mercer countered with a thousand people working in here they needed tons of stores if the accident that killed everyone occurred right after a supply run there would have been more than enough canned goods to support two men for ten years especially if they killed an occasional seal that explains why the man at camp decade had such rotten teeth anika said as hilda composed herself once again even with fresh meat ten years without fruits and vegetables would cause scurvy but where is everybody marty asked for the second time since i havent found any radiation mercer answered i think the corpses have been moved to another chamber and sealed inside to protect the two men who survived the accident you think it was a radiation leak that killed them what else could it have been mercer said they all died at the same time otherwise they would have escaped on the sub the man we found at camp decade and the one at the entrance must have been on the surface when the cave was dosed with radiation they could have waited up there for the radiation to dissipate to a safe level before returning underground then they could have moved the bodies to a side chamber and buried them how is it they didnt get killed by the residual radioactivity still in the bodies anika asked the ones we found are still radioactive after sixty years i dont know the germans must have had protective clothing for themselves erwin offered why didnt the navy officer use it when he opened the box when the c flew over no one had an answer to iras question lets get closer to the pandora boxes where its warmer and discuss our options mercer suggested i have a surprise and an idea ill meet you there in a second ira said and went back to the repair shop once they were settled mercer pulled a nearly full brandy bottle from his pack surprise i couldnt take my fathers videotapes and you brought booze marty said angrily thats not very fair i said essentials only mercer took a pull i consider alcohol an essential if you dont want any feel free to give up your share i didnt say that marty backpedaled so whats your idea a low rumbling sound prevented mercer from replying and from the side of the chamber a bright glow appeared in the machine shop before being suddenly doused damn ira cursed a moment later the light returned and stayed on what did you do mercer shouted as ira appeared from the shop laskos grin went from ear to ear played a hunch ira said i noticed the uniform shoulder tabs on the body up the tunnel were the brass cog wheels of the kreigsmarine engineer corps the guy had been the subs chief engineer as a mechanic myself i guessed that he spent the last ten years of his life making sure everything in this place was in perfect running condition its what i would have done but in the fifty years since he died wouldnt everything rust and wouldnt the fuel go bad erwin asked in normal conditions this place would resemble a scrap heap but the low temperature means theres virtually no humidity nothing rusts hell the brass buttons on the uniforms are barely tarnished as to the fuel the germans used diesel with a low cloud point for arctic conditions all i had to do was drain the water at the bottom of a can as a result of phase separation strain out the sediment and preheat it over a can of sterno to put the paraffin back in the solution i had to crank the generator like a bastard to flush the kerosene our german friend used as a rust inhibitor but it should smooth out in a minute or two as it lubricates itself i just cant believe it erwin persisted my car wont start after just one cold night youre hearing and seeing the proof the generator works like a charm with proper care you can leave an engine for decades and all you need to start it is a good battery thats what prevents your car from turning over cold temperature saps their power since the portable generator starts off a flywheel all it required was about fifty pulls on the cord its the lightbulbs that have lost their seals over time the first one blew as soon as the electrical current hit it well this changes a few things mercer said as his original idea evolved i had a feeling wed find a sub down here when erwin first mentioned thats how this base was supplied the germans would have kept one here at all times so they could transport the fragments as soon as they were ready which means its crew would have died with everyone else id thought that we could hide from rath in it by submerging in the lagoon without power how would we have surfaced again by opening a hatch and swimming out mercer answered cant be that deep in here now i wonder if we need to hang around at all ira guessed at mercers intention just because i got a onecylinder generator running doesnt mean the subll still work if the engineer took that much time on the generator it stands to reason his uboat is in excellent condition too ira weighed mercers logic for a second and nodded possibly youre proposing we sail it out of here without ira i never would have considered it but he used to teach submarine operations at the navys sub school in groton connecticut if he can train teenagers to run a nuclear vessel he can teach the six of us how to maneuver this antique correct me if im wrong ira but the principles havent changed much in fifty years havent changed much in a hundred years really lasko agreed nuke boats have a lot more automated controls that fish over there is bare bones uses muscles to open and close valves if nothing more we can use the uboat to hide ourselves but if we can get her running i think our best bet is to get the hell out of here mercer looked each of them in the eye as he spoke without martys satellite phone were still stranded when rath and his goons leave here itll take weeks to walk the six hundred miles to ammassalik considering we barely survived the past couple of days i doubt wed make it a quarter of that distance why the hell did you bring us up here instead of having the pilot land us closer to ammassalik marty asked angrily none of this needed to happen radioactive bodies golden boxes filled with christ knows what maybe ingrid would have marty calm down ira shouted right back mercer had a good goddamned reason the plane would have crashed a hundred miles from the town wed have died closer to it thats all ingrid would have been just as dead im sorry at least now we have a chance but my satphone probably wouldnt have gotten a signal until long after we froze ira stated mercers been buying us time every step of the way so cut him some slack all right marty fell silent capping the brandy bottle mercer looked around the circle of expectant faces proud of them all for handling the past days so well heres my plan i would like anika and erwin since you read german to search the administrative offices thoroughly for evidence ive noticed kohls name is stenciled on a lot of the equipment lying around and now im pretty sure raths job is to destroy it and erase any link his company has to this place we need paperwork and documents that implicate kohl for when this nightmare is over just make sure you dont leave any indications that we were here marty and hilda can give ira a hand with anything he needs what about you im going to work with ira he looked at anika as soon as your search is done join us we dont have much time okay boys and girl lets get busy ira said with the mock cheer of a drill instructor whats first im going into the boat to check it out i want you three to start on the fuel you need to drain the bottom few inches of water from each drum without stirring up the sediment theres a chain fall in the machine shop you can bring out to lift the barrels later well devise a filtering system i should be able to juryrig a preheater aboard the boat so we dont need to cook each drum when were ready to load how much fuel do you think we need marty asked eyeing the hundred or more barrels stacked next to the uboat it would be an exhausting job lets see the typical type vii has two sixcylinder supercharged gw diesels that could push them along at about sixteen knots on the surface and doublecommutator electric motors that produce about five hundred horsepower for a top submerged speed of approximately seven knots ira looked upward as if doing mental arithmetic and then grinned sadistically that means we need all the fuel we can get into her i was afraid of that by the light from the portable lamps wired to the generator mercer and the others got to work while ira disappeared into the uboat after establishing a system and a rhythm they had managed to prepare fifty of the drums when the slender submariner reemerged from the vessel his parka and snow pants were streaked with grime and his face was tigerstriped by smudge marks hows she look mercer called to ira who stood atop the conning tower surveying their progress that engineer knew what the hell he was doing he laughed ive seen new cars fresh off the assembly line in worse condition than this old girl you think this is going to work i honestly think it will i was worried about the rubber gaskets and hoses but theyve been treated with something while theyre stiff as hell they should hold okay once they warm up just in case im only going to run one engine and have the hoses from the other ready as spares what about the batteries well need to charge them if were going to get out of here he drained the hydrochloric acid from them and stored it in big glass bottles so none of the batteries have been eaten away ive just started refilling the sixtythree cells in the aft battery room that should be enough juice to clear the tunnel and reach the surface our priority is to make sure we can submerge her once rath shows up well worry about getting out of here later in that case well start loading the diesel into her main tanks as soon as i check them for water seepage this way we can use her junkers compressor to fill the air tanks for when we want to surface again mercer checked his watch he was stunned to see it was past midnight without the sun to guide his circadian cycle he hadnt realized that theyd been on the move for twenty straight hours well start that after we grab a few hours sleep hilda sagged when she recognized the english word sleep danke where the hell are anika and erwin marty asked dropping to the stone floor and propping his back against a barrel obviously they found something of interest ira climbed down the conning tower and crossed the gangway to the dock hilda took over cooking duties from mercer when he started gathering provisions from the packs freeing him to find anika he found her slumped over the desk in the administration buildings largest office erwin puhl was asleep on a threadbare couch mercer touched anikas shoulder and she came awake with a guilty start oh god i am so sorry she saw that erwin had also succumbed to exhaustion we were reading and took a quick break she looked at her watch three hours ago thats okay mercer smiled weve just knocked off outside have you found anything everything anika replied fire replacing the sleep in her eyes names dates orders procedures the works if we get out of here kohl ag is finished what about the two men who survived the accident that killed everyone else did they leave any kind of a journal thats what erwin was reading the scientist came awake when he heard his name he slipped on his glasses you were right about a great many of your conjectures mercer one of them was a jewish slave laborer named isidore schild the other was the submarines chief engineer wolfgang rossler they were on the glacier when one of the pandora boxes dropped from a crane and spilled its contents the radiation blast killed everyone in the chamber an hour after they got the fragments safely into another box schild and rossler remained outside for two weeks freezing and starving until they felt it was safe to enter again the protective suits the germans brought couldnt take a direct blast of radiation but it did shield them when they moved the contaminated bodies into the excavation and backfilled it by blowing up what they called the hanging wall thats a mining term for the ceiling of a tunnel mercer explained they must be talking about the shaft leading to where the meteorite fragments came to a rest after melting down to bedrock yes thats right they couldnt operate the submarine with only the two of them so they were marooned necessity ended any animosity between the two men they lived off the food supplies and killed the few seals that came into the cavern for the first few years they tried to signal allied aircraft that ventured nearby on their flights to and from england but it was rare any planes came this far north they assumed after several years that when no more planes approached the war had ended jesus mercer shuddered at the idea of being isolated for so long schilds journal is filled with anecdotes about their time here he was a remarkably generous man toward rossler considering the circumstances ill tell you the details later if youd like they decided that the only way to attract attention was if they could shoot down one of the passing planes since they had only small arms from the submarine the only weapon capable of crashing an aircraft was the radiation from one of the boxes they dragged the smallest one to the surface and took turns every day waiting for a plane to fly low enough and close enough for a direct dose of pandora radiation to kill its crew for eight long years they waited until the c flew over rossler was at the entrance so schild doesnt know the exact details he guessed that maybe the plane had engine trouble anyway rossler opened the box sacrificing his own life for schilds and downed the plane as soon as the radiation dissipated enough for his suit to protect him schild went in search of the plane but couldnt find it after two weeks he returned to the cavern despondent he finally gave up a short while later and left packing up enough provisions to sustain him for a week the seals had long stopped coming so he was dying of scurvy anyway he wrote a beautiful suicide note at the end of his journal which leads me to believe he knew nothing of camp decade want to know the sickest part of this mercer said when erwin fell silent had he stayed in the vicinity of the cave entrance after the plane crash he probably would have seen stefansson rosmunder as he searched for the wrecked stratofreighter he passed near enough to this place to give himself a fatal dose of radiation from rosslers body the tales of japanese soldiers surviving on remote islands long after the war were tame compared to the hardships rossler and schild endured only to die so close to rescue there are other parts of schilds journal anika said that are much much worse she held out her hand to erwin for the journal she thumbed through to the passage she wanted pausing to build the strength to reread it this takes place at the height of the mining operation her translation came fluidly as though shed already memorized the passage august can the nazis leave any beauty uncorrupted we learned again today that they cannot we fooled ourselves into thinking the guards didnt know about saras pregnancy yes her belly was hidden under loose clothing but there were more obvious signs of the life within her she was happy an unknown aberration from this living hell that shed been raped by guards who planted this seed no longer vexed her as her time approached shed been beautiful and the guards favorite we didnt understand why they had left her alone these past months now we realize they were under orders not to touch her she gave birth this morning straining as much to free the child as to maintain her silence many of the older women who knew midwifery helped her and as if they knew the due date herman kohl nephew of the industrialist volker kohl and here on an inspection tour appeared moments later with sturmbannfuhrer kress they took the child to the dock the wailing infant was forever silenced by the still waters i write now to the sounds of the old women crying and the snuffling of the guards once again raping sara i pray for the strength to hide from the suicidal thoughts plaguing me since my first day here so that mother and child will never be forgotten the heavy silence in the room served to amplify anikas sobs mercer too felt the salty sting of tears in his eyes a handful of the abstract six million had names and faces for him now he made a silent vow to stop at nothing until kohl paid for what they had done for him there was no ambiguity about responsibility kohl ag is going down he was unaware he spoke aloud anika looked at him and was a bit frightened by what she saw his rage was unlike anything shed ever experienced it shimmered off him like heat waves for the first time she realized mercers capacity for revenge since they didnt know how long they would remain isolated their meal was a light one their rations would be proportioned to sustain them for a week to ten days too exhausted to let rumbling bellies distract them they slept like the dead until ira laskos watch alarm roused them six hours later because of the physical strength needed to move the threehundredfiftypound fuel drums erwin and anika were given the job of degreasing the machinery in the uboat with rags under iras guidance he spent the morning cleaning the subs port diesel engine and checking that her electric motor would operate by jumping it with the portable generator ira had to scavenge wiring from the starboard power plant to get it running smoothly but was satisfied with his efforts mercer spent part of the morning rigging a trip wire device near the surface entrance he formed a sheet of lead into a tight ball that would roll down the tunnel once a lanyard was brushed by passing feet he placed a metal plate at the bottom of the tunnel that would reverberate like a bell when the ball struck it even if raths men sprinted down to the cavern the ball would beat them by ten minutes giving mercer and his group enough time to submerge the boat the whole setup looked innocuous enough to evade suspicion once rath found it they put in eighteen hours of work that day and slept if possible harder that night before mercer would let them into their sleeping bags he made certain that all evidence of their presence had been erased and that everything was packed for the dash to the uboat if necessary theyd considered sleeping on the boat but didnt have enough people to move one of the heavy pandora boxes into it to provide heat the following morning the exertion and cold made them lethargic and illtempered they loaded fuel all morning a filthy job that left them reeling from the fumes by lunch ira had tested all the subs valves and he was confident that when the time came she would dive with her air tanks charged off her compressor she would resurface too hed also managed to coax a few minutes of running time off the port engine and knew what needed to be done to get it running at full power he announced that they were ready with the exception of her batteries hed filled a few with acid so they would hold a charge for lighting the boat but the rest remained empty that job would have to wait until they were ready to leave most of the batteries had cracked in the past decades and were unusable those that ira salvaged still tended to seep acid because it was impossible to completely dry the bilge spaces the leaking hydrochloric acid would mix with the seawater contamination the resulting clouds of poisonous chlorine gas would quickly fill the uboats pressure hull to limit their exposure mercer decided they would fill the batteries just before leaving the cavern after his meager meal mercer gave his team a few hours rest before tackling the batteries as they gratefully fell into their sleeping bags he made the long trek up the tunnel to check his warning device hed thought of a better system to release it and wanted to make the modification climbing a thousand feet in a twomilelong shaft wouldnt normally bother him but he was more tired than he could remember the lack of food and cold so sapped his energy that twothirds the way to the surface he decided to turn back he couldnt afford to waste his dwindling reserves on building what amounted to a better mouse trap with a fraction of a seconds warning a bounding shadow flitted through the beam of his flashlight mercer tried to dodge out of the way as his tenpound lead ball came bouncing out of the darkness toward him it smashed his thigh like a baseball bat at full swing crumpling him to the ground like hed been shot the ball continued its plunge to the cavern a mile and a half away he bit his lip to keep from crying out and tasted blood lying on the floor of the tunnel he strained to see anything farther up the pipe cursing his stupidity for coming up here even if he couldnt see raths men he knew they were coming as he lurched to his feet his right leg would barely take his weight it was dead all the way to his toes son of a bitch he grunted and began loping down the tunnel a shuffling gait that hammered pain to the top of his skull with every step mercer knew the leg wasnt broken and tried to convince himself that he could run through the agony with a halfmile advantage he could only hope that rath would need time to assemble his men at the entrance before descending into the earth at his pace mercers lead would vanish fast there were no tricks he could think of to lessen the pain nothing he could do to increase his speed except push himself harder ira and the others must have heard the ball slamming into the metal plate at the bottom of the tunnel he wondered if they would wait for him and prayed they wouldnt to be captured now because of his mistake was something he couldnt take he knew though that they would wait right up until it was too late the thought that their lives hung in the balance carried him the next half mile he was twothirds home but knew he was tapped out his breathing raged painfully his thigh throbbed even stronger an agony that made him cry with each footfall he reached the cavern floor before he knew it his determination able to push him far beyond what he knew where his limits the cave was completely dark and he could hear nothing over his own pained gasps up the shaft he could just discern a faint ghosts glow of light a distant flicker that warned him he had only a few minutes he left his own light off relying on years of subterranean experience to guide him across the cavern to where the sub should be when he thought he was close he splayed his fingers across the maglite to diffuse its beam and flicked it on his sense of direction was perfect he stood a couple yards from the gangway he looked up to see anika klein standing atop the conning tower she saw him and her face lit up with undisguised relief come on beyond the sub the lagoon was littered with a hundred empty fuel drums that would disguise the one ira had bolted to the top of the uboats snorkel and the gas can hed mounted to hide the attack periscope tell ira to dive mercer wheezed we heard the ball fifteen minutes ago were ready he swept his light across the dock nothing remained of their equipment rath would never know they were here using his arms and one leg he climbed the ladder welded to the conning tower grateful that anika was there to drag him up the last few rungs mercer didnt waste seconds he didnt have by climbing into the sub he launched himself through the open hatch and fell to the floor of the firecontrol space located above the main control room anika followed him through stopping to dog the hatch above them the sub was watertight ira now she shouted down to the control room a steady hiss echoed throughout the uboat as ira opened valves to the sea flooding them with enough water to put the sub on the bottom of the lagoon sixty feet below the keel he knew to trim the flooding to compensate for the subs tendency to sink stern first because of her engines she went under with barely a ripple mercer gingerly lowered himself into the control room as cramped as the room was it was the largest space on the uboat but the low ceiling clutter of pipes wires and conduits as well as the myriad duty stations made it claustrophobic around the large tube for the boats second periscope ira stood in front of the dive controls adjusting the dizzying array of flow valves and knobs marty was seated at the planesmens station his hands kept well away from the twin wheels the others were in the forward torpedo room to distribute weight gently the sub settled on the bottom ira forced a little air into the saddle tanks to prevent suction forming against the silty seabed for fifteen minutes he continued to trim the uboat set the depths for the snorkel and periscope and generally made certain they were secure he scampered around with the agility of a man half his age it was clear that retirement hadnt deadened his training because no one had his specialized knowledge the others wisely stayed out of his way by the end of the week he said at one point all of you are going to know how to run this tin can in your sleep if sleep is a prerequisite after i do a little spying through the periscope im heading for a bunk to get a jump on everyone else mercer joked but pain clipped each word no youre not anika snapped with clinical professionalism youre getting to bed right now you can barely stand mercer made to argue and thought better of it anika had to support his shoulder as she led him to the captains cabin the only private spot on the twohundredfiftyfoot relic you or hilda should have this cabin mercer said when anika stripped off his parka sweet gesture she smiled but we took a vote yesterday by unanimous decision this ones yours she gave him several painkillers which he washed down with a mouthful of brandy no operating heavy machinery for twelve hours she admonished i promise i wont even lift my eyelids her morethanconcerned kiss lingered on his lips long after shed closed the curtain on the woodpaneled cabin georesearch northern camp greenland say again gunther rath snarled into the static filled radio your last transmission not understood we have located the cavern came the response from dieter the driver of one of the snocats advance team has penetrated the access tunnel and verified contents rath looked up from the radio and caught a smile on gretas lips klaus raeder stood behind her but his expression did not change he had just arrived at the base after a series of weather problems delayed his flights excellent dieter we have your location from the tracking device on the cat i will recall all vehicles and converge on your location the solar max swallowed dieters reply the tenuous link was gone rath got to his feet klaus i told you i could handle this i didnt doubt it raeder replied sarcastically facetoface with rath his confidence and certainty had returned its your tactics i question not your abilities greta would you excuse us the northern camp was composed of only one of the dormitory buildings flown up from the main base by the rotorstat by removing a few partitions they had converted four of the bedrooms to an operations center and makeshift galley greta schmidt didnt like being ordered to leave but knew gunther would tell her later what raeder had to say she went to her room without a word raeders voice was tight you will now explain why you felt it necessary to murder a planeload of people maybe i should start by explaining why i murdered a man named otto schroeder outside of munich first and why greta had to kill the russian scientist igor bulgarin here in greenland rath smirked at raeders stunned expression you dont know how close this expedition was to being compromised from the very beginning obviously not raeder said when he found his voice in the kohl archives we burned do you remember transcripts of leonid kuliks interrogation by the gestapo where he said he belonged to a group called the brotherhood of satans fist far from dying out during the war the brotherhood exists to this day i learned through contacts i maintain in russia that this group has been feeding information to a nazi hunter in austria in an attempt to stop us from securing the pandora boxes we werent able to stem the flow of documents so i had a team eavesdrop on the jew and learned that otto schroeder had been a mining engineer who worked on the cavern apparently the only living person with firsthand knowledge of what happened here during our rath paused to find the right word discussion not only did a group of snipers open fire on us but anika klein who i have since learned is the austrian jews granddaughter showed up schroeder was silenced but klein escaped and frustrated our attempts to locate her before she arrived in greenland somehow she discovered the connection between georesearch and us after she arrived here and obtained the support of philip mercer i had no choice but to silence them all and what about the russian you mentioned the one greta killed on your orders to check the body in camp decade she discovered him already checking the corpse for clues about his true identity realizing that igor bulgarin could be a member of the brotherhood greta beat him to death with a tire iron dr klein didnt believe the false clues greta left to make the murder look like an accident and she tried to return to the scene of the crime with mercer the day after she arrived here greta almost succeeded in stopping them by burning camp decade with them inside however luck was with dr klein again and they survived why didnt you tell me any of this raeder demanded these were details you pay me to handle rath said smoothly knowing that his superiors anger was evaporating the evacuation plan wed put together earlier was no longer viable since at least two people knew the truth about bulgarin i had to kill them before they reached iceland the only way to do that without causing even more suspicion was destroying the transport plane en route there had to be another way raeder said though he had already seen that there wasnt anything else rath could have done rath put as much sincerity in his voice as he could muster i thought long and hard about what i did believe me it wasnt an easy decision i admit i was a little rough with otto schroeder but his death was the result of the sniper attack bulgarin died because greta panicked ive been reacting to a situation out of my control we both know my past so i wont pretend that violence isnt an option but i drew the line at murder long ago i took no pleasure from what i did raeder searched raths eyes hoping to see truth in them he decided to believe gunther it was easier than the alternative since he was here he could better control his specialprojects director while he would allow rath to coordinate the destruction of the evidence in the cavern raeder was still wary about the fate of the pandora boxes when it came time to dispose of them he would make sure rath couldnt implement any hijacking scheme he might have planned okay what happens now he said at last my men will empty the cave of everything we can move and burn what we cant explosive charges will seal the place forever so even if there is another survivor like otto schroeder there will be no way to find the base then well haul the pandora boxes out to sea with the rotorstat and dump them in the deepest water we can find how long do you think it will take just a few days well have this building and the snocats back to the main base near camp decade in plenty of time if the danish government decides to revoke our permit and if they dont well turn everything over to the japanese team as scheduled dont worry klaus rath smiled no one will ever know what weve done kohl can pay the jews a pittance compared to what we really owe when raeder went to the bathroom greta schmidt returned to the opcenter well he bought the whole thing gunther struggled not to laugh we knew he would she purred massaging his shoulders i was thinking werner koenig is the only person here not under our direct control he knows that we arent in greenland for any scientific research dr koenigs accident is already planned i want to do it greta said quickly her face flushed laughing rath pulled her down to his lap and bit her ear you liked killing bulgarin didnt you there was no need for her to reply i bet you got off when he died not then she said hoarsely but later in the shower you are a sick bitch thats why you love me i dont love you her breath was coming faster now her eyes glassy she was near orgasm just thinking about murdering her former lover all right thats why you fuck me then the pandora cavern torn between his fear of cramped spaces and being choked again by ira lasko erwin puhl chose to crush his claustrophobia by acting as the crews lookout on the periscope by watching the activities of the blackclad georesearch men working in the cavern he could pretend that he wasnt trapped in an elongated coffin sixty feet under water the powerful floodlights the germans had installed gave him a small measure of security it was only when he returned to the main part of the uboat to sleep that the terror threatened to engulf him once again lasko made sure that erwins bunk was above his own in the amidships officers quarters just in case he had his face pressed against the eyepiece when mercer came up the ladder from the control room hows the view mercer asked and handed him a cup of water same as it was yesterday and the day before erwin stood take a look mercer replaced him on the steel seat and studied the cavern through the lines of the scopes crosshair reticle all the pandora boxes had been moved to the air shaft entrance on dollies raths men had brought and several had already been dragged to the surface by winches anchored at regular intervals along the tunnels length the three wooden buildings had been dismantled and burned and rath had had teams of men remove kohls name from each piece of equipment with torches before dumping it into the water a few pieces of gear had hit the submerged uboat producing a hollow echo that startled everyone inside the first time it happened from the wavering glow radiating from the slave annex mercer could tell that the five hundred bunk beds were also being reduced to ash he carefully turned the scope so the fuel drum bolted to it didnt act too unnaturally as it pivoted through the water he was searching for gunther rath and spotted him near the remains of the administration building talking with greta schmidt and a fortyish man with brushedback bronze hair whom mercer didnt recognize he flicked a lever on the scope to double its magnification the stranger had the sleek look of someone with power and he guessed that this was raths boss the head of kohl ag mercer committed his face to memory although the interior of the sub was thirtyone degrees and their breath was like clouds around their mouths and noses erwin puhl was sweating when mercer looked up from the periscope thanks erwin take back your window on the world the german jumped back to his normal position the stiffness had gone out of his leg but mercer still didnt put his full weight on it when he descended back to the control room whats happening topside ira asked he was training marty and hilda how to operate the planesmens stations anika klein was at the small chart table rereading the captains logbook she had already translated the sections pertaining to how they would negotiate the twists and turns necessary to escape the cavern through the submarine channel it promised to be an interesting trip rath has already dragged a few boxes to the surface and everything else is about destroyed i bet theyll clear out within twentyfour hours how is erwin doing anika asked fine as long as he has his periscope mercer erwin called from above them theyre about to shoot at the barrels what there are three men with assault rifles at the edge of the dock raths talking with them i think theyre going to sink the fuel drums in the lagoon shit raths a thorough son of a bitch isnt he mercer recognized the implication immediately stand by to lower the scope why puhls voice cracked because of the barrel covering it theyll know somethings up if it doesnt sink when they shoot it ira had already moved to the snorkel controls i i cant he was terrified theyre shooting now barrels are sinking he has to tell me when ira said you go up there no erwin needs to do this or he wont last five minutes once were cut off oh god theyre aiming right at me puhl screamed lower your goddamned voice mercer hissed they all heard a fusillade of rounds pound the barrel above them now i cant now mercer snapped or so help me christ claustrophobias going to be the least of your problems they hit the snorkel mercer nodded at ira to retract their only access to fresh air lower the scope erwin the terrified meteorologist didnt reply but the hydraulics activated and the attack periscope sank into its well erwin came down a moment later and ran forward staggering at the circular hatch leading out of the control room he almost made it to the tiny lavatory before he threw up i should check on him anika got up from her seat leave him ira said mercers right he needs to get through this on his own blind cut off from oxygen and stuck in what amounted to a narrow tube even mercer felt the walls start to close in filling the batteries with acid would do them no good now because they couldnt run the charging generator without fresh air and a way to vent the exhaust they were trapped on the bottom until georesearch left the cavern never thought id say this but i hope rath hurries the hell up amen there was no reason for the crew to sleep on a regular schedule except habit but at midnight the uboat was lit by a single red bulb in the control room the only sound came from the patter of condensation dripping from nearly every surface they had spent the day under iras gifted tutelage learning everything they would need to guide the sub out of the cavern when the time came anika lay awake in her bunk above hilda brandts the tension of the past days the horror of it all was finally cracking her resolve erwin had his burning drive to prevent the meteorite fragments from falling into kohls hands to give him strength marty sustained himself by knowing hed become more of a man in the past week than hed ever been as a trained sailor ira lasko seemed immune to the stress she didnt know how hilda held herself together her time in the bundeswehr germanys army perhaps and mercer he accepted every situation so calmly that anika couldnt envision a crisis that would faze him she was sure he was as scared as the rest of them but his impassive demeanor allowed him to work through it effortlessly anika recalled her first shifts on er duty and the nearparalyzing fear shed felt it took months of experience to build the confidence necessary to overcome her anxiety she wondered at mercers experience what hed done in the past to let him handle bomb threats plane crashes infernos and everything else thrown at them it was in the solitude of the nights that anika realized she needed some of his strength she paused to listen to the boat and heard nothing but drips and an occasional snore from ira farther forward she tossed aside the world war twoera blankets and unzipped her sleeping bag she slept clothed in everything but her boots and she gave a little gasp when the cold of the deck plating leached through her socks in the ruddy light from the control room she could see the curtain covering the entrance to mercers cabin she took a tentative step wondering how far she would take this where are you going hilda brandt whispered anika swallowed an unexpected jolt of guilt i have to pee the toilet is behind you past the wardroom hilda reminded with a trace of humor in her voice the chef knew where she was going thankful for the dark because her face was flushed with embarrassment anika turned and padded to the bathroom better hilda teased knowingly when anika returned to her bunk no the first explosion came a little past seven the next morning mercer was alone at the chart table cleaning cosmoline from the pair of mp schmeisser machine pistols hed found in his cabin along with a broomhandled mauser a pistol that had been an antique even when the sub was built hed already checked and matched the ammo he looked upward as if he could see through the hull and the water not that he needed to see to know what was happening garbage dump he said at the second rumble he added slave area the third would be the excavation that was already partially blocked and then came the longest detonation a rolling thunder that went on for five minutes amplified by the acoustics of the cavern the lagoon and the uboat the main access tunnel had just come down blasted into an impenetrable wall of rubble by explosive charges working around the clock the germans had completed their task and sealed the cavern forever what the hell was that ira charged into the control room from the radio shack where hed been attempting to fix the wireless or the sonar gear hed had no luck with either gunther rath burning his bridges chief mercer replied passively hed started teasing ira by using his former rank during their days of training well give it an hour or two to let the dust settle and then surface the boat theyre gone mercer nodded unless a few had a death wish in a swirling vortex of air bubbles the uboat rose from the bottom two hours later black water streaming off her outer hull erwin puhl was in the conning tower and he threw open the hatch not caring about the torrent of water that doused him although the cavern was pitchblack he took the first deep breaths hed enjoyed since losing the use of the periscope hows that mercer asked from below heaven he sighed fingering water from his glasses within a few minutes ira fired the port diesel the engine ran rough from fuel contamination and tarthick oil but he felt he could keep it running long enough to reach iceland mercer went ashore to check the cavern finding it much as hed predicted there was no evidence that anything manmade had ever been in the chamber and all the alcoves were blocked with debris boulders and loose rock from the entrance tunnel spilled far onto the main floor indicating a great deal of its length had been dynamited he was confident that rath and his men had collapsed a similar amount of the tunnel near the surface if they couldnt negotiate the sub through the zigzagging underwater channel they would die here in the darkness he returned to the uboat to help ira fill the battery cells with acid once they recharged if they recharged they would be ready to leave after an hour of noxious work in the cramped aft battery room below the galley ira announced that they were in trouble considering our circumstances youre not telling me anything new mercers eyes streamed tears from the caustic fumes laskos normal humor had abandoned him i mean real trouble most of these batteries are worse off than i thought the ones taking a charge leak like sieves once we close the hatches the subs going to fill with chlorine gas a lot faster than i anticipated mercer tensed how long do you think we can stand it depends on the individual but after an hour or so the boats gonna be a coffin ship can you rig some breathers for us i can but thats not the problem with acid eating into the functioning batteries the boats electric motor will lose power long before the first of us checks out have you figured out how long it takes to get through the tunnel and out to open sea mercers expression darkened according to the captains log about an hour and a half figures ira said sourly alls not lost all we have to do is push our speed over what he wrote to shave off some time it wont take me long to make corrections in the timing of our turns to compensate youre forgetting that his figures are based on traveling a certain amount of time at certain rpms before making a turn back then his boat was loaded with stores and a crew of fifty were at least a hundred tons lighter which will make us faster i can double the rpms but that wont necessarily mean that you can halve the time i hadnt thought of that mercer admitted any suggestions factor in a speed difference of about half a knot faster than the captain used and hope to christ youre right what do you mean hope im right its your idea ira smirked i dont want the others blaming me when we plow into a tunnel wall because we missed a turn it took a further two hours to get ready once the batteries were charged and any electrical faults repaired ira made certain that the air tanks were topped to their maximum pressure tolerance using the diesel they swung the antique away from the pier and lined up with the entrance to the submerged channel out of the cavern hilda and anika would operate the planes while marty was at the helm to control the rudder ira had stationed himself at the ballast control mercer stood at the plotting table where he could watch the gyrocompass on the table were a pair of dividers and the captains log which lay open to the chart of the submerged passage the rough sketch of the tunnel showed a twisting tube filled with numerous obstacles the sub would have to avoid as it wormed its way to the outlet in the fjord were in position erwin called from the conning tower he had noted their distance off the dock using the attack scopes range finder you know what you have to do mercer shouted back up to him the scope sank back into its mount and a second later erwin sealed them in this time he actually walked calmly to the bathroom and had time to close the door before he began retching without the pounding throb of the diesel the boat was remarkably quiet chlorine gas is already starting to build up ira said though it would be a while before they would smell it mercer consulted his chart noting how sharply the cavern floor had dropped off from the pier ira make your depth sixty meters helm steady planes at neutral mercer thought he sounded like an actor in an old war movie but his crew responded to his orders without question hold there ira anika called her eyes riveted to the fathometer at her station gotta tell me earlier or else well sink past our target depths ira said compensating for the mistake aye aye okay depth sixty meters here we go boys and girls consulting his revised propulsion figures mercer spoke crisply give me ninety rpms for ten minutes starting he checked the ratcheting second hand on his tag heuer now silently the uboat began to creep across the lagoon a washing hiss sounding through her hull as she cut the water ill need two degrees up on the planes when i give the command in about five minutes were ready anika said ill be damned chief mercer grinned momentarily overcoming his uneasiness you actually did it you got this thing going dont thank me wolfgang rosslers the man we owe our lives to if the nazis had had a few more like him they could have won the war on maintenance alone when it was time mercer gave the order to raise the bow planes to reduce their depth ira asked if he should vent water from the tanks but the log indicated that this maneuver was done only with the planes after another five minutes the tunnel took its first turn to the right marty steer right ten degrees ill tell you when to ease off this was a shallow turn in what the chart said was the widest part of the passage mercer wasnt concerned about hitting anything yet that fear would come later he watched the compass next to him okay ease her back a little more thats it he let out a breath increase to one hundred and thirty revs and prepare for a hard turn to port in two minutes they were well inside the sunken conduit surrounded on all sides by rock and ice a miscalculation in any direction would kill them all no one knew if the tunnel was still wide enough to allow the sub passage so they were forced to crawl along blindly unable to reduce their speed because of the chlorine gas filling the bilge marty coming up is a ninetydegree corner so bring us to port as fast as you can spin the wheel now anika ten degrees down on the planes make your depth eighty meters thats two hundred and fifty feet she said can this old hull take it well know in a minute creaking like a sailing ship caught in a typhoon the uboat spiraled deeper into the abyss her moans reminded mercer of whale song all right straighten her back out reduce rpms to one hundred weve got a long stretch at this depth make sure she doesnt drift like steel nails drawn across a chalkboard the uboat scraped against the side of the tunnel the impact made them clutch their seats the sub veered away from the wall and then drifted back again harder the hull plates screaming dislodged rocks hit the hull like cannon fire shit marty bring us to starboard two points the unholy screeching died as soon as bishop spun the wheel what happened erwin cried hed run into the control room at the first impact too scared to remain in his bunk despite his claustrophobia we needed to scrape some barnacles off the side of the boat mercer replied we should be back in our lane again marty bring her back to eight degrees magnetic you did take the north poles drift into account didnt you bishop asked and the fact were moving with the current which according to the chart runs at two knots they continued on this course for twenty minutes when erwin who was at the back of the control room began to cough mercer looked over his shoulder and saw a sickly green mist rising from the engine room behind him chlorine gas the first tendrils seemed to wrap around erwins stooped form like tentacles of some wrathful creature hold out for as long as you can before using the air tanks i rigged ira reminded mercer got his first stinging taste of the chlorine his eyes burned they had another fifty minutes before they reached the open it was going to be close in order to protect their vision everyone donned the protective goggles theyd used to combat the arctic weather the tunnel floors about to rise mercer said prepare to blow tanks to bring us to fiftyfive meters ten degrees up on the plane marty weve got a quick series of turns coming up port starboard port you just turn the wheel when i tell you increase to one hundred and thirty rpms again when we level out they went into the turns at the increased speed the old sub tilting first one way and then the other on mercers commands he didnt tell them that the channel through the sturn was just wide enough to allow the maneuver the tail slammed into a rocky pinnacle coming out of the first curve slewing the boat like it had been torpedoed mercers call for a quick correction wasnt fast enough they went into the second turn and the bows veered into the rock face reverberations booming like the inside of a church bell erwin shrieked and anikas knuckles whitened on the plane control wheel were doing fine mercer said choking when he took a lungful of gas marty bring us to port bearing ninety degrees marty nodded unable to speak around the accordion tube from his air cylinder the hull creaked mercer didnt understand what had happened the chart said that they shouldnt have hit anything that second time the pipe was supposed to have widened the next turn was in five minutes and he wasnt sure if they were traveling in the middle of the passage or along one side they didnt have the luck to consider they were in the middle so mercer had two choices were they far left or far right the control room was filled up to their knees in heavy chlorine gas wisps rising up like fog from a haunted moor marty are you right or lefthanded mercer asked and finally started drawing breath from his own cylinder marty held up his left hand bring us two points to starboard for a minute and on my command crank us to port if mercers guess was wrong they would plow straight into the far side of the turn at roughly six knots that kind of blow would crumple the bow like aluminum foil helm steer us to one hundred and thirty degrees everyone felt the tension in his voice angled over so they had to brace themselves the sub went through the turn gas pooling against the bulkheads like a liquid mercer held his breath they all did the beat of the propellers through the water sounded like a distant drumroll by mercers watch they were halfway through the turn he checked the chart and lurched the bottom of the tunnel had dropped away and the ceiling had lowered they were supposed to be at seventy meters dive ira twisted open valves to flood the bow ballast tanks at the same time anika and hilda cranked the dive planes as far as they could go the sub seemed to stand on its nose loose articles crashing to the deck all along the length of the vessel mercers feet came out from under him and he swung free dangling from a steel pipe they didnt quite make it the top of the conning tower crashed into the underside of the subterranean channel ripping away both periscopes in a wrenching squeal of torn metal water flooded the attack center located in the sail and would have filled the ship if it werent for one more watertight hatch a wall of chlorine gas as dense as smoke raced down the boat cutting visibility to almost zero until anika brought the bow back up leveling her out at eighty meters just as her keel began to scrape the bottom the noxious cloud settled again reaching up to mercers waist bring us to seventy meters ira neutral buoyancy again mercer checked the compass and saw that marty had them perfectly on course good job that was my fault sorry mercer paid for complimenting them seared by gas his lungs went into convulsions and vomit shot from his mouth he sucked great drafts from his air bottle cleansing the tortured tissue they had only one more change of depth to clear a peak in the channel and fifteen more minutes to go he knew they wouldnt last that long marty had been on his bottle much longer than he had and mercer could imagine poor erwin had been hyperventilating since theyd left the cavern he changed the figures on the chart making a quick guess rather than an accurate calculation maximum revolutions the tachometer peaked at two hundred twenty rpms bring us to thirty meters on my mark mercer could feel the sub racing along the bottom of the tunnel careening toward a bump on the seafloor that rose nearly a hundred feet come up too soon and they slammed into the ceiling of the passage too late and they would barrel into the mount ten degrees up on the planes mark mercer made up for his earlier mistake his timing was perfect like a crop duster swooping over a field the twohundredfiftyfootlong submarine rose off the bottom of the tunnel and climbed the sloped side of the hill her keel never more than ten feet from its irregular surface at thirty meters the uboat cleared the top of the mound with the ceiling of the tunnel now only forty feet above her ruined conning tower level once again and her screws churned with every remaining amp in her batteries from here it was a race to the open sea mercers gamble had saved them nearly eight minutes when we surface ira said and took another draw from his breathing tube im going to blow compressed air through the boat to vent the gas be prepared for a pressure change once he was satisfied they had cleared the tunnel and entered the fjord mercer ordered ira to blow the tanks the climb from a hundred feet seemed to take forever his air supply was about exhausted and each breath was a supreme effort that left his chest aching anika and ira were in even worse shape come on damm it we are so close he gave anika a draw off his supply and she sucked at it greedily hers must be empty he thought passing through twenty meters mercer felt his vision begin to close in on him and he took the breathing tube back for a moment he could taste anika on the mouthpiece somehow erwin found the strength to climb the ladder to the escape hatch he wasnt going to remain on the uboat one second longer than necessary pushed more by fear of confinement than of the gas the sub emerged from the sea bow first lifting forty feet from the water before slamming back again blowing off sheets of frothing water protected from the waves of the denmark strait by the fjords towering mountains the cauldron of turgid water around the sub was the only mark on the otherwise calm bay she rolled for a moment as ira pumped up the air pressure in an effort to vent the poison gas as soon as the exnavy man nodded to erwin he undogged the hatch air pressure blew the hatch outward sucking out a majority of the gas icy water from the flooded attack room rained into the control space showering the crew erwin scrambled up the ladder twisting around the bent remains of the two scopes to reach the next ladder the outer hatch spun freely and he threw it open reveling in their first sight of daylight in a week hilda and anika at his heels he clambered the rest of the way out of the sub and stood fully upright facing eastward to the open end of the fjord several miles away no one heard the shots hammering the conning tower but the metallic twang of ricochets sounded clearly lead and fractured steel exploding in all directions erwin felt a twin sting as his brain registered what was happening and he went limp allowing himself to fall back into the attack center his blood stained the pooled water pink hilda screamed even as the barrage continued against the uboats steel hull anika began to check his injuries like her mercer didnt hesitate it was as if hed expected such an ending to this hellish trek he raced back to his cabin and reemerged with a machine pistol in each fist spare clips tucked into the pocket of his snow pants wordlessly he tossed one mp to ira racked back the cocking handle on his own and climbed for the bridge the ice sheet above the pandora cavern the georesearch bell jetranger flared into a maelstrom of ice and snow that its rotors had just kicked up the impenetrable fog settled only after the blades began to slow dusting the two idling snocats a dozen men and a cargo sledge stacked with the recovered pandora boxes the smaller box found in the antechamber at the top of the air vent was kept separate the snow around the vent had been trampled flat by the frantic work to recover the golden chests nothing remained of the tunnel itself but a stain of dust that had belched from it when it had been dynamited the men who had completed the work waited for the rotorstat to come and carry the boxes away klaus raeder was sitting in the insulated snocat and hadnt heard the choppers approach until it was nearly upon them the flash of anger that jolted his body gave way to an eerie calm there was no need for the chopper here that meant rath was about to make his play for the deadly hoard for the tenth time in the past hour he glanced into the cargo area behind the cats rear seat the two assault rifles used to sink the fuel drums in the cavern were safely locked into an integrated rack raeder stripped off his heavy glove and jammed his right hand into his snowsuit pocket where he had the loaded automatic pistol hed taken from his office hed had no problem sneaking the weapon out of germany customs paid little attention to corporate jets he opened the vehicles door and stepped out there was little wind but the air was as clear and cold as crystal gunther rath stood a short way off with greta and the professional driver dieter before raeder took two paces a shadow passed overhead he looked up the rotorstat had come over the crest of the mountains that divided the ice sheet from the sea its bulk eclipsing the weak sun for a moment it was an otherworldly sight more befitting titans than men the four engine pods mounted on the side of her great white hull were larger than the jetranger helicopter sitting insectlike in the snow the pitch of its airships engines changed as it began to slowly settle toward earth raeder approached rath what is the helicopter doing here the rotorstat wont be able to land out here without a mooring mast well attach her lifting cables to the cargo and then follow in the chopper as she heads out to sea to drop the boxes no raeder wouldnt pretend to go along with this charade im not going to let the pandora boxes out of my control until i know they will be dumped we are getting on the rotorstat klaus she cant pick us up without a mooring mast rath said placidly we can watch from the chopper the noise of the descending airship increased as she fell below the tops of the mountains the drone of her power plants echoing off the rock the downdraft from her rotors began to stir the surface snow raths logic was reasonable it was always reasonable klaus reflected his specialprojects director could find excuses for murder and torture and make it sound sensible as if there was no other way but there were always other ways only it had been easier for raeder to let rath give in to his brutality no more raeder had just a few minutes left the boxes would slip from his grasp if the dirigible took off without him this is as far as im going to let you go gunther tell the airship pilot to pick us up raeders pistol came out in an easy maneuver unwavering and deadly and then the gun was lying in the snow ten feet away and klaus raeders arm was numb from fingertips to elbow klaus raeder looked first at his limp hand and then at the gun and finally at gunther rath expecting the pistol to paralyze rath raeder had not anticipated the lightning kick that sent the automatic flying rath stood implacably a trace of a smile on his face as if inviting raeder to dive for the weapon he was closer by ten feet but when he peered beyond greta and rath raeder saw that the workers whod emptied the pandora cavern had watched the onesided confrontation and each man was armed with either an assault rifle or a pistol the guns in the back of the snocat werent the only ones rath had brought to the area raeder realized too that he didnt have the mens loyalty they were raths klaus i dont blame you for trying to stop me i think i would have been disappointed if you hadnt gunther picked up the fallen pistol and handed it to greta knowing he had been outmaneuvered raeder accepted temporary defeat what do you plan to do with them no one will ever be able to build a bomb with the meteor fragments they dont need a chain reaction klaus hitlers plan was to load bits of it into v rockets at peenemunde and launch them at london they were designed to explode a thousand feet above the ground and spread their radioactive payload over a tremendous area since much of london was rubble the pandora dust would have lain there undetected with all the other debris silently poisoning an entire population it was estimated that just six warheads would have killed every living thing in london within two months it seems though that the uboat used to transport the fragments must have been lost during the mining operation and an accident in the cavern killed everyone else i assume der fuhrer lost interest in the proj ect then however in todays world the pandora fragments have a certain value as a terrorist weapon its less random than a chemical weapon easier to maintain than a biologic one and unlike other radiation sources it is completely untraceable just a few grams placed in say a busy subway station would consign every person walking by to a lingering death as it decays it creates its own shielding and can be removed safely i cant think of a better weapon for terrorism can you youre going to sell them rath looked pleased with himself as he replied i had three different bids to choose from north korea offered the most money but i cant see exiling myself to pyongyang ditto goes for iraq i ended up accepting the libyan offer since its close enough to europe to sneak over occasionally what about your precious nazi party now are you abandoning them who do you think gets most of the hundred million dollars thirty minutes later the cargo pallet laden with the boxes was secured to the airships lifting cables raeder rath and greta schmidt were in the back of the strippeddown bell helicopter the workers were already aboard the two snocats and on their way back to the temporary northern camp where they would disassemble everything for the return to camp decade because the weight of the cargo approached her maximum limit the rotorstat had to first fly out over the ice sheet to build up aerodynamic lift before turning back for the coast it took the dirigible twenty minutes to gain the thousand feet of altitude she needed to clear the mountains only then did the jetranger take off with the smallest pandora box resting between rath and raeder greta sat next to her lover the confiscated pistol clutched on her lap klaus raeder twisted in his window seat to get a glimpse of the rotorstat trailing the helicopter the airship was sailing a half mile behind them and yet seemed ready to swallow the chopper after being airborne for ten minutes they were still over greenlands jagged coast of bays inlets and fjords that was when raeder saw the research ship njoerd in a narrow bay two thousand feet below them he realized that the cargo would be transferred to the ship but didnt understand why he asked rath for one we need the rotorstat to return the snocats to camp decade also the airship tends to advertise her presence wherever she is my plan is for the njoerd to take the boxes to tripoli while the rotorstat returns to europe for the completion of her test flights a large area of deck behind the njoerds superstructure had been cleared to receive the cargo of golden crates and workers were preparing to guide the nets into position the chopper swung wide to leave plenty of room for the ponderous dirigible as it descended toward the ship hovering a quarter mile astern and five hundred feet up the pilot spun so that his passengers could watch the delicate placement of the cargo suddenly a portion of sea just fifty yards from the research ship came alive as if the water was being boiled like leviathan rising a gray torpedo shape emerged from the swelling waves rising into the air until a quarter of the vessels length was exposed mein gott rath raeder and schmidt said at once they recognized the antique uboat at the same time and knew where it had come from still bobbing on the swells of its own creation the conning tower hatch crashed open and a figure emerged rath ordered the pilot in for a closer look hoping it was mercer who had exited the submarine first because some of his guards were already at the rail of the njoerd armed with assault rifles before rath could discern the mans features winking lights shot from the weapons and the man vanished in a red mist patch me through to the rotorstat rath ordered a moment later the airships pilot came over the radio what do you want me to do abort the cargo transfer until we take care of the submarine i dont know if i can the engines are straining just to slow our vertical descent the airships four rotors whipped the air so strongly they rippled her kevlar skin the dirigible would need to build up forward speed so her airfoil shape gave her additional lift the cargo nets dangled only fifty feet from the surface of the bay her heavy mooring lines already trailed in the water rath looked back to the sub just as another person gained access to her protected bridge it was mercer and he remained huddled out of sight from the njoerd his attention was on the airship so he didnt notice the helicopter hovering behind him making sure his seat belt was tight and greta had klaus covered gunther rath opened the jetrangers side door arctic air blasted him like a hurricane and numbed his face and hands he couldnt wear his gloves and fire accurately so he left them off when he drew his pistol he activated the weapons specially mounted laser sight with the sub rolling and the chopper bouncing he doubted he could get off an accurate shot but all he wanted was mercers attention until the rotorstat could bull its way out of the fjord the red dot of light wavered all over the top of the conning tower until it streaked across mercers stooped form rath began firing from his vantage mercer couldnt see the rotorstat he could only hear it thundering above him its noise drowned out everything figuring they couldnt see him he chanced a look over the lip of the bridges coaming that was when he spotted the njoerd and the men lined at her side with weapons trained at him he ducked again as fire raked the conning tower when erwin had fallen back into the sub and hed heard the dirigible mercer had assumed the shots had come from above now he knew who had fired the scathing fusillade theyd surfaced right in the middle of the cargo transfer if it werent for bad luck he whispered iras head appeared through the hatch hows erwin anikas working on him now i dont think its too bad what happened the njoerd is about fifty yards off the port side and the rotorstats hovering just beyond her shes coming this way get back below and crank up the compressors fill the ballast tanks with air and prepare to dive leave your gun i have an idea i dont like it when you say that ira remarked and disappeared below mercer was preparing to take another look at the airship when a shard of whitehot steel ricocheted inside the bridge and buried itself in his thigh he fell heavily clamping a hand over the burning wound and looked up a big bell helicopter hung in the sky behind him with its side door opened he could clearly see the pistol in gunther raths hand and the sick smile on his face fluidly mercer pulled the mp from under him and squeezed the trigger the heavy machine pistol bucked like he was holding a live wire and jammed after half its thirtytworound magazine emptied as he recocked to clear the fouled breach the chopper twisted out of range he next aimed blindly toward the njoerd and pulled the trigger again raising himself as the barrage scattered the gunmen at the vessels rail in the moments reprieve before they regrouped he slammed home a fresh magazine he yelled down the hatch marty i need help screw this lets get out of here though angered mercer couldnt bring himself to blame martin bishop sealing the hatch and motoring away would be the smart thing to do but mercer wouldnt let that happen not when he had a chance to end this once and for all the pandora boxes were vulnerable and judging by the width of the fjord and the height of the mountains the bay was a thousand feet deep more than enough goddamn it marty get your ass up here the rotorstat was struggling over the njoerds deck slowly building speed that would become altitude in a few moments while the cargo nets were out of range the airships mooring lines made parallel vs as they were dragged through the calm water they would sweep across the uboats forward deck in twenty seconds or less the monstrous gas bag blotted out the sun as it came toward him its shadow spreading across the bay like a malignancy prop wash stirred the water behind her what do you need marty appeared at the hatch his firm voice in opposition to his frantic eyes take this mercer handed him iras mp point it at the helicopter if it gets too close or at the njoerd if those men get organized again ive never fired a gun in my life what if i need to change the clip if you need that much ammo ill probably be dead in his nervousness mercer cocked his gun again by mistake and ejected an unused round the chopper was a quarter mile away watching from a safe distance raths pistol was no match for a submachine gun the men whod been at the njoerds rail had found cover behind her gunwale or pieces of equipment they darted looks at the stationary submarine and fired occasional rounds to keep mercer pinned they seemed content with the stalemate because it allowed the rotorstat the time it needed to get clear screw that mercer said and unleashed a burst at the research vessel satisfied by the angry sparks of lead meeting steel he vaulted over the bridge rail on the opposite side of the conning tower and landed on the deck in a heap raths chopper roared at him but when he raised his weapon it banked away again rath took a snap shot as it pirouetted and hit nothing the dirigible was directly overhead looming like a fortystory building emptying a clip into its belly would have had the same effect as spitballs against an elephant so mercer ignored it the mooring lines were what he wanted they dangled from her bow to the sea crossing over the subs hull in the center of the uboats forward deck in seconds the fleeing airship would draw them out of reach mercer would need to cross thirty feet of metal nomansland with an unknown number of gunmen holding him in their sights his mouth was dry and his leg strobed with pain in time with his heart now or never cover me marty he couldnt be sure he had been heard over the airships quad rotors but he launched himself anyway the firing began at once and was met by a burst from the conning tower mercer ran on weaving along the deck until his foot caught against a hatch and he sprawled bullets searched him out and he scrambled to his feet firing to his left as he cradled the mp the mooring ropes were manila at least three inches around permanently attached to the airships internal structure and strong enough for ground handlers to haul the rotorstat against a stiff breeze as one oozed across the deck like a fleeing snake mercer dropped to his knees fired the last of his clip at the njoerd and tossed aside his weapon he needed both hands to lift the line it was slick with seawater and doubly heavy he ran back to the conning tower martys wild bursts keeping the gunmen at bay for precious seconds the rough line smeared skin off his hands as the rotorstat towed it past the uboat by the time he reached cover only fifty feet remained before the end would slither through his grasp he looked up to see the chopper returning rath must have realized what he was attempting and was coming in to stop him raths clothes whipped in the downbeat of the helos rotor the noise drowned the report but mercer knew the german had fired from the recoil of his gun arm he wrapped a loop of the mooring rope around a railing stanchion so it wouldnt be dragged back forward a shouted warning to marty was muffled by the rotorstat so all mercer could do was pray as he threw himself off the side of the sub more shots pinging against the uboats metal hide the frigid water sucked his breath out the instant it reached his skin the cold was solid like ice but much much worse it pounded against his skull and lanced into his joints the wound in his leg went numb mercers clothes quickly became saturated and he felt himself being dragged under the surface kicking first one foot and then the other he managed to remove his moon boots saving himself several pounds but the swim back up was agonizingly slow his head broke the surface he reached for and grabbed one of the many slits in the subs outer hull the bell jetranger was showing her tail as she moved out of range again marty must have chased him off mercer struggled to climb the side of the boat the rough edges in the slits digging into his stocking feet like razor blades a hand touched his arm and he saw anika klein reaching for him she must have joined marty on the bridge and jumped to the deck when she saw mercer dive into the water tie off the landing line the shout sounded distant in mercers frozen brain martys doing it she got a grip on mercers forearm and heaved him up to the deck a couple of feet away marty worked knots into what little remained of the disappearing landing rope threading the line through a number of larger hull slits it came taut just as he got the line secured to the sub he looked up to see the rotorstat come up short against its leash straining the huge dirigible pivoted around its bow losing altitude until her deadly cargo dipped into the ocean for a moment her engines screamed got you you son of a bitch marty shouted lets finish this mercer stood above them the schmeisser rippled again and hilda brandt motioned them to hurry the black gun smoking in her beefy hands like a fish struggling for its life the airship whipped back and forth on the end of its tether straining to break free from the uboat rath must have radioed the pilots and told them that if they released the pandora boxes their survival would be shortlived mercers hands were frozen claws as he climbed the ladder to the bridge under hildas covering fire anikas shoulder was under his backside as she headed to the top of the conning tower once they were safely on the bridge hilda directed them to get below she would keep up a steady barrage to prevent anyone from the njoerd launching a boat and cutting the line as he reached the control room mercer saw erwin puhl propped against the chart table his shirt was off and seeping bandages covered his shoulder and wrapped under his arm the meteorologist was ashen his lips pressed tight in pain are you okay mercer asked through chattering teeth anika said i am the first bullet went in and out under my arm the other was a ricochet buried in my shoulder it hurts but ira mercer gasped as he started stripping off his wet clothes are you ready say the word close the hatch marty and get down here anika helped mercer remove the remainder of his clothes he stood naked and dripping watery blood his skin blue and puckered dont judge me in this condition he said when she glanced at his groin she threw blankets over him as hilda and marty descended into the sub dive the ballast tanks gurgled as they filled with water and the boat slowly began to sink above them the rotorstat pilot saw the swirl of air bubbles around the antique sub and knew what was going to happen next his loyalty to rath ended at that instant and he nodded to his copilot dont do it he heard rath screaming over the headset the njoerd is sending out a boat to cut the mooring line you can hold on dump it the pilot said the copilot hit a switch that severed the cables securing the cargo nets to the airship thirty tons of gold plundered by the nazis and a ton of the deadliest element on the planet fell away from the dirigible it splashed into the sea and vanished the rotorstat rose like a childs balloon until it once again came up against the rope nose down and engines straining she fought a tugofwar against the sinking uboat trying to pull her into the ocean they would be free if they could hold out long enough for men from the njoerd to cut the rope the entire craft shuddered with the power of her four engines and massive rotors the pilot jettisoned fuel in an attempt to lighten his ship further but it made no difference as the altimeter unwound slowly he didnt need to look out the cockpit window to know it wouldnt even be close what are we going to do his copilot asked finally glancing out and seeing the smooth bay rising to meet them the pilots answer was just one word die the bow of the airship struck in a colossal explosion of spray and her remorseless downward plunge was checked she continued to hang there her nose like a dimple in the sea on the uboat they all felt the hull lurch when the rotorstat hit the surface even with the ballast tanks full the sub couldnt overcome the buoyancy of million cubic feet of helium the tugofwar had come to a standstill whats our depth mercer gasped as he drew a mouthful of brandy to warm his insides forty meters and holding we cant pull her under we dont need to mercers expression was savage blow the tanks and surface not fully understanding mercers plan ira blew compressed air back into the ballast tanks and watched the fathometer as the sub ascended once again because of the airships nearvertical position the rotors were no longer adding lift so when the sub rose and tension was released off the bow line her tail dropped before the pilots could compensate the massive underfin sliced into the water like a knife blade as she belly flopped and then she began a roll onto her side powered by jet turbines the rotors sliced air in a blur but when they came in contact with the water the teflon blades came apart like scythes hundredfoot slashes appeared in her skin and helium burst from the envelope in a screaming torrent it was her death cry half deflated and waterlogged the airship settled into the water and began to sink internal pressure pooling her lifting gas into pockets within her envelope that ruptured like boils part of her envelope fell across the stern of the njoerd kevlar fabric tangling and snaring on her deck cranes men scrambled to cut away the entanglements before the huge weight capsized the ship the airships other engine pods struck the ocean and more pieces of blade ravaged the gas bag and the njoerd a hundred feet from the dirigibles limp bows the uboat appeared once again as plucky as a bathtub toy gunther rath had watched the destruction from a safe distance and when he saw the sub he went berserk get closer he shouted at the pilot loading a fresh magazine into his glock he could see movement in the conning tower as two people came out on the deck one held an ax while the other had a schmeisser theres nothing we can do the pilot said get me down there rath screwed the guns muzzle into the pilots ear the chopper came at the sub like a hawk in a stoop and raced into a burst of mm rounds from the mp rath got off only one shot of his own before the charge carried him out of range in the moments it took the pilot to swing around for another pass one of the men had leapt to the deck and was hacking at the rope with the ax it parted at the third swing ill kill you gunther rath raged i doubt it klaus raeder laughed over the wind swirling through the helicopters cabin youll get one more shot off while they pump a dozen rounds into us and then theyll close the hatch and there wont be a thing you can do darling hes right greta said the boxes are gone but we still have this one she nudged the golden chest at her feet we can land on the njoerd and be far away by the time they reach civilization for a second she thought he was going to shoot her for suggesting it instead rath reholstered his pistol and turned his gaze out to the ruined airship draped across the stern of the njoerd greta wasnt going to risk asking him to close the door so she hunkered deeper into her parka rath looked across to klaus raeder sizing him up as if he were a commodity he said nothing but raeder recognized the feral look of a cornered animal rath was about to lash out the emotion was there just at the surface and ready to explode gunther reached into his coat again and withdrew the glock with a casual flick he tossed it out the door i would have killed you if i hadnt he explained by the time they get njoerds deck cleared enough to get under way mercer will be halfway to kulusuk well never be able to catch him so were altering our plans were going someplace where im going to need you it took twenty frustrating minutes for the helipad on the njoerd to be cleared of debris from the destroyed airship once they were down rath learned that there wasnt enough aviation fuel on the ship to use the chopper for the next leg of their journey they unlashed one of the powerful boats stored on the research vessel by then the uboat was long gone an hour later gunther rath greta schmidt and four of raths best security men were aboard the sleek oceangoing boat klaus raeder was trussed in the hold with the last box of meteorite fragments at thirty knots the boat had a range of three hundred miles they would make their destination shortly before nightfall aboard the u oily smoke billowed from the port diesel and poisonous vapor rose from the battery compartment forcing the crew to leave all the subs hatches open ira futilely waved a rag above the clattering forest of conrods cams and lifters trying to see what was fuming so badly the noise of the faltering motor absorbed his string of curses hows it look mercer shouted over the din lasko wiped grease from his face like we arent going to make it to iceland kulusuk or anywhere else he spat a black glob onto the deck piston rings are shot in at least two cylinders gaskets are failing all over the place and if it werent for the oil i salvaged from the starboard engine this pig would be dead in about an hour what can you give us ira scratched the stubble now fringing his otherwise bald head four hours maybe five we can return to the greenland coast but well be right back where we started from so weve got a decision to make yup talk to the others ill go along with whatever you decide i have to stay here and coax her along mercer carefully backed out the narrow alley between the engines and ducked through two watertight hatches to reach the control room he yelled up to the bridge at the top of the conning tower where marty was acting as lookout hilda brandt sat at the helmsmans station making sure the boat stayed on course anika had just come back to the control room after checking on erwin who was resting in his bunk marty clambered down the ladder and moved to anikas side whats erwins condition doctor he asked her hes fine ive got antibiotics keeping infection at bay and he didnt lose enough blood for shock to be a concern the bullet fragment in his shoulder should come out but isnt doing much harm in the short term the one that passed through under his arm didnt hit any major blood vessels or bone i just wish there was something i could do for his pain erwins a lot tougher than he looks marty opined thats for sure okay folks mercer began the good news is we have enough brandy for an impromptu party the bad news is we cant invite guests since it appears we wont make it to civilization his tone then became serious ira says the engine wont last for more than five hours meaning that if we continue east well stop long before iceland and if we turn south we wont reach kulusuk either what are our options anika asked confident by now that mercer would find a way a we dont reach kulusuk and b we dont reach iceland thats about it can we return to the coast of greenland to wait for rescue marty asked mercer shook his head i doubt anyone will find us remember this is one of the most remote places on earth providing we find a suitable place to beach our foods just about gone and without communications gear well be marooned again we have guns we can hunt seals marty said reasonably once rath gets the njoerd under way hell scour the coast looking for us hell spot the sub from his helicopter on the first pass if you think we can submerge until he flies away you can forget about it because we know about the pandora boxes rath wont leave until hes certain were dead no one spoke for a minute because none could think of an argument their fear further chilled the control room we have a third option it was erwin puhl he stood at the hatchway connecting the crews quarters to the control room his upper body was swathed in bandages a wad of surgical tape at the bridge of his nose held the broken halves of his glasses together i heard you talking anika crossed to him in three strides bracing his shoulder with hers she led him to the seat behind the plotting table her expression was a mix of concern and annoyance she didnt want him out of bed but the determination on his face led her to believe that any admonishments would be wasted by the time she eased him into the chair erwin was trembling in the dim light of the control room his skin had become gray a map of the denmark strait was flattened against the plotting table with the broomhandle mauser pistol and the captains log where are we exactly he wheezed mercer indicated a spot about eighty miles off the coast of greenland a bit south of the fjord they had just escaped and todays date is the fifteenth right there is a ship coming through the strait tonight that will be about here in five hours well within our range there isnt much shipping through these waters mercer said how do you know because another member of the brotherhood of satans fist is on her to take possession of the last remaining icon that rasputin commissioned the one leonid kulik never destroyed realization struck like a punch the universal convocation aboard the sea empress yes the pope is returning the icon to the russian orthodox church and brother anatoly vatutin is there to receive it mercer was silent for a second thinking i remember when we first met you mentioned the empress would be coming through the strait i thought it was strange that you knew her route considering it was supposed to be secret your colleague on the ship told you the sailing schedule thats right erwin agreed why is the ship this far north asked anika to take advantage of the spectacular aurora borealis created by the solarmax effect mercer didnt like coincidences and he was suspicious about this one he thought there could be another reason the sea empress happened to be in these waters but he kept it to himself how sure are you of this information he asked erwin the scientists voice firmed positive the top delegates had to approve the route long before they sailed brother anatoly stole the schedule from bishop olkranszy his superior at the convocation after anika translated the conversation for hildas benefit mercer could see that the group was evenly mixed about their options and decided that this wasnt the time for a vote it would be smarter just to make the decision himself he had gambled many lives over the years his own the most often and the burden never got lighter the five other survivors had put their trust in him and as their leader mercer had to do what he felt was necessary life hed learned wasnt about making the most right decisions that was simple the true test was being able to minimize the effects of the wrong ones and he felt hed made so many of the latter in the past weeks that just one chance remained to put everything right again he carefully worked out the vector on the chart anika have hilda steer one hundred and four degrees marty run back to the engine room and tell ira to open her up as much as he dares his orders were carried out instantly ill be topside he said his voice suddenly becoming thick in his throat i need some air like the night the titanic sank a thousand miles south of their position the ocean was as calm as a millpond darkness was creeping across the cloudless skies and already faint waves of light were appearing high in the heavens the aurora was going to be breathtaking its added illumination would also reveal any drifting icebergs in plenty of time to maneuver around them mercer tightened the hood of his parka jamming his fists into his pocket he was left alone on the bridge for a half hour until anika bobbed up through the hatch wordlessly she handed him two protein bars for dinner they munched in silence the cup of water had a skin of ice when she took a sip her eyes rarely left mercers face pfennig for your thoughts with the exchange rate thats about half a cent he said darkly sounds like youre overpaying his words stung her sorry id like to be alone right now so you can brood she challenged so i can think for you i believe it is the same thing why do you continue to blame yourself without you wed all have been dead on the plane from camp decade because i interviewed otto schroeder if anyone is to blame it is me no its gunther rath mercer had fallen for her trap anika smiled a kaleidoscope of color from the aurora shimmering off her jet hair see you know the truth and yet you beat yourself up as if everything is your fault that is foolish for me its inevitable because you let it mercer couldnt respond and they lapsed into silence again anika fidgeted as if she had something she wanted to say and didnt know how when she finally spoke her voice faltered back in the fjord i should have stayed below to tend to erwin i am a doctor and my duty was to my patient instead i went up to the conning tower i thought i just wanted to help now i realize what i really wanted was to take the gun from hilda and shoot those men on the njoerd ive trained my entire life to ease suffering and all i could think about was killing them for being part of the same evil that murdered all those people in the cavern sixty years ago i have never wanted to kill before the admission cost her but you didnt wanting to do something isnt a crime anika i want to cheat on my taxes every year that doesnt make me a criminal yes but you havent taken an oath to pay your taxes the way i have to heal people my place was with erwin not indulging in my desire for revenge she paused youve youve killed people before havent you yes the crew on the blimp being the most recent how do you you know handle it i dont i justify it by telling myself that they would have killed me if i hadnt acted first then i bury the guilt as deep as i can praying that one day the nightmares go away but mercer didnt say it afraid that voicing the truth would somehow crack the barricade hed built around those emotions the same way you deal with the trauma patients you lose you concentrate on those you did help anika searched his eyes and saw the lie she let it pass because the joyrider whod died in the er before she came to greenland was the fiftyseventh patient shed lost and she had no idea how many shed saved i shouldnt have asked im sorry hows your leg it hurts a bit but the stitches you laid feel fine thanks mercer recognized that shed let him off the hook i should make you my fulltime doctor after the helicopter and the dc im never getting on a plane again dont expect me to come to the states for a house call mercer smiled ill only get hurt in europe they talked easily for the next couple of hours not about anything in particular just enjoying the sound of each others voice the cold finally forced anika below again she paused at the hatch unable to resist returning to the subject they had left behind if you ever want to compare nightmares she said ill be there for you she ducked out of sight before mercer could respond ira lasko came up the hatch a moment later and found mercer laughing to himself whats the joke me im learning that im a lot more transparent than i thought how you doing down there my heads about ready to explode from fumes but im hanging in we should be about an hour from the sea empress i think the engines going to make it ive even managed to cobble together enough good batteries to give us some electrical power to maneuver once the diesel kicks out great job you think well find the cruise ship shell be lit up like a carnival and the weathers cooperating for once i think well spot her mercer moved to the hatch i might as well let a couple of the others stand watch im freezing my ass off marty took over on the conning tower while mercer spent a few minutes in the engine room soaking up heat from the big diesel he was back in the control room when with a grinding crash the port engine seized the thrashing propeller stopped so suddenly that the entire boat torqued over the eerie silence seemed unnatural after so many hours of clanking noise you goddamned whore ira was heard shouting you filthy piece of shit you can do better than this chief youre supposed to whisper sweet nothings to machinery mercer yelled back this is a german engine they like the rough stuff he came forward sorry folks the bus stops here weve got about twenty minutes of juice in the batteries if we just creep along mercer doublechecked the chart and his position estimates we should be right in front of the sea empress when she comes through with any luck we wont need that much from the batteries have you thought of how were going to board her with antiradar coating on the conning tower shell never see us and if we do appear on her scopes were going to look like a tiny iceberg that she can plow right over thats what im hoping for mercer answered youve never seen a picture of the sea empress have you shes a huge catamaran capable of launching boats from between her hulls we just line up in the gap and let her come right over us once abeam of her integrated marina we jump aboard ill be damned ira nodded in admiration teachers must have hated you in school whys that because you have an answer for everything after half an hour of waiting on the still waters marty shouted to the control room mercer i see her she looks like shell pass to our starboard mercer joined him on the icy bridge to judge for himself he took a pair of binoculars from bishop as hed predicted the sea empress blazed like a small city under the wavering curtains of the northern lights she looked beautiful and she looked like she would indeed pass them to starboard okay get below and prepare to move the sub as the cruise ship drew nearer mercer could better judge her speed and direction and ordered the uboat positioned accordingly the sub crept forward at a fraction of her normal power and barely made a ripple as she came about ira had been generous saying they had twenty minutes of juice remaining theyd be lucky to maneuver into the path of the fastapproaching hundredandfiftythousandton monster they got the stern of the sub pointed directly at the sea empress all right hold us here anika you and hilda get erwin up to the front deck through the binoculars mercer could clearly see her twin hulls and the yawning channel between them he continued to order small bearing corrections making sure the uboat was properly aligned with the sea empress she was now close enough for him to see individual windows along the front of her wide superstructure if he stood perfectly still he could feel the power of her whirling props through the water jesus shes huge he said to himself as the ship continued to widen as she closed eating further and further into his range of view they had to pass between her hulls at the exact center to avoid being slammed against one side or the other even a glancing blow would capsize the uboat ira he yelled down when i give the order give her everything shes got marty youll need to move the boat a little to port or starboard to get close to the dock i wont know which way until were between the hulls aye aye he watched as it came at them the sub in position bow waves peeling off the hulls reached the uboat before she entered the gap rocking her violently before she could find her center the wide span of the superstructure didnt begin until fifty feet back from the prow of each hull so for a moment it felt like they were motoring between two stationary ships the water pulsed then they were under the main part of the vessel and their perception of motion changed instantly they could all see just how fast the sea empress was cutting through the water around them the underside of the superstructure towered thirty feet above the surface of the ocean creating an echoing tunnel between the hulls there was enough light from the inside portholes to see a mural painted on the ceiling scroll past in a murky blur mercer was as awed as the rest but snapped himself out of it quickly ira full ahead and flood the tanks he studied the sides of the twin hulls and spotted an alcovelike pier on the left side near the stern beyond the marina were tall garagetype doors for launching larger boats marty give me ten degrees to port and get up here marty and ira scrambled up the ladder as the uboat accelerated and heeled over to the left their increased speed was far slower than that of the cruise ship but it would give them a margin of safety when they leapt for the builtin landing they assembled on the forward deck marty carried a knapsack full of documents from the cavern as well as the subs log book mercer had the schmeisser and the broomhandle mauser ira had swiped the enigma decoding machine from the uboats radio room as a souvenir nice touch mercer said almost as good as you writing kilroy was here on the side of the bridge just messing with a future marine archaeologist air bubbled around the uboat as her tanks filled with seawater and she continued to angle toward the marina the dock was nothing more than a long fiberglass ledge cut into the hull it was accessible from the interior of the ship through a standard hatchway placed next to two garage doors for launching personal watercraft farther aft were the bigger doors that shielded the storage area for the empresss larger excursion boats although the portholes along the hull were small they got an occasional glimpse of people in their cabins and once a face appeared at eye level across just a few feet of frothing water everyone waved cheerily the startled person an elderly priest blinked hard and when he looked again they had passed out of his view thatll make him lay off the sacramental wine the force of water hissing along the sea empresss hull created a cushion between her and the uboat a gap of about two feet that widened as the sub slowed due to the weight of her filling tanks frigid water began to wash along the deck plates shit i opened em too wide ira cursed get to the stern of the sub mercer prodded anika and hilda then helped erwin he began to run kicking up spray as the ocean reached his ankles itll reach the landing first with every step the water rose higher it was at mercers calves by the time they reached the back of the uboat the dock was still twenty feet too far slowed by the added drag the sub continued to sheer away from the towering side of the sea empress as the cruise liner overtook the uboat the landing drew abreast of the floundering submarine mercer took two sloshing steps and launched himself across the fourfoot gulf calling back as soon as he landed do it they had five seconds at most before the uboat was no longer alongside the dock erwins struggling leap would have dumped him in the sea had mercer not grabbed his good arm he cried out and slumped to the deck anika came across like a bounding gazelle marty and ira leapt with less grace but equal results hilda you can make it anika cried water surged past the cooks thighs hilda rushed like a charging hippopotamus but couldnt make herself leap the widening gap the water flooding across the subs deck was too deep frantic mercer spied a life ring mounted on the wall he coiled the end of the rope around his wrist and tossed it to the stricken woman just as she floated free from the sinking uboat he wasnt sure shed caught the life ring until the drag of her body against the cruise ships fifteenknot headway yanked him off his feet it would have hauled him into the water if he hadnt braced his legs against a bollard the effect of water pulling against her body meant mercer had a fivehundredpound weight at the other end of the line his wrist was about to snap help he cried it came out as a strangled croak the others grabbed the line taking up the strain and like dragging an anchor up a raging stream hauled hilda brandt back to the marina anika mercer gasped when hilda clawed her way onto the dock tell her shes the most beautiful mermaid ive ever caught panting from the exertion ira helped mercer to his feet now that were here o great cruise director and finished with our north atlantic tugofwar whats the next shipboard activity foraging for a cabin food and booze in whatever order youd like shuffleboards at ten me im going for the bar first the next joke died on mercers lips in the rush to save them hed forgotten that the ships being here might not be as coincidental as theyd thought anika was the first to notice the change in him whats wrong mercer didnt reply behind them was the watertight door leading into the ship it opened into the jet ski garage in the glow of a couple of nightlights dozens of the personal watercraft sat on astroturf pads next to racks of scuba gear and other aquatic toys also in the garage were two mahoganydecked thirtyfoot aquariva speedboats a sophisticated track crane mounted to the ceiling could launch any of the small vessels there was a glasssided office at the far side of the garage for the boat attendants to handle the paperwork of their job mercer crossed to it and found the door locked he used the machine pistol to smash the pane of glass in the door and let himself in switching on a desk lamp he spotted what he was looking for an invoice pad for passengers to charge a jet ski rental to their cabin the ships letterhead was on the top of the pages in bold script at the bottom he found the name of the vessels owners son of a bitch what is it the group had gathered behind him after helping themselves to handfuls of fluffy towels this ships owned by a company called rhinemarine so its a division of kohl ag aboard the sea empress i guess this ship being here wasnt such a coincidence after all erwin puhls voice quavered hed never considered that the forces the brotherhood were fighting could be so prepared this is either raths fallback position mercer agreed or he planned to transfer the pandora boxes here all along considering the ships distinguished passenger list i doubt customs is going to pay much attention to whats in her holds youre not surprised are you marty snapped more accusation than question mercer matched his anger after what weve been through i wouldnt be surprised if gunther rath is already on this tub he cant risk sticking by the njoerd in case we made it to kulusuk and contacted the authorities doesnt matter whos surprised ira soothed we need to figure out our next move erwin do you know what cabin your friend is in i dont know it was assigned when he boarded then we have to go look for him how do you propose to do that martys fury had not abated we look like a bunch of refugees there must be some cabins close by mercer said grateful for iras role as peacemaker well help ourselves to some new clothes after knocking to make sure the cabin nearest the marina was empty mercer splintered the lock with one kick he motioned to his people and they raced across the corridor and into the small room it was barely big enough for the three beds closet and tiny bathroom there was no porthole mercer went straight to the telephone hanging on the wall near one bed next to it was a list of numbers he dialed the one for a shiptoshore connection after a single ring a recording answered due to the solarmax effect all shiptoshore telephone calls have been suspended if this is an emergency please come to either of the pursers offices located on the entrance deck of each hull we are sorry for the inconvenience mercer fingered the disconnect button outside communications are out they claim its the solar max but i bet raths already here and has isolated the ship i would if i were him ira said who were you going to call i wanted to reach dick henna the head of the fbi weve been friends for years no kidding its a long story next mercer phoned the pursers office and asked to be connected to father anatoly vatutins room a moment later a shipboard operator said that no one was answering could you give me his room number its important that i find him im sorry sir the tired operator said we arent allowed to give out cabin numbers its company policy mercer hung up the phone damn it they wont give me vatutins room number either he crossed to the closet and opened the door hanging inside were three saffron robes of buddhist monks and rattan sandals the idea that flashed in mercers head was a desperate one he called to anika who was in the bathroom are there any razors in there a couple of them mercer snapped open the longest blade on his pocket knife youre not thinking what i think youre thinking you know any monks with hair ira besides what do you care youre already bald what are you doing marty asked we cant stay here because the monks will eventually return and as you pointed out we cant walk around the ship dressed as refugees so a couple of us are converting to buddhism one of the men will have to remain hidden in the boat garage with the women ill stay with them marty volunteered quickly and then added to defuse the tension hed caused unnecessarily at my age i cant risk cutting off all my hair it may not come back okay mercer began hacking at his hair with the knife if youre up to this erwin youre next ill be okay he fingered the fringes around his head and like ira i wont be losing much twenty minutes later ira mercer and erwin puhl had the robes draped over their regular clothes sleeves hiked to their elbows and pants carefully folded so their bare legs and sandled feet were exposed each was freshly shaved and their bald heads gleamed i look like an orange bowling pin mercer told his reflection in the bathroom i think you look handsome anika said like yul brynner in the king and i ira rubbed mercers naked skull if i was a phrenologist id say you thrive on danger and alcohol have impure thoughts about farm animals and probably wet the bed mercer chuckled remember my hair will come back touche back in the little office in the garage mercer handed the schmeisser to marty keeping the broomhandle mauser for himself dont use it unless you absolutely have to if you get caught rath wont execute you until he has all of us hell lock you up instead and well find you i understand bishop took the weapon sorry about what i said earlier its just that i ah im dont worry about it im scared too once we link up with vatutin well be safe in his cabin until we can figure out what to do next before you guys go out i have something for you anika removed a tube of lotion from the sundries rack near the office counter suntan lotion with bronzer itll darken your complexion a bit make you look more i dont know tibetan they smeared their hands faces and heads with the darkening cream all things considered their disguises werent too bad we should be back in a half hour this ship is enormous how are you going to find vatutin so quickly its nearly twelve mercer replied cruiseship tradition is the midnight buffet where else could he be well even bring back some food in a tight bunch the three men left the boat garage and started down the carpeted corridor at a bank of elevators their costumes were given their first scrutiny by a pair of frenchspeaking priests the clerics eyed the makeshift sling anika had made for erwin but otherwise ignored the fake monks mercer exchanged relieved glances with ira and erwin they rose seven decks in silence following the priests when they exited eavesdropping on their conversation mercer understood they were headed for the buffet in the main dining room he walked slowly letting the frenchmen draw out of earshot so far so good what happens when we run into some real buddhists pray they think weve taken vows of silence they reached one of the ships two cavernous atriums and crossed on a bridge next to a waterfall glancing down to see a group of rabbis chatting in a piano bar surrounded by a riot of jungle vegetation above them the aurora borealis washed through the skylights and cast wavering slashes of color on every surface it touched particularly brilliant flashes brought appropriate gasps from the people loitering at the railings of the multilevel atrium the crowds thickened as mercer and the others approached the dining room in the center part of the sea empress the noise of conversations grew most people ignored them but a pair of sharpeyed sikhs stared as they walked into the huge room mercer didnt know if it was cultural animosity or if their disguises didnt fool the turbaned men he submissively bowed his head as he shuffled past and stumbled into a man dressed in black like a priest the man turned and snapped something in angry german falling back into ira mercer couldnt suppress the recognition the german was from georesearch he wasnt wearing a priestly suit he wore a uniform the man said something again jabbing a finger into mercers chest ungalabu mercer said quickly casting his eyes down in apology ee ala haboba raths guard continued to glare but mercer refused to meet his eyes a trickle of sweat ran like a finger down his ribs sneering the german turned to his compatriot next to him said something derogatory and laughed he hadnt recognized mercer with his orange robes and shorn pate before joining the buffet line they waited until the guards were a dozen places in front of them how do you know tibetan ira whispered i dont mercer grinned and neither did he well get a table near them so erwin can listen to their conversation i dont see vatutin anywhere erwin said after a quick search of the room when we grab a seat you walk around and look more carefully if hes not here we can maybe try out on deck with his stomach straining to get at the magnificent displays of food ringing the room mercer placed just a few vegetables and some rice on his plate in keeping with buddhist practice yet when he reached the deli station he made two footlong sandwiches and slid them into the pockets of the robe the chef shot him an odd look but he had seen a number of dietary taboos broken on this trip there were only two people at the tenplace table closest to where the germans sat a man and a woman unlike any mercer had seen outside of a hollywood stereotype the man sported a shimmering blue sharkskin suit with a shirt and tie of the same color his toupee looked like a dead animal perched on his head the woman had poured herself into a silver dress that showed silicone cleavage to an inch above her nipples her big hair was bottle blond and styled into a towering cone her makeup would have been comical if it wasnt so appropriate to her overlifted face each individual eyelash seemed as long and thick as a babys pinky with his eyes mercer asked permission to sit absolutely the man slurred in front of him were three empty glasses and a full one im tommy joe farquar and this is my wife lorna were from the us of a gosh lorna squeaked in a voice shrill enough to shatter crystal its good to have some company for some reason no one wants to sit with us no more mercer made a sympathetic gesture and shoveled rice into his mouth to keep from laughing tommy joe leaned his elbows on the table and in an earnestness honed during his years of selling used cars asked have you gentlemen accepted jesus as your personal savior another mouthful of food went in before mercer could swallow the first i suspect you havent cause of the crazy getups youre wearing now i know its not your fault so i dont blame you none but i think its time you reconsidered the path youve chosen its never too late to find christ our lord tommy joe knows what hes talking about lorna cooed hes on television mercer jumped when he felt pressure against his crotch carefully he reached under the table and grabbed at what he feared was lorna farquars hand his fingers sank into something warm and furry and before he knew what hed touched tiny needle teeth sank into his thumb he pulled his hand away with a gasp and flung the farquars pekingese onto an adjoining table the dog had been snuffling into mercers pocket for the sandwiches pookie you bad boy get back into your bag ignoring the repulsed diners the dog defiantly lifted its leg against the flowered centerpiece after emitting a single drop the pekingese trotted through plates jumped to the floor and curled up in the carpetbag lorna carried for him good boy the other table cleared unless you accept christ into your heart tommy joe continued drunkenly youll never find salvation in the hereafter youll be denied his everlasting love in heaven and be cast into the pit i can imagine all the pagan things youve done and dont you worry i have a special program in my ministry to help all sorts of people find his light including he lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper homosexuals if jesus can forgive them you can believe youll be forgiven for praying to cows and false idols and such honey i dont think they understand you none lorna said into the first silence since mercer and ira had sat down do you speak american mercer shrugged to keep from laughing out loud he had to remind himself that raths men were right behind him tommy joe dropped his public persona godless heathens i think the younger ones kinda cute lorna batted her eyes at mercer you think anything in pants is kinda cute tommy joe pushed back his overflowing plate and gulped the last of his triple scotch ha theyre not wearing pants lorna snapped with a childs logic and obstinacy shut up farquar lumbered to his feet lets go find a bar i want to talk with these two some more lorna youd be the one doing all the talking they cant understand you he stalked off she considered remaining but gave mercer and ira a quick smile and wiggled after her husband the exnavy man leaned into mercers ear remind me to renounce my us citizenship when we get home mercer looked around the room and spotted erwin puhl weaving his way around tables toward them his dark expression told mercer that he hadnt found father vatutin he sat and mechanically ate his bland food leaning back far enough to overhear the conversation behind him raths two men had been eating like wolves and finished a few minutes later they left their plates and strode away anything mercer asked when they were gone i think they brought one of the boxes erwin said in a rush mercers expression turned frigid are you sure not positive but i think so they talked about cargo transferred from raths chopper to the boat they used to get here goddamn it our status just went from fugitive to hostage that single box of meteor fragments meant rath had complete control of the sea empress he could open it at any time and resign some of the greatest leaders on the planet to an unspeakable death mercer closed his eyes trying to block out the image of the sea empress becoming a coffin ship doomed to forever sail the seas with her decks covered by thousands of radioactive corpses a modern horrific mary celeste his goal to save the survivors was no longer enough they couldnt hide out when there was another pandora box loose he had to stop rath himself if just that single box got off the vessel the whole world was at risk they also mentioned they had a prisoner with them erwin continued someone who could get them onto the sea empress without raising suspicion who the hell would rath need ira asked hes got to be high up in kohl industries apparently not high enough mercer mused no sign of your priest friend i didnt see anatoly anywhere we should try calling his cabin again from the phone in the corridor mercer shot to his feet and handed the two sandwiches to ira you two make the call and get back to the boat garage where are you going im going to the radio room to call dick henna rath may prevent passengers from calling from their rooms but i cant believe communications are really out no matter what happens to us we have to get the word out about the box in the corridor mercer checked his watch the half hour hed promised anika was gone he looked around and spotted the two germans walking across the catwalk spanning the atrium if rath needed leverage to get him on the cruise liner mercer would need their prisoner to get into the radio room he began to follow the germans the guards turned along one of the hanging promenades passing darkened storefronts that read like a oneblock section of rodeo drive gucci movado armani chanel godiva mercer stayed well back partially to find cover in the thinning crowds partially because he couldnt match their pace wearing illfitting sandals the mauser was tucked into his waistband and he cleared away a fold in his robe so he could reach it easier the two germans wound through a couple of corridors and stopped at an elevator when the car arrived they stepped inside mercer ran down the hall when the doors closed above the elevator was a digital counter indicating the floor the car was on he watched it descend to one deck below where the marina was located he charged through the staircase fire door behind him pounding down two steps at a time his feet hurting with every impact mercer paused after descending three flights when he thought he heard a door open above him he captured his breath in his mouth but could hear nothing over the blood thumping in his ears he continued downward one flight above his destination a staff only door blocked his path he stopped to listen again and then swung open the unlocked door gone were the rich carpets subtle lighting and wood paneling this was the crews area of the vessel it was as utilitarian as a battleship and painted the same institutional gray he paused for a minute his head held at an angle to see if anyone had followed him the pistol grip became sweaty nothing dressed like a passenger he knew he couldnt spend any length of time in the bowels of the ship without catching the attention of a crew member still he needed to find raths prisoner edging down a companionway so long he couldnt see the other end he kept his back pressed against one wall there were countless doors lining the corridor and every thirty feet or so another hall ran off at a right angle the ship was a maze the linoleum was so new he could see individual scuff marks and amid the subtle abrasions of waiters loafers he recognized the heavy black smears left by rubbersoled combat boots raths men he followed the trail like a bloodhound twisting through the labyrinth while a subconscious part of his brain mapped his route of retreat a door opened just as mercer passed and without breaking stride he threw himself into the handsome twentysomething man who had come out wearing a purple robe they crashed into the bunk beds on the far wall of the cabin the young man yelping in pain mercer closed the door with his foot dont hurt me please the blond boy said he was english delicate as a girl a waiter mercer guessed i wont mercer kept menace in his voice what size shoes do you wear the boys eyes widened what shoes what size shoes twelve got any sneakers mercer hoped the american and english sizes were the same or at least close the boy nodded give them to me mercer let the waiter back to his feet and stripped off his monks robe the boy blubbered when he saw the handle of the mauser give me the shoes and keep your mouth shut and ill leave you alone the young englishman opened a closet and rummaged through the detritus at the bottom for his sneakers here here you are you wont hurt me i promise now turn around and put your hands behind your back mercer used a tie from the closet to bind the waiters hands to the metal bed frame the ball of socks he found was still warm and damp from the days use mercer jammed the socks in the youths mouth gagging at first the young waiter calmed enough to start drawing even breaths mercer put on the shoes pleased that they fit when your roommate unties you and you go to the security office you might want to come up with a better story than a deranged terrorist stealing shoes the boy mumbled into his gag and mercer laughed dont worry kid believe it or not your sneakers might save everyone on this ship back in the hallway mercer took up the trail again the scuff marks led him to a watertight door much thicker than any hed seen in the below decks area it was marked engineering staff only the floor thrummed with the force of the ships mighty power plants he decided that hed come as far as he should fumbling around down here was wasting time he didnt have hed take his chances getting into the communications room without raths prisoner he had the mauser and the element of surprise backtracking he passed the waiters cabin again he couldnt hear anything from within satisfied mercer rounded a series of corners brushing past a few offduty crewmen who shot him queer looks but said nothing as he turned one more corner he had just enough time to recognize a mass of blond hair before his crotch exploded in agony mercer dropped to his knees and through tearstreaked eyes saw a knee coming at his face he could do nothing his world had gone black by the time his head hit the deck fighting the urge to retch mercer came awake in slow increments his lower body felt distant like the pain belonged to someone else but as he became more aware he knew the agony was his alone the pulsing waves radiated from his genitals and settled in his lower belly like molten lead to distract himself he concentrated on the sharper pain in his face experimentally he traced his tongue across his teeth and was relieved they were all there he tasted blood opening his eyes sent bolts of electricity to his battered nose he spat who are you the question came from beyond mercers gray vision an idiot mercers voice was pinched by clotted blood in his nose he braced himself for what was about to come and sharply exhaled twin jets of red mist after a surreal moment where his head felt like it had shattered he peered around the spiky pinwheels of pain it took him a minute to realize where he was a crawl space below some kind of engineering room tangled with piping and who had spoken the blond man hed first spotted talking to gunther rath in the pandora cavern i promised myself when i saw you again id kill you mercer pulled his hands against the plastic strip ties binding his wrists over an insulated pipe above him the man was similarly shackled youre raths boss arent you klaus raeder they were both on their knees under a steel catwalk even if they could stand there was barely enough room lamps in the room above them made the floor under the grated catwalk look like bricks of light mortared with shadow the ties were threaded over a pipe suspended from the metal grid mercer pulled until the plastic ripped his flesh ive tried that raeder said you wont be able to do it he paused i recognize you now from your surveyors society picture youre philip mercer mercer was unwilling to give raeder the satisfaction of being right hed already guessed that rath had somehow doublecrossed his superior to steal the last pandora box why did he lock you up he needed me to get aboard the sea empress we came on the boat stored on the njoerd the captain wouldnt have given him permission if i wasnt forced to order him to and when you got to the ship you were put in here in case rath needed you again raeder nodded whats raths plan with the last box i was going to dump them in the sea raeder boasted no one was supposed to know about it and no one was supposed to get hurt you think i care about your intentions mercer couldnt believe the germans selfrighteousness and lack of shame your hopes dont amount to shit and never have considering how easily rath managed to hijack your plans someday id like to know how you thought you could sweep something like the pandora project under the rug for now i have to worry about stopping rath it was an economic decision raeder feebly clung to his original justification i was trying to save my shareholders from paying hundreds of millions of dollars for something none of us are responsible for your company profited from the thousand dead slaves in that cavern and youre telling me youre not responsible mercer couldnt believe what he was hearing hate to tell you this raeder but you are theres no statute of limitations on murder just because you didnt pull any triggers doesnt mean you can duck the culpability of the company you represent i thought i could get away with it raeders voice was nearly drowned by the sound of pumps and other machinery the air was stifling hot no one can walk away from their past mercer began looking around for something sharp to cut his bonds and that includes a company like kohl now your company is going to lose a lot more than the money it rightly owed and you are going to pay with your life do you think youre immune your life is as forfeit as mine no one can stop rath he controls the box and me which means he controls everything hes invincible there were no tools within reach but mercers tone was still defiant you sound like you want him to win no i just know he will its hopeless because he beat you mercer scoffed arrogance and gullibility are a dangerous mix and rath will be stopped there are five other people from the uboat with me and we have a contact on the ship theyll get the alarm out sorry to tell you this but when they brought you down here greta schmidt was talking with another of raths people about a report of stolen clothing near the ships marina i suspect that was your doing she was on her way there to investigate a door above them crashed open and mercer heard a babble of voices he recognized a snarling curse from ira hildas quiet sobs and anikas attempts to comfort her greta schmidts clear laughter sounded and again mercer strained at his bonds the effort left him panting a guard lifted a section of the catwalk directly above him and let it fall back on its hinges his partner kept mercer and klaus raeder covered with a submachine gun as he came down the steps to the low crawl space how are your balls greta smirked from the catwalk above sweaty want a taste in a fury she slammed her boot onto his exposed hands and would have broken mercers wrists if he hadnt laid them flat together gritting his teeth against the pain did little when gunther is finished on the bridge you are going to be the first to die the guards led mercers party into the cramped space and tied them to other lengths of pipe far enough apart so they could not help one another escape hilda was in tears and despite the bravado he was trying to show in front of the women marty bishops cheeks were also wet erwin was nearly catatonic only ira and anika had embers of the fire that had carried them so far anika even managed to throw mercer a smile just before her plastic cuffs were wrenched tight her body rippled with pain ira waited until greta finished speaking with one of the guards before he said mercer dont worry we made the call to your fbi buddy henna on the satphone by now hes alerted our navy as well as icelands so the solar max abated enough for us to use it mercer smiled about damn time i was tired of playing staked goat until you could use it greta looked from one man to the other dismayed that she couldnt detect fear in their voices you have no satellite phone she said at last ira gave her the withering look hed used on a generation of naval cadets i tossed it just before you captured us why do you think we didnt put up a fight weve won already only you dont know it this is not true there was doubt in her eyes you go right ahead and believe that you sick bitch anika klein blazed the truth should be here in about an hour aboard a dozen american helicopters greta crossed over to where anika was tied to a heat exchanger and i will tear out your ovaries long before they get here she considered slapping anikas face thought better of it and climbed the seven steps back to the catwalk a guard closed the hatch grate and the outer door slammed with a metallic bang from his position mercer couldnt see where ira lasko had been secured but he thought it was someplace behind him and around a piece of equipment you were trying to tell me that you found erwins friend and he had a satphone right ah no that was all bullshit we called his cabin again but he wasnt there greta found us about five seconds after erwin and i got back from the dining room seems we robbed the only buddhist monks who actually care about their property they had gone to the ships security office and rath was alerted greta and a couple of his boys ferreted us out considering their firepower we figured surrender was a better idea than suicide we thought you were still free anika added i went to find raths prisoner thats him over in the corner klaus raeders his name hes the head of kohl hi hope you burn in hell ira called as a greeting perhaps hed survived one narrow escape too many or perhaps because with all of them together and under raths control they were as good as dead either way mercer finally lost control this was as far as he could go there were no other options there was no hope he began to laugh the deep anomalous sound crashed against the steel confines of the machinery room lashed everyone and echoed back hammering it was manic frightening when he caught his breath again silence hung as heavy as steam i figured out the paradox to the mythological story of pandora he said in control of his voice if nothing more what paradox anika asked she opened a box that zeus gave to epimetheus and accidentally released all the ills on the world but when everything like greed and envy and disease had escaped she found that hope was still in the box its a beautiful story that means despite everything that may happen to you hope always remains thats the lesson people get from it mercer agreed bitterly thats not what im talking about hasnt anyone ever wondered why hope was in the box to begin with why was it in there with disease and hate and lust because hopes as destructive as any of those maybe worse it was never meant to be a gift from the gods it was punishment hope gives you strength when you have a chance when the situations impossible it becomes a torture the pain in his voice stunned everyone especially anika are you really that cynical mercer didnt answer despite his words he pulled against his shackles with every fiber of his being his eyes closed so tightly they felt crushed into his skull he bellowed in rage and frustration and hopelessness and with a metallic snap the thick plastic cuffs parted and his hands were free for a moment he stared at the cleanly severed ends dangling from his wrists it wasnt humanly possible to break these cuffs yet the evidence was right in front of him how a miracle the divine intervention of the gods telling him hed missed the point of the pandora myth klaus raeder was the only person who could see what mercer had done and he gaped how did you do that mercer looked upward in an ageold glance of reverence to a higher power thats how he spotted a spectral figure standing on the grating above him with a fire ax in his hands he was dressed in black with silver hair and a beard that approached his waist understanding dawned immediately father vatutin da vatutin lifted the hatch and moved down the steps the others began to cheer when they heard what was happening mercer massaged his wrists im not complaining but how did you know i see a buddhist monk near dining room when i go in for supper vatutins english was terrible i see him check expensive swiss watch that no monk can own i look more closely not monk but man made to look like monk i follow you knocked out by blond woman and brought here i hide then more people brought here and i see erwin i wait until guard posted at door turns away and use blunt edge of ax mercer got to his feet and shook the orthodox priests hand you have no idea what i was thinking when the cuffs broke vatutin touched the heavy cross resting on his chest i know what you think the two began to release the others anika smiled when mercer reached her i told you that theres always hope thanks for the reminder mercer was chagrined vatutin and erwin puhl embraced for a long time after the priest learned igor bulgarin was dead im gonna start calling you pessimism man from now on ira lasko said to mercer when he was freed that thing about hope being in the box was a good point just promise me its your last deathrow revelation i promise mercer took the weapons vatutin had liberated from the guard a silenced h ampk ps automatic pistol and a compact mp submachine gun also fitted with a long silencer now its time to put an end to this nightmare any ideas marty asked that all depends on herr raeder mercer looked down at him since they had yet to cut his bonds how about it you willing to help i told you earlier that i wanted to destroy the boxes it is rath who wants to sell them does he have a buyer libya shit and when this is over youre going to make full restitution yes mercer had a hard time believing such a quick answer because you got caught because i was wrong raeder countered think what you like of me dr mercer but i am not a monster i am a businessman a capitalist being an american you should understand my personal beliefs had nothing to do with my decision to conceal kohls past and no matter how much my company pays i dont believe full restitution can ever be paid to the victims of the holocaust i dont trust you but i also dont have a choice mercer hissed an ax stroke severed raeders plastic cuffs what are the security arrangements on this ship the popes swiss guards are in charge of the convocations delegates and the sea empress has personnel of her own about twenty i think i recognized several of them as part of gunther raths specialprojects department theyre his people like those at the greenland base they wont listen to me who did you speak to when rath needed permission to board the captain raeder answered at once he wouldnt let rath approach the ship until he heard i was on the boat from the njoerd he doesnt know that i am raths prisoner no one does so hell listen to you absolutely once we reach the captain will rath make a stand or try to run mercer said thinking aloud neither options too good ira said the worlds religious leaders are on this ship if rath opens that box the repercussions are going to be bloody every fanatic in the planet would use their deaths as an excuse for holy war but who will die if we let him run with the box and cant catch him again well get him ira lasko considered leaving it at that but he continued his voice tinged with guilt he edged mercer away from the others for privacy get me to a working phone and i guarantee that rath wont make it fifty miles from the sea empress the confidence in iras statement made everything suddenly clear to mercer the fury was like an explosion ten times more powerful than greta schmidts knee to the crotch youre working with the goddamned cia arent you ira nodded im sorry mercer he said meaning it that fucker charlie bryce set me up you were my backup in case something went really wrong i cant believe this and then mercer thought it through and he could believe it who better to back up an agent on a scientific expedition than a scientist his name wasnt unknown in various government circles including the cia it all made perfect sense in a compartmentalized needtoknow sort of way you were after the boxes for our military failing that i was to make sure no one else got them personally i was more than happy to see them sunk when the rotorstat went down listen i am really sorry about this i would have told you if i could but i was briefed personally by director barnes himself christ mercer spat hed met paul barnes a few times before and thought the cia director was an ass he tried to run his hands through his hair and his fingers met naked skin this only fueled his anger how the hell did the government know about the boxes and why didnt you go after them years ago we didnt know where the cavern was other than greenland that information came from documents brought to the states in the s by german rocket scientists stationed at peenemunde with werner von braun theyd been working on a nazi plan to load vs with meteorite fragments and irradiate london the scientists only knew that the meteor would be coming directly from greenlands east coast aboard a submarine of course the sub never arrived and the germans shelved the pandora project right ira said after the war our air force learned about it from the operation paperclip scientists we were using for our early rocket program they considered the pandora radiation as a potential american weapon and established camp decade in part as a base to search for the cavern after a few years of searching too far south it turns out the brass gave up stating that the whole thing had been a pipe dream of hitlers and wasnt true mercer recalled his conversation with elisebet rosmunder and how shed asked if he knew why the us government wanted to build an underice city like camp decade now he knew the answer he let the anger wash out of him so he could concentrate on what ira was saying shoot ahead sixty years and all of a sudden kohl industries is buying georesearch and planning to establish an arctic research base close to where the cavern was supposed to be the old documents hinted that kohl was involved with the pandora project in some capacity though there was nothing definitive nothing we could use in a courtroom unwilling to take the chance that they knew something we didnt the cia scrambled to have their base moved to our old site to throw them off that whole thing with the danish government that charlie bryce told me the surveyors society engineered was actually a cia operation to get me to greenland ira said i was brought in to keep an eye on georesearch in case the cavern turned out to be real and they tried to find it theres a military strike team waiting in iceland in case we needed them to stop kohl so you werent a chief in the navy my naval experience was why i was sent of course mercer exclaimed they knew a submarine was involved and wanted a man who had the proper background thats how youre such an expert on the type vii uboat before leaving for greenland i spent two weeks at the chicago museum of science and industry going over the u they have on display as to being a chief well i used to work on subs but then switched to intelligence work i retired as deputy chief of naval intelligence my rank was admiral and the bit about owning a truck stop in connecticut my fathers place i grew up working there my brother runs it now in reality i live about twenty miles from your brownstone and work in the white house for the presidents national security advisor a piece of the puzzle was still missing i assume you had martys military friend called away for active duty but what the hell did you need me for jim kneeland yes ira answered we felt the fewer people at camp decade the better we would have excluded marty too if we could have come up with a better cover story to get me close to georesearch bringing you in was director barness idea while i have a background in subs and intelligence he wanted someone who knew science but not one of the pencil necks from langleys technicalsupport division when he showed me your dossier and i read that article about you in time magazine i knew youd be perfect so i have you to thank no need to show your gratitude with a gift or anything a card will be fine they drifted back toward the others when we get out of this youre going to get a pounding mercer said but already his anger toward ira was abating paul barnes on the other hand was going to pay well agent lasko what do you propose ira turned deadly serious we have rath contained on the sea empress but we cant risk him nuking these people mercer agreed the universal convocation had to be protected at all costs the men and women on this ship represented the hopes and dreams of billions of people we have to flush him out so we can take him at sea how all rath has to do is threaten to open the box and everyone on the ship is his hostage mercer shook his head he knows that he cant win a hostage situation no one ever does so what do you suggest wed be in for one hell of a mess if we alert the swiss guards theyd probably make the situation worse in their zeal to protect the pope youre right about the guards not being an option which means were on our own remember that raeder said the ships security men are in raths pocket we have to get him to escape from the sea empress the way he came his boat is with the larger launches next to the marina i think you were hiding in klaus raeder offered and greta said raths on the bridge anika added mercer had gone quiet his eyes out of focus suddenly his features sharpened and he grinned wickedly i can think of only one way to get rath to leave the ship without him feeling directly threatened actually i can think of another way but i doubt the seven of us could get the ship to start sinking anika and ira exchanged startled looks and regarded mercer as if hed lost his mind thank god youre not thinking that she said so what is your idea simple we hijack the sea empress ourselves aboard the sea empress before mercer launched into his explanation ira suggested that anatoly vatutins cabin would be a better place to talk mercer gave him the mp to tuck under his robes he took point when they exited the machinery room the pistol held behind his back with a round in the chamber they left the guard vatutin had dispatched behind a large hydro pump ira walked the drag slot moving backward so they couldnt get jumped because it was so late at night the sea empress was running with just a skeleton crew on the bridge and fortunately no one in the engineering spaces mercer found an elevator after a few minutes and they ascended to vatutins deck moments later they piled into the priests room so far so good anika smiled with relief hear out my plan before you have me committed mercer said when they were settled he ticked his fingers as he counted their options we cant stay here until the ship docks because rath will organize a roomtoroom search once he realizes weve escaped even with raeders help we cant approach the captain because raths people are likely watching him the swiss guards are out because theyll probably turn us over to ships security ie rath we could try to find a satellite phone belonging to one of the reporters covering the convocation but there are two thousand cabins to check and wed be stopped long before we found one and finally we cant risk a direct confrontation with rath in case he opens the box does everyone agree so far mute nods okay to get rath off the ship we have to make him think escaping is a better option than remaining on board to do that we either sink the sea empress or create a situation where he feels just threatened enough to want to leave thats where we come in by pretending to be hijackers its going to put the swiss guards on full alert and distract some of raths people rath will figure out whats going on but he cant say anything without compromising himself it would be easier for him to cut his losses rather than fight us hell let the swiss guards and the ships regular security detail handle that why wouldnt he just hang around until his goons kill us all marty asked rath can pretend the solar max has shut down the ships communications but when we fire the first shot every reporter with an independent satellite uplink will be calling in the scoop in hours the empress will be swarming with choppers and motor launches from iceland rath would be trapped once hes gone anika interrupted we give ourselves up bring raeder to the captain and alert the authorities about raths escaping with the pandora box you got it once hes flushed out why dont we ambush him when hes trying to launch his boat erwins suggestion had merit and a fatal flaw he may have fifteen or twenty men with him if we cant guarantee a clean kill he could open the box mercer saw iras skeptical look and added all we need to do is fire off a few rounds terrorize some passengers and let panic do the rest as long as we dont get caught before rath leaves weve got nothing to worry about except swiss guards are not wearing blueandgold uniforms and carrying medieval weapons anatoly vatutin said they have combat armor and machine pistols and they will shoot to kill this isnt without risks mercer answered solemnly looking each person in the eye ira lasko didnt hesitate tell me how you want to do this mercer spent ten minutes outlining his plan and refining it with suggestions from the others the key was to protect klaus raeder until after rath left the vessel mercer estimated that would be about twenty minutes after the first firefight because of his injuries erwin would wait with the industrialist in vatutins cabin mercer wanted the others to stay with them martin bishop agreed however vatutin categorically refused he reminded mercer that hed been fighting for this for his entire life and wouldnt back out at the end and once anika translated their plan to hilda the chef too wanted to help she had military training she stated and could handle a gun mercers eyes asked anika her intentions she looked at erwin i can hold out for a while longer puhl said as if reading her mind the pains worse and my arms numb to my fingers but once raeder talks to the captain im going to the ships doctor without a professional excuse to remain behind anika klein tried to find a personal one and couldnt the others were risking their lives for something much bigger than they were and she couldnt let them go alone im in moments later the ersatz terrorists left the cabin finding additional weapons for the teams was easier than they thought in the elevator headed up to the main deck the car stopped a few floors short of their destination and two swiss guards stepped in barely giving mercer and his band a passing inspection both uniformed men carried beretta model submachine guns on slings as soon as the doors swept closed mercer clubbed one with the butt of the h ampk at the same time ira laid open the others scalp with his machine pistol a minute later the swiss were bound and gagged and their weapons including concealed pistols were distributed you promise were not going to kill anyone anika asked when mercer handed her his h ampk in favor for the model hed unscrewed the german pistols silencer well be shooting for effect mercer reassured if it comes to a real firefight aim for peoples legs that still goes against the hippocratic oath despite her protest anika tightened her grip on the big handgun shed do what was necessary this is where we split into two teams mercers voice was harder than hed intended ira take hilda and father vatutin and find the biggest group of people you can maybe in the theater i saw a bulletin for a midnight showing of the agony and the ecstasy take them hostage scare the hell out of them and get out again stay loose and mobile dont remain in one location for any length of time and make sure when you escape no one follows we meet back at father vatutins cabin in thirty minutes to wait for erwins allclear from the bridge the doors opened before anyone could acknowledge his final instructions and they scattered without a word because the majority of the passengers were men mercer and anika used a ladies rest room to give the others time to get into position they both even managed a nervous pee they reemerged from the tiled bathroom after five minutes casually mercer walked across the corridor near the main atrium and yanked the handle for the fire alarm nothing happened for a second and he feared the system remained silent until an actual fire was confirmed then the electronic horns began to cry wailing like a colicky infant drawing breath they kept their weapons out of view as a few latenight strollers looked around anxiously it took about three minutes for an emergency crew to be dispatched to the pull station when they rounded the corner from a stairwell mercer drew his weapon and fired a tight burst over their heads shredding the acoustical material in the ceiling a light fixture exploded and the screams of passengers reached an instant fever pitch the battle for the sea empress had begun usually when he was inside greta schmidt gunther rath delighted in making her bleed he had to make up for his small size by the punishing savagery of his strokes making their sex more akin to rape than a display of intimacy this time however he made love with a grateful tenderness unlike anything hed ever shown before rath had been in the cabin hed commandeered from the sea empresss second officer when shed come to him her expression a mix of smug pride and feverish anticipation she whispered she had a secret for him but wouldnt reveal it until theyd made love rath wasnt in the mood for one of her games and would have struck her if shed been within range of the chair he occupied a glass of vodka in his hand instead he simply ignored her seeing that she wasnt going to get what she wanted greta doled out a little more information in fact i have six secrets for you what are you talking about get into bed and ill tell you tell me now or ill beat it out of you his threat was more habit than menace i went below to check on raeder and guess who i ran into rath didnt ask philip mercer what and whats more when i had him tied up with raeder a breakin was reported on a lower deck near the marina i went with a couple of the ships security people and found the other five survivors she loved that her gift lifted his spirits they actually did try for iceland in that antique sub but made it only as far as the sea empress from the moment hed lost the boxes rath had been scrambling to minimize the damage the libyans were waiting for the njoerds precious cargo and he had to get the one remaining box to them until a salvage operation could be mounted to raise the rest he also needed to track down and kill mercer and the others it was clear they had been in the cavern and doubtlessly watched rath empty the chamber through the submerged uboats periscope if mercer managed to raise an alarm rath could forget any attempt at recovering the sunken boxes he laughed mercers audacity is going to cost him his life i wonder if he knew we were going to use the sea empress as a refueling stop on our trip to iceland how could he we didnt know wed need to come here until the rotorstat went down im just grateful it was here at all far from a lucky break the empresss presence in the denmark strait had been the result of careful planning and timing greta had been the one to suggest it as fallback position months ago when klaus raeder was in discussions with the vatican over the ships lease needing the cruise liner as a contingency had seemed unlikely but greta had insisted that with so much money on the line it would be foolish to rely solely on the njoerd as transport raeder had had no idea of raths ulterior motives when he passed along the suggestion to cardinal peretti the popes secretary of state the priest had thought cruising under the northern lights was a wonderful idea and successfully lobbied the other delegates to accept greta pulled her shirt over her head her breasts still red from earlier rough treatment is my surprise worth a lay that and much more rath said launching himself from his chair and sweeping her into his arms he laid her on the bed from triumph to disaster back to triumph and i couldnt have done it without you his lips never left hers the whole time they were joined rath was in a selfsatisfied sleep when the call came from young bern hoffmann whod been detailed to relieve the guard theyd posted at the auxiliary pump room door the prisoners had escaped rath slammed down the phone and tossed greta aside what is it she wiped sleep from her eyes her body sticky with dried sweat from their lovemaking rath was already in his pants mercer escaped she came more awake he couldnt have weve accounted for everyone on the dc those killed in the crash and the body we found after the pitaraq storm theres no one left to help him the guard they knocked out recalls a priest approaching him before he was struck rath wanted to shower her scent from his skin but didnt have time somehow mercer has a contact on the ship we didnt know about maybe another member of the brotherhood of satans fist i should have killed mercers group when you told me youd captured them he cant go anywhere greta legged into her panties the marina garage doors are rigged to an alarm on the bridge and he cant launch a lifeboat for the same reason theres no sign of the uboat so theyre trapped mercer cant go to the ships security people because raeder must have told him they are loyal to you and the swiss guards would lock them up as stowaways i know the options he wont choose rath snapped i dont know the one he will hes unpredictable at that exact moment the fire alarm went off rath actually smiled you clever son of a bitch whats clever about pulling the alarm its a pathetic attempt to distract us so mercer can escape but it alerts everyone on the ship to danger and it wont end with that single alarm before rath finished dressing and checking his personal weapons the phone rang again what is it herr rath its dieter im in the security office were getting reports of gunfire in the portside atrium against our people no the rally driver said someone shot at the damagecontrol team checking the fire pull station that just went active mercers trying to make the swiss guards think the convocations delegates arent safe its working the captain of the guards is screaming for an immediate sos to bring reinforcements from the italian warship shadowing the empress rath made his decisions quickly have everyone meet at the launch well let the swiss guards fight mercer and leave the ship during the confusion why leave she persisted we control the ship not after raeder contacts the captain and he turns to the swiss guards we dont have enough people to fight them but well never be able to get the rest of the boxes calm down we can charter a helicopter in iceland and return to the njoerd she has the right gear to mount a quick salvage job we wont recover all of them but well get enough to satisfy the libyans rath turned his attention back to the phone dieter i have an idea to buy us a little insurance have some men meet me on a deck ill join you myself rath turned to greta who had been dressing once we get away from the ship no one will touch us and if they try to follow good point rath used his walkietalkie to contact the men converging on the marina and ordered them to disable all the large boats stored there thatll buy us enough time to reach reykjavik and take off again for the njoerd whats this insurance you mentioned were taking a few guests with us they raced into the atrium from the corridor where the damage crew was cowering mercer unleashed another barrage into the skylight above dodging a rain of glass shards we are the action front for liberation he roared at the few men on the bridge with them he menaced them with his gun and they dropped to the carpet end tyranny now leading anika across the bridge he dashed through a fire door and collided with a pair of raths men coming up the echoing stairwell mercers momentum knocked one down the half flight of steps and the other was a fraction too slow recovering from the unexpected collision mercer smashed him in the forehead with the side of the model and spun to target the guard on the landing recognition flared it was bern hoffmann the young german mercer had saved from carbonmonoxide poisoning in camp decade in the moment of hesitation before hoffmann reached for his holstered pistol mercer jumped the eight steps to the landing dropping so his foot broke the young mans wrist hoffmann cried out but was silenced by a wellexecuted pistolwhip to the jaw mercer removed the pistol from hoffmanns limp hand and recovered a matching weapon from the unconscious man at the head of the stairs anika lets go theyll be fine her face was a mask of shock and revulsion mercers quick savagery had stunned her i cant i just then give me your gun and hide yourself we dont have time to argue she snapped out of her panic and came down the steps she couldnt tear her eyes away from the broken figure of bern hoffmann im sorry she said mercer didnt know if she was speaking to him or the unconscious man come on he took her by the hand and they continued their descent the sound of the fire alarm was diminished in the stairwell but came back when they emerged a few decks down they were near one of the spas through a glass wall mercer could see an elaborate gymnasium and an olympicsized swimming pool a fire pull station was across the hallway and he yanked the handle the other team would be doing the same at any pull station they happened across the alarm panel on the bridge should be lighting up like a christmas tree through a set of double doors mercer and anika came upon a number of convocation delegates milling in a hallway muttering unanswerable questions to each other about the situation he kept his weapons from view as they walked down the corridor he stopped when they reached the far end there were a number of escape routes in view he fired the remainder of the thirtyround magazine into the floor the companionway emptied except for the cordite stench and smoking brass he fitted another clip and racked the slide they ran for an outside door and emerged on a woodenfloor promenade deck the cold tang of the sea caressed their skin in the distance hulked the dark silhouettes of lifeboats on their davits a number of ships officers were checking them in case this turned out to be a catastrophic fire rather than a false alarm they hadnt heard the gunfire running in the opposite direction mercer and anika made their way toward a flight of stairs leading to one of the vessels many outdoor cafes mercer took the h ampk from anika and refitted the silencer two quick shots destroyed the lock on the sliding glass doors and they were back in the ship the hallway beyond the cafes entrance was deserted moving carefully because they were exposed they passed a number of shops and another bar that overlooked an outdoor pool across the smooth water they could see a towering funnel lit with floodlights neither saw the two figures crossing the pool area en route to an entry door until the door was heaved open the figures dressed in black and carrying mps with probing laser sights swept the corridor to their right and turned to look behind them mercer and anika stood just ten yards away he pushed her down and dove across the hallway as the laser cut the air above him mercer rolled onto his knee and fired a tongue of flame shooting from the model the fusillade caught the security personnel across the chests tossing one back onto the patio and standing the other against a wall his body jerking like a puppet you said you werent going to kill anyone anika shrieked they were raths men mercer shouted above her screams they were carrying german machine pistols not the italian ones the swiss guards have she edged closer and recognized the corpse in the hall from the georesearch station in greenland she couldnt believe the speed of mercers reaction i didnt have a choice mercer added and led her away he pulled another fire alarm as they entered a long corridor lined with cabins as before a few passengers were in the hallway but not many because rumors of a terrorist attack were already spreading mercer glanced at his watch assuming that the twentyminute time line had passed he was stunned to find less than half that had elapsed like all combat time had telescoped into a weird distortion where seconds took hours and hours could vanish in a blink they reached the double doors at the end of the hall just as swiss guards poured onto the companionway mercer fired a snap burst from his submachine gun praying he didnt hit anyone pounding the doors against their stops mercer pushed anika ahead of him taking up a defensive crouch when he found cover behind a large planter overflowing like a jungle a few seconds later a pair of swiss guards came racing after them he used the h ampk pistol hed taken from hoffmann and placed rounds in each of the guards thighs far enough from the femoral artery so they wouldnt bleed out lets go hed bought a few more seconds they burst into an empty ballroom the ornate chamber echoed as they ran toward the glowing exit signs on the opposite wall at the far side anika collapsed onto a sofa her chest heaving to get enough air into her body mercer too was winded but they couldnt rest here youre doing great he panted just a little while longer they checked the antechamber beyond the ballroom and began walking more normally their weapons hidden from the two muslim clerics arguing in arabic despite the wailing fire alarms they moved through several more passages firing indiscriminately at walls and ceilings spreading fear wherever they went at one point mercer found a stack of the ships newspaper awaiting delivery to the cabins he stuffed handfuls of them into a ventilation grate and set them on fire considering the size of the vessel it would take many minutes for the smoke to be detected but he hoped by then it would have diffused all over the ship more confusion more panic they dodged in and out of two more firefights with roaming guards each time escaping to a lower deck and blending with frightened passengers until they were safe by now mercer was thoroughly lost but he guessed that all passages on the each half of the catamaran eventually led to one of the atriums as they walked down a hall keeping watch for pursuing guards mercer spotted a sign indicating the atrium was just ahead he broke into a jog with anika beside him shed emptied all her clips but continued to carry the silenced h ampk they entered the atrium one level below the dining room where mercer had met the televangelist and his wife the cavernous space was deserted hunched to minimize his size he led anika to one of the bridges to get to the center of the ship so they could then lose themselves in the starboard hull an area they hadnt been to yet a piece of the bridges brass railing exploded the same time mercer heard the whip crack of a pistol shot he pushed anika to the carpet and covered her with his body it felt like the shot had come from across the malllike atrium and one level up he chanced a look and saw a dozen swiss guards lining the upper railings some of them were headed to the escalators the guards would reach the ends of mercers bridge long before he and anika could escape drop your gun mercer whispered to her visually checking distances in the opposite direction of the group of guards why im saving your life mercer said do it what are you going to do you dont want to know mercers grim tone sounded like a final goodbye as soon as anika laid the pistol on the floor he grabbed her by her collar and hauled her to her feet making sure the model was on safe he put her in a hammerlock and jammed the weapon into the side of her head her scream was no act one step closer and i kill her mercers shouted warning stopped the approaching men dead he kept twisting in place so no one could get an accurate shot because anika was so short using her as a shield was a lot harder than hed envisioned all of you drop your guns and back up a few guards pulled their aim high but none of them relinquished their grips the men coming down the escalator took up firing stances had any of them had laser sights like raths troops they would have taken a shot still mercers weaving form danced in and out of the crosshairs of eight different shooters let her go a guard officer shouted in rough english we will not fire drop your weapons while mercer wanted them to think he was unstable the anxiety straining his voice was very real this situation went far beyond anything hed ever experienced one twitchy finger and he and anika would be shredded ill kill her i swear to god come on keep me talking keep up the dialogue i need a minute more the way he was holding anika allowed him to see his watch his twentyminute deadline was up in fortyfive seconds after that he didnt care what happened ira and erwin were more than capable of alerting the cia about gunther rath you dont want to do this the guard captain called down in a soothing voice we can talk about it no mercer shrieked allowing his voice to become hysterical he wanted the swiss edgy and nervous it would throw off their aim lorna farquars dog bit me and i will hold this woman until she apologizes the absurdity of mercers demand had the desired effect for a fraction of a second the guards concentration wavered he whispered see you later in anikas ear pushed her to the floor once again and threw himself backward blindly vaulting over the railing behind him the rush of the free fall left his heart in his throat and the sound of anikas cry fading like a distant whistle mercer wouldnt know if his leap had been accurate until he hit he could only see the waterfall looming over him if he tipped his head back the falls seemed to have come to a standstill as he plummeted at the same speed as the water the drop was twenty feet and took more than a second more than enough time for the quicker of the guards to react automatic weapons opened up like chainsaws spray from rounds hitting the falls landed on mercer and then he himself landed flat on his back in the pool at the base of the falls he went deep and slapped against the concrete bottom of the fourfootdeep faux lagoon the water crashed back over him swirling with bubbles from the air forced from his lungs he lay at the bottom of the pool his entire body aching until he opened his eyes and saw streaks of silver slashing the water the guards were firing down at him with no breath to hold mercer swam under the falls and emerged in a hollowed space that housed the pumps needed to create the aquatic effect beyond was an access hatch so workers didnt have to wade through the pool to service the machinery soaked and struggling to refill his lungs mercer kicked open the hatch and emerged in a utility corridor it wouldnt take long for the swiss guards to figure out where he went anika he felt would be treated well by the swiss they knew her as a hostage not an accomplice it would be hours before they discovered she wasnt part of the convocation and by then mercer hoped to have the whole situation wrapped up once he got his bearings he descended several decks explaining to a few crew members he passed that hed been doused fighting a kitchen fire it took about five minutes to navigate to his destination and once he was there he found the door locked nonessential crew must have been ordered to their cabins until the nature of the emergency could be determined he realized he knocked and a second later the english youth whod already lost a pair of sneakers opened the door hi mercer grinned remember me he showed the submachine gun and with wordless resignation the boy let him into the room his roommate stared wideeyed from his bunk mercer didnt bother tying them this time he just borrowed another pair of shoes jeans a manchester united sweatshirt and a longbilled benetton cap that slid on his bald head as he closed the door he heard the englishman say to his roommate i told you i wasnt playing kinky games with that guy from housekeeping mercer tossed his weapons into a laundry cart with a spare key card to vatutins room he could only pass as a panicked passenger if he wasnt armed to the teeth if everything had gone according to plan gunther rath should be on his highspeed motor launch with greta schmidt and the pandora box while erwin and klaus raeder were speaking with the sea empresss captain about stopping him in all mercer felt pretty damned pleased with himself even if he walked like he had a massive sunburn on his back every square inch of skin stung and he knew hed be blackandblue for weeks he took an elevator back to the passenger area and a minute later fitted the magnetic card into the lock and fell into vatutins room the orthodox priest and hilda brandt were already back from their excursion the large woman looked stricken when she saw that he was alone wo ist anika mercer lowered himself into a chair and closed his eyes letting the fear and tension wash out of his body shes fine the swiss who have her think i took her hostage they dont know she was with us hilda looked to vatutin and the russian translated the answer as best he could sehr gut she said you guys have any trouble nyet vatutin said we separate from mr lasko after theater then come back here five minutes ago there was a knock on the door shave and a haircut but only one bit it was iras signal and mercer reached behind him to flick open the handle goddamn that was fun ira said crashing onto the bunk but if i were the pope id reconsider my security arrangements those swiss guards never got close a few minutes later the fire alarm cut off at the same time vatutins phone rang hilda picked it up and handed it to mercer i can tell by the silence he answered that youve succeeded yes and no erwin puhl said from the captains stateroom he sounded sick what happened mercer sat forward in his chair suddenly tense again raeder explained to the captain what was going on how we arent really terrorists and that gunther rath was the true threat the captain said that fifteen minutes ago the ships computer reported the marina doors had been opened he dispatched two officers to see what was happening and they reported back that raths boat was gone weve tried to raise rath in the cabin he commandeered but no ones answering whats the problem sounds to me like everything went exactly as planned ira can now call director barnes at the cia and have rath intercepted we won erwin relax we didnt win mercer remember when you tried to reach your fbi friend and were told communications were out because of the solar max yeah we figured it was rath blocking outgoing signals it wasnt the solar max has killed all radios and satellite phones on the ship ira cant call anybody nobody can were cut off ten miles north of the sea empress conversation outside the launchs cockpit was impossible with her twin saab turbodiesels at full throttle the sea was calmer than could be expected so the fortyfoot craft once stowed aboard the njoerd shot across the low waves like a thoroughbred gunther rath was in the throttlemans seat while dieter the professional car racer manned the helm greta schmidt and two of raths security people were strapped against the bench seat behind them because of the boats offshore capabilities no one actually sat rather they leaned into specially designed cshaped cushions that allowed them to use their knees to absorb impacts everyone was armed everyone was tense the pandora box was secured in the forward cabin accessible through the low door between the drivers positions with it were four guests thanks to the confusion mercer created their escape from the sea empress had been relatively simple soon after the initial burst of automatic fire at the atrium rath understood mercers intentions werent to kill merely to spread enough panic to ensure he left the ship the german knew he was being manipulated hated it but had little choice raeder would need just a moment alone with the cruise ships captain and raths plans were finished once hed taken his hostages he and greta raced for the marina avoiding any area where gunfire was reported after making certain the njoerds launch was fueled and ready they wrecked the eight large shuttle boats stored in the garage by smashing holes in their fiberglass hulls with sledgehammers from the radar repeater on the empresss bridge rath knew the italian destroyer was eight miles south of the luxury liner protecting her seaward flank and would be unable to pursue the launch once they swung north toward iceland ninety miles away with the solar max at its zenith and even the most powerful marine radios hampered to a few miles range the italians were deaf and mute rath was making the best of the disasters that had befallen him and maintained optimism that they would be able to recover the sunken pandora boxes and turn them over to libya if he couldnt he was confident that the single box in his possession would guarantee a financially secure future for him and greta he figured he only needed a twohour head start to escape iceland once they reached its shores it would take twice that time just for the empress to get close enough to the island to report what had happened by then rath would have sent a chopper to the njoerd and he and greta would be on a leased jet for a hop to tripoli he looked over his shoulder to where she huddled in her parka and offered her a reassuring smile theyd be okay mercer would have slammed down the phone if raths unimpeded escape hadnt been entirely his fault it didnt matter that the rest of his team had agreed with his assessment about the communications from the empress hed made the call to let rath go and radio the authorities afterward and now the german was miles away with one of the boxes and there was nothing he could do to stop him like hell there wasnt the idea came to him in a moment of clarity that overwhelmed his swelling feelings of defeat erwin put raeder on the phone youre on a speaker phone here in the bridge the president of kohl said at once what do you want me to do rath will be heading to iceland turn the empress northward and tell the captain to push the engines as far as they will go herr mercer this is captain heinzharold nehring the voice was accented but commanding mercer imagined a ramrodstraight veteran whod seen and done it all the sea empress is capable of twentyeight knots we will never catch rath his boat is too fast i recommend we alert the destroyer intrepido with signal flares and once we are close enough for voice contact have them take up the hunt where is she about eight miles south of us the captain admitted itll take too long mercer fought to keep frustration from his voice every second we waste gives rath that much more of a lead we have the capability to go after him ourselves turn us to iceland and start firing those flares the intrepido can catch up and you can tell them whats happening en route does she have a chopper yes but it is down right now for a transmission problem doesnt matter i can catch rath how turn the ship and let me worry about it mercer looked at ira lasko how many guns do you have i dumped them all father vatutin so did i hilda had also returned to the cabin without her gun erwin mercer said into the phone get some weapons mps and pistols also a cell phone and a satphone it may work when were closer to iceland meet me in the marina where we first came aboard what are you doing ira asked when mercer cut the connection remember the riva speedboats next to the jet skis theyre ten or fifteen miles an hour faster than raths boat raths going to beat us to the coast but well be right on his heels lasko made a sour face those boats are thirty feet long he said doubtfully we must be a hundred miles from iceland theyll never survive a race across the open ocean mercer was already at the door forcing the others in the cabin to follow the boat will be fine its us who may not survive ira got a sudden idea wet suits now were on the same page theyre right next to the aquarivas like a squad of soldiers bent on a oneway mission they descended to the marina grim faced and silent while the alarms had been canceled the publicaddress system repeated a call for all passengers to report to their rooms for a head count the hallways were deserted mercers body vibrated with tension but his senses were on the hyperacuity he experienced whenever he faced danger he felt he could almost hear the second hand of his watch he crashed through the doors to the marina and snapped on the overhead lights the two rivas were along the left wall their polished forward decks gleaming under the fluorescents the long stern decks hid a pair of horsepower mercruiser engines each had a leathertrimmed open cockpit behind a windshield that was more decorative than functional they were expensive toys designed for running around secluded tropical coves and he was about to take one out in the open north atlantic on a chase her builders had never imagined he moved to the crane controls next to the glass office where greta schmidt had captured the others ira check the fuel status of the boat closest to the exit doors if shes full dump out half the gas we need speed not range im on it he was already unclamping the rear hatch to get at the engines mercer pulled an oversize wet suit over his stolen clothes the garment was stiff and new cutting his mobility but hed need it when the riva approached icelands wavelashed coast he and ira were in for a wet freezing ride the boots had no treads so he was forced to keep on his sneakers the smell of spilled gas began to envelop the space good job father vatutin monitor the gauges so ira can change erwin was not alone when he came in to the marina a moment later marty anika and klaus raeder were with him mercer allowed himself a second of relief that she was all right and turned his concentration back to what he was about to attempt give the weapons to hilda to check over she had proved her weapons training equaled her cooking skills whats the status on that fuel almost there anika go open the outer doors mercer said paying no attention to her expression she ignored his order and crossed to him mercer was bent over tying his shoe and didnt know she was there until he straightened she slapped him across the face harder than any woman had ever struck him he reeled against the rack of wet suits his cheek numbed that was for sticking a gun to my head fury thickened her accent and made her eyes burn and id hit you again for jumping off the bridge you didnt need to do that you could have given up right then we had already won it was a stupid stunt you just wanted to see if you could do it didnt you goddamned men and their egos you remind me of a climber i knew who attempted an impossible ascent but was willing to die trying which he did she turned away but mercer placed a hand on her shoulder she shook herself free dont touch me behind her anger mercer saw fear for herself mostly but a little for him too if you want to pigeonhole me with suicidal rock climbers i cant stop you he showed no anger because he couldnt blame her but i think youre wrong am i reckless when i have to be do i take chances no sane person would yes but not because i want to i do it because i have to and you have to chase rath in a boat that will sink after the first mile concern dampened her rage and her true feelings welled into her voice yes because he has to be stopped i didnt choose to be here anika nor did i choose to be on that walkway with a dozen guns pointed at me in case you hadnt noticed i react to situations i dont go looking for them if you think of me as some cliched macho guy driven to danger thats fine but i dont think you know me well enough for that kind of judgment mercer became more conciliatory im sorry i scared you he broke eye contact then noticed that klaus raeder was pulling on a wet suit what the hell are you doing coming with you the industrialist said none of this would have happened if id faced my accountability rather than trying to buy it off im not going to let you clean up my mistake mercer considered denying raeder his opportunity for repentance but he sensed the germans sincerity raeder wanted rath dead more than he did mercer understood why know how to handle a weapon raeder nodded then boasted im also a black belt in judo good for you mercer was unimpressed i intend to shoot rath from as far away as i can if you want to go beat up his corpse afterward be my guest erwin puhl had opened the outer doors and frigid sea air swept the gasoline fumes from the garage while ira lasko slid his thin frame into a wet suit marty attached the lifting lines from the overhead crane to hard points on the speedboat retractable rails would move the riva out of the garage and lower it to the ocean between the empresss twin hulls lets saddle up ira said when he was dressed just before mercer fired the mercruisers a ships officer burst into the marina erwin and raeder recognized him captain nehring no one paid attention to the elderly figure behind him wearing black slacks and a gray sweatshirt nehring was white haired and commanding as mercer had imagined but also physically and emotionally exhausted ive had stewards going over the ship to take a count of our passengers he panted from the run from the bridge we just discovered that gunther rath has taken hostages damn it mercer hadnt anticipated this possibility who the gentleman behind him stepped forward not until mercer looked closely seeing past the casual clothes did he recognize pope leo xiv in the hallway he caught the shadows of several swiss guards stunned mercer spoke before thinking holy shit the pope informed me that his secretary of state cardinal peretti is missing and weve been unable to locate an american televangelist and his wife tommy joe and lorna farquar ira recalled the flashy minister and his ditzy wife possibly a target of opportunity he grabbed in a hallway captain nehring said then added somberly rath also kidnapped the dalai lama everyone exchanged frightened looks rath couldnt have chosen a more emotionally evocative hostage if hed tried the dalai lamas influence beyond his six million tibetan followers was incalculable after the pope the nobel peace prize winner was the most recognized religious figure in the world seen as a sage statesman and the voice of the oppressed all over the globe the captain has told me you are going after the kidnappers the popes english was accented yet musical i understand why you want to do this thing but i cant allow you to sacrifice your lives for the hostages i have known the dalai lama for several years he would not wish you to trade your life for his neither would dominic peretti and in his own way minister farquar worships the same god as i do and my heart tells me that he too would not want you to die to save him who had been taken hostage meant nothing to mercer to him it didnt matter if one of them was the dalai lama or the guy that fetched the lamas morning tea this wasnt about hostages or even revenge it was about preventing the pandora box from spreading death i understand what youre saying your worship holiness grace mercer didnt know what title was appropriate sir and i appreciate your concern but were not going to rescue the four hostages were going because gunther rath possesses something that threatens every living thing on the planet not knowing if hed offended the pontiff mercer pointed to anatoly vatutin father vatutin can tell you what im talking about the pope looked like he was going to ask another question but stopped himself the determination in mercers eyes and voice was enough to convince him that the men on the speedboat had no intention of martyring themselves go with god and my blessing mercer felt the power of a billion catholics behind that simple sentence thank you he refocused on captain nehring keep trying those radios alert the american base at keflavik as soon as you can if the italians get their chopper in the air send it after us he keyed the rivas ignition and the roar of the engines drowned out any other attempt at conversation raeder and ira hung on tightly as marty used the crane to lift the boat off its cradle and maneuver it to the launching rails mercer took a second to look at anika she was at the door of the marina her arms crossed over her chest her expression unreadable against his better judgment he gave her a wink and thought he detected a small crack in her resolve a tiny lifting at the corners of her mouth it could have been his imagination the canal between the hulls streamed like a swiftflowing river martys hands were unsure on the crane controls so when he lowered the riva it hit with a powerful splash and immediately bucked against the ropes mercer advanced the throttles to the same speed as the sea empress and their ride stabilized enough for ira to cast off the lines like the other extravagant marques italy is famous for masarati ferrari lamborghini the riva came alive when mercer gave it her head firewalling the engine controls as soon as she was free she came on plane and shot from the canyonlike channel rounding the bow of the sea empress the three men settled dive masks over their faces to protect themselves from the stinging wind and the spray whipped up when she cut through the swells they wore throattoankle twopiece suits dive gloves and hoods and the goggles covered the last area of exposed skin as long as the speedboat didnt encounter seas she couldnt handle they would be safe from hypothermia if she did hit a wave and capsize the suits would buy them another few minutes in the water which hovered just a few degrees above freezing the night dazzled with swaying tides of auroral light intense enough to hide all but the brightest stars none bothered to notice at the helm mercer kept his eyes focused to where he thought the horizon line divided sky from sea while ira watched the compass to make sure they stayed on course klaus raeder hunkered behind them on the bench seat designed for cocktail parties and relaxing soirees the guns were at his feet without wind to roil its surface the north atlantic remained calm enough for them to maintain maximum speed with the air whipping past them at fifty miles per hour speaking was out of the question instead the three men were left with their nagging fears constantly aware that a rogue wave could rear up without warning and end their desperate race if by some miracle they survived the sea when it shelved against icelands jagged shore they still had to deal with a determined and dangerous gunther rath mercer calculated that with raths onehour head start the two boats would reach the coast at about the same time provided he could maintain their current speed that likelihood vanished as the sea grew restless it was barely noticeable at first just a slow undulation like gently rolling hills but after they were out in the open for an hour the waves grew until the white slashes of foam topped all but a few of them the riva began to rock mercer was forced to nose the boat into the waves pulling them off course so they didnt take the swells broadside even with the riva throttled back to thirtyfive knots the ride was punishing the sleek craft became airborne off the larger waves skipping across swells so that her props thrashed water and air in equal measure explosions of black water doused the men as they rode the turgid sea punished by their safety straps and lashed by an icy wind from the west they held tight ira placed his lips to mercer ear and screamed you think rath will have to slow too mercer shook his head no it was too loud to explain that raths larger boat was designed for these kinds of openwater waves they had been lucky to make up nearly threequarters of raths lead and could only hope not to lose any ground as they powered northward the sea grew rougher still and with the first blush of dawn smearing the eastern horizon the wind kicked up mercers knees burned from the constant flexing and his hands ached from maintaining a whiteknuckled grip on the wheel his feet were soaked from water sloshing around the cockpit and a numbness was creeping up his calves through the saltstreaked face mask he continuously scanned the sea for a glimpse of a wake or a running light so far nothing behind him klaus raeder threw up mercer spotted a wave twice the size of anything theyd encountered just before it hit he whipped the wheel into the surging wall of water and the riva rocketed up its face in a gutchurning swoop launched from the crest in a corkscrew flight the boat landed with her gunwale almost awash and she would have capsized if mercer hadnt jerked the wheel in the opposite direction and slammed the throttles to their stops before he could fully recover the next monster wave hit them broadside and water poured into the cockpit this time there was nothing he could do but pray the wave passed under them before the riva floundered the speedboat tumbled into the trough and mercer had enough time to kick her around again so they sluiced through the third large wave in the set it was a masterful demonstration of driving and ira gave him a wideeyed stare of disbelief mercers matching incredulity showed it had been luck and not skill the rivas bilge pumps cranked overtime with no idea when the next big series would hit mercer pointed to the west to tell raeder to keep watch the german tapped him on the shoulder in acknowledgment settled again on their northerly direction mercer throttled back slightly for better control and continued their pursuit five more times they hit high rolling sets of waves and each time raeder gave mercer enough warning for him to steer into them the ranks of swells between the big ones were still large enough to sink the boat but mercer had found their rhythm and kept them safe after another hour what appeared at first to be a pinprick of light ahead and slightly to their left slowly revealed itself as a lighthouse they were approaching the eastern side of the reykjanes peninsula very close to where icelands keflavik airport was located mercer racked his brain to remember the geography of the area as he recalled the only accessible village on this part of the peninsula was the small fishing community of grindavik about ten miles farther along the coast assuming rath would follow the most direct course to iceland and would need to steal a truck to complete his escape he edged the riva to starboard and increased their speed when they entered the coastlines protective cover the twin engines sang the dawn grew to a whiteandgold ribbon and the nature of the coast became more clear forlorn and tortured by its volcanic creation mercer could see the outline of a couple of volcanoes like elongated triangles on the flat plain beyond also revealed in the growing light was a distant speck of white on the water the wake of a boat running hard when the others spotted it too raeder passed a machine pistol to ira lasko and kept one for himself the cold and misery of their trip was lost in the desire to see it through the njoerds launch seemed to grow in size as they approached the little town of grindavik was still dark but visible and they would be abeam of raths boat at least a mile before they reached it swaying in time with the boats motion ira jacked a round into the chamber of his mp mercer steered for the stern of the offshore launch masking the sound of his approach with the other powerboats thundering diesels they needed only a few seconds in range to disable the steelhulled craft and as long as rath and his crew kept their focus on the town they would never know theyd been spotted mercer slowed the riva matching the launchs speed when it was just twenty yards ahead he could see the name njoerd painted on her flat transom beyond he saw four heads one of them with streaming blond hair just as ira raised the h ampk to his shoulder some instinct made greta schmidt look behind her mercer couldnt hear her shouted warning but her mouth moved in frantic command ira squeezed the trigger and a flat spray of bullets kicked up spray at the spot the launch had been an instant before dieter had reacted to gretas screams with the exceptional reflexes that made him such a skilled racer he began slewing the larger boat in a random slalom that was impossible to accurately track with a submachine gun ira couldnt risk randomly firing at raths boat in case he hit one of the hostages mercer backed off the throttles not wanting to overtake the swishing launch the race would only end when they reached shore greta had disappeared from their view for a moment when she emerged from the forward part of the launch she had a pistol in one hand and a hostage in the other her greater size and strength all but smothered the struggles of her victim the scantily dressed lorna farquar while his life had hardened mercer to violence he was not immune to it there was no way he could brace himself to what he knew was about to happen lorna must have realized her fate too because her writhing became desperate gretas expression didnt change as she clubbed the woman behind the ear with the pistol and shoved her limp form off the back of the boat instinct told mercer to ignore the motionless body that bobbed in the launchs wake and concentrate on gunther rath and the last pandora box that was what was important yet his humanity was a much stronger drive than any personal desire for justice there was no hesitation he chopped the throttles holding fast against the steering wheel as the riva dropped from plane like a headon collision raths boat thundered away while mercer swept the riva in a tight circle to recover the evangelists wife she lay facedown her skimpy dress peeled from her body by the impact with the water her flesh was white against her translucent panties already looking lifeless with the rivas mercruisers burbling mercer drew up next to her edging wheel and throttle so the speedboat pirouetted and klaus raeder could grab her he heaved her across the gunwale as soon as her feet cleared the frigid water mercer opened the throttles again he looked over his shoulder in time to see clear water erupt from lornas mouth and her body convulse in a coughing fit that sounded over the throb of the engines she curled into a ball and retched again shed be shivering for the next couple of hours and her head would ache but shed be all right rath was a quarter mile ahead angling in toward the wooden jetties fronting grindavik his launch didnt slow until the last second its wake slamming fishing boats into each other and the floating docks the one permanent pier thrusting out in the water was a concrete structure with a highbowed purse seiner snugged against one side a battered van was parked on the dock and five earlymorning fishermen talked amiably as they prepared the boats lines rath ordered dieter to the other side of the pier and the driver deftly coasted the last few yards one of the security men leapt from the launch to secure a rope to the rusted cleats another man followed him his attention on the fishermen theirs on his gun as mercer brought the riva in toward the town two other gunmen appeared at the big launchs transom and unleashed matching sprays of automatic fire the range was extreme and yet mercer had to sheer away from the stream of bullets cutting a deep crescent in the sea like a shark kept at bay he cruised just beyond the limit of the weapons patrolling back and forth restlessly seeking an opening that would never come rath held the superior position and until hed loaded his hostages and the pandora box into the truck mercer ira and raeder could do nothing but wait get mrs farquar below and wrap her in as many blankets as you can find mercer ordered there should be heating vents mounted on the ceiling of the cuddy cabin open them wide as raeder maneuvered the woman into the cabin and mercer watched the frenzied activity on the dock ira lasko got an inspiration he flicked on the satphone hed carried and tried to get a signal through damn it nothing what about the cell phone it doesnt rely on a satellite its signal only has to reach the closest tower and i think i can see one just inland of the town good idea he tossed the satphone aside and snapped open another telephone no bigger than a wallet ive got a signal call paul barnes and get us some help mercer could see that three of the fishermen were being pressed into service to carry the golden box from the launch to the rear of their van as rath directed the transfer greta schmidt covered a rubbery tommy joe farquar the squat dalai lama and cardinal peretti farquar still had on his shiny suit while peretti wore black pants and shirt the lama suffered in the cold wearing nothing more than a red robe and sandals his eyebrows looked like dark smudges on his nearly bald head ira worked the phone for a minute speaking in nonsequitur codes until he finally reached his case officer rudy ira lasko shut up and listen its all true yes the meteorite fragments and kohl industries and every other damned thing klaus raeder isnt the man we want its his specialprojects director gunther rath now listen to me rath has a box loaded with an unknown amount of the meteor as well as three hostages including the dalai lama and the number two man at the vatican were off the coast of iceland near a town called grindavik it doesnt matter how we got here were here and we need some serious fucking help get on the horn and get us a chopper from the keflavik airbase raths in a white stretch van and will probably be heading across the peninsula toward the reykjavik road i think its route mercer interrupted have him tell the pilot theyll be on the access road to the blue lagoon thermal spa ira passed on the information adding were going to try to get ground transportation and maintain pursuit rath has four or five men armed with pistols and subguns he will not hesitate to fire no dont take the van from the air unless absolutely necessary hes got hostages for christs sake youve got a trace on this line so call me back at this number when you have air force cooperation he snapped off the cell phone he had a million questions that dont need to be answered until this shits over how long to get a chopper they couldnt afford a delay rath would be miles ahead by the time they stole a vehicle of their own and took up the chase again only fifteen minutes militarys been on alert since i stopped checking in klaus raeder clambered up the steep steps from the rivas cabin she should be fine the knot on her head is bleeding a bit but i dont think her skull is cracked every time the speedboat drifted toward shore with the rising tide a burst of machine gun fire erupted from the dock and mercer jammed the boat into reverse and hauled them out of range again they used the time to strip out of the restricting wet suits wind cut through the clothing but adrenaline insulated them from the chilling effects had grindavik been more than a clutch of white clapboard structures he would have beached the riva farther away and tried to flank the fugitives but there was nothing on either side of the village except miles of barren desolation on the dock gunther rath raged at his men hed been ensured that there was no way anyone could follow them from the sea empress and yet evidence to the contrary lurked a few hundred yards off shore granted even he couldnt have predicted mercer would attempt the dangerous openocean crossing in such a small boat but if hed known about the riva speedboats in the jet ski garage he would have ordered their hulls smashed too the petrified fishermen had almost maneuvered the twohundredpound golden box into the back of the van once it was secure rath planned to leave one gunman on the dock to hold mercer at bay while they made their escape he needed a half hour to reach keflavik airport where they could trade the hostages for a jet to get away from iceland come on he shouted and cuffed one of the fishermen the man staggered and the box fell heavily into the cargo area of the van rocking its suspension without thought or mercy rath pulled his automatic pistol from where it was jammed into his belt and shot two of the fishermen two others leapt onto their boat and hid from view and the fifth jumped into the water load up he snarled gesturing at the three hostages with the smoking gun mutely they climbed into the van the dalai lama giving him a look as if he understood what demons drove rath to murder so callously tommy joe farquar while sobered by the long boat ride simply allowed himself to be maneuvered too stunned by what happened to his wife to offer any kind of resistance cardinal peretti did nothing to hide his contempt willie i want you to stay on the dock rath ordered the youngest of his men keep that boat from landing as long as you can buy us thirty minutes and get yourself out of here stay away from the georesearch office in reykjavik and get word to the partys office in hamburg theyll know how to contact me and well extract you in a couple of days ja wohl the young neonazi replied proud to be able to serve his cause greta kept her pistol on the hostages as she entered the van through the side door reveling in the smell of testosterone and fear filling the cab she was near a sexual peak and the pressure of her clothing against her breasts sent ripples of energy through her body her faith in gunther was so absolute that she knew they would make it away with dieter behind the wheel and rath in the passenger seat the van started rolling down the dock once it was on the road they accelerated quickly the airport was just thirty miles away frustration filled mercer as the hostages boarded the van for a ride he doubted any would survive as soon as the vehicle disappeared into the quiet town he started for the dock and only realized rath had left behind a picket when the water around the riva exploded and bits of her forward deck blew away in bright slivers of precious wood he cranked the wheel while ira and raeder returned fire the gunman on the dock had cover behind a stack of heavy steel fish traps and nothing short of a missile would dislodge him im going to beach down the coast and well run back to town to find a car he shouted over the engines before he could execute his plan the gunman suddenly staggered out from his hide his hands smeared red where they clutched his stomach the sound of a rifle reached the men on the water a second later and they all saw a puff of smoke blow from the bridge of the fishing boat tied to the dock the neonazi looked up to where the shot had come from and the back of his head erupted as the rifle the fishermen used for sharks blew his brains all over the dock mercer didnt waste a second he took them in under nearly full power not caring that he scrubbed off speed using the side of the riva against the dock ira vaulted up to the concrete quay with a line and cinched it tight raeder came next and then mercer now holding a submachine gun and a beretta pistol two icelanders stood on the bridge of the boat their deeply weathered faces and suspicious eyes never leaving the three men the third survivor of the group had just reached the rocky beach and began walking back to the dock theres a woman in the cabin mercer pointed at the riva hoping that these men spoke english like most icelanders shes near hypothermic and needs a doctor for a concussion the fishermen said nothing the old boltaction rifle was leveled at mercers head the men who killed your friends dumped her in the sea we need a car to go after them the wind whistled through the fishing boats rigging if you wont help us at least dont stop us mercer pleaded the man holding the shark rifle let the barrel fall until it was pointed at the deck of his boat how long the woman in the water five minutes maybe eight gunfights and cold murder were beyond what these men knew a person sacrificed to the sea was a danger they could understand the two men they kill my cousins the captain of the boat said and reached into his pocket he tossed a wad of keys onto the dock at mercers feet you know killing you kill them i know sea i will help woman he raised his hand toward the town blue volvo in front of vsjomannastofan restaurant mercer didnt thank them they wouldnt expect it and he didnt have the time he scooped up the keys and raced off the dock confident that ira and klaus would keep up he was stopping for nothing until rath was dead the volvo was a beaten four door rust smeared and so often repaired that little of its original paint remained the interior reeked of pipe smoke and the seat covers were so shredded they showed more foam padding than black vinyl the engine belched and snorted and barely settled down when he forced the transmission into first gear with a painful grind mercers heckler amp koch was across his lap iras window refused to roll down so he smashed it out with his machine pistol the road twisted out of town following the vagaries of the volcanic terrain as their speed approached sixty the bald tires and mistslick macadam tried to throw them in the ditches bordering each curve mercer wished he had his jag right now theyd be doing a hundred without a chirp from the wheels still he pushed the old volvo harder drifting through corners with quick touches of brake and gas his hand working the stick without regard to the gears worthless synchronizers in the distance he could see steam plumes from the svartsengi power plant rising into the gray dawn like clouds struggling from the black landscape what he couldnt see was a white van driving as recklessly as he was at the end of this road was a branch east to reykjavik or west to the international airport and keflavik each route held promise for fugitives and mercer needed to be close enough to see where rath was heading any sign of that chopper he asked the volvo briefly lifted on two wheels as its tires screamed through a tight bend ceilings only about five hundred feet ira said referring to the low cloud cover that hung from the tallest peaks like muslin we wont see it until we pass under it the road leveled out and straightened as they neared the geothermal generating station and the adjacent blue lagoon spa a trio of hundredfoot cooling towers rose from the lava field like slender rockets on a moonscape their tops wreathed in steam the rest of the sprawling facility was hidden in a dip in the topography a half mile ahead was the turn for the plant and spa and just beyond that was the van mercers jaw tightened then he realized something was wrong the van wasnt in his lane it was in the opposite it wasnt heading away from them it was coming closer like an enraged insect a hughs helicopter painted olive drab hovered above the hurtling van its skids no more than fifty feet from the vehicles roof a sniper with a barrett caliber rifle sat in the open door his clothes rippled by the wind his eye screwed to the weapons enormous scope mercer slammed on the volvos emergency brake and slipped the car into a skid that completely blocked the twolane road even the sturdiest fourwheeldrive suv couldnt penetrate more than five feet into the mosscovered lava fields rath was caught between the helo and the car throwing open his door mercer pulled the h ampk and watched the van approach over the sights he pulled the trigger intentionally aiming low he couldnt risk the driver or a stray shot ricocheting in the cab it was one thing for dieter to risk his life on a race track another thing entirely facing the winking eye of an automatic mm it was a game of chicken that he wouldnt play braking so the vans back end broke loose he spun into the driveway of the generating plant and accelerated away mercer knew from his tour of the facility a couple years ago that this was the only way in or out of the complex as long as he could disable the van the pandora box was trapped he dove back into the volvo willed the transmission into gear and tore after the fleeing vehicle ira jammed a fresh magazine into mercers mp the van continued past the turnoff for the power station and drove toward the newly constructed blue lagoon spa the hughs flashed over the car nose down and menacing the spas modern glassandsteel building was set back from the empty parking lot it was reached by a meandering foot path cut into the lava a narrow trail flanked by tenfoot walls of tortured stone dieter careened through the lot and shot down the footpath sparks flying whenever the fenders scraped rock with mercer still several hundred yards behind them and unable to communicate with the chopper the maneuver bought them a few minutes to hustle their hostages from the van they had no choice but to leave the golden box in the rear one of raths gunmen waited in the van his machine pistol able to cover the entire trail when they followed mercer and his men would run headlong into a scathing ambush rath blew apart one of the spas glass doors with his pistol and rushed in confident that his men had peretti farquar and the dalai lama well covered ahead was a cavernous room bisected by a reception counter beyond was a waiting area with a twentyfoot glass wall overlooking the steaming waters of the artificial lagoon in the weak light of the encroaching dawn the water had a peculiar shade of milky blue a combination of silica and bacteria that gave it curative powers and the unholy stench of sulfur with an eye for urban street fighting rath positioned his men to best cover the entrance in case mercers team made it past the gunner in the van he also scouted out his escape route for when mercer was dead the building echoed with the reverberations of chopper blades just a few feet above the roof when he reached the parking lot and saw the spas canyonlike entry path mercer instinctively knew where rath had gone he braked hard at the beginning of the trail blocking it with the body of the volvo to trap the van hyped on adrenaline until his veins burned he never considered waiting for reinforcements from the military base at keflavik theyll be waiting for us to follow ira said well flank em mercer grunted you two climb up the left side of the path and ill go right well stop when were above the van the lava on this part of the reykjanes peninsula had been laid down in ad and despite icelands scouring winds it had not yet succumbed to the polishing effects of erosion clambering up the wall on one side of the path was like climbing a mound of broken glass a mistimed lunge for a knuckle of stone resulted in a bleeding gash on mercers knee and what felt like four fingerprints being abraded off his left hand slowed by his injuries he made his ascent and started off for the building he could see nestled in an excavated bowl of rock the lagoon behind it simmered like an aquamarine cauldron watching for a guard atop the lava and keeping one eye out for anyone lurking in the shadowy trail below mercer scrambled along the rim of the path until the van was directly below him he looked through the multiple windows fronting the spa but saw nothing in the darkness within the helicopters downblast blew a freezing gale across his naked scalp once ira and raeder were across from him and had the building covered mercer raised himself slightly to zero in on the rear of the white van and gave the h ampks trigger a long squeeze he emptied a clip careful to direct his fire away from where he thought the vans fuel tank would be the crashing shots deafened him so he didnt hear the rear door unlatch but he saw it swing outward a man in a black georesearch jumpsuit oozed slowly to the ground small eruptions in his uniform leaking blood gunfire burst from one of the windows a story above his position ira and raeders returned fire had no effect on the sniper a steady stream of rounds continued to explode around mercer he had a small measure of shelter behind an outcropping of lava but the mm rounds were quickly eating away at the volcanic stone he slapped in another clip then rather than run away as the gunman anticipated mercer charged the spa firing a short burst the gap between mercers hill and the buildings second story was eight feet across and in the instant before he jumped down he saw another gunman lurking below him unable to stop mercer angled slightly and leapt instead for an office window snapping off a couple rounds at the black glass as he flew the window was just starting to come apart as he burst through in a shower of glass he landed atop a cluttered desk scattering papers and knocking a computer to the floor he levered himself back to the window ready to fire at the guard hed glimpsed below but the man had vanished he saw ira and raeder moving out to find their own access to the building mercer took a deep breath prepared for the lancing pain of a broken rib or two but other than the dull ache from his impact with the desk he was all right he eased out of the office after recharging his halfdepleted clip with bullets from a pair of pistol magazines the interior of the spa was murky and indistinct filled with shadows that shifted as the sun rose higher at the end of the corridor was a bridge that overlooked the entry foyer and waiting area dozens of chairs and tables had been hastily stacked in one corner about halfway across the room a shape moved behind them mercer sighted in and fired off a threeround burst a hail of return fire pinned him to the bridge its glass railings disintegrated in a rain of shards he had a sudden inspiration when the autofire ceased he rolled and fired above the hidden gunmans redoubt the twentyfoot wall of glass was divided into huge sections by a steel lattice he concentrated his aim on the top section above the neonazi and held steady the inchthick plate splintered and came crashing down hundreds of pounds of glass falling to the stone floor the table and the gunman it was dieter caught in the avalanche he had just started to dive out from under the onslaught when a fiftypound piece of window caught him on the shoulder and severed his arm from his body mercer cut off his scream with a shot to the head movement caught his attention and he raised his weapon holding his fire when he recognized ira and raeder approaching from the other side of the bridge stay down mercer shouted too late the shots came from behind and below them near the spas gift shop iras quick dive wasnt enough his body jerked as two bullets found their mark the remainder of the short blast pinged off the structural steel in the ceiling as raeder provided cover fire mercer grabbed iras collar and dragged him to the safety of the corridor a snaking trail of blood was smeared into the carpet behind him mercer rolled him on his back and iras brow beaded with sweat hed gone completely white and his breath came in short choppy slurps blood bloomed across his abdomen and looked like a black slick on the inside of one thigh how bad mercer asked gently pulling up iras shirt how the hell should i know the agent gasped im not a doctor mercer used his sleeve to clear away blood and laughed the bullet pierced the small flap of skin on iras waist a clean in and out that left puckered holes but no lasting damage had your wife been a better cook it would have been worse the wound in the leg was much more serious it hadnt cut the femoral artery but the gushes of blood that poured from it indicated some other major vessels had been torn klaus exchanged more shots with the gunman in the gift shop mercer used his belt as a crude tourniquet cinching it as tight as he dared it would have to be released every twenty minutes or ira would risk gangrene if he couldnt remain conscious to do it raeder would have to stay with him is he okay raeder asked yeah mercer brushed glass from his shoulders with two guards down there were two left in addition to greta and gunther the odds had been evening out but without ira mercer would have to go after them alone and as long as the germans had the hostages he was fighting from an even more severe disadvantage i think the two gunmen are going to try to pin us here while the others escape over to the power plant where they can steal a vehicle what about the sniper in the helicopter raeder asked as he gathered iras spare clips unless they set down theyll never risk a shot the choppers too unsteady ira can you handle your own tourniquet i can for a while he licked his lips whats your plan no idea mercer looked around a haze of gunpowder smoke stinging his nostrils he could almost feel the two armed men lurking someplace in the elegant building he finally looked back to ira how about contacting your case officer again have him phone keflavik base so we can get the helicopter down you need immediate evac and we need some men to secure the pandora box klaus will stay with you until they land and then he can follow me wherere you going after rath that isnt the smartest idea youve ever had mercer laughed this coming from a man who just let himself get shot his next teasing comment died on his lips a pistol shot had sounded somewhere below near where he had seen the signs for the bathers changing rooms there was only one reason for a single shot in this kind of situation for some reason rath had just put down one of his hostages mercer looked first at ira and then at klaus raeder they too knew what had happened ill be okay ira said clasping mercers arm he had a pistol at his side move me into an office and go kill that sick son of a bitch make sure that chopper pilot knows which side were on when we get outside mercer said once ira was safely hidden behind a desk he grabbed up his h ampk and took off down the hallway with klaus raeder several office doors were open and their windows had a view of the lavarimmed pool area from this vantage point they saw figures moving through the swirling mist dark furtive shapes that lurched from cover to cover it was obvious that two were going against their will but was impossible to tell which one the dalai lama cardinal peretti or tommy joe farquar had been shot in the dressing room it was also clear that the two remaining gunmen in raths command were with them the blue lagoon spa was clear there are stairs at the end of the corridor raeder said lets do it they went down and came out into another hallway the mens changing room was behind them and mercer entered first his hands tight on the small machine pistol his ragged breathing reverberated off the tile walls he swept the dimly lit room quickly checking behind islands of lockers before swinging into the adjoining showers and rest room a body lay against one wall tommy joe farquars toupee was missing and his suit had lost its luster but he was alive frightened and in pain from the bullet through his shoulder he screamed when he saw mercer with the gun doubtlessly assuming he was with the men whod kidnapped him and dumped his wife into the sea suddenly he choked off his own shouts and stared defiantly philistine god will smite you down with a vengeance only he can conjure he raged in his best preachers voice you will burn in an unspeakable pit for all eternity your soul to become food for satans hell hounds thats probably true mr farquar mercer agreed but were not with your kidnappers in fact were the ones who saved your wife lorna is back in grindavik where you first made landfall shes going to be fine oh praise sweet jesus he tried to raise his arms in supplication but his wound quickly brought his hands back to his side he shrieked and turned ashen whyd they shoot you mercer asked i tried to run away it doesnt matter raeder snapped impatiently we have to go after gunther mr farquar medical help is on the way if you can try to crawl out to the hallway so someone spots you you cant leave me tommy joe raised his good arm they may come back not if i can help it they left him without another word passing out of the building and onto the wooden deck surrounding part of the sulfurous pool heat radiated from the surface of the oddly colored water raeder followed mercer around the lagoon tracking across the deck in the same direction theyd seen rath lead his prisoners the uneven terrain separating the spa from the power plant offered a million places for the germans to lay an ambush wary mercer stepped off the deck and onto the moonscape an ounce more pressure on his index finger ready to unleash thirty rounds fifty yards into the lava field he burst out from the densest of the steam the hughs swept across the plain at him its rotors beating like thunder forcing him and raeder to dive into a craggy hollow the industrialist landed on mercers back pressing his face against a knife edge of stone that opened yet another gash this one deep enough to leave a scar what is he doing raeder shouted terrified he thinks were with rath the chopper came across again this time standing off a hundred yards to give the sniper an open line of sight the barrett caliber cracked once and a chunk of rock the size of a basketball blew apart just a few feet from their position mercer and raeder both lunged to their feet and began running leaping from boulder to boulder rising and falling with the wrinkled ground the gun boomed again and this time the bullet passed close enough for mercer to feel the shock wave what can we do keep running iras got to get through to tell him who we are another shot went wide as mercer jinked like a fleeing antelope then suddenly his leg folded under him and he fell hard he heard more than felt something give way in his wrist as he tried to break the headlong tumble the numbness that climbed his left arm became a stabbing sensation from hand to elbow and then the pain behind his thigh hit searing and hot yet he could move his foot could see it rotate as he tested it something was wrong acaliber round should have crucified him to the ground and left him immobile and yet he struggled to his feet teetering as a wave of pain washed out of him he felt for the wound amid the mass of blood he felt something gritty jesus his femur had been powdered by the shot he was so deeply in shock he couldnt feel the full extent of the crippling injury that was why he could stand in a minute he knew hed pass out he could feel it coming but as he checked his bloodsmeared hand he saw particles of something black it wasnt bone fragments it was bits of rock hed been peppered by a ricochet of stone fragments from a round that had hit behind him the wound was no more than being shot from a half dozen bb guns he sagged but his relief was shortlived hed been concentrating on his wounds and not the chopper mercer had been standing motionless for fifteen seconds long enough for a good sniper to shoot him many times over he looked up and stared into the cockpit of the chopper hovering fifty yards away the sniper had him zeroed at the instant the sniper eased the trigger the pilot jerked the chopper the bullet passed harmlessly over mercers head the sniper glared at the pilot and shouted something listened for a moment and then looked over to where mercer remained standing he tossed a jaunty apologetic wave and the chopper heeled away flying toward the spas open parking lot what happened raeder emerged from a natural fortification of twisted rock ira must have gotten through mercer said still amazed to be alive can you go on the stinging in his leg was already subsiding as adrenaline overcame the pain mercers answer came without thought goddamned right i can they linked up with the pipeline that carried effluent from the generating plant to the spas pool and began running in the distance loomed one of the svartsengi plants many buildings a twostory concrete structure with small windows that looked like portholes from it ran countless other pipes in a tangled maze only an engineer could love steam drifted across the facility on the quirks of the wind they raced past the turquoise pond that had been the old blue lagoon spa and now acted as the leach field for the mineralladen water forced to the surface by earths tremendous internal pressure once at the plant mercer chanced a look down the central road that bisected the station there were six principal buildings and all but the administration center across the road were connected by pipes and conduits of various diameters it reminded mercer of a miniature oil refinery only this place was spotlessly clean as befitting its environmentally friendly power source the air crackled with the generation of thirtytwo megawatts of electricity enough power for a town of thirtytwo thousand people a flash of light and bullets sprayed the corner of the building where mercer and raeder crouched raeder fired back sparking rounds off pipes but hitting little else whoever had them zeroed was well protected by the steel forest there were two cars parked in front of one of the administration building most likely belonging to security guards since the regular work shift was hours away as raeder kept him covered mercer fired two quick bursts blowing out the four tires he could see from his vantage one way or the other it would end here they circled back around the building taking a path that ran alongside the lagoon of wastewater at the next building mercer found an unlocked door and eased inside his machine pistol held tight and ready the interior space was well lit and futuristic with catwalks that ran along parallel rows of heat exchangers and turbines the building hummed another door at the front of the building crashed open and two figures stood silhouetted mercer was about to fire when he recognized the silver hair of cardinal peretti shielded behind him was one of raths men a pistol held to the catholic leaders head let him go mercer shouted over the whine of machinery the gunman jerked peretti by the throat ducking behind the cardinal as they moved into the building i see you make a move he dies the neonazi shouted back in german mercer didnt need raeders whispered translation to get the gist of the remark you can walk away raeder called out we only want rath forget it herr raeder we all leave or we all die mercer stood slowly so the gunman could see him the mp dangling from its strap the man pulled his pistol from perettis skull and aimed it at him now you die the young fanatic shouted dominic peretti had been docile from the moment the gunmen had burst into his cabin aboard the sea empress because it was only his life he felt had been in danger but seeing the stranger taking deliberate steps toward them he couldnt allow such a sacrifice fortyfive years before he had been a star on his seminary schools basketball team because of a spin move some called divine he raised a hand to deflect the germans aim planted a foot to throw off the mans weight and spun around him quicker than hed been able to move in decades the gunman stood exposed for a fraction of a second mercer cleared the beretta from his belt and triggered off three shots fast enough to sound automatic the german was flung against the wall by the triple tap and crumpled to the steel flooring peretti dropped to a knee and felt for a pulse he looked to mercer with neither recrimination nor regret then started last rites are you okay father im fine my son the vaticans number two man said do you know where they have the dalai lama no we split up when they took us here the large man and the woman took the lama with them i believe they are in the administration building but im not sure trying to call the georesearch office in reykjavik raeder suggested maybe mercer said father you have to hide yourself until this is over i will in a moment he said continuing his prayers over the corpse only when he was done did he address mercer again can you do me a favor ah i dont really have the time mercer answered not understanding what the priest could possibly want considering the circumstances ask for my forgiveness and say one hail mary his eyes were alight then sin no more after you send the others to hell where they belong mercer muttered the nearly forgotten prayer peretti made the sign of the cross over him and hid next to one of the massive conduits carrying superheated water through an exchanger as safe a place as any at the site glancing outside mercer saw no movement the administration buildings front doors didnt look damaged he doubted that rath had gotten that far yet klaus keep that building covered im going to check the next one mercer dashed from the doorway using pipes as cover until he crashed against the base of the three towering smoke stacks the metal still hot to the touch even after the steam venting up them had passed through numerous turbines and exchangers the walls of the building behind him were made of steel plate like it had been armored as mercer reached a door he recalled why this was building and it contained the secondary turbine loops that used waste steam to boil a petroleum derivative called isopentane this liquid had been specially formulated to boil at a mere two hundred degrees fahrenheit in order to extract the last bit of energy from the natural steam he remembered the plant manager whod given him the tour years ago also telling him that isopentane was highly explosive behind this building would be the outlets where the saline water driven from the earths bowels was finally released back into nature after producing all the electricity and hot water needs of the citizens of the reykjanes peninsula no smoking signs were posted along building s walls the knob had already been shot off a door allowing mercer to slip inside building had a less modern more industrial look than the others with rows of long cylinders like rural propane tanks but these held the isopentane in a closedloop system of liquid and gas beside each set of tanks was a small steamdriven turbine the floor was polished concrete mercer was having difficulty keeping the mp steady from the pain in his wrist he had some motion in the joint and felt that some tendons had been torn his left hand felt like a dead weight and he steadied the machine pistols foregrip on the crook of his elbow with so much ambient noise in the powerhouse he had to rely on his vision to scout the building around one of the tanks he spotted a darkly dressed figure hunkered next to a turbine mercer recognized the gunman as a georesearch technician by his expression it was evident he recognized mercer too they fired at the same instant both bursts going wild from the shock of discovery ducking around a turbine mercer was chased by more rounds the sharp rip of a machine pistol tearing the air an ember of steel burned his hand before he could brush it away he fired back his adversary had moved so the shots hit nothing but metal okay where the hell did he go mercer moved to his left sighted along an access walkway but saw nothing he then went right a burst of autofire raked the concrete at his heels as he dove under an isopentane cylinder oh thats where he went he tried to get a bead on the assassin but there was too much machinery for a clean shot he studied the tank above him ten different pipes including a huge trunk line that brought steam from outside linked the stacked vessels mercer had no idea which carried gas and which carried liquid but he could tell which were the most vulnerable the trick would be to get the gunman into position he switched to his pistol to conserve ammunition and began maneuvering around the plant working the gunman like they were chess pieces giving ground when he had to but inexorably moving the man to where he wanted him dashing across an open space mercer slid behind a support column shots ripped furrows from the floor behind him secure once again his wounded leg all but dead now mercer felt he had the gunman he steadied his grip on the pistol and cycled through the clip as fast as he could pull the trigger the ricochets whined away as ten rounds slammed into the point where a pipe joined with the isopentane tank that shielded the assassin even before he knew if hed succeeded mercer began to run behind him the german had flinched at the onslaught of bullets hitting steel so close to his head he had a second to register the highpitched hiss before the leaking isopentane ignited like a flamethrower escaping gas blew out in a fiftyfoot tongue of fire that mushroomed into an overwhelming inferno eating everything it touched amid the blistering paint and melting wires the assassins body cooked like a joint of meat blasted by the overpressure wave mercer was thrown into the side of the building hard enough to momentarily knock him out when he came to an alarm sensed the fire and shut down this portion of the facility a klaxon wailed and sprinklers began a rain that quickly turned into a torrent he hauled himself from the floor fingering the knot growing on his forehead if none of the other tanks ruptured from the searing heat the building wouldnt go up if one did they all would in a chain reaction that would likely wreck several square acres he fitted the last magazines into each of his weapons and ran for the next building this structure was nearly identical to where hed left cardinal peretti differently painted pipes and valves added the only color to the monochromatic steel interior doubled over and limping his vision beginning to blur from a concussion mercer began a systematic sweep of the building there were hundreds of crannies a person could hide in miles of heavy pipes that could shield even the largest man and he wouldnt know they were there until he walked into their sights he jumped over a handrail to get off the exposed catwalk dividing the long room at the end of the row of identical machines he thought hed seen a shadow move he hunkered down to look under the pipes blocking his view there hiding behind the last turbine was a pair of legs but as he watched they vanished the person was crawling on top of the boxy exchanger getting the best location to cover the entire room mercer stood holding himself just out of the gunmans view he had one chance to get this right not quite pistols at ten paces this was more like automatic rifles at thirty the assassin knew he was in here had a good idea where he was hiding and would have the advantage of a secure firing platform mercer moved laterally singeing his hands on a pipe but not making a sound as he crawled to a different position he brought the h ampk to his shoulder and leapt up through the sights he saw greta schmidts head behind a small yellowhandled relief valve atop a thick pipe her flaxen hair framing her beautifulugly face her expression approached sexual euphoria eyes wide and dilated her skin flushed she had her own machine pistol clamped at her side but her aim was off by a few degrees of arc she saw mercer pop up from behind a piece of equipment and tried to adjust a streaming hail of rounds followed her swing mercer fired once before the slide on his mp racked back and jammed the single bullet struck the valve and vectored harmlessly away after a second of silence that seemed to unroll in slow motion the tremendous pressure of steam driven by the planets molten center exploded through the damaged valve in a screaming eruption in the fleeting moment before the jet of vapor obscured his view mercer saw gretas face begin to dissolve her hair vanished first burned away by the fivehundreddegree steam then the flesh began to melt away until patches of bone showed through the steam turned red as it boiled the blood and tissue from her skull she vanished and mercer choked on the acid that scoured the back of his throat hyperventilating he cleared the jam knowing that blind luck had saved him he remained where he was while the mental image of greta liquefying lost some of its vividness his head pounded a scream galvanized him a hoarse animal sound of primeval fury gunther rath had entered the building from the opposite end and spotted what remained of his lover mercer he roared i am going to kill you better men than you have made that threat mercer shouted back rath fired off a wild burst that rattled around the room sparking off countless metal surfaces i still have the dalai lama mercer almost made the mistake of telling him about klaus raeder in the next building he was tired hadnt slept in thirtysix hours and his brain wasnt functioning anywhere near where it should if it werent for the adrenaline he would have collapsed hours ago give it up rath even if you make it out of this plant alive youll never leave iceland you saw the helicopter you know weve alerted the military theyll quarantine this entire island if they have to you think that matters now rath challenged back even if i do escape the libyans would have me killed for not delivering the pandora boxes shit hes ready to die right here and he wants to take me with him mercer went from hunter to hunted in that one statement he could leave now slink away and wait for troops from keflavik base to end this suddenly an image flashed into his brain of elisebet rosmunder feeding the ducks in reykjavik the libyans wont get the chance he yelled he fired a quick burst and raced for one of the buildings back doors bullets chased him but none hit before he rolled onto the asphalt outside he knew rath would never let him escape the man had nothing left to lose and only revenge to keep him going mercer gave building a wide berth as he circled around it limping across open pavement until he reached a rocky area along the shores of the manmade wastewater lagoon the water shimmered with sunlight that had burst from over the horizon as he stopped at another tangle of pipes he saw rath at the door hed just passed through he was holding the lama by his collar the dalai lama had lost one of his sandals during his ordeal one foot was a bloody mess from running across the lava rocks he couldnt put any weight on it and his normally dusky complexion had paled from the pain yet his expression remained neutral as if the agony wasnt his own the strength he used to defy a nation as large and powerful as china extended to a will over his own body the burst of gunfire came from the far side of the complex it hadnt been intentionally aimed to kill rath but passed far over his head klaus raeder walked down the road like a western gunslinger changing clips as he approached his squint never leaving the man who had once been his most loyal assistant the dalai lama seemed to come alive when he interpreted raeders actions as a rescue attempt he shifted his weight when rath tried to return fire the shots flew far wide as the buddhist moved to smother his kidnapper in a bear hug mercer got ready for the moment the neonazi let the lama go his machine pistol had become too heavy to hold so he switched to the beretta handgun his grip was loose and shaky his eyes barely able to focus he squeezed his eyes shut to clear them and actually made his vision worse fifty yards separated rath and raeder hatred sparking between them like an electric arc frustrated that he couldnt hit his former boss because of the lamas untutored struggles rath rammed the muzzle of his pistol to the tibetan leaders head drawing blood having drawn the danger back to himself the lama went still more concerned with raeders safety than his own no closer klaus rath said in german in a voice that was unnaturally calm hed already made whatever mental adjustments were necessary to die either raeder didnt hear him or didnt care he kept coming mercer wished he could understand what they were saying to each other kill him gunther it doesnt matter raeder said calmly you will still die ill do it i know you will hed closed to within thirty yards whats one more death to you eh id say it was one more soul on your conscience but you dont have one i thought i had been your teacher all these years now i see it is you who taught me your life and mine are meaningless and his rath forced the gun harder against the lamas skull he believes hell be reincarnated on a higher plane im sure he fears death even less than we do let him go and the two of us will end this together lets see how much you have taught me raeder dropped his mp and threw aside the pistol in his belt one on one i let him go and mercer drops me where i stand raeder flicked his eyes in mercers direction and switched to english dont shoot i am going to handle this what the hell are you talking about dr mercer this is between gunther and me he is going to release the lama if you dont interfere screw that please raeder begged i told you before that this is my mistake to fix allow me that afterward you can arrest me and throw me in jail let me end this my way mercer blinked seeing two of everybody now you know what youre doing he asked doubtfully raeder had boasted he was a martial arts expert but rath had forty pounds and four inches on him even if he wins i guarantee hell be in no condition to leave this place the inside of mercers sneaker was spongy with blood from the sniper ricochet youd better be sure about that im in rough shape a wave of blackness swept across his vision and he stumbled back falling against an insulated outlet pipe that pulsed with the force of nearboiling water he couldnt prevent his aim from dropping rath tossed his automatic and gave the dalai lama a shove that sent him sprawling his glasses shattered when he hit the pavement though he struggled to get between the two antagonists his injured foot refused to support him the lama called out for them to stop but neither german listened rath and raeder moved closer circling warily raeder threw the first punch a lightning strike that would have crushed the throat of a normal man rath easily caught his fist twisted raeder over and kicked him three times in the stomach before releasing the arm and letting raeder fall to the ground klaus he laughed do you really think i taught you everything i know raeder lurched to his feet clutching broken ribs mercer raised his pistol but the two began circling again and he wasnt sure which of the figures he saw were real and which were chimeras he threw up his concussion from the explosion in building was far worse than hed thought the two men exchanged flurries of blows deflecting most landing occasionally both knew this match would have only one outcome rath was stronger fitter and more skilled hed trained raeder and for years had allowed his pupil to win bouts to keep him interested at any time rath could have killed him in the dojos where they sparred one more of raths many deceptions that was turning out to be as deadly as the rest soon raeders mouth bled from broken teeth and one eye was nearly closed he limped from a kick aimed at his crotch hed deflected into his thigh and yet he fought on giving ground whenever rath came in on him sacrificing his body as if the pain would somehow expunge his sins mercer had to drag himself to keep the combatants in view crawling across the rocks at the edge of the lagoon as they battled heat radiating from the pool drew more sweat to his already soaked face he was too dulled to understand what raeder was doing and rath was too intent on the kill the water feeding the nearby spa was regulated to a constant temperature of degrees hot enough to scald but cooling when it mixed in the squarefoot pool here there was no need to artificially cool the effluent and it erupted from the outlet pipes at nearboiling temperatures steam rose as from a volcanos caldera raeder absorbed a roundhouse kick to the head that dropped him near the outlet and when rath allowed him to get to his feet he swayed drunkenly almost toppling as rath came in again the industrialist showed that last bit of reserve hed clutched a flicker of hatred that drilled diamond hard through the pain clutching raths jacket raeder threw himself into the pool mercer drew back as scorching water splashed his legs the two men remained submerged for no more than a few seconds and when they surfaced klaus raeder had yet to relinquish his grip their faces and hands had turned bright red and the water sluicing off them carried their topmost layers of skin they were boiling alive writhing to break free rath lost his footing and sank under again coming up when his boss no longer had the strength to hold him it was far too late to save himself the nazis eyelids were gone raths scream was something mercer would carry for the rest of his life so too would he forever remember the look of triumph on klaus raeders face as he collapsed back into the water pressing his apprentices body under the seething waves tendrils of flesh formed a sickening broth around the corpses a minute might have passed maybe an hour mercer became aware of time again only when he felt a touch on his shoulder he opened his eyes it was the dalai lama he had dragged himself over without his glasses his eyes were squinted and watery where are you hurt he asked everywhere but my conscience mercer managed a tired smile are you all right i believe so yes the buddhist replied i wish i could have stopped them mercer rolled his head to stare into the boiling pool the man who saved you had a karmic debt that only his death could pay i think its better you didnt either the lama agreed or was too played out to respond mercer wasnt sure the silence between them punctuated by the muffled alarms still sounding from the isopentane explosion continued until battledressed soldiers appeared from the mist like wraiths they swarmed over the facility in squads of four barrels of their mas in constant sweeping motion a trio of medics approached mercer and the lama however another figure beat them to the wounded pair anika kleins expression showed a mix of concern and clinical professionalism the soldiers must have already known her medical background because they deferred to her as she checked her patients i thought you didnt make house calls mercer croaked and i was going to give up flying too she agreed rolling him to examine the bloody wound in his leg but the italian navy got their helicopter running again and i knew youd need a doctor what about ira and the hostages theyre fine ira has already been airlifted to reykjavik along with mr and mrs farquar cardinal peretti was unharmed stop worrying about the others she used scissors from one of the medics bags to cut away his pants while they concentrated on the dalai lama her fingers were sure and quick this isnt too bad we found whats left of greta and the other two georesearch guys where are rath and raeder still fighting in hell i would think he slurred anika flashed a penlight in his eyes looks like youve got a slight concussion im surprised thick skull like yours her tone was teasing youre losing points for bedside manner hows this then and she leaned over to kiss him lightly does that mean im forgiven no it means that i understand you a little better her eyes softened as two stretcher bearers approached she whispered and i still like what i see epilogue the secret service agent examined mercers passport and the videocassette in the large envelope he carried before waving him toward the town house the summer sun beat on the narrow vienna street gilding many of the architectural details of the baroque and rococo buildings to mercer the temperature felt like a sweet caress after so many freezing days he climbed the couple of steps to the institute of applied research moving slowly because hed abandoned his cane in iceland an elderly housekeeper opened the door before he knocked she stepped aside wordlessly but her expression was one of displeasure knowing who was already here mercer couldnt blame her he paused in the entryway the tumult of books hanging from every wall and teetering on every surface overloaded him like a child at christmas he loved books collected them and treasured them the way others accumulated fine wine or stamps or antiques his collection ran toward old texts on geology and the earth sciences and first editions written by the pioneers in those fields but any old book gave him a sense of excitement it was the thrill of knowing that within their covers was information he didnt have a detail or an observation hed never made he loved their unique power to humble and enlighten at the same time seeing the material anikas grandfather had accumulated reminded him that in a few months hed be in paris for an auction of journals written by the french engineers whod failed in their nineteenthcentury attempt to cut a sealevel canal across panama he wanted the diary of baron godin de lepinay the first man to propose the lakeandlock solution that was eventually built mercer had an eccentric friend who was convinced the journal contained the last clue to the whereabouts of a treasure stolen from the spanish main and was willing to pay for half the book just to make a copy frau goetz indicated that everyone was in a dining room at the back of the town house he heard a pendulum clock chopping at time like the rest of the building the dining room was lined with shelves and the books once covering the wooden table had been stacked around the rooms perimeter with the door to the garden closed everything smelled musty and accented with pipe tobacco on the floor in front of the glass door was an apparatus for creating random sound vibrations to defeat laser microphones and since the director of the central intelligence agency had brought a security contingent to this meeting mercer assumed the house had already been swept for other types of listening devices the dci paul barnes was in his late fifties with graystreaked hair and a constant expression of irritation his intense eyes werent enough to draw attention from the bulbous mole that sat in the crease where his nose joined his face the mole appeared raw from constant rubbing mercer knew barnes to be a political infighter who spent a great deal of time on damage control in front of the congressional intelligence committees uniformly agreed to be the worst of the presidents appointments he didnt have the proper background to effectively head americas premier spy agency and fought tenaciously to maintain his position seeing mercer his eyes went tight the animosity between them stemmed from mercers successful involvement with several recent crises that barnes should have handled anika klein was sitting between two elderly gentlemen in somber ties and worn shirts one he assumed was her grandfather jacob eisenstadt and the other his research partner theodor weitzmann mercer grinned when he saw her she leapt to her feet quicker than shed intended paused to smooth her black skirt and crossed to plant a chaste kiss on his cheek she wore no makeup and was dressed modestly out of respect for her grandfather yet her attempt to stifle her sexuality only made mercer more aware of it i cant believe the doctors in reykjavik released you she regarded the bruising on mercers face and the sunken hollows that hid his eyes only four days had passed since gunther raths defeat mercers left arm was in a sling for a sprained wrist and he walked with a noticeable limp they didnt i checked myself out as soon as you left iceland if id known you lacked the good sense to stay in the hospital i wouldnt have come here she introduced him to eisenstadt and weitzmann who shook his hand in turn it is good to meet you eisenstadt rumbled in his accented english mercer and he had spoken on the phone a few times when the details of this meeting had been hammered out my pleasure sir the elderly researcher matched mercers impression solid and apparently humorless he had a formal grace lost to younger generations and a sagacity that commanded instant respect frau goetz put coffee and a glass of water at a place open for mercer he caught her scrutiny and her approving nod to anika anika shook her head slightly then smiled before making a slight gesture with her hand as if to say maybe she blushed when she noted that mercer had seen the exchange barnes sighed since were all here we can get this over with hed made no gesture to greet mercer properly thanks to ira laskos efforts from his hospital room in reykjavik mercer had learned that barnes had spent a very long afternoon in the white house the chief executive was furious with barnes for how hed handled this affair and mercer understood that barnes was under orders to make any concession necessary to set things right hed even been forced to vienna to accommodate eisenstadt and weitzmann rather than hold this meeting in washington essentially barnes was here to agree to whatever mercer asked for mercer would have flaunted his control over the dci had he not gained some perspective in the past few days instead he savored knowing he held all the cards and allowed barnes a measure of dignity mr barnes i want to thank you for agreeing to come here today mercer began perpetuating the illusion that the dci still had a choice and i especially want to acknowledge your efforts camouflaging what happened aboard the sea empress i sense your hand in the cover story about a terrorist attack in which all the hijackers were killed by the ships security personnel it fit close enough to the facts to convince the media barnes acknowledged if he was relieved that mercer wasnt rubbing in his errandboy status he didnt show it we effectively blacked out information about the fighting at the blue lagoon and the svartsengi power plant saying it was a pressure explosion that rained debris on the adjoining spa your government will pay to repair the facilities anika asked plus a little extra for the families of the fishermen murdered in grindavik barnes nodded thats how we got the cooperation of the local authorities that takes care of those on the periphery mercer said but there are a number of people more directly involved who cant be silenced so easily thats why im here barnes folded his hands on the table preparing himself for the negotiations to discuss the terms for your cooperation this wont be a discussion mr barnes mercers tone sharpened reminding barnes of his role a dozen innocent people are dead because of this and you have an obligation to them and their survivors ive compiled a list he still suffered from the emotional hangover of writing the names especially scarred by elisebet rosmunders who would have been alive if he hadnt spoken with her before we get to specifics there are a few things i want to know first beginning with charlie bryce and the surveyors society and their relationship to the cia barness eyes swept the others around the table this isnt the time or the place to talk about that if there is a relationship which im not saying there is it would be classified mercer ignored barness security concerns until were all satisfied there arent going to be any secrets anika knows how i got involved in this expedition so shes already drawn some inferences ive also made mr eisenstadt and mr weitzmann aware that i was approached by the society to help ira lasko one of your agents do you want to leave us believing that the surveyors society is a cia front although this was a minor point barnes still resented sharing anything they arent a front the surveyors society does he searched for the right word favors for us you may recall bryces speech about the three kinds of explorers real ones armchair ones and those who pay others to explore for them lets just say that the cia falls into the latter category when we need certain deniable operations carried out and you pay them why do you think every school in the nation pays twice the normal subscription price for their magazine a black budget subsidy exactly by the way ira doesnt work directly for the cia he was seconded to us for this mission from the white house he already told me in fact hes trying to talk me into accepting a job there special science advisor to the president or something mercer wasnt sure if hed accept but he was honored if its any consolation barnes added bryce wasnt too pleased when i had him recruit you ill deal with charlie at another time mercer said were here to discuss what to do about each other and to handle the final disposition of the remaining pandora box and an icon belonging to a russian priest they represent the last link to an unprecedented discovery as a scientist you must know the pandora fragments could contain untold knowledge about our universe and its creation barnes tried to press his point with a hard stare but mercer remained unfazed i doubt you believe in science for sciences sake mr barnes where are the fragments barnes leaned across the table in another effort to gain some psychological leverage when ira lasko was debriefed in the hospital he said he didnt know he lied because of the prior arrangements the old nazi hunters had brought their small television and vcr into the dining room mercer slid the cassette into the tape slot and waited while frau goetz pressed the correct buttons to bring up the picture this footage was taken yesterday the image on the screen was bouncy and the audio was filled with a deep thrumming rattle the watchers quickly realized that the video had been taken aboard a speeding helicopter the choppers side door was closed so the camera panned down through the scratchy window a thousand feet below the cold north atlantic surged with its unending rhythm they were high enough that the whitecaps looked like bits of string the frame jumped and suddenly mercer was shown sitting on the bench seat in the rear of the cargo chopper who took this barnes asked sharply ira wanted to be with us but couldnt get out of the hospital father anatoly vatutin ran the camera mercer answered before the video image of himself bent forward to strip a tarp off a box sitting next to the door a golden reflection filled the dim interior of the chopper resting on the only remaining pandora box was another glittering relic the last of rasputins icons jacob eisenstadt grunted when he saw the box although hed already been warned what was on the tape his eyes were wet doubtlessly thinking about what the box represented the origin of that gold and all those whod died filling it barnes sucked in a quick breath he glanced at mercer trying to understand what was happening behind his gray eyes mercer gave a triumphant smile that told barnes everything you didnt the tape made mercers answer unnecessary father vatutin set aside the camera to open the cargo door and then refocused on mercer as he kicked the heavy icon out the door the camera image followed the antique as it pinwheeled toward the sea swallowed by distance before it was swallowed by the water barnes went pale with impotant rage next the tape showed mercer bracing his legs against the seat supports and levering his back against the twohundredpound pandora box vatutin had tightened his focus on the swastika adorning the side of the pandora box tracking it as mercer pushed it to the door pausing with the box on the edge of oblivion mercer addressed the camera shouting over the wind and the rotors steady beat the problem with any scientific discovery is that once something is known it cant be unlearned we cant forget how to make a nuclear bomb or poison gas nor can we prevent the propagation of that knowledge to use a cliche once the genies out of the bottle it cant be put back well this is one genie that im not going to let escape the military applications of pandora radiation far outweigh any potential scientific use a russian madman realized that a hundred years ago and hid the truth until a german madman nearly succeeded in unleashing pandoras destructive potential one again now its my turn to end this once and for all what gives you the right barnes shouted at mercer no one gave it to me mercers voice was steel thanks to what youve put me through in the past weeks ive earned it everyones focus returned to the television as the chopper banked over aiding mercers final effort to heave the pandora box into the rolling swells far from where anyone would find it again father vatutin one of the two remaining members of the brotherhood of satans fist videotaped the object of his lifelong quest until it was gone from the helicopters altitude the splash appeared puny an anticlimactic end to such a malignant artifact the screen turned to electronic snow as the drama came to an end eisenstadt reached over to shut off the television thank you dr mercer for showing me that and thank you for including me in your decision to destroy the last of the gold i had been searching for once anatoly vatutin explained that it was his group in russia feeding theodor and me information about the shipment and told me what the nazis had used it for there was no other alternative the financial loss to living jews is painful but unavoidable mercer acknowledged the compliment but continued to study barnes sensing the machinations already churning in his head if youre thinking that you can return to the site where the rotorstat went down and retrieve the rest of the boxes forget it i cant stop you from recovering them but i know every top scientist you would use to analyze the meteorite fragments including the people at sandia and livermore labs the instant i find anyone is working on pandora im going to bury you is that the price of your silence barnes knew the threat wasnt an idle one nodding slowly mercer was too emotionally drained to summon outrage at the dcis intrinsic duplicity hed expected no less and what about the others what will their cooperation cost jacob eisenstadt pointed a gnarled finger like an old testament prophet you must know that receiving our cooperation does not mean you also get our approval his voice thundered however if kohls entire board of directors is replaced and the company agrees to pay double what the jewish reconciliation commission is asking for theodor and i will let this matter drop barnes rocked back from the verbal broadside but answered quickly the german government has been cooperative so far the njoerd has been impounded and those crewmen loyal to rath will be prosecuted the innocent sailors members of georesearch from before kohl bought the company are being released after signing secrecy agreements in order to keep this as quiet as possible i see no reason why they wont compel kohl to agree to your request though hed received the answer he wanted the old nazi hunter didnt look happy mercer doubted hed ever be truly at peace is that it barnes prompted into the silence not quite mercer pulled a sheet of paper from his pocket hilda brandt wants enough money to start her own restaurant in hamburg once hes recovered from his injuries erwin puhl wants a permanent staff job at mcmurdo station in antarctica to continue his weather research father vatutin is asking for the funding to rebuild a particular church in st petersburg marty bishop disappeared as soon as the sea empress put in to reykjavik his fights with his father not you so i doubt hell make any demands what about you dr klein what do you want she gave mercer a significant look im all set thanks they spent a further twenty minutes hammering out details barnes capitulating on each and every point after barnes left the institute anika invited mercer out for a drink asking him to give her a moment to say goodbye to her grandfather he was left waiting for fifteen minutes ready she announced when she came out of the dining room a large bag over her shoulder outside the afternoon light made her hair glisten like polished anthracite she walked with an infectious bounce that mercer wished he could keep up with he was thinking that maybe he shouldnt have abandoned the cane given to him in iceland seemed like a long time to say goodbye were only going to a bar arent we she gave him a mocking look youre not very bright are you not usually no i have to be back to work in a week and i wont have any vacations for a while rededicating yourself to medicine ive learned that playing at danger isnt the same as actually experiencing it there will be no more rockclimbing expeditions im returning to the hospital and kissing my bosss backside until my lips go numb ive had all the excitement i want my sentiments exactly but whats that got to do with getting a drink anika stopped them on the street he stood a head taller than her but the force of her personality made the physical difference all but disappear there was a mischievous gleam in her eyes im in the mood for wine and a certain american geologist i know promised me a couple of days in the loire valley i was saying goodbye to my grandfather because youre taking me to france i am mercer was both stunned and delighted he had already booked an evening flight back to the states you are she started walking again taking his hand and turning away so he couldnt see the flush rushing up her throat do you remember how i told you i get drunk on a single glass of wine i have to warn you that when im tipsy i usually get aroused too mercers heart tripped and suddenly his aches didnt bother him so much when he found his voice he stammered i consider myself warned they went off to restore each others spirit so that at least this one episode wouldnt haunt their dreams and after their first night together in a quaint guest house perfumed by vineyards they knew it wouldnt
