lois mcmaster bujold memory chapter one miles returned to consciousness with his eyes still closed his brain seemed to smolder with the confused embers of some fiery dream formless and fading he was shaken by a fearful conviction that he had been killed again till memory and reason began to place this shredded experience his other senses tried to take inventory he was in nullgee his short body stretched out flat strapped to a surface and swathed in what felt like a thin foil med wrap standard military issue wounded all limbs seemed present and accounted for he was still wearing the soft bodysuit that had lined his nowmissing space armor the straps were not tight the complex scent of manytimesrefiltered air cool and dry tickled his nostrils he secretly snaked an arm free careful not to rattle the wrap and touched his bare face no control leads no sensorsno bloodwhere are my armor my weapons my command headset the rescue mission had been going as smoothly as such missions ever did he and captain quinn and their patrol had penetrated the hijackers ship found the brig blasted through to the captured barrayaran impsec courier officer lieutenant vorberg still alive though addled with sedatives the medtech had pronounced the hostage clear of mechanical or chemical boobytraps and theyd begun the exhilarating trip through the dark corridors back to the waiting dendarii combat shuttle the hijackers very much occupied elsewhere had made no attempt to jump them what went wrong the sounds around him were quiet the bleep of equipment the hiss of atmosphere recycling on normal operation the murmur of voices one low animal moan miles licked his lips just to be sure that noise wasnt coming from himself he might not be wounded but somebody nearby was not in good shape a tangy whiff of antiseptics escaped filtration he slitted open his eyes prepared to play unconscious again and think fast if he found himself in enemy hands the sounds around him were quiet the bleep of equipment the hiss of atmosphere recycling on normal operation the murmur of voices one low animal moan miles licked his lips just to be sure that noise wasnt coming from himself he might not be wounded but somebody nearby was not in good shape a tangy whiff of antiseptics escaped filtration he slitted open his eyes prepared to play unconscious again and think fast if he found himself in enemy hands only one casualty miles corrected his thought a violent headache throbbed at the base of his brain but he bore no plasma arc burns no nervedisrupter paralysis no intravenous tubing or hypospray injector pierced his body pumping in blood replacements or synergine against shock he did not float in a narcotic haze of painkillers and no pressure bandages hampered his slight movements no senseblockers the headache felt like a poststun migraine how the hell could i have been stunned through combat armor the dendarii medtech still combatarmored but with helmet and gloves off turned and saw miless open eyes youre awake sir ill notify captain quinn he hovered briefly over miless face and flashed a light into his eyes doubtless checking for abnormal pupil response how long was i out what happened you had some kind of seizure or convulsion no apparent cause the field kit test for toxins didnt turn up anything but its pretty basic well go over you more thoroughly as soon as were back to the ships sick bay not dead again worse this is still more of the leftovers from the last time oh hell what have i done what have they seen he would rather have beenwell no he would not rather have been nervedisrupted but almost how long miles repeated the seizure seemed to last four or five minutes it had certainly taken more than five minutes to get from there to here then youve been unconscious for about a half hour im afraid admiral naismith hed never been out so long before this was the worst attack ever by far hed prayed the last one would be the last one over two months had passed since his previous unwitnessed brief collapse dammit hed been certain the new medication had worked he made to free himself fighting out of the heat wrap and bunk straps please dont try to get up admiral i have to go forward and get reports the medtech placed a cautious hand upon his chest and pressed him back onto the bunk captain quinn ordered me to sedate you if you tried to get up sir miles almost barked and i countermand that order but they did not seem to be in the midst of combat now and the tech had a medically steely look in his eye of a man prepared to do his duty whatever the risks save me from the virtuous is that why i was out so long was i sedated no sir i only gave you synergine your vital signs were stable and i was afraid to give you anything else till i had some better idea what we were dealing with what about my squad are we all out the barrayaran hostage did we get him out all right everybody got out all right the barrayaran um will live i retrieved his legs theres a good chance the surgeon will be able to reattach them the medtech glanced around as if seeking comradely assistance what how was he injured uh ill call captain quinn for you sir you do that growled miles the medtech ducked away into free fall and murmured urgently into an intercom on the far wall he returned to his patientlieutenant vorberg ivs were pumping plasma and medications into the man through sites on both an arm and his neck the rest was concealed by heat foil at a lightsignal from the forward bulkhead the medtech hastily strapped himself into his station jump seat and the shuttle went through a quick series of accelerations decelerations and attitude adjustments in preparation for locking on to its mother ship properly upon docking the injured hostage was rushed out first in two parts miles gritted his teeth in dismay at the sight of the soldier clutching a large coldcontainer who followed the medtech and float pallet there did not seem to be much blood smeared around though miles had just given up waiting for quinn and was releasing himself from his medical restraints when she appeared from the flight deck and floated down the aisle toward him she had doffed the helmet and gloves from her space armor and pulled back her bodysuits hood to free her dark sweatflattened curls her beautifully sculpted face was pale with tension her brown eyes dark with fear but his little threeship fleet could be in no immediate danger or she would be attending to it not to him are you all right she asked hoarsely quinn whatno give me a general status report first green squad got the hijacked ships crew out all of them there was a bit of equipment damagethe insurance companys not going to be as ecstatic as the last timebut our life bonus is safe and warm praise be to god and sergeant taura and our hijackers we took their big ship and nineteen prisoners three enemy killed all secured there our prize crew is aboard cleaning up six or eight of the bastards escaped in their jumppinnance its weak on armamentthis far from the nearest jump point the ariel can overtake them at our leisure your decision whether to stand off and blow them up or attempt capture miles rubbed his face interrogate those prisoners if this is the same bloodyhanded lot that took the solera last year and murdered all the passengers and crew vega station will pay a reward and we can collect three times for the same mission since the vegans are offering the same reward for the proof of their deaths record everything carefully well demand surrender once he sighed i take it things did not run exactly according to plan again hey any hostagerescue ploy that gets everyone out alive is a success by any sane standard assuming our fleet surgeon doesnt reattach your poor barrayarans legs lefttoright or backwards this is a onehundredpercenter er yes what happened when i went down what happened to vorberg friendly fire unfortunately though it didnt seem all that friendly at the time you fell oversurprised the hell out of us your suit emitted a lot of garbage telemetry then your plasma arc locked on she raked her hands through her hair miles glanced at the heavyduty plasma arc built into the right arm of quinns space armor twin to his own his heart sank into his churning stomach oh no oh shit dont tell me im afraid so you kneecapped your own rescuee neat as could be right across both legs luckilyi guessthe beam cauterized as it sliced so he didnt bleed to death and he was so tanked on drugs im not even sure he felt much for a moment i thought some enemy had taken over remote control of your suit but the engineers swear that isnt possible anymore you blew out a bunch of wallsit took four of us to sit on your arm till we could take the medics canopener to your armor and get in and get you disconnected you were thrashing aroundyou damn near took us out too in pure desperation i stunned you on the back of your neck and you went limp i was afraid id killed you quinn was a little breathless describing this her lovely face was not after all the original but a replacement after her own violent encounter with plasma fire over a decade ago miles what the hell was going on with you i think i had some kind of seizure like epilepsy except that it doesnt seem to leave any neurological tracks im afraid it might be an aftereffect from my cryorevival last year you know damned well it is he touched the twin scars on either side of his neck now grown faint and pale the lesser souvenirs of that event quinns emergency stunnertreatment explained his lengthy bout of unconsciousness and subsequent headache so the seizures were no worse than before oh dear said quinn but is this the first she paused and looked at him more closely her voice went flatter this isnt the first time youve done this is it the silence stretched miles forced himself to speak before it snapped it happened three or four or five times soon after i was brought back from stasis my cryorevival surgeon said they might go away on their own the way the memory loss and the shortness of breath have and after that they seemed to stop and impsec let you go out on a covert ops field mission with that kind of time bomb in your head impsec does not know miles elli he said desperately theyd pull me right off line duty you know they would nail my boots to the floor behind some desk at best medical discharge at worstand that would be the end of admiral naismith forever she froze stricken i figured if the seizures came back id try to solve em on my own i thought i had does anybody know not very many i didnt want to chance it getting back to impsec i told the dendarii fleet surgeon i swore her to secrecy we were working on a causal diagnosis havent got too far yet her specialtys trauma after all yes like plasma arc burns and limb reattachment at least lieutenant vorberg could not be in better or more experienced hands right now even if he could have been magically transported in an instant back to barrayars own imperial military hospital quinns lips tightened but you didnt tell me never mind our personal relationship im your second in command on this mission i should have told you obvious in hindsight blindingly quinn glanced up the fuselage of the shuttle where a medtech from the peregrine was wrestling a float pallet in through the hatch i still have some mopping up to supervise youre going to stay in the frigging sick bay till i get back right im back on track now it could be months till it happens again if ever right quinn repeated through her teeth with an open glare at him he thought of vorberg and deflated right he muttered thank you she hissed he scorned the float pallet insisting on walking but otherwise followed the medtech feeling horribly subdued im losing control of this as soon as miles arrived in sick bay an anxious tech administered a brain scan drew blood took samples of every fluid his body could be made to exude and rechecked every vital sign he possessed after that there was not very much to do but wait for the surgeon miles withdrew discreetly into a small examining room where his batman brought him his ship uniform the man seemed inclined to hover solicitously and miles irritated sent him away this left miles alone in a quiet room with nothing to do but think possibly a tactical error quinn could be trusted with the mopping up or why else had he made her his second she had taken over competently enough the last time he had been violently removed from his chain of command his chest blown out by that snipers needle grenade on the mission to jacksons whole he pulled up and fastened his gray trousers and studied his torso his fingers tracing the wide spidery burst of scars fading on his skin the jacksonian cryorevival surgeon had done a superb job his new heart and lungs and assorted other organs were nearly fully grown now entirely functional with the latest additions the brittle bones that had plagued him since his defective birth were almost completely replaced by synthetics throughout his body the cryosurgeon had even straightened his spine while she was at it there was barely a hint left of the hunchback curvature that along with his dwarfish stature had made his fellow barrayarans snigger mutant when they thought he could not hear hed even gained a couple more centimeters in height out of the deal an expensive little bonus but it mattered to him the fatigue didnt show to the outward eye he was in better physical shape than hed ever been in his nearly thirty years of life theres just one little hitch of all the threats that had ever shadowed his hardwon career this was the most elusive the least expected the most fatal hed worked with impassioned concentration overcoming all doubts as to his physical disabilities winning his way to premier status as barrayaran imperial securitys most creative galactic affairs agent where the barrayaran empires regular forces could not reach past barriers of politics and distance in the chaining network of wormhole jump routes that strung the galaxy together a supposedly independent mercenary outfit might pop up unimpeded miles had spent a decade perfecting his cover identity of admiral naismith selfstyled leader of the dendarii free mercenary fleet daring rescues our specialty such as the current mission the grotty crew of hijackers had run seriously out of luck the day theyd stolen an unarmed freighter of zoave twilights planetary registry and found what they thought was the prize in the package in the form of a barrayaran imperial courier covertly transporting credit chits and vital diplomatic information if theyd had any sense of selfpreservation at all they should have returned lieutenant vorberg and his packets undamaged and unexamined immediately to the nearest droppoint with profuse apologies instead theyd tried to sell him to the highest bidder slay them all impsec chief simon illyan had muttered the devil will recognize his own then hed delegated the details to miles the emperor did not approve of unauthorized persons impeding his couriers or torturing them or attempting to market them like highinformationdensity slabs of meat this was one mission where although the dendarii fleets official sponsor was the insurance company covering the zoave twilight ship it wouldnt hurt to reveal that their cobacker was the barrayaran empire good publicity for the protection of the next courier to run into similar bad luck assuming it was luck miles itched to go oversee the interrogation of the prisoners illyans second sharpest concern after the retrieval of vorberg alive was to determine if the courier had been kidnapped by accident or on purpose if on purpose somebody had some internal investigating to do in all miles was extremely glad that sort of messy job did not fall into his area of expertise the surgeon still dressed in her sterile garb entered at last she put her hands on her hips stared at miles and sighed she looked tired hows the barrayaran miles ventured will um he recover hes not too bad the cuts were very clean and luckily just below the knee joints which saved a world of complications hell be about three centimeters shorter after this miles winced but hell be on his feet by the time he gets home she added assuming that takes about six weeks ah good but suppose the random blare of the plasma arc had taken vorberg through the knees or about a meter higher cutting him in half there were limits to the miracles even his dendarii surgical expert could perform it would not have been a career high point after miles had airily assured his impsec chief that he could rescue vorberg with scarcely a ripple in his routine to return him packed in a body bag two body bags miles felt faint with a weird mixture of relief and horroroh god im going to hate explaining this to illyan the surgeon studied miless scans muttering medical incantations were still on baseline here no obvious abnormalities show up the only way i can get any leverage into this is to have you monitored while you undergo an attack hell i thought we did every kind of stress and electroshock and stimulus known to science to try to trigger something in the lab i thought the pills you gave me had brought it under control the standard anticonvulsant were you taking it properly she eyed him suspiciously yes he bit back more profane protestations have you thought of something else to try no which is why i gave you that monitor to wear around her glance around the examining room did not disclose the device where is it in my cabin her lips thinned in exasperation let me guess you werent wearing it at the time it didnt fit under my combat armor her teeth clenched couldnt you have at least thought toto disable your weapons i could hardly be of use to my squad in an emergency disarmed i might as well have stayed aboard the peregrine you were the emergency and you certainly should have stayed aboard the peregrine or back on barrayar but securing vorbergs person had been the most critical part of the operation and miles was the only dendarii officer impsec entrusted with the barrayaran imperial recognition codes i he bit his tongue on futile defenses and started over you are quite correct it wont happen again until we get this straightened out what do we do next she opened her hands ive run every test i know obviously the anticonvulsant isnt the answer this is some kind of idiosyncratic cryonic damage on a cellular or subcellular level you need to get your head to the highestpowered cryoneurology specialist you can find he sighed and shrugged into his black tee shirt and gray uniform jacket are we done for now i urgently need to supervise prisoner interrogation i suppose she grimaced but do us all a favor dont go armed yes maam he said humbly and fled chapter two miles sat before the secured comconsole in his cabin aboard the flagship peregrine composing what seemed like his thousandth classified field report to the chief of barrayaran imperial security simon illyan well it wasnt the thousandth that was absurd he couldnt have averaged more than three or four missions a year and hed been at it less than a decade really since the vervain invasion adventure had made it all official less than forty assignments but he could no longer name the actual number offhand without stopping to think and add them all up and it wasnt an effect of lingering cryoamnesia either keep organizing boy his personal synopsis needed to be no more than a brief guide to the appendices of raw data drawn from the dendarii fleets own files illyans intelligence analysts liked having lots of raw data to chew upon it kept them occupied down in their little cubicles in the bowels of impsec headquarters at vorbarr sultana and entertained too miles sometimes feared the peregrine the ariel and the rest of admiral naismiths select battle group now orbited the planet of zoave twilight his fleet accountant had turned in a busy couple of days settling up with the insurance company who finally had their freighter and crew back applying for salvage fees for the hijackers captured ships and filing the official claims for bounty to the vega station embassy miles entered the costsreturns spreadsheets in full into his report as appendix a the prisoners had been dumped downside for the vegan and zoavan governments to divide between thempreferably in the same sense as poor vorberg had been the exhijackers were a vile crew miles was almost sorry the pinnace had surrendered appendix b was copies of the dendarii recordings of the prisoner interrogations the downside governments would get an edited version of these with most of the barrayarspecific queries and answers deleted lots of criminal testimony of little direct interest to impsec though the vegans ought to be pretty excited about it the important thing from illyans point of view was that no evidence had been extracted which would indicate that the kidnapping of the barrayaran courier was anything but an accidental side effect of the hijacking unlessmiles made sure to note this in his synopsisthat information had been known only to those hijackers who had been killed since that number included both their socalled captain and two of the higherranking officers there were enough possibilities in this direction to keep illyans analysts earning their pay but that lead must now be traced from the other end through the house hargraves representatives who had been trying to handle the sale or ransom of the courier for the hijackers miles hoped cordially that impsec would focus its best negative attentions upon the jacksonian semicriminal great house though house hargravess agents had been extremely if unwittingly useful in helping the dendarii set up their raid illyan ought to like the accountants report the dendarii had not only succeeded in keeping their costs under budget this timefor a change they had made a truly amazing profit illyan who had been willing to spend imperial marks like water on the principle of the thing had got his courier officer retrieved effectively for free are we good yes sowhen was the soefficient impsec lieutenant lord miles vorkosigan finally going to get that longedfor promotion to captain odd how miless barrayaran rank still seemed more real to him than his dendarii one true he had proclaimed himself an admiral first and then earned it later instead of the more normal other way around but at this late date no one could say he had not really become what he had once pretended to be from the galactic point of view admiral naismith was solid all the way through everything he advertised himself as being he really was now his barrayaran identity was simply an extra dimension an appendix theres no place like home i didnt say there was nothing better i just said there was nothing likeit this brought him to appendix c which was the dendarii combat armor recordings of the actual penetration and hostage retrieval sequences sergeant tauras green squad and its rescue of the freighters crew and his own blue squad and that whole chain of events in full sound and color with all their suits medical and communications telemetry morbidly miles ran through all the realtime records of his seizure and its unfortunate consequences suit s vid recording had some really great closeups of lieutenant vorberg shocked from his doped stupor screaming in agony and toppling unconscious in one direction while his severed legs fell in the other miles found himself bent over clutching his chest in sympathy this was not going to be a good time to pester illyan for a promotion the convalescent vorberg had been handed over yesterday to the barrayaran counsels office on zoave twilight for shipment home through normal channels miles was secretly grateful that his covert status had let him off the hook for going into sick bay and personally apologizing to the man before the plasma arc accident vorberg had not seen miless face concealed as it had been by the combat armors helmet and afterwards of course the dendarii surgeon reported vorberg had only the haziest and most confused memory of his rescue miles wished he could delete the entire blue squad record from his report impractical alas having the most interesting sequence missing would draw illyans attention as surely as a signal fire on a mountaintop of course if he deleted the entire appendix all the squad records it would be camouflaged in the general absence miles considered what could replace appendix c he had written plenty of brief or vague mission synopses in the past in the press of events or exhaustion due to a malfunction the rightarm plasma arc in suit locked into the on position in the several minutes of confusion surrounding correcting the malfunction the subject was unfortunately hit by the plasma beam not his fault if the reader construed this as a malfunction in the suit and not its wearer no he could not lie to illyan not even in the passive voice i wouldnt be lying id just be editing my report for length it couldnt be done hed be sure to miss some tiny corroborative detail in one of the other files and illyans analysts would pick it up and then hed be in ten times the trouble not that there was that much in the other sections pertinent to this brief incident it wouldnt be that hard to run over the whole report this is a bad idea still it would be interesting practice he might have the job of reading field reports someday god forbid it would be educational to test how much fudging was possible for his curiositys sake he recorded the full report made a copy and began playing around with the copy what minimum alterations and deletions were required to erase a field agent s embarrassment it only took about twenty minutes he stared at the finished product it was downright artistic he felt a little sick to his stomach this could get me cashiered only if i got caught his whole life felt as if it had been based on that principle hed outrun assassins medics the regulations of the service the constraints of his vor rank hed outrun death itself demonstrably i can even move faster than you illyan he considered the present disposition of illyans independent observers in the dendarii fleet one was detached back with the fleets main body the second posed as a comm officer on the ariel neither had been aboard the peregrine or out with the squads neither could contradict him i think id better think about this for a while he classified the doctored version top secret and filed it beside the original he stretched to ease the ache in his back desk work did that to one his cabin door chimed yes baz and elena a womans voice floated through the intercom miles cleared his comconsole slipped his uniform jacket back on and released the door lock enter he turned in his station chair smiling a little to watch them come in baz was dendarii commodore baz jesek chief engineer of the fleet and miless nominal secondincommand elena was captain elena botharijesek bazs wife and current commander of the peregrine both were among the few fellow barrayarans the dendarii employed and both were fully apprised of miless dual identity as admiral naismith slightly renegade betan mercenary and lieutenant lord miles vorkosigan dutiful barrayaran impsec covert ops agent for both predated the creation of the dendarii fleet itself the lanky balding baz had been in on the beginning of it a deserter on the run whom miles had picked up and in his private opinion recreated elena was another matter altogether shed been miless barrayaran bodyguards daughter raised in count vorkosigans household and practically miless foster sister barred from barrayaran military service by her gender she had longed for the status of a soldier on her armymad homeworld miles had found a way to get it for her she looked all soldier now slim and as tall as her husband in her crisp dendarii undress grays her dark hair clipped in wisps around her ears framed pale hawk features and alert dark eyes so how might their lives have been different if she had only said yes to miless passionate confused proposal of marriage when they were both eighteen where would they be now living the comfortable lives of vor aristocrats in the capital would they be happy or growing bored with each other and regretting their lost chances no they wouldnt even know what chances they had lost maybe there would have been children miles cut off this line of thought unproductive yet somewhere suppressed deep in miless heart something still waited elena seemed happy enough with her choice of husband but a mercenarys lifeas he had recent reason to knowwas chancy indeed a little difference in some enemys aim somewhere along the line might have turned her into a grieving widow awaiting consolation except that elena saw more line combat than baz did as an evil plot brooded upon in the recesses of miless mind in the secrecy of the nightcycle this one had a serious flaw well one couldnt help ones thoughts one could help opening ones mouth and saying something really stupid though hi folks pull up a seat what can i do for you miles said cheerfully elena smiled back and the two officers arranged station chairs on the other side of miless comconsole desk there was something unusually formal in the way they seated themselves baz opened his hand to elena to cede her the first word sure sign of a tricky bit coming up miles pulled himself into focus she began with the obvious are you feeling all right now miles oh im fine good she took a deep breath my lord another sure sign of something unusual when she addressed him in terms of their barrayaran liege relationship we wish to resign her smile confusingly crept wider as if shed just said something delightful miles almost fell off his chair what why elena glanced at baz and he took up the thread ive received a job offer for an engineering position from an orbital shipyard at escobar it would pay enough for us both to retire i i didnt realize you were dissatisfied with your pay grades if this is about money something can be arranged it has nothing to do with money said baz hed been afraid of that no that would be too easy we want to retire to start a family elena finished what was it about that simple rational statement that put miles so forcibly in mind of the moment when the snipers needle grenade had blown his chest out all over the pavement uh as dendarii officers elena went on we can simply give appropriate notice and resign of course but as your liegesworn vassals we must petition you for release as an extraordinary favor um im not sure the fleets prepared to lose my two top officers at one blow especially baz i rely on him when im away as i have to be about half the time not just for engineering and logistics but to keep things under control to make sure the private contracts dont step on the toes of any of barrayars interests to know all the secrets i dont see how i can replace him we thought you could divide bazs current job in half said elena helpfully yes my engineering seconds quite ready to move up baz assured him technically hes better than i am younger you know and everyone knows youve been grooming elli quinn for years for command position elena went on shes itching for promotion and ready too i think she more than proved that last year shes not barrayaran illyan might get twitchy about that miles temporized in such a critical position he never has so far he knows her well enough by now surely and impsec employs plenty of nonbarrayaran agents said elena are you sure you want to formally retire i mean is that really necessary wouldnt an extended leave or a sabbatical be enough elena shook her head becoming parents changes people i dont know that id want to come back i thought you wanted to become a soldier with all your heart more than anything like me do you have any idea how much of all this was for you just for you i did i have im done i knowenough is not a concept you particularly relate to i dont know if the wildest successes would ever be enough to fill you up thats because i am so very empty but all my childhood all my youth barrayar pounded into me that being a soldier was the only job that counted the most important thing there was or ever could be and that i could never be important because i could never be a soldier well ive proved barrayar wrong ive been a soldier and a damned good one true and now ive come to wonder what else barrayar was wrong about like whats really important and who is really important when you were in cryostasis last year i spent a lot of time with your mother oh on a journey to a homeworld shed once sworn passionately never to set foot upon again yes we talked a lot she and i id always thought i admired her because she was a soldier in her youth for beta colony in the escobar war before she immigrated and married your father but once reminiscing she went into this sort of litany about all the things shed ever been like astrocartographer and explorer and ships captain and pow and wife and mother and politician the list went on and on there was no telling she said what she would be next and i thought i want to be like that i want to be like her not just one thing but a world of possibilities i want to find out who else i can be miles glanced covertly at baz who was smiling proudly at his wife no question her will was driving this decision but baz was quite properly elenas abject slave everything she said would go for him too rats dont you think you might want to come back after in ten fifteen twenty years said elena do you even think the dendarii mercenaries will still exist no i dont think ill want to go back ill want to go on i already know that much surely youll want some kind of work something that uses your skills ive thought of becoming a commercial shipmaster it would use most of my training except for the killingpeople parts im tired of death i want to switch to life im sure youll be superb at whatever you choose to do for a mad moment miles considered the possibility of denying their release no you cant go you have to stay with me technically you realize i can only release you from this duty i cant release you from your liege relationship any more than emperor gregor can release me from being vor not that we cant agree to ignore each others existences for extended periods of time elena gave him a kindly smile that reminded him quite horribly for a moment of his mother as if she were seeing the whole vor system as a hallucination a legal fiction to be edited at will a look of centered power not checking outside of herself for for anything it wasnt fair for people to go and change on him while his back was turned being dead to change without giving notice or even asking permission he would howl with loss except you lost her years ago this change has been coming since forever youre just pathologically incapable of admitting defeat that was a useful quality sometimes in a military leader it was a pain in the neck in a lover or wouldbe lover but wondering why he was bothering miles went through the proper vor forms with them each kneeling before him to place his or her hands between miless he turned his palms out and watched elenas long slim hands fly up like birds freed from some cage i did not know i had imprisoned you my first love im sorry well i wish you every joy miles went on as elena rose and took bazs hand he managed a wink name the first one after me eh elena grinned im not sure shed appreciate that milesanna milesia milesia sounds like a disease miles admitted taken aback in that case dont i wouldnt want her to grow up hating me in absentia how soon can we go asked elena we are between contracts the fleets scheduled for some downtime anyway everythings in order in engineering and logistics baz added for a change no postmission damage repairs delay no let it be done swiftly quite soon i expect ill have to notify captain quinn of course commodore quinn elena nodded shell like the sound of that she gave miles an unmilitary parting hug he stood still trying to breathe in the last lingering scent of her as the door whispered closed behind them quinn was attending to duties downside on zoave twilight miles left orders for her to report to him upon her return to the peregrine he called up dendarii fleet personnel rosters upon his comconsole while he waited and studied bazs proposed replacements there was no reason they shouldnt work out promote this man here move that one and that one to cover the holes he was not he assured himself in shock about this there were limits even to his capacity for selfdramatization after all he was a little unbalanced perhaps like a man accustomed to leaning on a decorative cane having it suddenly snatched away or a swordstick like old commodore koudelkas if it werent for his private little medical problem he would have to say the couple had chosen their timing well from the fleets point of view quinn blew in at last trim and fresh in her undress grays bearing a codelocked document case since they were alone she greeted him with a nonregulation kiss which he returned with interest the barrayaran embassy sends you this love maybe its a winterfair gift from uncle simon we can hope he decoded and unlocked the case ha indeed its a credit chit interim payment for the mission just concluded headquarters cant know were done yethe must have wanted to make sure we didnt run out of resources in the middle of things im glad to know he takes personnel retrieval so seriously it might be me needing this kind of attention someday it was you last year and yes he does agreed quinn you have to give impsec that much credit at least they do take care of their own a very oldbarrayaran quality for an organization that tries to be so uptodate and whats this hm he fished the second item out of the case ciphered instructions for his eyes only quinn politely moved out of the line of sight and he ran it through his comconsole though her native curiosity couldnt help prompting a so orders from home congratulations complaints well huh he sat back puzzled short and uninformative whyd they bother to deepcode it i am ordered to report home in person to impsec hq immediately theres a scheduled government courier ship passing through tau ceti which will lay over and wait for meim to rendezvous with it by the swiftest possible means including commercial carrier if necessary didnt they learn anything from vorbergs little adventure it doesnt even say conclude mission and it just says come im to drop everything apparently if its that urgent it has to be a new mission assignment in which case why are they requiring me to spend weeks traveling home when ill just have to spend more weeks traveling right back out to the fleet a sudden icy fear gripped his chest unless its something personal my fathermy mother no if anything had happened to count vorkosigan presently serving the imperium as viceroy and colonial governor of sergyar the galactic news services would have picked it up even as far away as zoave twilight what happensquinn leaning against the far side of the comconsole desk found something interesting to study on her fingernailsif you collapse again while youre traveling not much he shrugged how do you know er she glanced up sharply i didnt know psychological denial could drop so many iq points over the side dammit youve got to do something about those seizures you cant just ignore them out of existence though apparently thats exactly what youve been attempting i was trying to do something i thought the dendarii surgeon could get a handle on it i was frantic to get back out to the fleet to a doctor i could trust well i can trust her all right but she says she cant help me now i have to think of something else you trusted her why not me miles managed a somewhat pathetic shrug the palpable inadequacy of this response drove him to add placatingly she follows orders i was afraid you might try to do things for my own good whether they were the things i wanted or not after a moment spent digesting this quinn went on a shade less patiently how about your own people the imperial military hospital at vorbarr sultana is nearly up to galactic medical standards these days he fell silent then said i should have done that last winter im committed to finding another solution now in other words you lied to your superiors and now youre caught im not caught yet you know what i have to lose he rose and circled the desk to take her hand before she started biting her nails they fell into an embrace he tilted his face back slipped an arm up around her neck and pressed her down to his level for a kiss he could feel the fear as suppressed in her as it was in him in her quick breathing and somber eyes oh miles tell themtell them your brains were still thawing out back then you werent responsible for your judgments throw yourself on illyans mercy quick before it gets any worse he shook his head any time up to last week that might have worked maybe but after what i did to vorberg i dont think it can get any worse i wouldnt have any mercy on a subordinate who pulled a trick like that why should illyan unless illyan isnt presented with the problem in the first place great and little gods youre not thinking you can still conceal this are you it drops out of this mission report quite neatly she pushed back from him aghast your brains did get frostbitten irritated he snapped illyan cultivates his reputation for omniscience quite carefully but its hype dont let those horuseye badgeshe mimed the impsec insignia by holding his circled thumb and fingers up to his eyes and peering through owlishlyaffect your mind we just try to look like we always know what were doing ive seen the secret files i know how screwed up things can really get behind the scenes that fancy memory chip in illyans brain doesnt make him a genius just remarkably obnoxious there are too many witnesses all dendarii missions are classified the troops wont blab except to each other the storys all over the ship halfgarbled people have asked me about it uh what did you tell them she shrugged a shoulder angrily ive been implying it was a suit malfunction oh good nevertheless theyre all here and illyans way over there a vast distance what can he learn except through what i tell him only halfvast quinns bared teeth had little in common with a smile come on use your reason i know you can if imp sec was going to catch this they should have done it months ago all the jacksonian evidence has obviously escaped them clean a pulse beat in her throat theres nothing reasonable about this have you lost your grip have you lost your frigging mind i swear to the gods you are getting as impossible to manage as your clonebrother mark how did mark jump into this discussion it was a bad sign warning of a precipitous downhill slide in the tone of the debate the three most ferocious arguments hed ever had with elli were all over mark all recently good god hed avoidedmostlytheir usual intimacy this mission for fear of her witnessing another seizure he hadnt thought he could explain one away as a really terrific new kind of orgasm had she been attributing his coolness to their lingering differences about his brother mark has nothing to do with this mark has everything to do with this if you hadnt gone downside after him you would never have been killed and you wouldnt have been left with some damned cryonic short circuit in your head you may think hes the greatest invention since the necklin drive but i loathe the fat little creep well i like the fat little creep somebody has to i swear you are frigging jealous dont be such a damned castiron bitch they were standing apart both with their fists clenched breathing hard if it came to blows hed lose in every sense instead he bit out baz and elena are quitting did you know that im promoting you to commodore and fleetsecond in bazs place pearson will take over as fleet engineer and you will also be brevet captain of the peregrine till you make rendezvous with the other half of the fleet the choice of the peregrines new commander will be your first staff appointment pick someone you think you can tr work with dismissed blast it that was not how hed intended to present quinn with her longedfor promotion hed meant to lay it at her feet as a great prize to delight her soul and reward her extraordinary effort not fling it at her head like a pot in the middle of a raging domestic argument when words could no longer convey the weight of ones emotions her mouth opened closed opened again and where the hell do you think youre going without me as a bodyguard she bit out i know illyan gave you the most explicit standing orders that youre not to travel alone without one how much more career suicide do you think you need in this sector a bodyguard is a formality and a waste of resources he inhaled ill take sergeant taura that ought to be enough bodyguard to satisfy the most paranoid impsec boss and shes certainly earned a vacation oh you it was seldom indeed that quinn ran out of invective she turned on her heel and stalked to the door where she turned back and snapped him a salute forcing him to return it the automatic door alas was impossible to slam but it seemed to shut with a snakelike hiss he flung himself into his station chair and brooded at his comconsole he hesitated then he called up the short mission file and ciphered it onto a security card he punched up the long versionand hit the erase command done he stuffed the ciphered report into the codelocked pouch tossed it onto his bed and rose to begin packing for the journey home chapter three the only two adjoining cabins left aboard the first tau cetibound jumpship heading out of zoave twilight happened to be premierclass luxury suites miles smiled at this misfortune and made a mental note to document the security necessity for illyans accountants preferably while pointing out what obscene profits the mission just completed had made he pottered about taking his time putting away his sparse luggage and waiting for sergeant taura to finish her meticulous security sweep the lighting and decor were serene the beds were spacious and soft the bathrooms individual and private and they didnt even have to go out for food unlimited room service was included in the stiff fare once the ship was spaceborne they would be in effect inhabiting their own private universe for the next seven days the rest of the trip home would be much less inviting at the tau ceti transfer station he would change uniforms and identities and step aboard the barrayaran government vessel in the persona of lieutenant lord miles vorkosigan impsec courier a modest young officer with the same rank and duties as the unlucky lieutenant vorberg he shook out his imperial undress greens and hung them up in a lockable cupboard along with the uniform boots their shine protected in a sealed bag courier officer always made an excellent coveridentity for miles s wideranging travels to and from the dendarii fleet a courier never had to explain anything on the debit side the company aboard the next ship would be allmale allmilitary and alas all barrayaran no bodyguard required sergeant taura could split off to return to the dendarii and miles would be left alone with his fellow subjects of the imperium from long experience he anticipated their reaction to him to his apparent undersized unfitness for his military duties theyd say nothing overtit would be obvious to them that he held this cushy couriers sinecure by virtue of some powerful nepotistic stringpulling on the part of his father the viceroy admiral count voretcetera it was exactly the reaction he desired to maintain his deep cover and lieutenant vorkosigan the dull would do nothing to correct their assumptions his own slursensitive antennae would fill in the blanks well maybe the crew would include men hed traveled with before used to him by now he locked the cupboard let lieutenant vorkosigan and all his troubles stay out of sight and out of mind for the next week he had more engaging concerns his belly shivered in anticipation sergeant taura returned at last and ducked her head through the open doorway between their two rooms all clear she reported no bugs found anywhere in fact no new passengers or cargo added at all since we booked passage weve just left orbit he smiled up and up at her his most unusual dendarii trooper and one of his best no surprise that she should be good at her job shed been genetically engineered for the task taura was the living prototype of a genetic design project of dubious morality conceived and carried out where else on jacksons whole theyd wanted a supersoldier and theyd assigned a research committee to carry out the project a committee consisting entirely of biological engineers and not one experienced soldier theyd wanted something spectacular to impress the client they had certainly achieved that when miles had first encountered her the sixteenyearold taura had reached her full adult height of eight feet all of it lean and muscular her fingers and toes were tipped with heavy claws and her outslung mouth made fierce with fangs that locked over her lips her body seemed to glow with the radiant heat of a burning metabolism that lent her unnatural strength and speed that and her tawny golden eyes gave her a wolfish air when fully concentrated upon her work her ferocious stare could cause armed men to drop their weapons and throw themselves flat on the floor a psychologicalwarfare effect miles had actually witnessed on one delightful occasion miles had long thought that she was one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen in her own way you just had to be able to see her properly and unlike his blurredtogether dendarii missions miles could enumerate every rare occasion they had ever made love from their very first encounter six seven years ago now from before he and quinn had ever become a couple in point of fact taura was some kind of very special first for him as he had been for her and that secret bond had never faded oh theyd tried to be good dendarii regs against crossrank fraternization were for the benefit of all to protect the rankers from exploitation and the officers from losing control of discipline or worse and miles had been quite determined as the young and earnest admiral naismith to set a good example for his troops a virtuous resolve that had slipped away somewhere after the umpteenth wevelostcountagain time he had been almost killed perhaps well if you couldnt be good at least you could be discreet very good sergeant he held out a hand to her you may as well take a breakfor the next seven days eh her face lit her lips drew back in a smile that fully exposed her fangs really she said her resonant voice thrilling really she trod over to him her muscled mass making the deck creak slightly beneath her dendarii combat boots and bent to exchange a promissory kiss her mouth as always was hot and exhilarating the fangs might be a subliminal trigger to that adrenaline rush but mostly it was just the sheer wonderful tauraness of her she was liferelishing experiencedevouring living in an eternal now and for very good reasons he forced his mind away from a descending swoop on that future or any other and curled his hand around the back of her head to loosen the neatly pinnedup braid of her mahogany hair ill freshen up she grinned breaking away after a time she twitched at her loosened gray uniform jacket enjoy the hell out of the bathing facilities he advised cordially its the most sybaritic setup ive seen since dyne stations ambassadorial baths he retreated to his own facility to ditch uniform and rank insignia and to engage in a pleasant ritual of leisurely preparation involving depilation cleanliness and cologne taura deserved the best she also deserved all the time she wanted seldom could she shed the stern sergeant and reveal that feminine self shyly hidden on the inside seldom indeed could she trust anyone to guard that vulnerability the fairy princess he thought of her we all have our secret identities it seems he dressed himself sarongfashion in a prewarmed fluffy towel and went to perch on his bed waiting alertly had she anticipated this private space together and if so what little garment would she bring out of her valise this time she would insist on trying out these wouldbe sexy numbers on him not seeming to realize how like a goddess she was already when dressed in nothing but her streaming hair well all right not streaming hair left to its own devices it tended to go stiff and uncooperative and frizzy tickling his nose but it looked good on her he hoped she had managed to lose the horrifying pink thing with the red feathers it had taken all his tact last time to get across the idea that perhaps the color and design choice did not compliment her best features without ever once intimating any fault in her taste or personal appearance she might be able to break him with one hand but he could kill her with a word never his own face lit with unabashed delight at her return she was wearing something creamcolored and sleek and shimmerysilky meters of fabric so fine one might with little effort draw it through a ring the goddesseffect was nicely enhanced her immense intrinsic dignity unimpaired oh splendid he caroled with unfeigned enthusiasm do you really think so she spun for him the silk floated outward along with a spicymusky scent that seemed to go straight up his nostrils to his backbrain with no intervening stops her bare toes did not click on the floorprudently she had trimmed and blunted all her nails before painting them with gold enamel hed have no hardtoexplain need for stitches or surgical glue this time she lay down beside him their ludicrous heightdifference obviated here at last they might fill their hunger for human or almosthuman touch until sated without interruption without comment he bristled defensively inside at the thought of anyone watching this of some abrupt surprised bark of laughter or sarcastic witticism was his edginess because he was breaking his own rules he didnt expect any outsider to understand this relationship did he understand it himself once he might have mumbled something about the thrill an obsession with mountain climbing the ultimate sex fantasy for a short guy later maybe something about a blow for life against death maybe it was simpler than that maybe it was just love he woke much much later and watched her as she slept it was a measure of her trust that his slight stirring did not bring her hyperawake as her genetically programmed drives usually rendered her of all her many and fascinating responses the fact that she slept for him was the most telling if one knew her inside story he studied the play of light and shadow over her long long ivory body halfdraped with their wellstirred sheets he let his hand flow along the curves a few centimeters from the surface buoyed by the feverish heat rising from her golden skin the gentle movement of her breathing made the shadows dance her breathing was as always a little too deep a little too fast he wanted to slow it down as if not her days but her inhalations and exhalations were numbered and when shed used them all up she was the last survivor of her fellow prototypes they had all been genetically programmed for short lives in part perhaps as a sort of failsafe mechanism in part perhaps in an effort to inculcate soldierly courage out of some dim theory that a short life would be more readily sacrificed in battle than a long one miles did not think the researchers had quite understood courage or life the supersoldiers had died fast when they died with no lingering years of arthritic old age to gradually wean them from their mortality they suffered only weeks months at most of a deterioration as fierce as their lives had been it was as if they were designed to go up in flame not down in shame he studied the tiny silver glints in tauras mahogany hair they had not been there last year shes only twentytwo for gods sake the dendarii fleet surgeon had studied her carefully and given her drugs to slow her ferocious metabolism she only ate as much as two men now not four year by year like pulling hot gold wire through a screen they had extended tauras life yet sometime that wire must snap how much more time a year two when he returned to the dendarii next time would she still be there to greet him with a proper hello admiral naismith in public and a most improper not to mention rude and raucous howdy lover in private its a good thing she loves admiral naismith lord vorkosigan couldnt handle this he thought a bit guiltily of admiral naismiths other lover the public and acknowledged quinn nobody had to explain or excuse being in love with the beautiful quinn she was selfevidently his match he was not exactly being unfaithful to elli quinn technically taura predated her and he and quinn had exchanged no vows no oaths no promises not for lack of asking hed asked her a painful number of times but she too was in love with admiral naismith not lord vorkosigan the thought of becoming lady vorkosigan grounded downside forever on a planet she herself had stigmatized as a backwater dirtball had been enough to send spacebred quinn screaming in the opposite direction or at least excusing herself uneasily admiral naismiths lovelife was some sort of adolescents dream unlimited and sometimes astonishing sex no responsibilities why didnt it seem to be working anymore he loved quinn loved the energy and intelligence and drive of her their shared passion for the military life she was one of the most wonderful friends hed ever had but in the end she offered him only sterility they had no more future together than did he and elena bound to baz or he and taura who is dying god i hurt it would be almost a relief to escape admiral naismith and return to lord vorkosigan lord vorkosigan had no sex life he paused so when had that happened that lack in his life rather a long time ago actually odd he hadnt noticed it before tauras eyes halfopened honeycolored glints she favored him with a sleepy fanged smile hungry he asked her confident of the answer uh huh they spent a pleasant few minutes studying the lengthy menu provided by the ships galley then punched in a massive order with taura along miles realized cheerfully he might get to try a bite of nearly everything with no embarrassing wasteful leftovers while waiting for their feast to arrive taura piled pillows and sat up in bed and regarded him with a reminiscent gleam in her gold eyes do you remember the first time you fed me yes in ryovals dungeons that repellent dry ration bar better rat bars than raw rats let me tell you i can do better now and how when people were rescued they ought to stay rescued wasnt that the deal and then we all live happily ever after right till we die but with this medical discharge threat hanging over his head was he so sure that it was taura who would go first maybe it would be admiral naismith after all that was one of my first personnel retrievals still one of the best in a sort of cockeyed way was it love at first sight for you mm no truthfully more like terror at first sight falling in love took oh an hour or so me too i didnt really start to fall seriously in love with you till you came back for me you do know that didnt exactly start out as a rescue mission an understatement hed been hired to terminate the experiment but you turned it into one its your favorite kind i think you always seem to be especially cheerful whenever youre running a rescue no matter how hairy things are getting not all the rewards of my job are financial i dont deny its an emotional kick to pull some desperate somebody out of a deep deep hole especially when nobody else thinks it can be done i adore showing off and the audience is always so appreciative well maybe not vorberg ive sometimes wondered if youre like that barrayaran fellow you told me about who went around giving everybody liver pates for winterfair cause he loved them himself and was always frustrated that no one ever gave him any i dont need to be rescued usually last years sojourn on jacksons whole having been a memorable exception except that his memory of it had a big threemonth blank in it mm not rescue exactly rescues consequence freedom you give freedom away whenever you can is it because its something you want yourself and cant have naw its the adrenaline high i crave their dinner arrived on two carts miles sent away the human steward at the door and he and taura busied themselves in a brief domestic bustle getting it all nicely arranged the cabin was so spacious the table wasnt even folddown but permanently bolted to the deck miles nibbled and watched taura eat feeding taura always made him feel strangely happy inside it was an impressive sight in its own right dont overlook those little fried cheese things with the spicy sauce he pointed out helpfully lots of calories in them im sure thanks a companionable silence fell broken only by steady munching contented he inquired she swallowed a bite of something meltingly delicious formed into a dense cake in the shape of a star oh yes he smiled she had a talent for happiness he decided living in the present as she so carefully did did the foreknowledge of her death ever ride upon her shoulder like a carrion crow yes of course it does but let us not break the mood did you mind when you found out last year that i was lord vorkosigan that admiral naismith wasnt real she shrugged it seemed right to me i always thought you ought to be some sort of prince in disguise hardly that he laughed god save me from the imperium amen or maybe he was lying now instead of then maybe admiral naismith was the real one lord vorkosigan put on like a mask naismiths flat betan accent fell so trippingly from his tongue vorkosigans barrayaran gutturals seemed to require an increasingly conscious effort anymore naismith was so easy to slip into vorkosigan so painful actuallyhe picked up the thread of their previous conversation confident that she would followfreedom is exactly what i dont want not in the sense of being aimless or or unemployed especially not unemployed its not free time that i wantthe present moment excepted he added hastily she nodded encouragement i want my destiny i guess to be or become as fully me as i possibly can hence the invention of admiral naismith to hold all those parts of himself for which there was no room on barrayar hed thought about it god knew a hundred times thought of abandoning vorkosigan forever and becoming just naismith kick free of the financial and patriotic shackles of impsec go renegade make a galactic living with the dendarii free mercenary fleet but that was a oneway trip for a vor lord to possess a private military force was high treason illegal as hell a capital crime he could never go home again once he went down that road above all he could not do that to his father thecountmyfather a name spoken all in one breath not while the old man lived and hoped all his oldbarrayaran hopes for his son he wasnt sure how his mother would react betan to the bone as she was even after all these years of living on barrayar shed have no objection to the principle of the thing but she didnt exactly approve of the military she didnt exactly disapprove either she just made it plain that she thought there were better things for intelligent human beings to do with their lives and once his father died miles would be count vorkosigan with a district and an important vote in the council of counts and duties all day long live father live long there were parts of himself for which admiral naismith held no place either speaking of memorable rescuestauras lovely baritone brought him back to the presenthows your poor clonetwin mark getting along now has he found his destiny yet at least taura didnt refer to his one and only sibling as the fat little creep he smiled at her gratefully quite well i think he left barrayar with my parents when they departed for sergyar stayed with them a bit then went on to beta colony my betan grandmother is keeping an eye on him for mother hes signed in at the university of silica same town as she lives instudying accounting of all things he seems to like it sort of incomprehensible i cant help feeling ones twin ought to share more of ones tastes than an ordinary sib maybe later in life youll grow more alike i dont think mark will ever involve himself with the military again no but maybe youll get interested in accounting he glanced up suspiciouslyoh good she was joking he could tell by the crinkle at the corners of her eyes but when they uncrinkled faint crows feet still tracked there as long as i never acquire his girth he sipped his wine mention of mark recalled jacksons whole and his cryorevival and all his secret problems that were presently spinning out in unwelcome consequence it also recalled dr durona his cryorevival surgeon had the refugee durona sisters actually succeeded in setting up their new clinic on escobar far from their unbeloved exhome mark ought to know he was still channeling money to them according to his last communication and if so were they ready to take on a new or rather old patient yet very very quietly he could take a long leave ostensibly to visit his parents on sergyar from sergyar it was only a short hop to escobar once there he could see rowan durona he might even be able to slip it past illyan even more openly feigning it was a trip to see a lover or at least slip it past the count even impsec agents were allowed grudgingly to have private lives though if illyan himself had one it was news to miles miles s brief love affair with rowan had been sort of a mistake an accident that had happened while he was still suffering from cryoamnesia but they had parted he thought on good terms might he persuade her to treat him yet make no records of it for impsec to find it could be done get his head fixed whatever the hell was wrong with it and go quietly on with no one the wiser right part of him was already beginning to regret not decanting both versions of his mission report to impsec onto ciphercards and saving the final decision for later when hed had a bit more time to think it through turn in the one eat the other but he was committed now and if he was committed he needed a better plan than trusting to luck escobar it was as soon as his schedule allowed extremely annoying that he wasnt being routed through escobar on this run home he sat back and regarded the triumphant litter of plates cups glasses and bowls crowding the table looking rather like a battle scene after well after taura had been through no more mopping up required he glanced past her silkdraped shoulder to their bed well milady a nap or something she followed his glance something then a nap she decided at your command he bowed vorishly sitting and rose to take her hand seize the night chapter four as was standard operating procedure for returning couriers an impsec groundcar and driver picked up miles at the military shuttleport outside vorbarr sultana and whisked him directly to impsec headquarters downtown he wished the driver would slow down or circle the block a few more times as hq loomed up around the last corner as if the frustrating weeks he had spent thinking about his dilemma aboard the government ship on the way home were not enough he didnt need more thought he needed action the driver passed the security checkpoint and pulled through the gates to the massive gray building vast and grim and foreboding the impression was not all due to miles s state of mind impsec hq was one of the ugliest buildings in vorbarr sultana tourists from the backcountry who might otherwise have been expected to avoid the place drove by just to look at it in honor of the interesting reputation of the architect whom legend had it had died insane after the abrupt eclipse of his patron emperor yuri the driver took miles past the daunting facade and around to the discreet side entrance reserved for couriers spies informers analysts secretaries janitors and others with real business in the place miles dismissed driver and car with a wave and stood in the autumn afternoon chill outside the door hesitating one last time he had a sinking conviction his carefully crafted plan was never going to work and even if it did work id have my head cranked over my shoulder forever waiting to be caught ex post facto no he would not go through with it he would turn in the doctored ciphercard yes hed left himself no choice there but then and before illyan had a chance to review the thricedamned thing he would give illyan his verbal report and tell him the exact truth he could feign that hed felt the news of his medical flaw was too hot to put on record even in cipher as if he were tossing the problem promptly and properly into illyans lap for decision it wasnt physically possible for miles to have made it home any faster anyway if he stood here in the cold any longer pretending to study the stylized granite monsters carved in low relief on the door lintelpressed gargoyles some wag had dubbed thema guard would come up and make polite and pointed inquiries at him determined he slid out of his military greatcoat and folded it neatly over his arm clutched the ciphercase to his green tunic and stepped inside the clerk at the desk checked him through the usual security id procedures without comment it was all very routine he left his coatwhich had never come from any military store but instead had been tailormade to fit his very nonstandard sizein the checkroom it was a measure of his security clearance that he was sent off without an escort to find his own way to illyans notveryaccessible office you had to go up two different lift tubes and down a third to get to that floor once hed arrived and passed through the last scanner in the corridor he found the door of the outer office open illyans secretary was at his desk talking with general lucas haroche head of domestic affairs the generals title always put miles in mind of a gigolo for bored wives but in fact it was one of the nastier and more thankless jobs in the service tracking wouldbe treason plots and antigovernment groups strictly on the barrayaran side his counterpart general allegre had the fulltime task of doing the same for restive conquered komarr miles usually dealt with the head of galactic affairs a much more exotic and evocative title in miless opinion on the rare occasions when he didnt deal with illyan directly but the ga was stationed on komarr and miles had been routed straight back to barrayar this time without stopping at the planet that guarded barrayars only jumppoint gateway to the wormhole nexus one must assume its urgent maybe it would even be urgent enough to divert illyans negative attentions from miless bad news hello captain hello general haroche as the supposedly junior officer present miles greeted them both with a vaguely directed salute which they returned as casually miles did not know illyans secretary well the man had held this critical position for about two years which gave miles at least six years seniority on him as an illyansatellite if one wanted to think of it in those terms the secretary held out his hand for the ciphercase your report good sign it in please i sort of wanted to hand this one to the boss personally miles nodded to illyans closed inner door cant today hes not in not in i expected there were some things i needed to add verbally ill pass them on for you as soon as he gets back will he be back soon i can wait not today hes out of town shit well reluctantly miles handed over the case to its proper recipient and pressed his palm four times to the comconsoles readpad to affirm and document delivery so did he leave any orders for me he must have known when i would arrive yes lieutenant you are to take leave until he calls you in i thought this was urgent or why rush me home on the first ship ive just had several weeks of time off cooped up on board what can i say the secretary shrugged occasionally impsec remembers it is the military hurry up and wait miles would get no unauthorized information out of him but if there was that much time his clever little plan to skin off to escobar for secret treatment so recently suppressed reared up out of the mire again leave huh do i have time and permission to visit my parents on sergyar im afraid not you are to hold yourself ready to report back here on a onehour notice youd better not depart the city at miless dismayed look he added sorry lieutenant vorkosigan not half as sorry as i am he was put forcibly in mind of his own sententious motto about no battle plan surviving first contact with the enemy well tell illyan id like to see him at his earliest convenience of course the secretary made a note and how are your parents lieutenant vorkosigan inquired general haroche cordially haroche was a graying man of fiftyodd who wore slightly rumpled undress greens miles liked haroches voice which was deep and rich and sometimes humorous with a faint provincial accent from the western districts that his years in the capital hadnt quite smoothed away haroches work had gained him a formidable reputation in impsecs inner circles though it was practically unknown to outsiders a dilemma miles appreciated he predated miles as a fixture at impsec hq by a year or so but a decade in haroches job miles reflected would give anybody gray hairs and stomach trouble too you probably have more recent information on them than i do sir i think my mail is chasing me back home from the drop at galactic affairs hq on komarr haroche turned his hands palmout and shrugged no not really illyan has split out sergyar from my department and created a separate department for sergyaran affairs equal with the komarran surely theres not that much for a separate department to do said miles the colonys less than thirty years old the population isnt even up to a million yet just barely put in the secretary haroche smiled a bit grimly i thought it was premature but what the illustrious viceroy count vorkosigan requests has a way of happening he halflidded his eyes as if casting miles a significant look dont you give me that nepotism crap haroche you know what my real work is and how well i do it sounds like another cushy impsec desk job to me the colonists are too busy working their tails off to foment rebellion maybe i ought to apply for it its already been filled im afraid by colonel olshansky oh ive heard hes a steady man sergyar is certainly in a critical strategic position in the wormhole nexus but i thought that aspect came under galactic affairs illyans looking to the future i suppose miles sighed i guess i may as well go on home the office can find me at vorkosigan house when it decides it wants me the secretarys lips stretched in a sinister smile oh we can find you wherever you are it was an impsecish injoke miles laughed dutifully and escaped miles arrived at the last lifttube foyer on the way back to the exit simultaneously with a captain in undress greens a darkhaired middleaged fellow with intense hooded nutmegbrown eyes and a fleshy blade of a nose sweeping down his roman profile a familiar but entirely unexpected face duv galeni said miles what are you doing here well hello miles galeni smiled as much as galeni ever smiled a pleased grimace he was a little older and a little thicker than when miles had last seen him but seemed relaxed and confident working of course i requested reassignment here last we met you were doing that stint in counterintelligence on komarr is this a promotion did you develop a sudden hankering for desk work over field work did you come to bask in the somewhat radioactive glow from the centers of imperial power all of the above plus galeni glanced around as if to be sure they were alone what secret was so sensitive it must be whispered here in the very center of the labyrinth theres this woman good god that sounds like one of my cousin ivans lines you a woman and what dont you dare hoot at me dont you still have that ah enviable arrangement with the formidable quinn miles controlled a wince thinking of his and quinn s last argument more or less he had to get back and fix it with quinn at his earliest opportunity shed relented enough to come to see him off at the peregrines shuttle hatch but their goodbyes had been formal and strained there you go said galeni tolerantly shes a komarran from the toscane family after she took a doctoral degree in business theory on komarr she went into the family transhipping concern shes now stationed in vorbarr sultana as a permanent lobbyist with the trade group representing all the komarran shipping concessions as sort of an interface between them and the imperium a brilliant woman coming from galeni whod taken an academic doctorate in history himself before becoming one of the first komarrans ever admitted to the imperial military service this was high praise so are you romancing her or thinking of hiring her for your department miles swore galeni almost blushed this is serious vorkosigan ambitious too if shes a scion of those toscanes i was a scion of those galens once back when the galens rated that particular inflection thinking of rebuilding the family fortunes are you mm times have changed and they arent changing back but they are changing onward its time for a little ambition in my life i think im almost forty you know and tottering on the brink of complete decrepitude obviously miles grinned well congratulations or should i say good luck ill take the luck i believe congratulations are still premature but they will be in order soon i hope and you my lovelife is entirely too complicated at the moment or at any rate admiral naismiths is oh you mean work im ah not working at present i just got back from a little galactic tour galeni twitched an eyebrow in understanding his own encounter several years past with the dendarii mercenaries and admiral naismith was certainly still vivid in his memory are you headed up and in or down and out miles pointed to the down tube im headed home i have a few days leave maybe ill see you around town then galeni swung into the down tube and rendered miles a cheerful parting semisalute i hope so take care miles descended in turn exiting at the ground floor at the side entrances security desk miles paused in a minor dilemma every time hed ever gone home after a final impsec mission debriefing hed either called for a car from the counts garage driven by an armsman or servant or more often found one waiting for him when he emerged from illyans lair but armsmen servants vehicles and all the rest of the household had decamped with the count and countess for the viceroys palace on sergyar though his mother had written him dryly that the term palace was most misleading so should he requisition a ride from impsec hqs motor pool or order a commercial cab though one might be certain that any cab which came here had been vetted by security first hed sent his sparse luggage directly home from the shuttleport it was chill and gray out but not raining and hed just spent a great many days stuck aboard a decidedly cramped if fast jumpship he collected his greatcoat and stepped outside he was only under orders to keep a bodyguard on duty at all times during his galactic travels after all it was about four kilometers from impsec hq to vorkosigan house both centrally located in the old town i do believe ill walk home he turned the last corner onto the street vorkosigan house faced just as the gray afternoon darkened into drizzle and congratulated himself on his timing four kilometers in well maybe it wasnt the fastest time hed ever done but at least he wasnt gasping for breath as he would have been six months ago the brisk walk had been a nonevent the streets of the central capital were thick with afternoon traffic and clogged with pedestrians who hurried past on their various businesses sparing barely a glance for the striding little man in military dress no long stares no rude gestures or comments not even one covert old hex sign against mutation had getting rid of his uneven limp leg braces and most of the crookedness in his back made that much difference or was the difference in the barrayarans three oldstyle mansions had once shared the city block for security reasons the one on this end had been bought up by the imperium during the period miless father had been regent and now housed some minor bureaucratic offices the one on the other end more dilapidated and with bad drains had been torn down and replaced only by a little park in their day a century and a half ago the great houses must have loomed magnificently over the horsedrawn carriages and riders clopping past now they were overshadowed by taller modern buildings across the street vorkosigan house sat in the center set off from the street by a narrow green strip of lawn and garden in the loop of the semicircular drive a stone wall topped with black wroughtiron spikes surrounded it all the four stories of great gray stone blocks in two main wings plus some extra odd architectural bits rose in a vast archaic mass all it needed was window slits and a moat and a few bats and ravens for decoration earthdescended bats were rare on barrayar as there were not enough earthdescended insects for them to eat and the native creatures incorrectly called bugs were usually toxic when ingested a force screen just inside the wall provided the real protection and eliminated the romantic possibility of bats a concrete kiosk beside the gate housed the gate guards in the heyday of the regency three full platoons of impsec guards had traded shifts around the clock in posts all around the building and for several blocks beyond watching the important government men hurry in and out now there was one lone gate guard a young impsec corporal who poked his head out the open door at the sound of miless steps emerged and saluted him a new man no one miles recognized good afternoon lieutenant vorkosigan the young man said i was expecting you they brought your valise a couple of hours ago i scanned it and everything its ready to go in thank you corporal gravely miles returned his salute been any excitement around here lately not really sir not since the count and countess left about the most action weve had was the night a feral cat somehow got past the scanner beams and ran into the tanglefield i never knew cats could make such a racket she apparently thought she was about to be killed and eaten miless eye took in an empty sandwich wrapper on the floor shoved against the far wall and a small saucer of milk a flicker of light from the banks of vid displays for the perimeter monitors in the kiosks second tiny room cast a chilly glow through the narrow doorway and er was she killed i mean oh no sir fortunately good he retrieved his valise after an awkward scramble with the guard as he belatedly tried to hand it to miles from the shadows under the guards chair beside the saucer a pair of yellowgreen eyes glinted in feline paranoia at him the young corporal had an interesting collection of long black cat hairs decorating the front of his uniform and deep halfhealed scratches scoring his hands keeping pets on duty was highly unregulation nine hours a day stuck in this tiny bunker he must be bored out of his mind the palmlocks have all been reset for you sir the guard went on helpfully ive rechecked everything twice can i carry that for you do you know how long you will be here will there be anything going on i dont know ill let you know the kid was clearly longing for a little conversation but miles was tired maybe later miles turned to trudge up the drive but then turned back what did you name her sir the cat a look of slight panic crossed the young mans face as that regulation about pets no doubt recalled itself to his mind er zap sir he was honest at least how appropriate carry on corporal miles gave him a parting impsec hq analysts salute which was a sort of wave of two fingers in the general vicinity of ones temple impsec analysts tended not to have a great deal of respect for anyone whose measured iq was lower than their own which included most of the rest of the imperial service the guard returned a snappier grateful version when did impsec start sending us children for gate guards the grim men whod patrolled the place in miles s fathers day would have executed the unfortunate cat on the spot and sifted its remains for scanning devices and bombs afterwards the kid must be all of at least twentyone years old if hes impsec and that rank in the capital miles controlled a slight twinge of disassociation and strode up the drive and under the porte cochere out of the drizzle that was becoming outright rain he pressed the palmlock pad to the right of the front door its two halves swung out with stately grace to admit him and closed again behind him as he stepped across the threshold it felt quite odd to open the door himself there had always been a vorkosigan armsman in the house uniform of brown and silver on duty to admit him when did they automate that door the great entry hall with its blackandwhite paved floor was chill and shadowy as the rain and gloom of early evening leached away the light miles almost spoke lights to bring up the illumination but paused and set down his valise in his whole life hed never had vorkosigan house entirely to himself someday my son all this will be yours he whispered experimentally into the shadows the hardedged echo of his words seemed to rasp back up from the tessellated pavement he suppressed a slight shudder he turned to the right and began a slow tour of the premises the carpet in the next room muffled the lonely clump of his boots all the remaining furnitureabout half seemed to be missingwas covered with ghostly white sheeting he circled the entire first floor the place seemed both larger and smaller than hed remembered a puzzling paradox he checked out the garage occupying the whole eastern wings subbasement level his own lightflyer was tucked neatly into a corner a barge of an armored groundcar polished and luxurious but elderly occupied another he thought of his combat armor i probably ought not to attempt to drive or fly either till this damned glitch in my head gets straightened out in the lightflyer he risked killing himself in a seizure in the landbarge anyone else on the road last winter before hed convinced himself that he was healing as promised hed gotten really good at apparently casually cadging rides he ascended one of the back stairways to the huge kitchen on the lower level it had always been a lucrative locale for treats and company when he was a child full of interesting busy people like cooks and armsmen and servants and even an occasional hungry imperial regent wandering through looking for a snack some utensils remained but the place had been stripped of food nothing left in the pantries or the walkin freezer or refrigerators which were tepid and disconnected he reset the smallest refrigerator if he was going to be here very long he would have to get food or a servant one servant would certainly do yet he didnt want a stranger in here maybe one of the recently pensioned folks lived in retirement nearby and might be persuaded to come back for a few days but he might not be here very long maybe he would buy some readymealsnot military service issue thank you there was an impressive amount of wine and spirits left to age undisturbed in the climatecontrolled cellar the lock of which opened to his vorkosigan palm he brought up a couple of bottles of a particularly chewy red laid down in his grandfathers day not troubling to switch on the lifttube he hauled both bottles and the valise up the curving stairs to his thirdfloor bedroom in the side wing which overlooked the back garden this time he called up the lights as true night was lending more danger than melancholy angst to his stumbling around in the dark the chamber was exactly as hed left it only four months ago too neat and tidy no one had really lived here for a long time well lord vorkosigan had dragged in for a good period last winter but he hadnt been in condition then to make many waves i could order in some food split it with the gate guard but he really didnt feel that hungry i could do anything i wanted anything at all except for the one and only thing he did want which was to depart tonight aboard the fastest jumpship available bound for escobar or some equally medically advanced galactic depot he growled wordlessly what he did instead was unpack his valise and put everything neatly away shed his boots and hang up his uniform and shuck on some comfortable old shipknits he sat on his bed and poured some wine into his bathroom tumbler hed avoided alcohol and every other possible drug or druglike substance all the way out to that last mission with the dendarii it seemed not to have made any difference to the rare and erratic seizures if he stayed here quietly alone inside vorkosigan house until his meeting with illyan if an episode occurred again at least no one could witness it ill have a drink then order some food tomorrow he must form another plan of attack on the the damned saboteur lurking in his neurons the wine slid down smoky rich and warming selfsedation seemed to require more alcohol than it used to a problem easily remedied the desensitization might be yet another side effect of the cryorevival but he was glumly afraid it was simply due to age he slipped into sleep about twothirds through the bottle by noon the next day the problem of food was becoming acute despite a couple of painkillers for breakfast and the absence of coffee and tea turning downright desperate im impsec trained i can figure out this problem somebody must have been going for groceries all these years no come to think of it kitchen supplies had been delivered daily by a liftvan he remembered the armsmen inspecting it the chief cook had practically had the duties of a company quartermaster handling the nutritional logistics of count countess a couple dozen servants twenty armsmen an assortment of their dependents peckish impsec guards not above cadging a snack and frequent state dinners parties or receptions where guests might number in the hundreds the comconsole in the cooks cubicle off the kitchen soon yielded up the data miles sought there had been a regular supplierthe account was now closed but he could surely open it again their list of offerings was astonishing in its scope their prices even more so how many marks had they been paying for eggsoh that was twelve dozen eggs to a crate not twelve eggs miles tried to imagine what he could do with a hundred and fortyfour eggs maybe back when hed been thirteen years old some opportunities just came too late in life instead he turned to the vid directory the closest purveyor was a small midtown grocery about six blocks away another quandary dare he drive walk there take a commercial cab home the place turned out to be an odd little hole in the wall but it supplied coffee tea milk a reasonable number of eggs a box of instant groats and an array of prepackaged items labeled reddimeals he stacked up two of each of the five flavors on impulse he also snagged a halfdozen foil packets of expensive squishy cat food the smelly stuff cats liked so should he slip it to the gate guard or attempt to seduce zap the cat to his own following after the incident with the tanglefield the beast probably would not be hanging around the back door of vorkosigan house much he gathered up his spoils and took them to the checkout where the clerk looked him up and down and gave him a peculiar smile he braced himself inwardly for some snide remark ah mutant he should have worn his impsec uniform nobody dared sneer at that horuseye winking from his collar but what she said was ah bachelor his return home and midafternoon breakfast occupied another hour five hours till dark more hours till bedtime it did not take nearly all that time to look up every cryoneurology clinic and specialist on barrayar and arrange the list in two orders medical reputation and the probability of keeping his visit secret from impsec that second requirement was the sticking point he really didnt want any but the best messing around with his head but the best were going to be depressingly hard to convince to say treat a patient and keep no records escobar barrayar or should he wait until he got out on his next galactic mission assignment as far from hq as possible he paced the house restlessly turning over memories in his mind this had been elenas room that tiny chamber had belonged to armsman bothari her father here was where ivan had slipped through the safetyrailing fallen half a story and cut his head open with no discernible effects on his intellect it had been hoped the fall would make him smarter for his evening meal miles decided to keep up the standards he donned his dress greens pulled all the covers off the furniture in the state dining room and set up his wine with a proper crystal glass at the head of the meterslong table he almost hunted up a plate but reflected he could save the washing up by eating the reddimeal out of its packet he piped in soft music other than that dinner took about five minutes when hed finished he dutifully put the covers back on the polished wood and fine chairs if id had the dendarii here i could have had a real party elli quinn or taura or rowan durona or even elena baz and all bel thorne whom he still missed all of the above somebody the inner vision of the dendarii occupying vorkosigan house gave him vertigo but there was no doubt theyd know how to liven the place up by the next evening he was desperate enough to call his cousin ivan ivan answered his comconsole promptly enough lieutenant lord ivan vorpatril was still wearing undress greens identical to miless except for the symbol of ops instead of impsec pinned to his collar in front of the red lieutenants rectangles at least ivan hadnt changed still holding down the same desk at imperial service headquarters by day and leading the pleasant life of a vor officer in the capital by night ivans handsome affable face brightened into a genuine smile when he saw miles well coz i didnt know you were back in town i got in a few days ago miles confessed ive been sampling the somewhat bizarre sensations of having vorkosigan house to myself dear god youre all alone in that mausoleum except for the gate guard and zap the cat who keep to themselves it ought to suit you back from the dead as you are said ivan miles touched his chest not really i never noticed before how much the old place creaks at night i spent this afternoon he couldnt very well tell ivan hed spent the day plotting a secret medical foray without ivan asking why he continued smoothly looking through the archives i got to wondering how many people had actually died on the premises over the centuries besides my grandfather of course there were a lot more than id thought a fascinating question actually he would have to scan the archives yech so whats happening in town any chance of you stopping by im on duty all day of course theres not too much going on really were at that odd cusp done with the emperors birthday and not time yet for winterfair how was the birthday bash this year i just missed it i was still en route three weeks out nobody even got drunk to celebrate yes i know i got stuck delivering your districts bag of gold it was the usual crush gregor retired early and things sort of trickled off to nothing before dawn ivan pursed his lips looking like he was being seized with a bright idea miles braced himself i tell you what though in two nights gregor is having a state dinner theres two or three major new galactic ambassadors and a couple of minor counsels whove presented their portfolios in the last month and gregor figured to round them up all at once and get it over with as usual mother is playing hostess for him lady alys vorpatril was widely acknowledged as the premier social arbiter of vorbarr sultana not least because of her frequent duties at the imperial residence as official welcomer for wifeless motherless sisterless emperor gregor theres going to be dancing after mother asked me if i couldnt round up some younger people to warm up the ballroom by younger i gather she means under forty appropriate ones you know the drill if i had known you were in town id have nailed you before this she wants you to bring a date miles interpreted this preferably a fiancee ivan grinned yeah but for some reason most fellows i know wont lend me theirs would i be supposed to provide a dance partner too i hardly know any women here anymore so bring one of the koudelka girls i am sure its like taking your sister but they are decorative as hell especially en masse did you ask delia said miles thoughtfully yeah but ill cede her to you if you like and take martya but if youre escorting delia you have to promise not to make her wear high heels she hates it when you make her wear high heels but shes so impressive in them shes impressive out of them too true well yes all right miles entertained a brief flashing vision of himself having a seizure right on the imperial ballroom floor in front of half the vorish social cream of the capital but what was the alternative stay home by himself yet another night with nothing to do but dream about his afterthenextmission escape to escobar evolve nineteen more impractical ways to defeat impsec s observation of him on impsecs home turf or brainstorm how to steal the gate guards cat for company and ivan might solve his transportation dilemma i dont have a car miles said what happened to your lightflyer its in the shop adjustments want me to pick you up his brains were lagging that would leave ivan driving to the terror of all prudent passengers unless miles could bully delia koudelka into taking over miles sat up seized with a bright idea of his own does your mother really want extra bodies she says so captain duv galeni is in town i saw him the other day at impsec hq hes stuck down in the analysis section except that he seems to regard it as a rare treat oh yeah i knew that i would have remembered to tell you eventually he came over to our side of town a few weeks ago in tow of general allegre for some consultation by the upperups i meant to do something to welcome him to vorbarr sultana but i hadnt got around to it yet you impsec boys tend to keep to yourselves over there in paranoia central but anyway hes trying to impress this komarran girl miles forged on not girl woman i suppose some kind of highpowered wheel in a trade delegation shes strong on brains rather than beauty i gather which doesnt surprise me knowing galeni and she has interesting komarran connections how many points dyou think he would score for getting her into an imperial state dinner many said ivan decisively especially if its one of my mothers exclusive little soirees and we both owe him one more than one and hes not nearly as sarcastic as he used to be either i noticed maybe hes mellowing out sure invite him along said ivan ill give him a call and get back to you then happy in his inspiration miles cut the com chapter five miles climbed from captain galenis groundcar which was stopped at the east portico of the imperial residence and turned to assist delia koudelka who scarcely needed help she swung out her long athletic legs and bounced to her feet the flowing skirts of her dress in her favorite blue revealed a glimpse of her matching dancing slippers sensible comfortable and flat she was the tallest of commodore koudelkas four daughters the top of miles s head was a good ten centimeters below the level of her shoulder he grinned up at her she returned a somewhat twisted smile companionable and sporting i dont know why i let you and ivan talk me into this she sighed to his ear because you like to dance miles stated with certainty give me the first two and i promise ill find you a nice tall galactic diplomat for the rest of the evening its not that she denied eyeing his shortness what i lack in height i make up in speed thats the trouble she nodded vigorously galeni turned over his modest vehicle to the waiting imperial servant who drove it away and arranged his own ladys hand upon his arm it took some knowledge of galeni to read his saturnine features miles made him out as a little proud a little smug and a little embarrassed as a man who arrives at a party wildly overdressed since galeni albeit almost painfully neat scrubbed shaved and polished wore the same dress green service uniform with glittering insignia as miles did it could only be the effect of his companion he ought to be smug thought miles waitll ivan sees this if laisa toscane possessed more brains than beauty she had to be some kind of genius yet the exact source of her intense physical impression was elusive her face was softly molded and pleasant but not nearly as striking as say elli quinns expensive sculpture her eyes were unusual a brilliant bluegreen though whether the color was cosmetically or genetically conferred miles could not tell she was short even for a komarran woman two handspans shorter than galeni who was almost as tall as delia but her most distinctive feature was her skin milkwhite and almost seeming to glowzaftig miles thought was the word for that rich flesh plump was misleading and not nearly enthusiastic enough he had never seen anything so edibly female outside a cetagandan hautladys force screen wealth did not always confer taste upon its possessor but when it did the results could be impressive she wore dark red loose trousers in the komarran style and a matching lowcut top made subtle with a boxy open jacket in cream and bluegreen understated jewelry her hair was too dark to be called blond too silvery to be called brown and curled in short wisps in a forthrightly komarran fashion her smile seemed pleased and excited as she glanced up at her escort but by no means overwhelmed if she makes it past aunt alys miles decided shes going to do just fine he lengthened his stride to match delias and bowed his little party indoors as if emperor gregors state dinner was his personal gift to them they were vetted through by the imperial guards and a majordomo who determined that they had no wraps to be relieved of nor under miless escort further need of guidance the next person they encountered was indeed lady alys vorpatril who stood at the foot of the staircase tonight shed chosen a gown of dark blue velvet trimmed with gold in salute perhaps to the vorpatril colors of her longdeceased husband shed worn a widows dove gray all through miless childhood he seemed to recall but had at length given it up possibly about the same time she had finally forgiven lord vorpatril for getting himself killed in that particularly outrageous fashion during the war of vordarians pretendership hello miles dear delia she greeted them miles bowed over her hand and introduced captain galeni and dr toscane with more formality lady alys nodded approvalmiles was relieved that ivan had indeed followed through and arranged their addition to the guest list as promised and not forgotten till some embarrassing last minute or later gregor is receiving everyone in the glass hall as usual lady alys went on youll be seated at his table for dinner down from the escobaran ambassador and her husbandi thought we ought to intersperse the galactics with a few natives this time thanks aunt alys miles glanced past her shoulder at a slight familiar figure in officers dress greens standing in the shadows in the door to the left of the staircase and talking in low tones with an impsec guard uh delia would you show duv and laisa to the glass hall ill be right along sure miles delia smiled at laisa swept up her long skirts with the ease of practice and led the komarrans up the wide stairs what a lovely young woman stated lady alys gazing after them ah you mean dr toscane miles hazarded she was all right to bring i take it oh yes she is the principal heiress of those toscanes you know quite appropriate alys spoiled this encomium somewhat by adding for a komarran we all have our little handicaps lady alys was employed by the emperor to see that the right people were admitted but miles had spotted the other member of the team the man gregor employed to see that the safe people were admitted chief of imperial security simon illyan glanced up at last from his conversation with the impsec guard who saluted him and disappeared through the doorway illyan did not smile or beckon miles but miles ducked around lady alys and made for him anyway trapping him before he could follow the guard sir miles gave him an analysts salute illyan returned an even more modified version a slightly frustrated wave more repelling than acknowledging the impsec chief was a man in his early sixties with brown hair going gray a deceptively placid face and a permanent habit of blending quietly into the background illyan was clearly on duty tonight supervising the emperors personal security evidenced by the comm link earbug in his right ear and the charged lethal weapons on both hips this meant either that there was more going on here tonight than miles had been briefed about or that there wasnt much going on anywhere else to nail illyan down at hq and hed left the routine to his bland and steady secondincommand haroche did your secretary give you my message sir yes lieutenant hed told me you were out of town i was i came back have you seen my latest report yes damn the words theres something important i left out of it seemed to choke in miless throat i need to talk with you illyan always closed seemed more expressionless than usual this is neither the time nor the place however quite sir when im waiting on further information right if it wasnt hurry up and wait it was wait and hurry up but something must be about to break soon or illyan wouldnt have miles dancing attendance in vorbarr sultana on a onehour reportforduty notice if its a new mission i wish to hell hed let me in on it i could at least be starting some contingency planning very good ill be ready illyan nodded dismissal but as miles turned away he added lieutenant miles turned back did you drive here tonight yes well captain galeni did ah illyan seemed to find something mildly interesting to look at over the top of miles s head sharp man galeni i think so giving up on prying anything further out of illyan tonight miles hurried to catch up with his friends he found them all waiting for him in the broad corridor outside the glass hall galeni was chatting amiably with delia who seemed in no hurry to go in and find ivan and her sister laisa was gazing around with obvious fascination at the handmade antiques and subtly colored patterned carpets lining the corridor miles strolled along with her to study the elaborate and painstaking inlay on a polished tabletop a scene of running horses in the natural hues of the various woods its all so very barrayaran she confided to miles does it meet your expectations indeed yes how old do you suppose that table isand what went through the mind of the craftsman who made it do you suppose he ever imagined us imagining him her sensitivelooking fingers ran over the polished surface aromatic with fine scented wax and she smiled about two hundred years and no at a guess said miles hm her smile grew more pensive some of our domes are over four hundred years old and yet barrayar seems older even when it isnt there is something intrinsically archaic about you i think miles reflected briefly upon the nature of her homeworld in another four hundred years the terraforming on komarr might begin to make it habitable for humans outdoors without breath masks for now the komarrans lived all together in domed arcologies as dependent upon their technology for survival against the choking chill as the betans were on their screaming hot desert world komarr had never had a time of isolation never been out of touch with the galactic mainstream indeed it made its living fishing out of that stream with its one vital natural resourcesix important wormhole jump points in close practical proximity to one another the jumps had made komarran local space a nexus crossroads and eventually unfortunately a strategic target barrayar had exactly one wormhole jump route connecting it to the galactic nexusand it went through komarr if you did not hold your own gateway those who did control it would own you miles pulled his thoughts back to a smaller and more private human scale obviously galeni ought to take his lady out in the open barrayaran air shed surely enjoy all those kilometers of unkomarran wilderness hiking say or if she truly favored the archaic you ought to get duv to take you horseback riding miles suggested goodness can he ride too her amazing turquoise eyes widened er good question well if not miles could give him a crash course sure intrinsically archaic seems so she dropped her voice to a secretive toneintrinsically romantic but dont tell duv i said so hes such a stickler for historical accuracy the first thing he does is blow off all the fairy dust miles grinned im not surprised but i thought you were the practical businesswoman type yourself her smile grew more serious im a komarran i have to be without the valueadded from our trade labor transport banking and remanufacturing komarr would dwindle again to the desperate subsistenceand lessthansubsistencelevel from which it rose and seven out of ten of us would die one way or another miles twitched an interested brow he thought her figures exaggerated if obviously sincerely felt well we shouldnt hold up the parade shall we go in he and galeni rearranged themselves at the sides of their respective ladies and miles led the way through the nearby double doors the glass hall was a long reception chamber lined on one side with tall windows on the other with tall antique mirrors hence its name acquired when glass was a lot harder to come by playing host rather than liege lord tonight gregor stood near the door in company with a few high government ministers roped in for the occasion greeting his guests the emperor of barrayar was a lean almost thin man in his midthirties blackhaired and darkeyed tonight he wore wellcut civilian clothes in the most conservative formal barrayaran style with a hint of the vorbarra colors in the trim and sidepiping on the trousers gregor was preternaturally quiet by choice when permitted to be not now of course when he was in social mode a duty he disliked but as with all his duties did well anyway is that him laisa whispered to miles as they waited for the group ahead of them to finish their pleasantries and move on i thought he would be in that fantastical military uniform one sees him wearing in all the vids oh the parade redandblues he only puts them on for the midsummer review birthday and winterfair his grandfather emperor ezar was a real general before he was ever emperor and wore uniforms like a second skin but gregor feels he never was despite his titular command of the imperial forces so he goes for his vorbarra house uniform or something like this whenever etiquette permits we all appreciate it vastly because it lets us off the hook for wearing the damned things the collar chokes you the swords trip you and the boot tassels catch on things not that the collar of the dress greens was much lower and except for the tassels the tall boots were similar but at his height miles found the long sword of the pair a particular trial i see said laisa her eyes twinkled in amusement ah were up miles shepherded his flock forward delia had known gregor all her life and except for a brief word and smile of greeting stepped back to give the newcomers a chance yes captain galeni ive heard of you gregor said gravely when miles introduced the komarranborn officer to him galeni looked for a split second as if he wasnt sure how to process this alarming tidbit of information and gregor added quickly good things gregor turned to laisa his gaze for a moment rather arrested he recovered quickly and bowed slightly over her hand murmuring something polite and hopeful about komarr as a welcome part of the empires future once through the formalities delia led off in a search for ivan and her sister among the thinly scattered brilliantly dressed guests the room was not nearly so jammed as for the birthday or winterfair laisa glanced back over her shoulder at gregor heavens i nearly felt he was apologizing for conquering us well not really said miles we didnt have much choice after the cetagandans invaded us through you he was merely expressing sorrow for any personal inconveniences it may have caused which all things considered seem to be tailing off thirtyfive years after the fact multiplanet empires are a tricky balancing act though the cetagandans have managed theirs for centuries not that they would be my first pick as political role models he doesnt seem exactly the stern personality your official news services project does he more glum than stern reallythats just how he comes out on the vid fortunately perhaps they found their way temporarily blocked by a skinny old man doddering along with a cane his ultraformal parade redandblues correct right down to the two swords banging on his bony hips hung loosely on him and were oddly faded in color miles grabbed his guests and stepped back hastily to let him pass laisa watched with interest now whos the old general one of the most famous relics of vorbarr sultana said miles general vorparadijs is the last surviving imperial auditor to have been personally appointed by emperor ezar he looks rather military for an auditor said laisa doubtfully thats imperial auditor with a capital a miles corrected and a capital imp um every society has to face the question who will guard the guardians the imperial auditor is the barrayaranstyle answer the auditors are sort of a cross between oh a betan special prosecutor an inspector general and a minor deity it doesnt necessarily have anything to do with accounting though thats the origin of the title the original counts were voradar taus tax collectors with that much money floating past my illiterate ancestors they tended to grow sticky fingers the auditors policed the counts for the emperor the unexpected arrival of an imperial auditor usually with a large imperial cavalry force frequently triggered messy and unusual suicides the auditors used to get assassinated more in those days too but the early emperors were really consistent in following those up with spectacular mass executions and the auditors became remarkably untouchable its said they used to be able to ride the countryside with bags of gold hanging off their saddles and almost no guards and the bandits would secretly ride point to clear their paths just to make sure the auditors were sped out of their districts with no irritating delays i think thats a legend myself laisa laughed its a great story though there are supposed to be nine of them put in galeni a traditional number with several possible old earth origins its a favorite topic for undergraduate history papers though i believe there are only seven living auditors at present are they appointed for life asked laisa sometimes said miles others are just appointed on a casebycase basis when my father was regent he only appointed acting auditors though gregor confirmed several of their appointments when he reached his majority in all matters pertaining to their investigations they actually speak with the emperors voice thats another very barrayaran thing i once spoke with the count my fathers voice in a little murder investigation in my own district it was a strange experience it sounds really interesting from a sociological view said laisa do you suppose we could corner general vorparadijs and get him talking about old times no no said miles in horror its the office thats interesting vorparadijs himself is the deadliest senile old vor bore in vorbarr sultana all he does is this monologue about how standards have gone to hell since ezars day with pointed looks at me usually interspersed with detailed accounts of his bowel troubles yes agreed delia koudelka he interrupts you constantly to tell you youth have no manners youth is anybody under sixty seventy miles corrected he still refers to my father as tiotrs younger boy are all auditors that old well not that old but they tend to pick retired admirals and generals in case they have to put the wind up nonretired admirals and generals they avoided the deadly general and caught up with ivan and martya koudelka only to be parted from them again by the majordomo who seated them for dinner in the ornate lesser dining hall the meal went well miles thought miles exerted himself to ask leading questions of the escobaran ambassador and to patiently endure the usual spate of inquiries about his famous father laisa across from him held her own in conversation with an elderly gentleman of the escobaran s retinue gregor and captain galeni managed a few exquisitely polite exchanges about barrayarankomarran relations suitable for the tender ears of galactic guests it wasnt just for miless sake that they had been seated at gregors table miles judged laisas bright eyes rose at what miles recognized was a straightline about komarran shipping deliberately handed her by galeni she addressed gregor directly across the escobarans yes sire in fact the komarr shippers syndicate for which i work is very concerned about the issue before the council of ministers right now weve petitioned for tax relief on profits directly reinvested in capital improvements inwardly miles applauded her nerve to lobby the emperor himself over the entreeyeah go for it why not yes said gregor smiling a little minister racozy mentioned it to me im afraid it will find stiff opposition in the council of counts whose more conservative members feel our large military expenditures on komarrs jumppoint defenses should be er proportionally shared by those on the front lines but capital growth will provide a much bigger base to tax on the next round to siphon it off too soon is like like eating your seed corn gregors brows rose an extremely useful metaphor dr toscane i shall pass it on to minister racozy it might make a better appeal to some of our backcountry counts than the more complex discussions of jump technologies on which hes been attempting to tutor them laisa smiled gregor smiled galeni looked downright smug laisa having made her point had the good sense to back off and turn the conversation immediately to lighter matters or at least to escobaran policies on jump technologies less potentially volatile than barrayarankomarran taxation issues music for the dancing afterwards in the ballroom downstairs was provided as usual by the imperial service orchestra surely among the less martial if more talented soldiers of barrayar the elderly colonel who directed them had been a fixture in the imperial residence for years gregor opened the dancing formally by taking lady alys for a spin around the floor then as etiquette demanded a string of female guests in order of rank starting with the escobaran ambassadoress miles claimed his two dances with the tall blond beautiful delia having made whatever point that made to the onlookers he went on to practice an illyanlike blending with the walls to watch the show captain galeni danced if not well at least earnestly he had an eye on a political career after his twenty years in the service were up and was methodically collecting all possible pertinent skills one of gregors armsmen approached laisa when miles next spotted her dipping and sliding in a mirror dance she was opposite gregor miles wondered if shed get in a few more good lines about trade relations while she was at it an exhilarating opportunity and she wasnt wasting it the komarr shippers syndicate should give her a bonus for this nights work glum gregor actually laughed at something she said she returned to galeni temporarily holding up the wall along with miles with her eyes shining hes more intelligent than i imagined she said breathlessly he listens very intently you feel as though hes taking it all in or is that an act no act said miles hes processing everything but gregor has to watch what he says very closely given that his word can be literally law hed be shy if he could but hes not allowed not allowed how odd that sounds said laisa she had the chance to test gregors reserve three more times on the marquetry dance floor before the evening drew to a close at a proper and conservative hour before midnight miles wondered if gregor was giving him the lie about his shyness because he actually made laisa laugh once or twice too the party was breaking up before miles finally found himself in gregors orbit for a quiet private word unfortunately the first thing gregor said was i hear you managed to get our courier back to us almost in one piece a bit below your usual standards wasnt it ah so vorbergs home is he so im told what exactly happened a very embarrassing accident with an automated plasma arc ill tell you all about it but not here i look forward to it which put gregor on the growing list of people for miles to try to avoid damn where did you find that extraordinary young komarran woman gregor added gazing off into the middle distance dr toscane impressive isnt she i admired her courage as much as her cleavage what all did you find to talk about out there komarr mostly do you have her um the shippers syndicates address oh never mind simon can get it for me along with a complete security report whether i want it or not no doubt miles bowed impsec lives to serve you sire behave gregor murmured miles grinned upon their return to vorkosigan house miles invited the two komarrans in for a drink before reflecting upon the present logistical complications of entertaining galeni started to politely decline mentioning something about work tomorrow but simultaneously laisa said oh yes please id love to see the house lord vorkosigan its imbued with so much history galeni immediately swallowed whatever hed been about to add and followed her in smiling slightly all the groundfloor rooms seemed too vast and shadowed and foreboding for just three people miles led them upstairs instead to a more humanly scaled small parlor then had to zip around the room whisking the covers off the furniture before anyone could sit down he set the lights to a reasonably romantic lateevening glow then galloped downstairs again two and three flights respectively in search of three wineglasses and a suitable bottle of wine he arrived back upstairs rather out of breath he returned to the small parlor to find galeni had not taken advantage of his opportunity miles should have uncovered only the small sofa forcing the two into closer proximity than the separate admittedly comfortable chairs they had chosen staid old rulefollowing galeni seemed unconscious of his ladys secret yen for a little romantic idiocy miles was oddly reminded of taura forced by her size and work and rank into a permanent public persona too dangerous to mock laisa was not too big but perhaps was too bright too conscious of her public and social duties shed never ask directly galeni made her smile but not laugh the lack of any senseof play between them worried miles you had to have a keen sense of humor to do sex and stay sane but miles did not feel particularly qualified just now to give galeni advice on how to run his lovelife he thought again of tauras comment you try to give away what you want yourself hell galeni was a big boy let him find his own damnation it wasnt hard to lead laisa into conversation about her work though it made things a little onesided miles and galeni naturally couldnt say much in return about their own highly classified business this segued into what seemed to be the topic of the evening komarrbarrayaran relations and history the toscane family had been notable cooperators after the conquest hence their premier position today but you cant miles maintained stoutly when the subject came up properly call them collaborators i think that term ought to be reserved for those who cooperated before the barrayaran invasion no reflection upon the toscanes patriotism that they declined to embrace the scorched earth or rather scorched komarr position of the later resistance quite the reverse the barrayaran invasion hadnt exactly been a winwin situation but at least the cooperators had known how to cut their losses and go on now a generation later the success of the toscaneled resurgent oligarchy demonstrated the validity of their reasoning and unlike galeni whose father ser galen had spent his life pursuing a futile komarran revenge the toscane position had left laisa with no embarrassing connections to live down ser galen was a topic neither miles nor galeni broached miles wondered how much galeni had told her of his late mad father it was halfway between midnight and dawn with another bottle of the best wine killed among them before miles could bring himself to let his yawning company go home he watched reflectively as galenis groundcar turned out of the drive and down the nightquiet street saluted on its way by the lone impsec night guard galeni like miles had spent the last decade pursuing an allconsuming career its secret strains had left him perhaps a bit romantically retarded miles hoped when the time came galeni didnt put his proposal to laisa as some sort of business proposition but he was very much afraid that would be the only mode galeni could allow himself galeni didnt have enough forward momentum that desk job suited him that one wont be lingering for you very damned long galeni someone with more nerve will move in and snap her up and carry her off to keep greedily for himself as a wouldbe baba a traditional barrayaran marriagebroker miles did not feel the evening had advanced galenis agenda nearly enough sexually frustrated enough by proxy for both his friends miles went back inside the door securelocked itself he undressed slowly and sat on his bed watching his comconsole with the same malignant intensity with which zap the cat eyed a human bearing food it remained silent chime damn you in the natural perversity of things this ought to be the hour illyan called him in when he was tired and halfdrunk and unfit to report now illyan i want my mission every hour that passed seemed a greater strain every hour another hour wasted if enough time went by before illyan called him in that he might have made it to escobar and back hed be fit to chew the carpet even when not having a seizure he considered hauling up another bottle and getting really drunk in an act of sympathetic magic to make illyan really likely to call but nausea and vomiting tended to make time move subjectively slower not faster an unattractive prospect maybe illyans forgotten me a thin joke illyan never forgot anything he couldnt sometime back when hed been an impsec lieutenant in his late twenties thenemperor ezar had sent him off to distant illyrica to have an experimental eidetic memorychip installed in his brain old ezar had fancied owning a walking recording device answerable to himself alone the technology had not caught on as a commercial development due to the incidence of iatrogenic schizophrenia the chip had subsequently induced in its wearers ruthless ezar had been willing to take that risk for the reward or rather had been willing for a disposable young officer to take it for him ezar in pursuit of his policies had disposed of thousands of soldiers like illyan in his lifetime but ezar had died soon after and left illyan like a wandering planetoid to fall into orbit around admiral aral vorkosigan who proved to be one of the major political stars of the century illyan had worked security for miless father one way or another for the next thirty years miles wondered what it would be like to have thirtyfive years of memories at your beck and call as sharp and instantaneous as if just experienced the past would never be softened by that welcome roseate fog of forgetfulness to be able to rerun every mistake youd ever made in perfect sound and color it had to be something like eternal damnation no wonder the chipbearers had gone mad although maybe remembering other peoples mistakes was not so painful you learned to watch your mouth around illyan he could quote you back every idiotic stupid or illconsidered thing youd ever said verbatim with gestures all in all miles didnt think hed care for a chip himself even if he were medically qualified he felt close enough to schizoid dementia already without any further technological boost in that direction thanks galeni now seemed the bland unimaginative sort who would qualify but miles had reason to believe galeni harbored hidden depths as hidden as his father ser galens terrorist past no galeni was not a suitable candidate either galeni would just go insane so quietly he would rack up huge damages before anyone caught on miles stared at his comconsole willing it to light up call call call give me my goddamn mission get me out of here its silence seemed almost mocking at length he gave up and went to get another bottle of wine chapter six it was evening two full days later before the personal comconsole in his bedchamber chimed again miles who had been sitting next to it all day nearly flinched out of his chair he let it chime again deliberately while he tried to slow his racing heart and catch his breath right this has to be it cool calm and collected boy dont let illyans secretary see you sweat but to his bitter disappointment the face that formed over the vid plate was only his cousin ivan hed obviously just blown in from his days work at imperial service headquarters still wearing his undress greens with blue not red rank rectangles on the collar behind his bronze ops pins captains tabs ivan is wearing captains tabs hi coz said ivan cheerily how was your day slow miles fixed his features into a polite smile hoping to conceal the sinking feeling in his gut ivans smile broadened he ran a hand over his hair preening notice anything you know damned well i noticed instantly you have a new hairstylist miles feigned to hazard uncertainly ha ivan tapped a tab with a fingernail making it click you know impersonating an officer is a crime ivan true theyve never caught you yet ivan got promoted to captain before me ha ivan repeated smugly its all official as of today my new pay grade started at reveille this morning i knew this was in the pipeline but ive been sitting on the news thought you all deserved a little surprise how come they promoted you beforeme who the hell have you been sleeping with boiled off miless lips before he could bite it back down he hadnt meant his tone of voice to come out quite that harsh ivan shrugged smirking i do my job and i do it without going around bending all the rules into artistic little origami shapes either besides youve spent i dont know how much time on medical leave deduct that and ive probably got years of seniority on you blood and bone every bit of that unwelcome leave had been bought with blood and bone and endless pain laid down willingly enough in the emperors service blood and bone and they promote ivan before me something like rage choked him clotting words in his throat like cotton ivans face watching his fell yes of course ivan had expected to be applauded in some suitably backhanded way expected miles to share his pride and pleasure in his achievement which truly made a sad dish when eaten alone miles struggled for better control of his face his words his thoughts he tried to return his voice to the proper tone of light banter congratulations coz now that your rank and pay grade have become so exalted what excuse are you going to give your mother not to get married to some fine vor bud they have to catch me first grinned ivan lightening again in response i move fast mm better not wait too long didnt tatya vorventa give up and get married recently though theres still violetta vorsoisson i suppose well no actually she got married last summer ivan admitted helga vorsmythe picked off by one of her das industrialist friends of all things he wasnt even vor wealthy as hell though that was three years ago god miles you are out of it no problem i can always go for someone younger at this rate youre going to end up courting embryos we all will that skewed malefemale birth ratio about the time we were being born is catching up with us well good going with your captaincy i know you worked for it even though you pretend not to youll be chief of ops before i turn around i wager ivan sighed not unless they break down and finally give me some ship duty to go on my resume theyre awfully stingy with it these days theyre pinching halfmarks in the training cycles im afraid everyones complaining on that score youve had more ship duty than anyone i know up to the rank of commodore in your own inimitable assbackwards way ivan added enviously yeah but its all classified secret youre among the very few who know the point is you havent let the lack of halfmarks stop you or the rules or respect for reality as far as i can tell i never let anything stop me thats how you get what you want ivan no ones just going to hand it to you well no one was going to just hand it to miles things fell out of the sky onto ivan and had done so all his charmed life if you cant win change the game ivan twitched a brow upward if theres no game isnt winning a pretty meaningless concept miles hesitated out of the mouths of ivans ill have to think about that one dont strain yourself little genius miles managed an unfelt smile ivan looked as though this whole conversation was leaving as bad a taste in his mouth as it was in miles s better to cut the losses he would make it up with ivan later he always did i think id better go now yes you have so much to do with a grimace ivan cut the com even as miless hand reached for the offkey miles sat in his comconsoles station chair in silence for a full minute then being quite alone he threw back his head and spat his frustration at his bedroom ceiling in a string of all the blue galactic curses he knew afterwards he felt slightly better as if hed managed to eject something poisonous from his soul along with the foul words he didnt begrudge ivan his promotion not really it was just it was just was winning all he really wanted or did he still want also to be seen to have won and by whom impsec was the wrong damned department to be working for if you hungered for fame along with your fortune yet illyan knew miless parents knew gregor all the close people who really counted knew about admiral naismith knew what miles really was elena quinn all the dendarii even ivan knew who the hell am i twirling for if not for them well there was always his grandfather general count piotr vorkosigan dead these thirteen years miless eye fell on his grandfathers ceremonial dagger in its elaborate sheath sitting in a place of honor or at least uncluttered by other detritus on its own shelf across the room miles had actually insisted on carrying it around with him at all times earlier in his career proving what to whom nothing to no one now he rose walked over to the shelf and lifted the weapon drawing the fine blade from its sheath and watching the light play over the textured steel it was still a fabulous antique but it lacked some former geas it had once held upon him the magic was gone or at least the curse was lifted it was just a knife he slid it back into its sheath opened his hand and let it fall back to its place he felt out of balance he had felt that way increasingly when at home but this trip the sensation was acute the strange absence of the count and countess was like a preview of their deaths this was a taste of what it would be like to be count miles vorkosigan all day long he wasnt sure he liked the flavor i need naismith this eviscerated vor life unnerved him but naismith was an expensive hobby to get impsec to pay for naismith required a reason literally a mission in life what have you done to justify your existence today was a question to which admiral naismith had better be able to supply a daily answer or risk being snuffed out impsecs accountants were as dangerous to his continuation as enemy fire well almost his hand traced the spray of scars on his chest under his shirt there was something wrong with his new heart it pumped blood all right all the ventricles and valves were in order it was supposed to have been grown from his own tissues but it seemed a strangers mismatch youre going looney all alone in this empty house a mission a mission was what he needed then everything would be all right again it wasnt that he wished harm on anyone but he longed for a hijacking a blockade a small colonial war better still a rescue free the prisoners yeah youve done all that if thats what you wanted why arent you happy the taste for adrenaline it appeared was an appetite that grew by what it fed upon naismith was an addiction a craving that required everstronger and more toxic doses for the same level of satisfaction hed tried a few dangerous sports by way of experiment to soothe that hunger he wasnt all that good at them lacking among other things the time to acquire true expertise and besides that extra edge was missing it wasnt very interesting to risk only himself and a trophy seemed a tawdry bit of junk when hed played for and won ten thousand human lives in a single round i want my frigging mission call me illyan the call when it came at last literally caught him napping the chime brought him abruptly out of an exhausted afternoon doze after a night of almost no sleep at all racked with circular patterns of worry and useless speculation he had practiced in his mind miles estimated about three hundred versions of his upcoming interview with illyan the only certainty he held was that the three hundred and first would be something totally different the face of illyan s secretary formed over the vid plate now miles said before the man could get his first word out he rubbed his hand through sleepbent hair and over his slightly numb face the secretary blinked cleared his throat and started in with his own practiced sentences good afternoon lieutenant vorkosigan chief illyan requests that you report to his office in one hour i could make it quicker one hour the secretary repeated hq will send a car for you oh thanks useless to ask for more information over a comconsole miless machine was more secured than a commercial model but not that much more the secretary cut the com well it would give him time to take another cold shower and dress properly after his second bath of the day he pulled a set of freshpressed undress greens out of his closet and set about transferring his impsec silver eyes to their place on the collar in front of theahembattered red lieutenants tabs hed been wearing for eight bleeding years the rank tabs were duplicates but the eyeofhorus pins built up in molecular layers of tarnishproof silver in a hidden pattern were issued one set rightand leftfacing to a soldier name and serial number were engraved on the back and woe to the man who lost his impsec eyes were as hard to counterfeit as money and as powerful when miles was finished his appearance was as neat as for any interview with the emperor neater gregor had less immediate control over his destiny than illyan did it was all sympathetic magic when you couldnt do something truly useful you tended to vent the pentup energy in something useless but available like snappy dressing still he was downstairs and waiting ten minutes before the impsec groundcar showed up at the front portico when he arrived this time at illyans office the door to the inner chamber was open the secretary waved him through illyan looked up from his own oversized overworked comconsole desk and nodded in return to miless slightlysharperthananalysts salute he reached for a control and the door to the outer office slid closed and securelocked itself the locking was an unusual gesture and miles quelled a rising hope that it meant that this time something bloody big was in the works something really challenging there was a chair waiting good illyan had been known when particularly furious to keep one standing till the yelling part was done not that illyan ever raised his voice he tended to the devastatingly wellchosen word to convey his emotions a style miles admired and hoped to emulate but there was a peculiar tension in the impsec chief today grim much more so than normal miles seated himself and gave illyan a short nod signifying his commander had all his attention im ready lets go illyan leaned not forward but back studying miles across the wide black surface of the desk you told my secretary you had something you wanted to add to your last report shit now or never but the confession of his little medical problem would be certain to totally derail whatever mission assignment was coming up never it is then ill fix it myself later as soon as possible nothing important now whats up illyan sighed and drummed his fingers once introspectively on the black glass before him i received a disturbing report from jacksons whole miless breath drew in i died there once admiral naismith is notably unwelcome in those parts but im ready for a rematch what have the bastards done now this is not a new mission nor a new report this is in relation to your last i can hardly call it a mission since i never ordered it your last adventure there illyan looked up at him oh said miles cautiously complete copies of your cryorevival surgeons medical records finally surfaced it took some time due to the confusion of the durona group s hurried departure from jacksons whole with their records scattered between escobar and house fell house fell needless to say was not forthcoming with extra data it took even more time for the records to be received and processed by my analysis section and to finally be read in detail by someone who realized their significance and implications some months in fact miless belly went abruptly very cold as if in memory of his freezing death he had a sudden insight as to the exact state of mind of a person who felljumpedwas pushed from the top of a very tall building in that subjectively stretched eternity it took for them to reach the pavement below we have just made a major mistake oh yes what bothers me most of course illyan went on is not your seizures themselves but the fact that you concealed them from the impsec physicians who were trying to return you fit for duty you lied to them and through them to me miles swallowed searching his paralyzed consciousness for a defense for the indefensible what couldnt be defended could only be denied he pictured himself chirping brightly what seizures sir no dr durona said they would go away on their own she had dammit she had or they might he corrected at that time i thought they had illyan grimaced he picked a ciphercard from his desktop and held it up between thumb and forefinger this he stated is my latest independent report from the dendarii including your fleet surgeons medical reports the ones she kept in her cabin not in her sick bay office they were not easy to obtain ive been waiting for them they came in last night he had a third observer i might have known i should have figured it do you want to try to play any more little guessing games about this illyan added dryly no sir miles whispered he hadnt meant it to come out a whisper no more games good illyan rocked slightly in his station chair and tossed the card back to the desktop his face looked like death itself miles wondered what his own face looked like as wideeyed as an animal in the headlights as viewed from a groundcar traveling toward it at a hundred kilometers an hour he suspected thisillyan pointed to the ciphercardwas a betrayal of the subordinates who depended on you as well as of the superiors who trusted you and it was a knowing betrayal proved on lieutenant vorbergs body do you have anything to say in your defense if the tactical situation was bad change your ground if you cant win change the rules miles s internal tension shot him up out of his chair to pace back and forth before illyans desk his voice rose i have served you body and bloodand ive bled plentyfor nine years sir ask the marilacans how well ive served you ask a hundred others over thirty missions and only two that could remotely be classified as failures ive laid my life on the line dozens of times ive literally laid it down does that suddenly count for nothing now it countsillyan inhaledfor much thats why i am offering you a medical discharge without prejudice if you resign now resign quit this is your idea of a favor impsec has made worse scandals than this disappeari know you can do more than that if you choose its the best way not just for you but for your names sake i have thought this through from every angle ive been thinking about it for weeks this is why he called me home no mission there never was only this i was screwed from before the beginning no chance after serving your father for thirty years illyan continued i can do no less and no more miles froze my father asked for this he knows not yet apprising him is a task i leave to you this is one last report i do not care to make rare cowardice on illyans part and a fearsome punishment my fathers influence said miles bitterly some favor believe me without your record you so justly quote even your father could not gain you this mercy from me your career will end quietly with no public scandal yeah miles panted real convenient it shuts me up and gives me no appeal i advisewith all my heartagainst your forcing this to a courtmartial you will never get a more favorable judgment than this private one between us it is with no intent to be humorous that i tell you you havent a leg to stand on illyan tapped the ciphercard for emphasis indeed there was no amusement at all in his face on the documented evidence here alone never mind the rest of it youd be lucky to get out with only a dishonorable discharge and no further sentence atop it have you discussed this with gregor miles demanded imperial favor his last emergency defense the one hed sworn hed die rather than call upon yes at great length i was closeted with him all this morning over nothing but this oh illyan gestured at his comconsole i have your records ready for you to sign out here and now palmprint retinascan and its done your uniforms didnt come from military stores so need not be returned and it is traditional to keep ones insignia but im afraid i must ask you to hand in your silver eyes miles turning on his heel aborted the halfgesture of his agitated hands reaching to clamp defensively to his collar not my eyes its not true i can explain i can the edges and surfaces of the objects in the room the comconsole desk the chairs illyans face seemed suddenly sharper than before as if imbued with some heightened measure of reality a nimbus of green fire broke up into colored confetti closing over him no he came to consciousness flat on his back on illyans carpet illyans blooddrained face hovered over him tense and worried something was lodged in miless mouthhe turned his head and spat out a stylus a lightpen from illyans desk his collar was unfastenedhis hand reached to touch itbut his silver eyes were still in place he just lay there for a moment well he said thinly at last i imagine that was quite a show how long aboutillyan glanced at his chronofour minutes about standard lie still ill call a medic i dont need a goddamn medic i can walk he tried to get up one leg buckled and he went down again face mashed in the carpet his face was stickyhed evidently hit his mouth which was swelling on the first fall and his nose which was bleeding illyan handed him a handkerchief and he pressed it to his face after about a minute he suffered illyan to help him back into the chair illyan halfsat on the edge of his desk watching him watching over him always you knew said illyan and you lied to me in writing in that damned falsified report you pissed away everything id have mistrusted my memory chip before i mistrusted you why miles were you that panicked the anguish leaked into that level voice like blood into a bruise yes i was that panicked i didnt want to lose naismith i didnt want to lose everything it doesnt matter now he fumbled at his collar one pin tore the green fabric coming off in his shaking hands he thrust the pins blindly at illyan there you win illyans hand closed over them god save me he said softly from another such victory fine good give me the readpad give me the retinal scan lets get this the hell over with im sick of impsec and eating impsec shit no more good the shaking didnt stop radiating outward in hot waves from the pit of his belly he was terrified he was about to start crying in front of illyan illyan sat back his closed hand turning inward take a couple of minutes to compose yourself take as long as you need then go into my washroom and wash your face im not unlocking my door till youre fit to go out strange mercies illyan you kill me so courteously but he nodded and stumbled to illyans little lavatory illyan followed him to the door then apparently deciding he would stay on his feet this time left him alone the face in the mirror was indeed unfit to be seen bloody and ravaged it was very like the face he had last seen looking back at him the day sergeant beatrice had been killed except about a hundred years older now illyan will not shame a great name neither should i he washed carefully though he failed to get all the bloodstains out of his torn collar and the creamcolored shirt opened under it he returned to sit docilely and let illyan hand him the readpad for his palmprint administer the retinal scan and record his brief formal words of resignation all right let me out he said quietly miles youre still shaking i will be for a while yet it will pass let me out please ill call a car and walk you to it you shouldnt be alone oh yes i should very well do you wish to go directly to a hospital you ought to as a properly discharged veteran youre entitled to impmil treatment in your own right not just in your fathers name i figured that would be important no i wish to go home ill deal with it later its chronic not critical probably be another month before it happens again if it runs to form you should go to a hospital youmiles eyed himhave just lost your authority over my actions may i remind you simon illyans hand opened in troubled acquiescence he walked back around his desk and pressed the keypad that unlocked his door he rubbed his hand over his own face for a moment as if to wipe away all emotion and the water standing in his eyes miles fancied he could almost feel the coolness of that evaporation across illyans round cheekbones when illyan turned back his face was as bland and closed as miles had ever seen it god my heart hurts and his head and his stomach and every other part of him he climbed to his feet and walked to the door shrugging away illyan s hesitant hand under his elbow the door hissed open revealing three men standing in anxious guard near it illyans secretary general haroche and captain galeni galenis brows rose looking at miles miles could tell exactly when he noticed the insigniastripped collar for his eyes widened in shock cripes duv what dyou think that hed had a fistfight with illyan along with the screaming match that an enraged illyan had torn those impsec eyes forcibly from miless tunic circumstantial evidence can be so convincing haroches lips parted in a breath of disturbed surprise what the hell his hand opened in question to illyan excuse us illyan met no ones eyes pushing through the assembled impsec officers all wheeled to stare after the pair as they made it to the corridor and turned left chapter seven conscious of the impsec drivers eyes following him miles walked carefully through the front door of vorkosigan house he did not let his shoulders sag until the doors closed safely behind him he fell into the first chair he came to on top of its cover it was another hour before he stopped shivering not the growing darkness but bladder pressure at last drove him to his feet our bodies are our masters we their prisoners free the prisoners once up and moving his only desire was to be still againi should get drunk its traditional for situations like this isnt it he collected a bottle of brandy from the cellar wine seemed inadequately poisonous this burst of activity dwindled to rest in the smallest room he could find a fourthfloor chamber which but for its window might have passed for a closet it was a former servants room but it had an old wing chair in it after going to all the trouble to find the brandy he had not the ambition left to open the bottle he crouched down small in the big chair on his next trip to his bathroom sometime after midnight he picked up his grandfathers dagger and brought it back with him to set it beside the sealed brandy bottle on the lamp table by his left hand the dagger tempted him as little as the drink but toying with it did provide a few moments of interest he let the light slide over the blade and pressed it against his wrists his throat along the thin scars from his cryonic prep already slashed there definitely the throat if anything all or nothing no playing around but hed died once already and it hadnt helped death held neither mystery nor hope and there lurked the horrible possibility that those who had sacrificed so much to revive him the last time would be inspired to try it again and botch it or rather botch it even worse hed seen halfsuccessful cryorevivals vegetable or animal minds whining brokenly in oncehuman bodies no he didnt want to die at least not where his body could ever be found he just couldnt bear being alive right now the sanctuary in between the two organic states sleep refused to come to him but if he sat here long enough eventually he must sleep surely get up get up and run as fast as you can back to the dendarii before impsec or anyone could stop him now was his chance naismiths chance naismiths last chance go go go he sat on muscles knotted the litany of escape beating in his head he discovered that if he drank no water he didnt need to get up so often he still didnt sleep but in the predawn his thoughts began to slow a thought an hour that was all right light seeped into the room again through the window making the lamplight grow pale and wan a quadrangle of sun crept slowly across the worn patterned rug as slowly as his thoughts left to center to right then gone the sounds of the city outside softened with the oncoming twilight but his little bubble of personal darkness remained as insulated from the world as any cryochamber distant voices were calling his name its ivan blech i dont want to talk to ivan he did not respond if he said and did nothing maybe they wouldnt find him maybe theyd go away again dryeyed he stared at a crack in the aging plastered wall which had been in his line of sight for hours but his ploy didnt work booted footsteps sounded in the corridor outside the little chamber then ivans voice shouting much too loud hurting his ears in here duv i found him more footsteps a quick heavy stride ivans face wove into his field of vision blocking the wall ivan grimaced miles you in there boy galenis voice my god dont panic said ivan hes just gone and got himself sensibly drunk he picked up the sealed bottle well maybe not he prodded the unsheathed knife beside it hm illyan was right muttered galeni not necessarily said ivan after about the twentyfifth time you see this you stop getting excited about it its just something he does if he were going to kill himself hed have done it years ago youve seen him like this before well maybe not quite like this ivans strained face occluded the plaster again he waved a hand in front of miless eyes he didnt blink galeni noted nervously perhaps we ought not to touch him dont you think we should call for medical help you mean psychiatric absolutely notreal bad idea if the psych boys ever got hold of him theyd never let him go no this is a family matter ivan straightened decisively i know what to do come on is it all right to leave him alone sure if he hasnt moved for a day and a half he isnt going far ivan paused bring the knife along though just in case they clattered out again miless slow thoughts worked through it one thought per quarter hour theyre gone good maybe they wont come back but then alas they reappeared ill take his shoulders ivan directed you take his feet no better pull his boots off first galeni did so at least hes not rigid no quite limp rigidity would require effort the boots thumped to the floor ivan took off his own uniform tunic rolled up the sleeves of the roundcollared shirt under it slipped his hands under miless armpits and lifted galeni took his feet as instructed hes lighter than i thought said galeni yeah but you should see mark now said ivan the two men carried him down the narrow servants stairs between the fourth floor and the third maybe they were going to put him to bed that would save him a bit of trouble maybe he would go to sleep there maybe if he were very lucky he wouldnt wake up again until the next century when there would be nothing left of his name and his world but a distorted legend in mens minds but they continued on past miless bedroom door and bumped him through into an old bathroom down the hall one that had never been remodeled it contained an antique iron tub large enough for small boys to swim in at least a century old they plan to drown me even better i shall let them one two three on three said ivan to galeni just three said galeni all right they swung him over the edge for the first time miles glimpsed what waited for him below his body tried to spasm but his unused locked muscles foiled him and his dry throat blocked his cry of outrage about a hundred liters of water with about fifty kilos of ice cubes floating in it he plunged downward into the crashing cold ivans long arms thrust him under all the way he came up yelling ice wat ivan shoved him back in again on his next breath ivan you goddamn fri on the third emergence his voice found expression in a wordless howl ah ha ivan chortled happily i thought that would get a rise out of you he added aside to galeni who had ducked away out of range of the wild splashing ever since that time he spent at camp permafrost as a weather officer theres nothing he hates worse than cold back you go boy miles fought his way out of ivans grip spat freezing water clambered up and fell out over the side of the tub ice cubes stuck here and there to the outside of his sodden uniform tunic and slithered down his neck his hand drew back in a fist and shot upward at his cousins grinning face it connected with ivans chin with a satisfying meaty thunk the pain was delicious it was the first time in his life hed ever successfully slugged ivan hey ivan yelped ducking backwards miless second swing missed as ivan now prudently held him at arms length out of miless range i thought that sort of thing broke your arm not anymore miles panted he stopped swinging and stood shivering ivan rubbed his jaw brows rising feeling better now he asked after a moment miles answered with a spate of swearing plucking off and throwing a few last clinging ice cubes from his tunic at ivans head along with the curses glad to hear it said ivan genially now im going to tell you what youre going to do and youre going to do it first thing is youre going to go to your room and take off that wet uniform then depilate that repellent beard stubble and get a hot shower and then youre going to get dressed and then were going to take you out to dinner dont want to go out miles mumbled surly did i ask for an argument did you hear me ask for a betan vote duv galeni watching in fascination shook his head right ivan continued i dont want to hear it and you dont have a choice ive got another fifty kilos of ice tucked in the freezer downstairs and you know i wont hesitate to use it miles could read the utter indeed enthusiastic sincerity of this threat in ivans face his bad words trailed off into a disagreeable but not disagreeing hiss you enjoyed that he grumbled at last damn straight said ivan now go get dressed ivan made few further demands upon miles until he had dragged him out to a nearby restaurant there he made sotto voce threats until miles put a few bites of food into his mouth chewed and swallowed once he started eating he found he was very hungry and ivan desisted satisfied with his performance now said ivan shoveling in the last bite of his own dessert what the hell is going on with you miles glanced up at the two captains at galenis eyeofhorus pins you first did illyan send you both he asked me to check on you said galeni having got the idea that we were friends of a sort since the gate guard reported you had gone in but never come out and you didnt answer your comconsole after repeated calls and messages i thought id better take a look in person i felt less than comfortable invading vorkosigan house by myself so i rounded up ivan whom i construed as having a family right to be there on the authorization i had from illyan the gate guard overrode your locks and let us in so we didnt have to break a window galeni hesitated i also didnt fancy having to pull your body down from a rafter somewhere all by myself told you not said ivan not his style if he ever does do himself in im betting itll be something that involves large explosions and lots of innocent bystanders probably miles and ivan exchanged sneers i wasnt so sure said galeni you didnt see him ivan when he came out of illyans office the last time i saw anybody who looked that shocky was a fellow i helped pull out of his crashed lightflyer ill explain it miles sighed but not here some more private place too much of it has to do with business he glanced away from galenis silver eyes my former business right agreed galeni blandly they ended up back in the kitchen at vorkosigan house miles hoped dimly ivan would help him get drunk but his cousin brewed tea instead and made him drink two cups for rehydration before settling down astride a chair his arms crossed on the back and saying all right give you know you have to yes i know miles closed his eyes briefly wondering where to begin the beginning would probably do excuses and denials all so well practiced boiled up in his head the taste of them balanced on his tongue was more loathsome than clean confession and more lingering the shortest way between two points was a straight line after my cryorevival last year i had a problem i started getting these seizures convulsions lasting two to five minutes they seemed to be triggered by moments of extreme stress my surgeon stated that like the memory loss they might right themselves they were rare and seemed to be tailing off as promised so i didnt mention it to my impsec doctors when i came home oh shit murmured ivan i see where this is going did you tell anyone mark knew you told mark but not me i could trust mark to do what i asked of him i could only trust you to do what you thought was right hed said almost the same thing to quinn hadnt he god ivans lips twitched but he did not deny it you can see why i was afraid it might be a oneway ticket to a medical discharge at worst a desk job at best and no more dendarii mercenaries no more field work but i thought if i or rather my dendarii surgeon could fix it quietly illyan need never be the wiser she gave me some medication i thought it was working no no excuses dammit and illyan caught up with you and canned you for it isnt that a little extreme after all youve done for him theres more ah my last mission we went to pry a kidnapped impsec courier out of the hands of some hijackers out past zoave twilight i wanted to supervise the rescue personally i was wearing my combat armor i had an episode right in the middle of the operation my suits plasma arc locked on i damn near cut the poor courier in half but he was lucky i just lopped off his legs instead ivans jaw dropped then closed i see no you dont not yet that was merely criminally stupid what i did next was fatal i falsified my mission report claimed the accident with vorberg was an equipment malfunction galenis breath drew in sharply illyan said youd resigned by request but he didnt say whose request or why and i didnt dare ask i didnt believe it i thought it might be the start of some new scam an internal investigation or something except i dont think even you could have faked the look on your face ivan was still processing it you lied to illyan yeah and then i documented my lie anything worth doing is worth doing well yes i didnt resign ivan i was fired on all of barrayar right now there is no one more fired than i am did he really rip off your silver eyes ivans own eyes were round who said that galeni grunted looked like it haroche thought so worse he was crying ivan in all his life miles had never seen illyan weep no i did that myself i did it all to myself he hesitated i had my last seizure in his office right in front of him i think i mentioned they seem to be triggered by stress ivans face screwed up in a sympathetic wince galeni blew out his breath haroche couldnt believe it either he said everyone at impsec hq knew illyan thought you shit gold bars naismith was the best oh yes after the dagoola iv operation he damn well should have thought so but the dagoola rescue had been almost four years ago so what have you shit for me lately i take it thats a direct quote from haroche mm he can be blunt he doesnt exactly suffer fools gladly im told he came up through the ranks he said you were being groomed as illyans successor miless brows rose in startlement impossible being a desk driver requires very different qualities than being a field agent a diametrically opposed attitude to the rules for starters im not wasnt nearly ready for illyans job so haroche said your next posting was to be his assistant it seems five years on the domestic side and youd have been ready to step up when illyan was ready to retire rubbish not domestic affairs now if i had to fly a desk galactic affairs on komarr would actually make sense i have some experience there that gap in your experience was exactly what they hoped to target by harnessing you with haroche illyan once told me haroche was personally responsible while he was a domestic affairs agent for derailing no less than four serious plots against the emperors life not including the yarrow incident which won him his chiefship maybe illyan hoped whatever haroche has would rub off on you i dont need miles began and shut his mouth whats the yarrow incident asked ivan and if its that important why havent i heard of it a textbook case in counterterrorism said galeni illyan has all his new analysts study it the case is famous inside impsec miles explained being a success however its practically unknown outside impsec its the nature of the job successes are secret and thankless failures are splashy and gain you only blame take my career for example it was a close call said galeni a hyperisolationist faction aligned with count vortrifrani plotted to suicidedrop an old jumpfreighter named the yarrow square on the imperial residence it would have taken out most of the place even without the explosives theyd packed it with the explosives were their one mistake since that was the loose thread that led haroche s team to them vortrifrani distanced himself like crazy but it broke up his support and the imperium has been less ah embarrassed by him since ivan blinked my mothers flat isnt far from the residence yes one wonders how many people in vorbarr sultana theyd have taken out if theyd missed their drop point thousands miles muttered ill have to remember to thank haroche next time i see him said ivan sounding impressed i was offworld at the time miles sighed as usual he suppressed an irrational twinge of jealousy nobody ever said anything to me about this proposed promotion when was this vile little surprise supposed to be sprung within the year apparently i thought id made the dendarii too valuable for impsec to even dream of doing anything else with me so you did a little too good a job chief of impsec at age thirtyfive huh god be praised im saved from that at least well no joy to haroche to be required to paper train some vor puppy for the express purpose of being promoted over his head he ought to be quite relieved galeni said apologetically i gather he was actually ha said miles blackly he added after a moment by the way duv i trust its obvious that what ive told you is private information the official version for impsec hq and everywhere else was that i was medically discharged without prejudice so illyan said when haroche asked illyan was tightlipped as hell but you could see there had to be more to it ivan excused himself miles brooded into his teacup he thought he could sleep now in fact there was nothing he wanted more ivan returned all too soon and dumped down a valise beside the kitchen table whats that miles asked suspiciously my things said ivan for a couple of days youre not moving in what dont you have enough space youve got more rooms than a hotel miles miles slumped again recognizing an argument he wasnt going to win theres a thought for my next career vorkosigans bed and breakfast rooms cheap ivan cocked an eyebrow hell no charge em a fortune he paused so when are you planning to move back out not until you get some people in here till you get your head fixed you certainly need a driver at the very least i saw your lightflyer downstairs in the garage by the way in the shop for adjustments my ass and somebody to cook meals and stand over you and see you eat them and somebody to clean up after you i dont make that much mess and clean up after all the other somebodies ivan went on relentlessly this place needs a staff miles just like any other museum eh i dont know if youre saying you dont know if you want them guess what you dont have a choice if youre saying you dont know how to hire them want my mother to do it for you er i think id rather select my own personnel shed make it all too right and proper to use sergeant botharis old phrase there it is do it or ill have her do it for you hows that for a threat effective right then dont you think i could get by with just one person to do everything drive cook ivan snorted chase after you and make you take your nasty medicine for that youd need to hire a baba to find you a wife why dont you just start with a driver and cook and go on from there miles grimaced tiredly look said ivan youre a bleeding vor lord in vorbarr sultana we own this town so live like one have some fun for a change have you lost your mind ivan youre not a guest in vorkosigan house miles youre its only child or you were till mark came along and he has his own private fortune at least widen your possibilities you grew so narrow working for illyan its like you hardly had a life at all lately thats quite right naismith had all the life but naismith was dead nowkilled by that needle grenade on jacksons whole after all though the doubletake of realization had required a full year to run its course miles had read of mutants twins born joined together inseparably in their bodies sometimes horrifically one died first leaving the other attached to a corpse for hours or days until they died too lord vorkosigan and admiral naismith bodybound twins i dont want to think about this anymore i dont want to think at all lets go to bed ivan its late isnt it late enough said ivan chapter eight miles slept till midmorning the next day to his dismay when he threaded the labyrinth of the house down to the kitchen he found ivan sitting drinking coffee his breakfast dishes piled in the sink dont you have to go to work miles inquired pouring the chewy dregs from the coffeemaker into his cup i have a few days personal leave ivan informed him how many as many as i need as many as he needed that is to satisfy himself that miles was going to behave properly miles thought it through so if he hired that unwanted staff ivan relieved of the deathwatch would slope off home to his neat little flatwhich incidentally had no staff underfoot only a discreet cleaning service then miles could fire the staff that is discharge them again with suitably glowing recommendations and a bonus yeah that would work have you communicated to your parents about this yet ivan asked no not yet you ought to before they get some garbled version through some other source so i ought its not easy he glanced up at ivan i dont suppose you could absolutely not cried ivan in a tone of horror after a moment of silence he relented to the measure of a well if you really cant but id rather not ill think about it miles slopped the last of the greenish coffee into his cup trudged back upstairs and dressed in a loose embroidered backcountrystyle shirt and dark trousers which he found in the back of his closet hed last worn them three years ago at least they werent tight while ivan wasnt around he pulled all his barrayaran uniforms and boots out of his closet and bundled them into storage in an unused guest room down the hall so he wouldnt have to look at them every time he opened his closet door after a long hesitation he exiled his dendarii mercenary uniforms likewise the few clothes left hanging seemed lonely and forlorn he settled himself at his comconsole in his bedroom a message to his parents ah god and he ought to send one to elli quinn too would he ever get the chance to make it right again with her facetoface body to body it was a horribly complex thing to attempt via a comconsole message just his thin electronic ghost mouthing words illchosen or misunderstood weeks out of synchrony and all his messages to the dendarii were monitored by impsec censors i cant face this now ill do it later soon i promise he turned his thoughts instead to the less daunting problem of vorkosigan house staffing so what was the budget for this project his lieutenants medicaldischarge halfpay would barely cover the salary and board of one fulltime servant even with a free room thrown in at least of the sorts of superior folk normally employed by the aristocracy in the capitalhe would be competing with sixty other district counts households in that labor market here a host of lesser lordlings and the sort of new industrial wealthy nonvor who were presently carrying off such a distressing percentage of eligible vor maidens to preside over their homes in the style to which they aspired miles tapped in a comconsole code the pleasant smiling face of the vorkosigans business manager tsipis appeared with startling promptness over the vid plate upon miless call reaching his office in hassadar good morning lord vorkosigan i was not aware you had returned from your offplanet duty how may i serve you he was not yet aware of miless medical discharge either apparently miles felt too weary to explain even the editedforpublicconsumption version of events so only said yes i got in a few weeks ago it looks like im going to be downside longer than id anticipated what funds can i draw upon did father leave you any instructions all of it said tsipis excuse me i dont understand all of the accounts and funds were made joint with you just before the count and countess departed for sergyar just in case you are your fathers executor you know yes but he hadnt thought sergyar was that wild a frontier um what can i do its much easier to say what you cant do you cant sell the entailed properties namely the residence at hassadar and vorkosigan house you can buy whatever you wish of course or sell anything your grandfather left you solely in your own name so can i afford to hire a fulltime driver oh my yes you could afford to staff vorkosigan house in full the funds are there piling up arent they needed for the viceroys palace on sergyar countess vorkosigan has tapped a certain amount of her private moneys apparently for some redecorating project but your father is only maintaining his twenty armsmen at present everything else on sergyar comes out of the imperial budget oh tsipis brightened are you thinking of reopening vorkosigan house my lord that would be splendid it was such a fine sight last year at winterfair when i dined there not at present tsipis drooped ah he murmured in a tone of disappointment then a look of belated enlightenment came over his face my lord do you need money er yes that was what i had in mind to like pay a driver maybe a cook pay bills buy things a suitable living allowance you know his impsec pay accumulating in his lengthy absences on duty had always been more than enough he wondered how much to ask tsipis for but of course how would you like it a weekly deposit into your service account perhaps no id like a new account separate just to me as lord vorkosigan excellent thinking your father is always very careful to keep his personal and imperial funds identifiably separated its a good habit to start not that the most foolhardy imperial auditor would ever have dared to take him on of course nor have looked anything but a fool afterwards when the numbers were laid out tsipis tapped on his comconsole and glanced aside at some data readout suppose i transfer the entire accumulated unused household fund over into your new account for seed money and then just send the usual weekly allotment to follow fine now if you need any more do call me right away sure ill send you your new account chit by courier within the hour thank you miles reached to cut the com then added as an afterthought how much is it five thousand marks oh good and eighty thousand marks to start tsipis added miles did a quick mental reversal and calculation this place was sucking down five thousand marks a week oh much more than that with the armsmen and the countesss personal account and this does not include major repairs which are budgeted separately i see now should you take an interest i should be happy to go over all your financial affairs with you in much more detail tsipis added eagerly theres so much that could be done with a somewhat more aggressive entrepreneurial and dare i say less conservative and more inventive approach if i ever have the time thank you tsipis miles quit the com much less casually good god he could buy damn near anything he wanted he tried to think of something he wanted the dendarii yeah we know but their price for him wasnt measured in money what else once in his increasingly distant youth hed lusted briefly after a lightflyer faster and redder than ivans a particularly fine model albeit several years old now sat in the garage downstairs only lightly used of course he couldnt fly it at all now it was never what i wanted to buy that held my hearts hope it was what i wanted to be what had that been well an admiral of course a barrayaran one by age one year younger than when his father had become the youngest in postisolation history at age despite miless height and in the teeth of his handicaps but even had he been abnormal of body his era had brought him no convenient major wars to speed promotion impsec covert ops had been the best he could do not just the one branch of the service that would take him but the only one that could put him in the forefront of the only significant action presently available how could you be a great man if history brought you no great events or brought you to them at the wrong time too young too old too damaged he turned to his list of five retired vorkosigan armsmen living in the vorbarr sultana area though elderly an armsman with his wife perhaps to cook would be the ideal solution to his problem he wouldnt have to teach them anything about vorkosigan houses routine and theyd have no objection to a shortterm gig he began coding his calls maybe ill get lucky on the first try one was too doddering to drive anymore himself the other fours wives all said no or rather no it wasnt as if he were in the heat of battle he could not justify invoking certain archaic loyalty oaths with a snort he gave it up and went to collect last nights scraps from the kitchen in his ongoing campaign to convince zap the cat to not snatch food with razor claws run under a chair and growl through her gorge but rather eat daintily and sit on ones lap and purr gratefully afterwards like a proper vor cat in all there was a lot about zap that reminded miles of his clonebrother mark and hed done all right with mark in the end it wouldnt hurt to let the gate guard know about tsipiss courier too miles arrived to find the gate guard had a visitor a tall blond young man who bore a notable if softer resemblance to the sharperfeatured corporal kosti he also bore a large lacquered box good morning or should i say afternoon sir the guard greeted him with a vague aborted salute almost worthy of an hq analyst belatedly recognizing the fact that miles wore no uniform um may i introduce my younger brother martin youre not old enough to have a younger brother hello miles stuck out his hand the blond youth shook it without hesitation though is eyes did widen a bit looking down at miles uh hello lieutenant lord vorkosigan nobodyd briefed kosti either it appeared the corporal was too far down in the hierarchy maybe miles glanced away from the impsec silver eyes on kostitheelders stiff collar well get it over with no more the lieutenant im afraid ive just mustered out of the service altogether medical discharge oh im sorry to hear that simy lord the gate guard sounded quite sincere but he did not demand embarrassing explanations nobody looking at miles would question the medical discharge story zap oozed from under the kiosks chair and growled lightly at miles whom she was growing to recognize that hairy beast isnt getting any friendlier is she said miles just fatter im not surprised said corporal kosti every time we change shifts she tries to convince whoever is coming on duty shes been starved by the last man miles offered a scrap which zap deigned to accept in the usual manner and then retreated to scarf her spoils miles sucked on the scratch on the back of his thumb clearly shes training to be a guard cat if only we could teach her to tell friend from foe he stood up again nobody wants to hire me for just two months martin said to his brother evidently continuing a conversation miles s arrival had interrupted miless brow rose looking for work are you martin looking to turn eighteen and apply to the service said martin stoutly ive two more months to wait but my mother said if i dont find something for me to do in the meanwhile she will and im afraid it has something do with cleaning wait till you meet your first master sergeant kid youll find out about cleaning i cleaned drains on kyril island once miles reminisced i was quite good at it you my lord martins eyes grew round miless lips crimped it was exciting i found a body oh martin settled impsec business right not at the time his first sergeant will straighten him out the corporal confided confidently to miles he treats me as an honorable veteran he does not know oh yes the two insiders grinned malevolently at the wouldbe apprentice the service is getting pickier with its recruits these days i hope you didnt slack your schoolwork no my lord said martin if true this one would be a shooin he had the physique for a ceremonial guard his brother obviously had the brains to be a real one well good luck to you better luck than mine no unjust to use his daily gift of breath to complain about his luck so martin can you drive of course my lord lightflyer a slight hesitation ive done a bit i happen to be in temporary need of a driver really my lord do you thinkcould i perhaps the corporals forehead crinkled in mild dismay its part of my job to keep him alive martin you wouldnt embarrass me would you martin gave him a brotherly curl of the lip but disdained interestingly to rise to the bait his attention was on miles when could i start any time i suppose today if you like yes he needed to at least go to the grocery and get another crate of reddimeals there probably wouldnt be much to do at first but i wouldnt know in advance when i wanted you so id like you to live in you could spend your spare time studying up for your service entrance evaluations plus of course the medical watch would the acquisition of the possiblymorepliable martin be enough to displace ivan he would have to apprise martin of that extra little detail of his job later no sooner the next attack could happen any time unfair to hit the kid with a convulsing employer and no warning elli quinn would agree i cant drive myself ive been having trouble with seizures an afteraffect of an acute case of death i picked up last year courtesy of a wellaimed needle grenade the cryorevival almost worked the corporal looked enlightened i never thought a couriers job was the feather bed some people make it out to be martin stared down at him in utter fascination almost as impressed as hed been by the draincleaning confession you were dead my lord so they tell me what was it like i dont know said miles shortly i missed it he relented slightly being alive again hurt though wow martin shoved the lacquer box toward his brother zap the cat emerged again to roll backwards across the mirrorpolished toes of the corporals boots purring wildly waving her claws in the air and glaring at the box calm down zap youll set off the alarms said the corporal amused he set the box down on the kiosks tiny table and released the lid somewhat absently he tore off the cover of his serviceissue readymeal lunch and set it on the floor zap sniffed it and returned to clawing his booted leg and looking longingly at the lacquered box the inside of the box lid turned into a clever tray or plate with little compartments onto it kosti placed two temperaturecontrolled jugs a bowl and cups there followed an assortment of sandwiches on two different kinds of bread with variously colored fillings cut into circle star and square shapes the crusts removed carved fruit on a stick buttery cookies and round tarts with flaky fluted sugarsprinkled crusts oozing dark thick fruit syrups from one of the jugs kosti poured a pinkish cream soup into the bowl from the other some spicy hot drink both steamed in the cool air for zap the cat there was a wad of prettily tied green leaves that unfolded to reveal a meat paste of some kind apparently the same as filled one of the sandwiches zap dived in the moment kosti spread it on the floor growling ecstatically tail lashing miles stared in amazement and swallowed saliva what is all that corporal my lunch said kosti simply m mother sends it over every day he batted away a brotherly paw descending on one sandwich hey you can get yours at home this is mine he glanced up a little uncertainly at miles technically impsec personnel on duty were not supposed to eat anything but impsecissued rations to avoid any attacks through ingestible drugs or poisons but if you couldnt trust your mother and brother who could you trust besides it wasnt miless officerly job to enforce impsec regs in idiotic situations anymore your mother makes all that every day mostly said kosti with my sisters married of course and just martin left in the house i think shes getting a little bored corporal kosti martin miles took a deep breath laden with delectable aromas do you think your mother would like a job things are looking up said ivan judiciously over their lunch the next day ma kosti had deposited her artistic offering and withdrawn from the yellow parlor possibly to bring the next load several minutes later he added muffled around a full mouth what are you paying her miles told him double it said ivan decisively or youll lose her after your first dinner party someone will hire her away or kidnap her not with her son as my gate guard besides im not planning any dinner parties that would be a shame want me to no miles weakened possibly a subtle and sinister effect of the spiced peach tart melting in his mouth not at present anyway he smiled slowly but in the department of great leaders of history you can tell everyone with perfect truth that lord vorkosigan eats the same food as his gate guard and driver a contract with ivans cleaning service to send in people twice a week completed the staffing of vorkosigan house to ivans convenience but as a ploy to get rid of ivan miles realized the acquisition of ma kosti had proved a slight miscalculation he should have hired a bad cook if ivan would only leave miles could go back to brooding in peace he couldnt lock his bedroom door and not answer it without it being an invitation to ivan to break it down and there was a limit to how much he could snarl and sulk without risking another icewater dip at least ivan could start going back to work in the daytime miles thought he tried a broad hint over dinner most men he quoted are of naught more use in their lives but as machines for turning food into shit ivan cocked an eyebrow at him who said that your grandfather leonardo da vinci miles returned primly but was compelled to add grandfather quoted it to me though thought so said ivan satisfied sounds just like the old general he was a monster in his day wasnt he ivan put another bite of roast dripping with wine sauce into his mouth and started chewing ivan was a pain the last thing a monster wanted was a fellow to follow him around all day long with a mirror the days had blended formlessly into a week before miles found a message from the outside world on his comconsole he hit the replay and the fineboned face of lady alys vorpatril composed itself over his vid plate hello miles she began i was very sorry to hear about your medical discharge i know it must be a great disappointment to you after all your efforts credit to ivan he had certainly not told her the whole story or her condolences would have been much differently phrased she dismissed his utter destruction with an airy wave and went on to her own concerns at gregor s request i am hostessing an intimate luncheon in the residences south garden tomorrow afternoon he has asked me to invite you he asks you to come an hour early for a personal conference id take that as requests and requires your attendance rather than just invites if i were you on that first matter or so i read it between the lines though he was all softvoiced about it the way he gets sometimes you know rsvp immediately you get this message please she cut the com miles bent and rested his forehead on the cool edge of the comconsole hed known this moment must come it was inherent in choosing to live gregor was giving him the opportunity to formally apologize they had to clear the air sooner or later if only as count of his district someday miles was going to be around vorbarr sultana for a long time yet he wished he might render his apology in the old archaic bellysticking sense in absentia it would be easier and less painful why didnt they just leave me dead the first time he sighed sat up and punched in lady alyss number on the com chapter nine count vorkosigans armored groundcar sighed to the pavement under the east portico of the imperial residence martin looked nervously back over his shoulder toward the gates and the gesturing guards clustered around them are you sure thats going to be all right my lord dont worry about it said miles seated beside him in the drivers compartment theyll have that little bit of wroughtiron straightened back up and repainted before im ready to be picked up again i wager martin made to pop the canopy or at least hunted valiantly for the control to do so in the gleaming array before him miles pointed thanks martin muttered the canopy rose miles escaped with his life martin tell you what while im engaged in here why dont you take this barge for a practice spin around the city he dropped the groundcars comm link into his pocket ill call you back when i need you if youmiles deleted run into a have a problem call me no he suspected he would shortly be praying for interruptions to his upcoming interview with gregor but it was cheating to prearrange them call this number he leaned over and tapped a code into the cars elaborate console this will get you a very competent gentleman named tsipis nice fellow hell tell you what to do yes my lord watch your forward momentum the power in this beast fools you the heavyduty fuel cells add mass almost as badly as the armoring does the handling is quite deceptive take it out someplace where you have a lot of space and experiment so it wont surprise you again uh thank you sir the canopy hissed shut through the polarized halfmirroring miles could see martin suck on his lip in concentration as the car rose and moved forward once more the cars silveryreaming left rear edge was undamaged miles noted without surprise another trainee ah yes if hed had his wits about him he could have sent the boy out to practice all last week and avoided that minor embarrassment with gregors gate but martin would do all right once hed been permitted enough experience and the better for not having the unnerving presence of his lordly little new employer at his elbow one of the residences liveried servants met miles at the door and escorted him to the north wing they were headed for gregors private office then the north wing was the only section of the sprawling imperial residence less than two hundred years old it had been burned to the ground during the war of vordarians pretendership the year of miless soltoxingasdamaged birth and subsequently rebuilt the emperors groundfloor office was one of gregors few truly private and personal spaces the decoration was spare the limited artwork all purchased from rising young artists who were actually still alive and there wasnt an antique in it gregor was standing by a tall heavily draped window staring out at his garden as miles entered had he been watching he wore his vorbarra house uniform today very sharp miles presently feeling allergic to uniforms was underdressed for the residence in some slightly outdated street wear hed rummaged from the back of his closet the servant announced lord vorkosigan and followed himself out gregor nodded and waved miles to a chair miles returned a somewhat leaden smile as gregor seated himself across from him and leaned forward hands clasped on his knees this is as difficult for me as im sure it must be for you gregor began miless smile grew dryer not quite i fancy he murmured gregor grimaced one hand flipped outward as if to bat away the bait i wish you hadnt done it i wish i hadnt done it too gregor continued inconsistently we cannot undo whats done no matter how we might wish it mm if i couldone of those onewish thingsi dont even know that id choose this maybe go back instead to the death of sergeant bothari and undo that right at the beginning i dont know maybe it wouldnt have worked out any better probably not but that was a more innocent mistake if more lethal ive graduated to more calculated stupidities these days his voice was stiff you were on the verge of such great things what a desk job in domestic affairs i beg to differ that was perhaps the sharpest bite in all this tangle that hed sacrificed everything up to and including his integrity to save an identity that was scheduled to be taken away from him within a year anyway if he had known he would have what what huh gregors lips thinned in serious displeasure ive spent a lifetime having my affairs managed by old men you were the first man of my generation i thought i might successfully place in a position of real power and responsibility in the upper echelons of what is ironically called my government and i screwed up yes we know gregor you have to give them this much credit they werent old when they started serving you illyans brevet field promotion to chief of impsec was at what age thirty and he was going to make me wait to thirtyfive the hypocrite gregor was shaking his head if he says miles miles whatever are we going to do with you im walking out of here but what he said instead was so what are you planning to do now almost as bad but miles stayed seated i dont know i need some time off serious time off time to think medical leave and travel time arent really the same thing i request that you not attempt to make independent contact with the dendarii mercenaries i realize that i and impsec combined probably couldnt stop you if you were determined to hijack them and take off but theres no way id be able to save you from a treason charge this time miles managing not to swallow guiltily nodded perfect understanding hed always known that would be a oneway trip the dendarii dont need a commander with convulsions either till i get my head fixedif it can be fixedits a null temptation perhaps fortunately he hesitated then let his primary anxiety surface in the most neutral wording he could muster what will the status of the dendarii fleet be now that would seem to depend on its new commander how will quinn want to play it so gregor was not planning to unilaterally dispose of all of miless creative efforts miles sighed inward relief and chose his next words carefully shed be a fool to throw away ourherimperial retainer and shes nobodys fool i see no reason the fleet cannot continue to be the same resource for impsec under her that they were under me im willing to wait and see how it works out see if she can deliver the successes or not god help you quinn but the dendarii could remain the emperors own even without him yes that was the important part they were not to be abandoned quinns been my apprentice for damn near a decade shes in her midthirties at the peak of her performance shes creative shes determined and she gets amazingly streamlined in emergencies of which shes encountered a fair number in my wake if shes not ready to move up then im not the commander i thought i was gregor nodded shortly very good he inhaled almost visibly changing tack his face grew lighter will you join me for lunch now mlord vorkosigan i appreciate the gesture gregor but must i stay theres someone i want you to meet or rather observe he still values my opinion my judgment lately has been nothing to write home about mm speaking of that have you told your parents about this yet no said miles and added cautiously have you no a glum silence fell for a moment its your job said gregor at last firmly i dont deny it do see to your medical treatment promptly miles i am willing to make that an imperial order if necessary not necessary sire good gregor rose miles perforce rose too they were halfway to the door when miles managed a smallvoiced gregor yes im sorry gregor hesitated then returned a very tiny nod they continued on together in a grassy nook in the south garden enclosed by trees and flowering shrubs a table for four had been set under a fringed muslin awning the weather was cooperating the autumn sun dappling a shade that was perfectly cooled by a faint breath of breeze the noises of the surrounding city seemed muffled and distant as if the garden were embedded in a dream miles slightly disturbed eyed the arrangement as he seated himself at gregors left hand surely he does not mean to honor me with this that would be a mockery right now gregor waved away an anxious liveried servant offering a prelunch selection of drinks they were waiting for someone it appeared enlightenment arrived simultaneously with lady alys vorpatril very correctly dressed for a vor woman in the afternoon in a blue bolero and skirt trimmed with silver that seemeddeliberatelyto bring out the faint streaks of silver in her dark hair she escorted dr laisa toscane neat and stylish in komarran trousers and jacket servants leapt to seat the women then faded discreetly out of sight again good afternoon dr toscane miles said as greetings were exchanged all around we meet again is this your second trip to the residence then my fourth she smiled gregor very kindly invited me to a luncheon meeting last week with minister racozy and some of his staff where i had a chance to present some of my trade groups views and then there was a ceremonial reception for some retiring district officers that was just fascinating gregor miles glanced at alys vorpatril seated on his own left she returned a very bland look the servants began presenting food and the conversation commenced not surprisingly with a few platitudes about komarran affairs it took an almost immediate hard left turn however as gregor and laisa began comparing families and childhoods they were both onlychildren a fact they seemed to find mutually engrossing and worthy of much comparisonanalysis miles had the strong sense of having come in on part or perhaps part of an ongoing serial miless own role seemed limited to occasional confirming murmurs about incidents of the distant past he barely remembered alys normally chatty said almost as little gregor exerted himself to draw laisa out but she held her own gently insisting on a pointforpoint trade of information it was more than miles had heard gregor talk at one time in ages when the cream cakes appeared along with an offering of five kinds of dessert coffees and teas gregor said shyly ive arranged a small surprise for you laisa he made a covert handmotion down at his side an obviously prearranged signal immediately picked up by an attentive liveried man who promptly disappeared around the shrubbery you said youd never seen a horse except in vids the horse is such a symbol of the vor i thought you might like a ride on cue the liveried man returned leading the most gorgeous little white mare miles had ever seen in his life not barring his grandfathers stables of expensive bloodstock bigeyed daintyfooted the hooves were all polished black and the long silvery mane and flowing tail had scarlet ribbons braided in to match the saddlecloth not to mention the scarlet embroidered leadline attached to the gilt bridle oh my laisas breath was quite taken away as she ogled the beast may i pet it but i have no idea how to ride but of course gregor escorted her to the mares side she laughed as her hands flew to touch the glossy neck and ran through the shining mane the mares placid eyes halfclosed in calm acceptance of these just attentions ill lead you myself said gregor just at a walk shes very gentle the mare was next door to somnolent in fact in miless judgment gregor was obviously taking no chances on any unpleasant horsy accidents spoiling his show laisa made doubtful fascinated pleasetalkmeintoit noises miles leaned over to lady alys and whispered where did gregor ever find that horse three districts away she murmured back it was flown in to the residence s stables yesterday gregor has been driving his domestic staff to distraction for four days planning every detail of this luncheon ill give you a leg up gregor went on as the groom held the embroidered leadline here let me show you how you bend your leg and i cup it in my hand it took three tries and a good deal of laughter to boost laisa aboard if gregor was trying to cop a feel hed managed to do so with stunning savoir faire she settled into the velvetpadded saddle looking delighted selfconscious and a little proud of herself gregor recovered the line from the groom motioned him away and led off for a tour of the garden paths talking and gesturing miles wideeyed swallowed a large gulp of scalding tea so aunt alys are you playing baba or what its beginning to look like it she said dryly her own eyes following the delicate little cavalcade when did this happen im not quite sure i looked around and there it was ive been scrambling to catch up ever since but alys a komarran for empress it had to be an empress that gregor had in mind alys would never have leant herself as a procurer arent the conservativewing vor lords going to shit themselves not to mention the remaining radical revolutionary komarrans theyll shit themselves sideways please do not use barrackslanguage at the table miles but in answer to your question perhaps the centrist coalition will like it though or could be persuaded to by you or by their wives through you do you mean do you approve her eyes narrowed thoughtfully taking it all in all yes i think i do since your mother would not bestir herself in that department i have by default been supervising gregors bridesearch for the last decade and a frustrating task it has been i mean hed just sit there and stare at me with this dreadful doleful why are you doing this to me look on his face i think ive paraded every tall slim vor beauty on the planet past him at one time or another to the great disruption of their lives and the routines of their families ive offered dozens of resumes nothing worked i swear gregor has been even more frustrating than ivan and ivan has lost so many good opportunities a certain nameless wit or halfwit even whispered i ought to start trying boys but i pointed out that would not solve the heir problem which is the whole point of the exercise in the first place not without a great deal of unprecedented genetic engineering interference miles agreed no not boys not gregor but not a vor either i had that figured out years agoi wish youd have asked me gregors even more closely related to mad emperor yuri than i am and um he knows more about his father the late unlamented crown prince serg than i think my parents might wish he has these historically wellfounded genetic paranoias aboutwellparanoia and about vor inbreeding hed never let himself fall in love with another vor alyss fine dark brows twitched i eventually figured out the vor part for myself it left me with a dilemma as you may imagine so what does he see in dr toscane dyou think besides brains beauty a nice personality a good sense of humor social grace wealth and nonvor genetics that is alys vented a small ladylike snort i think its even simpler and more fundamental than that though i doubt gregor is conscious of it not to imitate one of your mothers annoying betanstyle instant psychoanalyses but gregors mother was murdered when he was five years old her red lips crimped briefly in old pain lady alys had known princess kareen back then look at dr toscanes figure its maternal not a bone in sight anywhere all that time i wasted herding tall slender beauties past him when i should have been rounding up short plump beauties i could cry she ate a decisive bite of cream cake instead miles cleared his throat neutrally gregor and laisa rounded a corner turned away and passed up an alley of topiaried yew trees tall thin gregor strode at laisas stirrup gesturing animatedly smiling and talking laisa leaned halftoward him over the saddlebow eyes shining lips parted listening with all her heart miles feared so miles alys went on her voice cooler tell me about your captain galeni its not clear to me where he fits in all this hes not my captain miles said hes gregors captain but hes your friend according to ivan ivan worked with him much longer than i did quit evading the question i have a feeling its important or could be its as much my job to prevent domestic disasters for gregor as it is simons to prevent security ones or as it was your fathersits minister racozys job now i supposeto prevent political ones simons impsec report claims galeni and dr toscane are not lovers i no i dont think so either he was courting her though thats why i invited them along to the imperial state dinner in the first place to help him out miless imperial luncheon was turning heavy in his belly but they are not formally engaged i dont think so had they talked about matrimony dont know im not exactly intimate with galeni yknow weve just worked together thrown together once by accident in that mess with mark on earth later by assignment during an impsec investigation of a certain nasty incident on komarr i think galeni had marriage on his mind yes but hes a very closed man for a lot of good reasons i think its been hard for him to try to get close to laisa not because of what she is but because of how he is or how hes made himself slow and deliberate and careful lady alys tapped one long enameled fingernail on the lace tablecloth unmarred around her place by crumbs or spills i need to know miles is captain galeni likely to be a problem over this i dont want any more surprises what do you mean by problem be a problem or make a problem alyss softly modulated voice grew edged thats exactly what im asking you i dont know i think he could be hurt im sorry galeni was about to get frigging mangled was what god duv this wasnt what id meant to do for you sorry sorry this is my day to be one sorry sod all right well ultimately its laisas choice said alys judiciously how can poor galeni compete with the emperor she gave him a slightly pitying look if she loves galeni theres no contest if she doesnt then theres no problem right i think my head hurts lady alyss lip curled slightly in covert agreement but her expression returned to its usual pleasant calm as gregor and the pony show approached again gregor helped laisa down managing something suspiciously close to an embrace in the process he handed the horse off to its groom again and another servant brought silver basins for the pair to wash the horse residue if any off their hands a redundant gesture the beast had to have been shampooed to within an inch of its life this morning miles would have had no hesitation about eating his lunch off its gleaming haunches alys made a show of checking her chrono im sorry to break up this delightful afternoon gregor but your meeting with count vortala and minister vann is only twenty minutes from now oh laisa pinkcheeked and consciencestricken scrambled up from the chair shed just reoccupied im keeping you from your work not with lady alys here to remind me of it gregor returned with a glint that made alys s smile thin in turn but gregor rose obediently and bowed over laisas handwas he yes he was going to kiss it in fact he turned it over and brushed his lips on her palm miles crossed his arms and put his own hand over his mouth and bit his tongue laisa closed her hand over the kissed spot like a woman capturing a butterfly and smiled actually she grinned gregor grinned back looking exhilarated alys cleared her throat miles bit harder gregor and laisa exchanged a long and remarkably idiotic look alys broke it up at last took laisa in hand and bore her away saying something brightly about a walk through the lower salons to view the inlaid panels along the way gregor flung himself back halfsideways in his chair one booted leg hooked over the arm swinging well what do you think of her dr toscane i wasnt asking your opinion of your aunt alys miles studied gregors eager smile no this man was not asking for a critique lovely isnt she very intelligent brilliant i wish you could have attended racozys staff meeting her presentation was a model of clarity no doubt with every expert the trade association owned doubtless up all night to help prepare it still miles had run a staff briefing or two himself in his day he respected the effort involved but gregor was not so much soliciting miless opinion as asking for a confirmation of his own i was never a yesman very patriotic gregor burbled on in just the forwardlooking cooperative way your father had always hoped to achieve on komarr yes sire beautiful eyes yes sire miles sighed very um bluegreen why is he doing this to me because the count and countess vorkosigan werent here perhaps he was using miles as a standin for his parents who after all were orphaned gregors foster parents as well good god how were they going to react to this quickwitted yes sire very miles yes sire stop that um miles tried the tonguebiting trick again gregors boot stopped swinging his face grew more serious shadowed he added quietly im terrified of rejection im not the expert on women ivan claims to be but all the preliminary signs looked like goaheads to me no of what could happen later this job could be the death of me and of those closest to me the shade of princess kareen not the vagrant breeze chilled the air it was perhaps as well for gregors untrusted sanity that the north wing where his mother had died had burned flat and been rebuilt ghostfree ordinary men and women die every day for all sorts of reasons from random chance to inexorable time death is not an imperial monopoly gregor looked at him so its not he said softly he nodded decisively as if miles had just said something useful what miles tried to change the subject so whats up at your meeting with vortala and vann oh the usual their imperial lands distribution committee wants favors for friends i want their friends to present proof of competent usage plans ah all south continent matters of no direct interest to the vorkosigans district miles wondered if he ought to pass the word to his fathers deputy that this would be the ideal week to lobby gregor for favors for the district in his current state of dreamy idiocy and sexual fog the lovestricken gregor might well grant anything no better for the imperium to keep this temporary insanity a state secret marriage would cure gregor quickly enough a komarran empress god what a nightmare for impsec illyan really would have that stroke hed been threatening for years have you warned illyan about this yet i thought id send lady alys to apprise him if things seemed hopeful fairly soon she seems to have made it her department shes the best ally and gobetween you could have behave and youll keep her on your side but have you thought through the political ramifications of this marriage it was the first time anyone had spoken that word out loud miles realized ive thought about nothing else for the past week it could be a good thing you know miles a symbol of imperial unity and all that it was more likely the komarran underground would make it a symbol of komarr being screwed again by barrayar miles imagined the potential for vicious political satire and winced dont get your hopes up on that score gregor shook his head at the last none of that matters ive finally found something for me really for me not for the imperium not even for the emperor just for me then grab it with both hands and dont let the bastards take it away from you thank you gregor breathed miles bowed himself out he wondered if his new driver had killed anyone yet and if the counts car was still rightsideup but mostly he wondered how he could avoid duv galeni for the next few weeks chapter ten it took miles several days to extract himself from ivans clutches and escape south to the vorkosigans district alone or almost alone in the end he formally pledged his word as vorkosigan to ivan that he wouldnt attempt either active or passive suicide stunts while gone ivan had reluctantly accepted this but it was obvious from martins new wariness that ivan had chosen to put an extra word in his ear about problems besides seizures to watch for in his employer and probably some com numbers to call in case of emergencies or excessive weirdness now the kid thinks im crazy or at any rate discharged because i was crazy not crazy because i was discharged thanks ivan but perhaps a few days in the peace and calm of vorkosigan surleau would ease miless mind and martins too miles knew theyd crossed the northern border of his home district when the first blue shadows of the dendarii mountains colored the horizon ahead of them appearing out of the wavering air as suddenly as a mirage turn to the east here miles told martin ive a mind to quarter the district well pass just north of hassadar have you ever been down this way before no my lord dutifully martin banked the lightflyer into the morning sun the canopys polarization compensated for the glare as miles had suspected martin was shakier as a lightflyer pilot than a groundcar chauffeur but the failsafe systems made a lightflyer a small highly maneuverable strippeddown cross between an antigrav sled and an airplane almost impossible to crash somebody having a fiveminute seizure might possibly manage the feat though sometimes the best way across a square was around three sides not that the vorkosigans district was a square exactly more of a squashed irregular parallelogram some kilometers from the northern strip of lowlands to the southern mountain passes and about kilometers easttowest skirting the mountain chain along its highest ranges only about the northern fifth was flat fertile plains and of that of course only half was usable the city of hassadar appeared on their nearright miles directed martin wide around the hightraffic areas avoiding the complications of the city computers navigational control of the lightflyer traffic hassadars all right i guess said vorbarr sultanabornandbred martin gazing out over the citys earnest little effort at urban sprawl its as modern as any city on barrayar said miles more modern than vorbarr sultana almost all of it was built after the cetagandan invasion when my grandfather chose it for the new district capital yeah but hassadars about all the district has said martin i mean theres hardly anything else here well if by anything you mean cities no its landlocked away from any chance at the coastal trade its always been agricultural as much so as the mountains permit theres not much to do up there in the mountains judging from the number of hillmen who come to vorbarr sultana looking for work said martin we make jokes about them like what do you call a dendarii hillgirl who can outrun her brothers a virgin martin chuckled miles did not a distinct chill fell in the cabin of the lightflyer martin glanced sideways and shrank in his seat sorry mlord he muttered ive heard it before ive heard them all in fact his fathers armsmen all district men used to make them up but that was different somehow some of them had been hillmen themselves and not lacking in wit its true that the dendarii mountain folk have a lot fewer ancestors than you vorbarr sultana slugs but thats because they failed to roll over and surrender to the cetagandans a slight exaggeration the cetagandans had occupied the lowlands where theyd made handy targets for the hillmen led by the terribly young general count piotr vorkosigan to descend upon the cetagandans should have moved their lines back fifty kilometers instead of trying to push them up into the treacherous hills the vorkosigans district had subsequently lagged behind others in development because it was among the most wartorn on barrayar well that had been a good excuse two generations ago even one generation ago but now the imperium plucks us vorkosigans from our district and uses us up and never replaces what it borrows and then makes jokes about our impoverishment odd hed never thought of his familys ardent service as a hidden tax on the district before miles waited an extra ten minutes more than hed originally intended to then said turn south here give us a thousand meters more of altitude though yes mlord the flyer banked to the right after a few more minutes the automated beacon on the ground detected them and issued the standard bleat over the lightflyers com a recorded voice intoning warning you are entering a high radiation area martin paled mlord should i continue on this heading yes were all right at this altitude but its been years since i flew over the center of the wastelands its always interesting to check and see how things are progressing down there the farmland had given way to woodland many kilometers back now the woodland grew more sparse the colors odder and grayer scraggly and blighted in some areas strangely dense in others i own almost all of that yknow miles went on gazing down at it i mean personally not a figure of speech because my fathers the district count my grandfather left it to me not to my father like most of the rest of our property ive always wondered what sort of a message to me that was supposed to be blighted land for a blighted scion a comment on his early disabilities or resigned realization that count arals life would run its course long before the blasted land recovered ive never set foot on it i plan to put on radiation gear and visit it sometime after i have children they say there are some very strange plants and animals down there theres no people are there said martin staring downward in palpable unease without being told he added a few hundred more meters of altitude a few squatters and bandits who dont expect to live long enough to have cancer or children the district rangers round them up and run them out from time to time it looks deceptively recovered in spots in fact the radioactivity levels in some areas have dropped by half in my lifetime when im old this will just begin to be usable again ten more years mlord said martin miless lips twitched i was thinking like fifty more years martin he said gently oh after a few more minutes he craned his neck and stared out the canopy past martin there on your left that blotch is the site of vorkosigan vashnoi the old district capital huh its going graygreen now it used to be all black still when i was a kid i wonder if it still glows in the dark we can come back after dark and look martin offered after a slight pause no no miles settled back in his seat and stared ahead at the mountains rising to the south thats enough i could power up some more said martin presently as the moldy colors on the landscape below fell behind to be replaced by healthier greens and browns and golds see what this flyer can do his tone was decidedly longing i know what it can do said miles and i have no reason to hurry today another time perhaps martin had dropped a number of such hints obviously finding his employers taste in travel staid and dull miles itched to take over the controls and give martin a real thrillride through the dendarii gorge that tripledip through the wild upanddown drafts beside and under the main waterfall could force a sufficiently whiteknuckled passenger to throw up alas even without the seizures miles didnt think he was physically or mentallyor morallyup to it anymore not the way he and ivan had used to do it when slightly younger than martin here it was a miracle they hadnt killed themselves at the time they had been convinced it was their superior vorish skill but in retrospect it looked more like divine intervention ivan had started the game each cousin took a turn at the lightflyers controls on runs through the deep winding gorge till the other either tapped out martial artsfashion by banging on the dash or else lost their last meal for a proper run one had to disable several of the lightflyers failsafe circuits first a trick miles would just as soon martin not learn about miles had pulled ahead of ivan in the score early by the simple precaution of not eating first till ivan twigged to it and insisted they eat breakfast together to assure fairness miles won the final round by challenging ivan to a night run ivan took the first turn and brought them through alive though he was white and sweating when they popped up over the last rim and leveled out miles lined up for his run and turned off the flyers lights all credit to ivans nerve he didnt break and claw screaming for the disabled emergencyeject button till he realized his cousin was also flying the speedpattern through the gorge with his eyes closed miles of course didnt bother to mention hed flown the identical pattern over sixty times in daylight during the prior three days gradually darkening the canopy until fully opaqued that had been the last round of that game ivan never challenged him again what are you smiling about mlord martin inquired ah nothing martin bank right here and head up across the middle of that wooded area im curious to see how my forest is getting along the absentee vorkosigan sires had gone in heavily for lowsupervision sorts of farming after fifty years of forestry the fine hardwood trees were almost ready for sustained selective cutting in another ten years say patches of oak maple elm hickory and vesperbirch vied in brilliance in the autumn sun a dark green grace note was added here and there on the steep hillsides by the genetically engineered winterhardy ebony a new strainor rather new to barrayarimported just three decades ago miles wondered where it would all end up in furniture houses and other common things he hoped some of it at least would be used beautifully for musical instruments say or sculpture or inlay miles frowned at a column of smoke rising several ridges away go over there he told martin pointing but upon arrival he discovered it was all right it was just his terraforming crew burning off another hillside of poisonous native scrub prior to treating the soil with organic waste of earthdna origin and planting the tiny saplings martin circled above them and the halfdozen men in breath masks looked up and waved cordially all unknowing who observed them give them a wingwaggle back miles told martin who complied miles wondered what it would be like to do that job all day every day terraforming barrayar the old lowtech way meter by meter but at least it would be easy to look back and measure your lifes accomplishment they left the forest plantation and continued west over the rugged redbrown hills all patched and embroidered here and there with earthdescended colors marking human habitation or feral growth the gray mountains snowdusted marched ever higher to their left miles settled back and closed his eyes a while weary for no reason he was eating and sleeping as well as he ever did at last at an inquiring murmur from martin he opened them to spot the distant glimmer of the long lake at vorkosigan surleau winding some kilometers westward through the patchy hills they passed over the village at the lakes foot and the ruined and burnedout castle occupying the headland above it that had been the original reason for the villages existence miles had martin fly all the way to the headwaters and back before they circled to land on the vorkosigans property there were easily a hundred new residences dotting the lakeside further up around the curve of the few kilometers of shoreline belonging to his family that were now owned by people from hassadar or vorbarr sultana they were the source of the population explosion of well at least a dozen boats marring or decorating depending on your point of view the blue surface of the waters the village was growing too serving the vacationers and retirees as well as the few old vor estates nearby the vorkosigans summer place had formerly been a long twostory stone guard barracks for the castle now converted to a graceful residence with a fine view over the lake miles had martin bring the lightflyer down on the landing pad by the garage over the ridge to the house my lord martin inquired unloading their bags this house at least had a caretaker couple in residence to keep it alive and maintain the extensive grounds it would not have the dark and tomblike atmosphere of the mansion in the capital no leave those for now i want to visit the stables first miles led off down the path to the collection of outbuildings and earthgreen pastures in the first little valley back from the lake the teenaged girl from the village who looked after the handful of remaining horses came out to greet them and martin who had obviously been dutifully prepared to endure several days of unalleviated rural boredom in his eccentric lords company brightened right up miles left them to get acquainted and went to the pasture gate his horse who had picked up the rather unfortunate name of fat ninny from miles s grandfather in the first few weeks of his life as a foal came to greet miles at his call nickering and miles faithfully rewarded him with peppermints from his pocket he petted the big roans wide velvety nose the beast rising twentythree years old nowhad more gray among his red hairs and wheezed from his canter across the pasture so dare he ride with this seizurething probably not the sort of dayslong camping trips up into the hills he most enjoyed if he trained martin to be his spotter he could perhaps risk a few turns around the pastures he wasnt likely to break any of his synthetic bones falling off and he trusted ninny not to step on him swimming the other main pleasure of life at vorkosigan surleau was right out sailing was dubious hed have to wear a life jacket constantly and take martin could martin even swim let alone play lifeguard to a seizuring man overboard while simultaneously not letting the boat get away from him it seemed rather a lot to ask well the lakes waters were chilling with the onset of autumn anyway it was not by accident that miless thirtieth birthday came up the week following while he lingered in quiet ennui by the lakeside it was the best place to ignore the event unlike the capital where he was likely to be plagued with acquaintances and relatives or at least ivan ragging him on the topic or worse inflicting a party on him though ivan would doubtless be restrained by the knowledge that his turn would be next in a couple of months anyway miles would really only be one day older just like any other day right the day in question dawned foggy and damp from the previous days melancholy rains that had so suited miless mood but it was apparent from the high pale blue directly overhead that the weather would develop into something warm and hazy and perfect it was also apparent that he was not going to be permitted to ignore it all when the first call of congratulations came over the houses comconsole from a primly amused lady alys could ivan be far behind if he didnt find some way to hide he risked being tied up all day on the blasted thing he snagged a prebreakfast roll from the kitchen on the way through and walked out along the hillside path to the gardenandgraveyard formerly the last resting place of the barrackss guardsmen it had been taken over by the vorkosigans as their family plot after the destruction of vorkosigan vashnoi miles sat companionably for a while beside sergeant botharis grave nibbling the roll and watching the rising sun burn redly through the morning mists above vorkosigan surleau then he strolled over to old general piotrs plot and stared down at it for long minutes time was he had stamped and shouted to that mockingly silent stone whispered and pleaded but the old man and he seemed to have nothing further to say to each other why not im talking to the wrong damned grave is the problem miles decided abruptly ruthlessly he turned and strode back to the house to wake up martin who would sleep till noon if allowed he knew someplace he could go where the comconsole could not pursue him and he desperately needed to talk to a certain small lady there so where are we headed mlord martin inquired settling into the lightflyers pilots seat and flexing his fingers were going to a little mountain community called silvy vale miles leaned over and entered instructions into the vid mapnavigator program which projected a colorenhanced d grid for them theres a particular spot i want you to land in this little valley here just above this narrow fork its a cemetery actually there should be just enough space between the trees to put the lightflyer down or there was the last time i was up there its a pretty place beside the brook the sun comes down through the trees maybe i should have packed a picnic its about a four daywalk from here or two and a half days on horseback or something under an hour by lightflyer martin nodded and powered up they rose above the ridge and turned southeast i bet i could get you there faster martin offered no are we going the long way around again miles hesitated now that he was in the air his urgency was slackening to be replaced by seeping dread and you thought apologizing to the emperor was hard yeah ive been meaning to show you a few facts of life about mountain downdrafts and lightflyers head south and west here toward those peaks very good sir said martin practicing his best vor lords servants style though spoiling the effect immediately thereafter by adding a hell of a lot better than another riding lesson martin and ninny had not gotten along as well as miles had expected them to martin clearly preferred lightflyers there followed an hour of interesting moments in and around dendarii gorge even cityboy martin was impressed by the grandeur of place miles was pleased to note they took it a lot slower than he and ivan ever had the lessons made their breakfasts merely a mild regret and not an immediate emergency but eventually miles ran out of delays to offer and they turned due east again so whats to do in this silvy vale place asked martin friends scenery not exactly when i was about your brothers ageid just graduated from the imperial service academy in factthe countmyfather stuck me that is assigned me to be his voice in a case that was brought before the counts court he sent me up to silvy vale to investigate and judge a murder an infanticide for mutation very much in the old traditional style martin made a face hillmen he said in revulsion mm it turned out to be more complex than id thought even after i managed to tag the right suspect the little girlit was a little girl four days old who was killed for being born with the cats mouthher name was raina csurik shed be getting close to ten years old by now if shed lived i want to talk to her martins brows rose do you uh talk to dead people a lot mlord sometimes martins mouth crooked in an uncertain wehopethisisajoke smile do they ever talk back sometimes what dont you ever talk to dead people i dont know any except you mlord martin modified this slightly i was only a wouldbe corpse give yourself time martin your acquaintance will surely expand in time miles knew lots of dead people but even on that long list raina held a special place after hed peeled away all the imperial pomp and nonsense exhausted all the vying for promotion waded through all the idiot regulations and dark nasty corners of military life when it wasnt a goddamn game anymore when things went real and really scary with lives and souls too going down the flashdisposer for it raina was the one symbol of his service that still made sense he had a horrible feeling hed somehow lost touch with raina too lately in all this mess had he got so wound up with playing naismith and with winning that game that hed forgotten what he was playing for raina was one prisoner naismith would never rescue down underground these ten years there was a probably apocryphal tale told of miless ancestor count selig vorkosigan collectingor more likely attempting to collecttaxes from his districts people no more thrilled by the prospect then than they were now one impoverished widow left with her feckless late husbands debts offered up the only thing she had her sons drumplaying son included selig it was said accepted the drumming but gave back the boy selfserving vorish propaganda no doubt naismith had been miless own best sacrifice his all in all what he came up with when he turned himself insideout with the trying barrayars galactic interests seemed very far away in this mountain morning light but serving those interests had been his part naismith was the drumsong hed played but vorkosigan was the one whod played it so he knew exactly how hed lost naismith misstep by misstep he could touch and name every link in that disastrous chain of events where the hell had he lost vorkosigan when they landed he would tell martin to take a walk or go fly the lightflyer around some more this was one conversation with the dead he didnt want a witness to hed failed gregor yet faced him failed his family and would have to face them soon but facing raina that was going to hurt like needle grenade fire oh raina small lady please what do i do now he hunched away from martin very silent his forehead leaning against the canopy eyes closed head aching martins voice broke into his increasingly agonized reverie mlord what should i do i cant land in the valley where you said its all water what miles sat up and opened his eyes and stared out in astonishment there seems to be a lake there said martin indeed across the narrow shoulder where the two descending streams had met now sat a small hydroelectric dam behind it filling the steep valleys a winding sheet of water reflected the hazy morning blue miles rechecked the vid map just to be sure and then the date on the map this maps only two years old but this sure as hell isnt on it but this is the place all right do you still want to land yes um try to set down on the shore there on the east side as close to the mark as you can it wasnt an easy task but martin at last found a spot and eased the lightflyer down among the trees he popped the canopy and miles climbed out and stood on the steep bank and peered down at the clear brown water he could only see a few meters into it a scattering of white tree stumps stuck up out of it like bones martin curious followed him and stood by his side as if to help him look so is the cemetery still under there or have the folk of silvy vale moved their graves and if so where have they moved them to miles muttered martin shrugged the blank and placid mirror of the water gave no answer either chapter eleven after martin jockeyed the lightflyer up out of the trees miles located the clearing he sought about a kilometer away he had martin put them down in the yard in front of a cabin built of weathered silvery wood the cabin with its familiar fulllength porch giving a fine view over the valley and the new lake appeared unchanged though there were a couple of new outbuildings downslope a man came out onto the porch to see what was landing in his yard it was not the balding onearmed speaker karal this was a total stranger a tall fellow with a neatly trimmed black beard but he leaned interested on the porch railing of barkpeeled sapling as if he owned the place miles climbed out of the lightflyer and stood by it for an uncertain moment staring up at the man rehearsing explanations for himself and secretly glad of martins bulk perhaps he should have brought a trained bodyguard but the strangers face lit with recognition and excitement lord vorkosigan he cried he ran down off the porch two steps at a time and strode toward miles his hands out in greeting smiling broadly great to see you again his smile faded nothing wrong i hope well this one remembered miles all right from that judgment of nearly a decade ago no this is purely a social visit miles offered as the man came up and shook his handboth his handswith enthusiastic cordiality nothing official the man stepped back looking down at his face and his smile turned into a sly grin dont you know who i am urn im zed karal zed zed karal speaker karals middle son had been twelve years old miles did a little quick math twentytwo or thereabouts yeah the last time i saw you you were shorter than me well my ma was a good cook indeed i remember miles hesitated was are your parents um oh theyre fine just not here my older brother married this lowlander girl from seligrad and went there to work and live ma and da go down to live with them for the winter cause the winters are getting hard for them up here ma helps with their kids is karal not the speaker of silvy vale anymore then no we have a new speaker as of about two years ago a young hotshot full of progressive ideas he picked up living in hassadar just your type i think youll remember him all right names lem csurik zeds smile broadened oh said miles for the first time today a smile tugged at his own lips really id like to see him ill take you to him right now if youll give me a lift hes probably working on the clinic today you wont know where that is its brightnew just a second zed dashed back into his cabin to put something in order a hint of that former twelveyearold in his run miles felt like banging his head on the lightflyers canopy to try to force his spinning brain back into gear zed returned to hop into the lightflyers backseat and give martin a string of directions interspersed with running commentary as they rose into the air and passed over the next ridge he brought them down about two kilometers away in front of the rising frame of a sixroom building the biggest structure miles had ever seen in silvy vale power lines were already strung to it feeding a rack of packrechargers for power tools half a dozen men paused in their labors to watch them land zed clambered out and waved lem hey lem youll never guess whos here miles followed him toward the building site martin sat at the controls and watched in bemusement my lord lem csuriks recognition was instantaneous too but then miless appearance was ah distinctive miles could probably have picked lem out of the crowd in turn with a moments study he was still the wiry hillman of about miless age that miles remembered though obviously much happier than the day a decade back when hed been falsely accused of murder and even more confidentlooking than the time miles had briefly seen him in hassadar six years ago lem too went for an engulfing twohanded greeting speaker csurik congratulations miles said in return i see youve been busy oh you dont know the half of it my lord come see were getting our own clinicits going to serve the whole area im pushing to have it undercover before the first snow flies and all ready by winterfair thats when were getting our doctor a real one not just the medtech who flies the circuit once a week the docs one of your lady mothers scholarship students from the new school in hassadar hes going to serve us here four years in exchange for his schooling winterfairs when hes supposed to graduate were fixing him up a cabin too upslope its got a real nice view lem introduced his crew all around and took miles on a tour of if not the clinic yet the dream of the clinic that burned in his imagination so hotly miles could see its ghostly outlines all complete i saw the electric dam in the valley coming in miles said when lem at last paused for breath where did that come from we built it said lem proudly you can bet that was a job and a half with so few power tools had to make the power to have the power of course wed been waiting and waiting for the powersat receptor the district promised us but we were so far down the list wed still be waiting then i got to figuring i went over to dostovar and looked at their hydro plant which theyd had for years it was lowtech but it worked i got a couple of the fellows from there to come help us with the dam picking the best site and all and got an engineer from hassadar whose house id helped build to come help us with the electrical system guts he gets the use of a cabin up from the new lake for a vacation place in the summer in return we still owe for the generators but thats all that was the best site was it oh yes the shortest span and the biggest drop available and the most waterflow well outgrow it in time but thats the whole point without basic power this place was in stasis now we can grow couldnt have won the lottery from the district for the doctor without power for the clinic for one thing you didnt let anything stop you did you well mlord you know who i learned that from harra his wife of course rainas mother miles nodded speaking of harra where is she today he had come up here wanting only to stand silent before the dead but he was now beginning to want very much to talk to harra teaching at the school i built on another roomwe have two teachers now you know theres a girl harra trained who does the little ones and harra teaches the older ones can i ah see it harrad skin me alive if i let you get away without seeing her come on ill take you over there now zed having turned miles over to the responsible authority waved goodbye and headed back home disappearing among the trees lem spoke briefly to his crew and took over zeds place as native guide in the back seat of the lightflyer another short hop brought them to an older and more traditional structure a long cabin with two doors and fieldstone fireplaces on both ends a large handcarved sign with scrolling letters above the porch labeled it the raina csurik school lem led miles through the door on the left martin trailing to linger uncertainly just outside about twenty teenagers of various sizes sat at handmade wooden desks with comconsole laplinks atop them listening to the vigorously gesturing woman at the head of the room harra csurik was still tall and lean as miles remembered her her straight strawblond hair was tied back neatly at the nape of her neck hillwoman fashion and she wore a hill womans simple dress though clean and well made like the majority of her students her feet were bare in this mild weather but her protuberant gray eyes were lively and warm she broke off her lecture abruptly as she saw miles and lem lord vorkosigan well i never expected this she advanced upon him much as zed and lem had but not content with a handshake she hugged him at least she didnt pick him up bodily miles concealed his startlement recovered his wits quickly enough to hug her back and took both her hands in a halfswing around as she released him hello harra you look splendid i havent seen you since hassadar yes i should have been round long before this but they kept me busy i have to tell you it meant the world to me when you came to my graduation from the teachers college there that was a piece of good luck that i was onplanet at the time no merit in it thats a matter of opinion come see she towed him toward the front of the room see kids whos come to see us its your own lord vorkosigan they stared at him with interest rather than suspicion or revulsion their eyes shifting to check the odd little man in the flesh before them against the picture on the wall at the front of their classroom above the vid projection space three stillportraits were lined up two by mandate one of emperor gregor in the splendid and gaudy parade dress uniform and one of their district count miless father staring out sternly in the most formal brownandsilver livery of the vorkosigans the third portrait was nonregulationpublic offices were not normally required to display a portrait of their counts heir as well but miless own face smirked back at him from up there it was one of his younger and stiffer scans wearing imperial service dress greens with light blue ensigns rectangles on the collar it had to date from his academy graduation because no silver eyeofhorus pins yet glittered there where the devil had harra obtained it she displayed him as proudly to her students as any showandtell exhibitor excited as a sixyearold with a jar of pet bugs he hadnt come to silvy vale expecting to see anyone let alone speak publicly and felt decidedly underdressed in an old backcountrystyle tunic and worn black trousers left over from a set of service fatigues not to mention the battered service boots hed muddied by the reservoir but he managed a few generic hearty well done well done comments that seemed to please everyone harra took him around the front porch into the next room and repeated the show throwing the young woman teaching there into terminal flusterment and raising the younger students wrigglequotient to something near explosion as they were coming back around on the porch miles seized harras hand to slow her down for a moment harrai didnt come up here for a surprise inspection for heavens sake i just came up to well to tell you the truth i just wanted to do a little memorial burning on rainas grave the tripod and brazier and aromatic wood were stashed in the back of the lightflyer that was good of you mlord said harra miles made a small throwaway gesture but she shook her head in denial of his denial miles went on it seems id need a boat to do it now and i dont want to risk setting fire to the boat im sitting in or did you folks move the graveyard yes before it was flooded people moved some of the graves those who wanted to we picked a real nice new spot up on the ridge overlooking the old site we didnt move my mothers grave of course i left her down there let even her burial be buried no burnings for her harra grimaced miles nodded understanding rainas grave well i guess it was because the ground was so damp down there by the creek and she only had that bit of a makeshift crate for a coffin and she was so tiny anyway we couldnt find her to move shes gone back to the soil i guess i didnt mind it seemed right when i thought about it i really think of this school as her best memorial anyway every day i come here to teach is like burning an offering only better because it makes instead of destroys she nodded once resolute and calm i see she looked at him more closely you all right mlord you look really tired and all pale you havent been sick or something have you he supposed three months of death qualified as about as sick as one could get well yes or something but im recovering oh all right are you headed anywhere after this not really im sort of on holiday id like you to meet our lads mine and lems lems ma or his sister take care of them while im teaching wont you come home for lunch with us hed intended to be back at vorkosigan surleau by lunchtime kids weve two now a little boy four and a little girl one no one was using uterine replicators up here yet shed borne them in her body like her lost firstborn dear god but this woman worked it was an invitation he could not possibly escape id be honored lem show lord vorkosigan around a minute harra went back inside to consult with her team teacher and then with her students and lem dutifully took miles on an outside tour of the architectural highlights of the school a couple of minutes later children exploded from the building shrieking off happily in all directions in early dismissal i didnt mean to disrupt your routine miles protested futilely he was in for it now he could not for three worlds betray those smiles of welcome they descended by lightflyer unannounced upon lems sister who rose to the challenge smoothly the lunch she provided was thank god light miles dutifully met and admired csurik children nieces and nephews he was hijacked by them and taken on a stroll through the woods and viewed a favorite swimming hole he waded gravely along with them on the smooth stones with his boots off till his feet were numb with the chill and in a voice of vorish authority pronounced it a most excellent swimming hole perhaps the finest in his district he was obviously an anomaly of some fascination an adult almost their own size what with one thing and another it was late afternoon before they arrived back at the school miles took one look at the mob of people streaming into the wide yard bearing dishes and baskets and flowers musical instruments and pitchers and jugs chairs and benches and trestles and boards firewood and tablecloths and his heart sank despite all his efforts to avoid such things today it seemed he was in for a surprise party after all phrases like we should go before dark martins not used to flying in the mountains died on his lips theyd be lucky if they got out of here before tomorrow morning orhe noted the stone pitchers of dendarii mountain maple mead the deadliest alcoholic beverage ever invented by mantomorrow afternoon it took him a meal sunset a bonfire and rather a lot of carefully rationed sips of maple mead but eventually he actually relaxed and began to enjoy it then the music began and enjoyment became no effort at all off to the side martin at first inclined to turn up his nose a bit at the rustic homemade quality of it all found himself teaching city dances to a group of eager teens miles bit back inflicting any prudent warnings on the boy such as maple mead may go down smooth and sweet but it destroys cell membranes coming back up some things you had to learn for yourself at certain ages miles danced traditional steps with harra and other women until he lost count a couple of older folk whod been there at his judgment of a decade ago nodded respectfully at him despite his capering it was not after all a party for him despite the bombardment of birthday congratulations and jokes it was a party for silvy vale if he was the excuse for it well it was the most use hed been to anybody for weeks but as the party died down with the bonfires embers his sense of incompletion grew hed come up here to what to try to bring his dragging depression to some kind of head perhaps like lancing a boil painful but relieving disgusting metaphor but he was thoroughly sick of himself he wanted to take a jug of mead and finish his talk with raina bad idea probably he might end up weeping drunkenly by the reservoir and drowning himself as well as his sorrows poor repayment to silvy vale for the nice party and betrayal of his word to ivan did he seek healing or destruction either it was this formless state in between that was unbearable in the end somehow after midnight he fetched up by the waterside after all but not alone lem and harra came with him and sat on logs too the moons were both high and made faint silky patterns on the wavelets and turned the rising mist in the ravines to silver smoke lem had charge of the jug of mead and distributed it judiciously otherwise keeping a mellow silence it was not the dead miles needed to talk to in the dark he realized it was the living useless to confess to the dead absolution was not in their power but ill trust your speaking harra as you once trusted mine i have to tell you something miles said to harra knew there was something wrong she said i hope youre not dying or something no i was worried it might be something like that a lot of muties dont live very long lives even without someone to cut their throats vorkosigan does it backwards i had my throat cut all right but it was for life not for death its a long story and the details are classified but i ended up in a cryochamber out in the galactic backbeyond last year when they thawed me out i had some medical problems then i did something stupid then i did something really stupid which was to lie about the first thing and then i got caught and then i got discharged whatever it was about my achievements you admired that inspired you its all gone now thirteen years of career effort down the wastedisposer in one flush hand me that jug he swallowed sweet fire and handed it back to lem who passed it to harra and back to himself of all the things i thought i might be by age thirty civilian was never on the list the moonlight rippled on the water and you told me to stand up straight and speak the truth said harra after a long pause does this mean youll be spending more time in the district maybe good youre ruthless harra miles groaned the bugs sang their soft chorus in the woods a tiny organic moonlight sonata little manharras voice in the dark was as sweet and deadly as maple meadmy mother killed my daughter and was judged for it in front of all of silvy vale you think i dont know what public shame is or waste why dyou think im telling all this to you harra was silent for long enough for lem to pass around the stone jug one last time in the dim moonlight and shadows then she said you go on you just go on theres nothing more to it and theres no trick to make it easier you just go on what do you find on the other side when you go on she shrugged your life again what else is that a promise she picked up a pebble fingered it and tossed it into the water the moonlines bloomed and danced its an inevitability no trick no choice you just go on miles got martin and the lightflyer in the air again by noon the next day martins eyes were red and puffy and his face had a pale greenish cast worthy of a speed run through the dendarii gorge he flew very gently and carefully which suited miles exactly he was not very conversational but he did manage a did you ever find what you were looking for mlord the light is clearer up here in these mountains than anywhere else on barrayar but no it was here once but its not here now miles twisted in his seat straps and stared back over his shoulder at the rugged receding hills these people need a thousand things but they dont need a hero at least not a hero like admiral naismith heroes like lem and harra yes martin squinted perhaps not appreciating that light just at present after a time miles asked how old is middleage martin oh martin shrugged thirty i guess thats what id always thought too though hed once heard the countess define it as ten years older than whatever you were a moveable feast i had a professor at the imperial service academy once miles went on as the hills grew more gentle beneath them who taught the introduction to tactical engineering course he said he never bothered changing his tests from term to term to prevent cheating because while the questions were always the same the answers changed id thought he was joking unh said martin dutifully never mind martin miles sighed just go on chapter twelve after their return to the lake house and a sparing lunch from which martin excused himself altogether miles locked himself into the comconsole chamber and prepared to face the expected spate of messages forwarded from vorbarr sultana the birthday congratulations were each the measure of their senders grave and straight from gregor tinged with cautious mockery from ivan and falling into a range in between from the handful of acquaintances who knew he was onplanet marks tightbeam recording from beta colony was markian his mockery was an awkward imitation of ivans edgier and more selfconscious from the stilted wouldbe flippancy miles gathered this was not the messages first draft but it was miles realized upon reflection very probably the first time in his life mark had ever had to compose a birthday greeting to anyone keep trying mark youll learn how to be a human being yet miless judicious smugness faded as he realized this compelled him to compose a return message it was obvious mark hadnt heard the news about miless change of status yet how the devil was he going to tell mark about it in a way his clonebrother couldnt construe as blame he set the problem aside temporarily he saved the one from his parents for last it had been beamed not mailed therefore it would have left sergyar in the government data tightbeam and been expressjumped through the wormhole barriers between receivers taking little more than a day en route shipped message disks took as long to travel between the two worlds as a person almost two weeks this was therefore the latest news and would contain their reactions to the latest news theyd had he took a deep breath and keyed it up theyd sat back from the vid receptor to both fit into the scan and so appeared as small smiling halffigures over his vid plate count aral vorkosigan was a thickbodied whitehaired man in his early seventies dressed in his brownandsilver vorkosigan house uniform this message must have been recorded sometime during his working day the countess wore a vor ladys afternoonstyle jacket and skirt in green ditto red roan hair like ninnys even to the having of more gray in it was held back from her broad forehead by fancy combs in her usual style she was as tall as her husband and her gray eyes danced with amusement they do not know no ones told them yet miles knew this with sinking certainty before either even opened their mouth hello love the countess began congratulations for reaching thirty alive yes the count seconded we truly wondered if you would make it many times but here we all are somewhat the worse for wear but after a deep contemplation of the alternative happy to be so i may be far from you here on sergyar but i can look in the mirror every morning and remember you by all these white hairs its not true miles objected the countess grinning he was already going gray when i met him at age fortyodd i didnt get my gray hairs till after though we miss you the count continued do insist your travel to your next mission assignment be routed through sergyar coming or going or both and plan at least a short layover theres so much going on here of significance to the future of the imperium i know youd be interested in seeing some of it ill light up simons life if he doesnt send you by the countess added you can pass that on to him as my personal threat alys tells me youve been home for several weeks why havent we heard from you partying too hard with ivan to take ten minutes out to talk to your aged parents lady alys too had declined it appeared to be the bearer of even the nonclassified version of the bad news and she was ordinarily the countesss main gossippipeline to everything of vorish interest in vorbarr sultana and gregors court speaking of alys the countess went on she tells me gregor has met this girland you can just hear the capital letters in her voice what do you know about this have you met her should we be happy or worried or what an imperial marriage to a komarran said count vorkosiganonce nicknamed the butcher of komarr by his political enemies most of whom hed survivedis fraught with potential complications but at this late date if gregor will only do his duty and produce a proper crown prince somehow ill do whatever i can to support the project and all of us in my generation who were in the pool of potential heirs will breathe a great sigh of relief assure gregor of my full support i trust his judgment the counts face grew oddly wistful does she seem like a nice girl gregor deserves a little personal happiness to make up for all the nonsense on the other side that he bears for us all alys said shell do said the countess and i trust alyss judgment though i dont know if the young lady quite realizes what shes getting into please assure dr toscane of my full support miles whatever she decides to do surely shell accept if gregor asks her said the count only if shes so headoverheels in love as to have lost all sense of selfpreservation said the countess believe me you have to have lost your mind to marry a barrayaran vor lets hope she has miless parents exchanged peculiar smiles so lets see the count went on what were we doing at age thirty can you remember back that far cordelia barely i was in the betan astronomical survey screwing up my first chance at being promoted to captain it came around again the next year though and you bet i grabbed it then without which i would never have met aral when and where i did and you wouldnt exist miles so i dont wish to change a bit of it now i was a captain by twentyeight the count reminisced smugly the countess made a face at him ship duty suited me i didnt get stuck at a desk for another four or five years when ezar and the headquarters hotshots began planning the annexation of komarr his face grew serious again good luck to gregor on this thing of his i hope he can succeed where i did not succeed so well as id hoped to thank god for a new generation and clean starts he and the countess glanced at each other and he finished so long boy communicate dammit the countess added take good care of yourself kiddo please communicate dammit their forms twinkled into thin air miles sighed i cant put this off much longer i really cant he did manage to put it off one more day by having martin fly him back to vorbarr sultana the following morning ma kosti served miles lunch in splendid isolation in the yellow parlor shed obviously worked hard to make it as proper as possible perhaps studying up on her new job from etiquette manuals or getting tips from other vors servants in the area he ate dutifully despite an urge to gather up his plates and go join martin and his mother in the kitchen certain aspects of the vor lord role seemed remarkably stupid at times afterwards he went to his room to finally face the task of composing a message to his parents hed recorded and erased three different triesone too glum one too flippant one way too full of ugly sarcasmswhen an incoming call interrupted his endeavors he welcomed it despite the fact that it was ivan ivan was in uniform calling on his lunch break perhaps ah youre back in town good ivan began that good seemed quite heartfelt apparently on more than one level feeling better for the little vacation in the hills i trust somewhat miles said cautiously how had ivan found out so soon that he was back good ivan repeated now ive been wondering have you done anything toward getting your head looked at yet seen a doctor not yet made an appointment anywhere no hm mother asked me gregord asked her it seems guess whos at the bottom of that chain of command and gets delegated to actually do something about it i said i didnt think youd done anything yet but id ask why havent you i miles shrugged there didnt seem to be any rush i wasnt bounced out of impsec for having seizures i was bounced out of impsec for falsifying a report and not one on a minor matter either even if the medicos could do something to get me back into guaranteed perfect working order tomorrow which if they could my dendarii surgeon would have already done it it wouldnt change anything illyan wont take me back he cant its a matter of frigging principle and illyan is one of the most principled men i know id wondered if it was because you didnt want to go to impmil said ivan didnt want to deal with the military docs if thats the case i understand i supposei think youre being silly mind you but i can understand so ive looked up three different civilian clinics that specialize in cryorevival cases that seem to have good reputations ones here in vorbarr sultana ones over in weienovya in vordarians district and ones on komarr if you think closer proximity to galactic medicine is an advantage that would offset any lingering animosity toward your name there you want me to make you an appointment at one of them miles thought he could guess the names of all three from his prior search no thanks ivan sat back his lips twisting in puzzlement you know id figured that would be the first thing youd do once the little icewater bath brought you up out of the fog youd get your legs under yourself and be off and running just like always i never saw you face a wall that if you couldnt go over it youd not try to find some way around through or under or blow it up with sappers charges or just bang your head against it till it fell down and then theyd stick me with chasing you again running where ivan ivan grimaced back to the dendarii of course you know i cant do that without my official position in impsec under due imperial authority my command of the dendarii becomes a vor lord a counts heir for gods sake running a private army treason ivan lethal treason weve been all through that before if i went i could never come back i gave my word to gregor i wouldnt do it yeah said ivan if youre not coming back what does your word as vorkosigan have to do with anything ever again miles sat silent so that business with having ivan underfoot in vorkosigan house hadnt been only a deathwatch after all it had been an escapewatch as well id have bet money youd bolt ivan went on if thered been anybody who had a high enough security classification to bet with besides galeni of course and hes not the wagering sort s why ive been dragging my feet despite gregor and mother about harassing you to get your head fixed why borrow trouble its a bet im glad to lose by the way so when are you going to get an appointment soon too vague ivan rejected this i want a straight answer something like today or maybe tomorrow before noon ivan wouldnt go away till he extracted a response that satisfied him by the end of the week miles managed good ivan nodded shortly ill check back at the end of the week and expect to hear all about it byefor now he cut the com miles sat staring at the empty vid plate ivan was right he hadnt done a thing more about pursuing a cure since hed been fired once freed from his constraining need for secrecy from impsec why hadnt he been all over this seizure disorder attacking it tearing it apart or at least riding some hapless medico as hard as hed ever ridden the dendarii mercenaries to successfully complete their missions to buy time he knew it for the right answer but it only brought him to a new level of selfbafflement time for what keeping himself on selfinflicted medical leave allowed him to avoid facing certain unpleasant realities squareon such as the news that the seizures couldnt be cured and that the death of hope was permanent and real no cryorevival for that corpse just a warm and rotting burial yeah really or was he just as afraid his head could be fixedand then hed be logically compelled to grab the dendarii and take off back to his real life the one that soared out far far away into the glittering galactic night escaping all the dirtsuckers petty little concerns back to heroing for a living more afraid had he lost his nerve after that hideous episode with the needle grenade he had a clear flashvision in his memory of his odd angled view of his own chest blowing outward in a lumpy red spray and pain beyond measure and despair beyond words waking up afterward hadnt been a picnic either that pain had dragged on for weeks without escape suiting up again to go out with the squad after vorberg had been hard no question but hed been doing all right until the seizure so was the whole thing from end to end from seizure to falsification to discharge a tricky dance to save himself from ever having to look down the wrong end of a needlegrenade launcher again without having to say i quit out loud hell of course he was afraid hed have to be a frigging idiot not to be anyone would but hed done death he knew how bad it was dying hurt death was just nothing both were to be avoided by any sane man yet hed gone back hed gone back all the other times too after the little deaths his legs smashed his arms smashed all the injuries that had left a map of fine white scars over his body from head to toe again and again and again how many times did you have to die to prove you werent a coward how much pain were you required to consume to pass the course ivan was right hed always found a way over the wall he imagined it through the whole scenario suppose he got his head fixed here or on komarr or on escobar it didnt matter where and suppose he took off and impsec declined to assassinate their renegade vor and they achieved some unspoken agreement to ignore each other forevermore and he was all and only naismith and then what i face fire climb that wall and then what i do it again and then what again and then what its logically impossible to prove a negative im tired of playing wall no he needed neither to face nor avoid fire if fire came his way hed deal with it it wasnt cowardice dammit whatever it was so why havent i tried to get my head fixed yet he rubbed his face and eyes and sat up and attempted once more to compose a coherent account of his new civilian status and how hed come by it for the admiral count and his lady the woman whom his father routinely addressed as dear captain it came out very stiff and flat he was afraid worse even than marks birthday message but he refused to put it off until yet another tomorrow he recorded and sent it albeit not by tightbeam he let it go the long way by ordinary mail though marked personal at least it was gone and he would not be able to call it back again quinn had sent a birthday greeting too demurely worded so as not to provide too much entertainment for the impsec censors a strong tinge of anxiety leaked through her casual facade nonetheless a second inquiry was more openly worried with enormous reluctance he repeated a truncated version of his message for quinn minus the backfill and cutting straight to the results she had predicted she deserved better but it was the best he could do right now she did not deserve silence and neglect im sorry elli ivan invited himself to dinner the next night miles feared he would have to endure more of the campaign to get him to address his medical problems about which admittedly he had still done nothing but instead ivan brought flowers to ma kosti and hung around the kitchen during dinner preparations making her laugh until she ran him out at that point miles began to fear it was the opening of a campaign to hire away his cook though whether in ivans own right or on behalf of lady alys he was not yet sure they were halfway through dessertby ivans request a reprise of the spiced peach tartwhen they were interrupted by a comconsole call or rather by martin lurching in to announce theres some impsec stiffrod on the com for you lord vorkosigan illyan why would illyan call me but when ivan following in curiosity hed trooped to the nearest com on that floor the one sited in his grandfathers old sitting room overlooking the back garden the face that formed over the vid plate at his touch was that of duv galeni you smarmy goddamn little pimp said galeni in a deadlevel voice miless own bright innocent panicked hi duv whats up tripped over this and fell very flat and just lay there withering under galenis glare galenis face was neither red nor pale but livid gray with rage i should have stayed at vorkosigan surleau one more week think you knew you set this up you set me up um just checking miles swallowed what are we talking about galeni didnt even bother to dignify this with an answer but glared on his lips curling back on his long teeth in an expression that had nothing to do with a smile gregor and laisa by chance miles hazarded more thick silence broken only by galenis breathing duv i didnt know it would come out like this who would have guessed it after all these years i was trying to do you a favor dammit the one good thing thats ever come my way taken stolen vor does mean thief and you goddamn barrayaran thieves stick together all right you and your fucking precious emperor and the whole damned pack of you uh put in ivan from the side is this comconsole secured miles sorry duv but if youre going to express yourself so um frankly wouldnt it be better to do it in person i mean i hope this isnt over your impsec channel they have ears in the damnedest places impsec can take its ears and the flat head between them and shove them up its collective ass galenis accent normally elusively urbane was going not only distinctly komarran but streetkomarran miles signaled ivan to shut up remembering what had happened to two unlucky cetagandans the last time miles had seen galeni this upset a personal visit seemed like a singularly bad idea just now there was corporal kosti to protect him of course but could kosti handle one of his own superiors in a homicidal trance it seemed rather a lot to ask of the poor fellow duv im sorry i didnt mean it to come out this way it was nothing id planned it took everyone by surprise even lady alys ask ivan ivan shrugged hands out s true miles cleared his throat cautiously how um did you find out about this she called me when about five minutes ago shes just dumped him oh great they both called me galeni groaned she said i was her best friend here and she wanted me to be the first komarran to hear the news gregors really gone and done it then and uh what did you say congratulations of course what else could i say with the pair of em sitting there grinning at me miles breathed relief good galeni hadnt lost all control hed just called miles to have a shoulder to gnash his teeth on looked at in a certain light it was a measure of immense trust terrific thanks duv ivan rubbed his neck youve been chasing this woman for five months and all you got was that she thinks youre her friend duv what the hell were you doing all that time shes a toscane said galeni im just an impoverished collaborator by her familys standards i had to persuade her that i had a future worthy of her nothing to look at now no but later then he came along and just just swept her up with no trouble at all miles having watched gregor practically turning handsprings in an effort to be pleasing to laisa said only um five months is way too slow said ivan continuing his tone of earnest critique god duv i wish youd asked me for some advice earlier shes komarran what can one of you damned barrayaran sugarplumfairysoldierbloodybuffoons know about a komarran woman intelligent educated sophisticated almost thirty miles mused i had a timetable said galeni when shed known me six months exactly i was going to ask her ivan winced galeni seemed to be calming down or at least beginning a downward slide from his immediate reaction of rage and pain into a less energyintensive despair perhaps his violent words were going to be safetyvent enough for his boiling emotions without violent actions this time miles at least he didnt preface the name with a string of pejoratives nowyoure nearly gregors foster brother no nearly about it um do you think could you possibly persuade him to relinquish no galeni ran down altogether no i owe gregor from too far back on a personal as well as a political level this heir business is essential to my future health and safety and gregors been dragging his feet on it forever till now i cant do anything but support him and anywayhe remembered his aunt alyss wordsits laisas decision not yours or mine or gregors i cant help it if you forgot to tell her about your timetable im sorry shit galeni cut the com well said ivan thinly into the silence that followed at least thats over with have you been avoiding him too yes coward who was it spent the last two weeks hiding out in the mountains it was a strategic withdrawal well i believe our dessert is drying out back in the dining room im not hungry besides if this is gregor and laisas night to start informing selected personal friends prior to the official announcement i may as well stay here for a few more minutes ah ivan nodded and pulled up a chair and seated himself three minutes later the comconsole chimed miles keyed it on gregor was trimly dressed in dark and distinctly civilian gear laisa was lovely as usual in bluntly komarran style both were smiling eyes alight with the glow of their mutual infatuation hello miles gregor began to which laisa added a hello again lord vorkosigan miles cleared his throat hi folks what can i do for you i wanted you to be among the first to know said gregor ive asked laisa to marry me and she said yes gregor was looking quite blitzed as if this prompt assent had come as a surprise to him laisas smile to her credit was at least equally blitzed congratulations miles managed ivan leaned over his shoulder into the vid pickup to add a second to the motion and gregor said oh good youre here you were next going down his list of profoundly relieved heirs in official order of rank well it was the barrayaran thing to do laisa murmured greetings to ivan too am i the first to know miles trolled not quite said gregor weve been taking turns lady alys was first of course shes been in on this from the start or nearly so i sent the message to my parents yesterday and ive told captain galeni added laisa i owe him so much he and you both and ah what did he say he agreed it might be good for planetary accord said gregor which considering his background i find most heartening in other words you asked him pointblank and he said yes sire poor excellent duv no wonder he calledme it was that or explode galeni is a complex man yes i know you like him said gregor and i sent a message to your parents that should arrive tonight i expect to hear back from them by tomorrow oh miles said reminded aunt alys was ahead of you i think my father asked me to send on his personal assurance of support and my mother asked me to tell you the same particularly dr toscane im looking forward to meeting the legendary cordelia vorkosigan laisa said with evident sincerity i think i could learn a lot from her i think you could too admitted miles good god theyll be coming home for this wont they i can think of no one i want more to stand on my wedding circle than them except you said gregor i trust you will be my second just like a duel certainly uh whats the timetable on the publiccircus part of this gregor sagged slightly lady alys seems to have some very definite ideas on that score i wanted the betrothal ceremony immediately but shes insisting it not even be announced till after her return from komarr im dispatching her to be my voice to laisas parents all the proper forms you know and the formal betrothal not for two months and the wedding not for nearly a year we compromised on one month after her return to the betrothal and are still arguing about the other she says if we dont give the vor ladies time to dress properly theyll never forgive me i didnt see why it should take them two months to get dressed mm id give her a free rein in this if i were you she could have the conservative old vor faction eating out of her hand for you without them ever knowing what hit them which is half your problem solved i cant speak for the radical komarran half im afraid alys thinks we should have two weddings one here one on komarr said gregor a double ordeal he glanced aside and squeezed laisas hand but worth it staring down the social gauntlet opening with increasing complexity before them they both looked like they were thinking of eloping youll get through it all right miles assured them heartily well all help wont we ivan my mothers already volunteered me ivan admitted glumly have you ah told illyan miles asked i sent lady alys to break the news to him before anyone else said gregor he called on me in person to assure me of his personal and professional supportthat phrase about support keeps cropping up do i look like im about to faint i couldnt tell if he was pleased or horrified but then illyan can be hard to read sometimes not that hard id guess he was personally pleased and professionally horrified he did suggest i do all i could to expedite the return of your lady mother before the betrothal to as he put it lend her clout to lady alys i wondered if youd add your voice to that plea for us miles shes so hard to detach from your father ill try actually it would probably take a wormhole blockade to keep her away gregor grinned congratulations to you too miles your father before you needed a whole army to do it but youve changed barrayaran history just with a dinner invitation miles shrugged helplessly god is everybody going to blame me for this and for everything that follows lets try to avoid making history on this one eh i think we should push for unalleviated domestic dullness with all my heart gregor agreed with a cheery salute he cut the com miles laid his head down on the table and moaned its not my fault yes it is said ivan it was all your idea i was there when you came up with it no it wasnt it was yours youre the one who dragooned me into attending the damned state dinner in the first place i only invited you you invited galeni and anyway my mother dragooned me oh so its all her fault good i can live with that ivan shrugged agreement well should we drink to the happy couple there are things in your cellars with more dust on them than an old vor miles thought it over yeah lets go exploring over the racks downstairs just after violently rejecting miless diffident suggestion of maple mead as the afterdinner poison of choice ivan added reluctantly dyou think galeni will try to do anything hed regret or that wed regret miles hesitated a long time before saying no chapter thirteen ivan did not make good his threat to follow up his harassment about miless medical treatment or lack of it because he was pressganged into assisting lady alyss departure for komarr she paused in passing vorkosigan house to drop off several kilos of historical references about previous imperial weddings with orders for miles to study up when she returned shed doubtless have a lengthy list of chores for everyone from ivan outward and the next man outward from ivan was miles miles leafed through the old books in some dismay how many of these dusty ceremonies were they going to drag out of the museum it had been forty years since the last imperial wedding between prince serg of gloriousdubious memory and the illfated princess kareen that had been a circus of monumental proportions and serg had only been the heir not the reigning emperor still miles supposed such a renewal of the forms of the vor cemented their fraying identity as a class perhaps a wellconceived and conducted ceremony would act as a kind of social immunosuppressant to keep the vor from rejecting the transplanted komarran tissue alys certainly seemed to think so and she ought to know the vorpatrils were as oldvor as they came glumly he contemplated his future duties he supposed being the second to the emperor at his wedding was politically as well as socially important given the degree to which the two modes could run together in vorbarr sultana but it still made him feel about as useful as a plaster lawn statue holding up a flambeau well duty had brought him much stranger tasks before this would he rather be back cleaning freezing drains under camp permafrost or running around jacksons whole one step ahead of some psychotic local barons goon squads dont answer that boy lady alys had found a temporary replacement for herself as gregors social chaperone in drou koudelka the commodores wife and delias mother miles discovered this when madame koudelka called to issue an invitationcommand for him to come be vorishly ornamental at another of gregors courting picnics miles arrived a trifle early at the residences east portico only to run into a mob of men in parade red and blues just leaving some ultraformal morning ceremony he stood aside to let the uniformed officers pass trying to keep the naked envy out of his face one man stepped down the stairs slowly and carefully leaning on the railing miles recognized him instantly and quelled an impulse to try to duck behind the nearest topiaried bush lieutenant vorberg vorberg had never seen admiral naismith only a sawedoff suit of combat armor it had apparently been gregors day to hand out various imperial recognitions for a new decoration gleamed on vorbergs chest the one for being wounded in the emperors service miles had half a jar full of similar ones at home in a drawer at some point illyan had stopped issuing them to him anymore perhaps fearing that miless threat to don them all at once sometime was not facetious but it was clearly the first serious honor vorberg had ever had occasion to collect for he wore it with a bemused selfconsciousness miles couldnt help himself ahvorberg is it he essayed as the lieutenant passed him vorberg blinked uncertainly at him then his face cleared vorkosigan yes ive seen you around galactic affairs hq on komarr i believe he nodded cordially one impsec courier and fellow vor to another whered you collect the bad luck charm miles nodded to vorbergs chest or should i not ask its not that classified i was on a routinefairly routinerun out past zoave twilight bunch of goddamn hijackers captured the ship i was on not one of our courier ships surely id have heard about that it would have been a major flap i wish it had been impsec might have sent a proper force after me for that it was just a commercial freighter of zoavan registry so anyway impsec in its infinite wisdom and doubtless under the advice of the same budgetpinching accountants who booked me on that damned ship in the first place scraped up some lowbidder mere outfit to try and spring me it was a real foulup he lowered his voice confidentially if youre ever out that way yourself avoid the collection of clowns calling itself the dendarii free mercenary fleet theyre deadly isnt that the idea not to your own side its not oh someone must have told vorberg hed been hit by friendly fire the surgeon probably she was incurably honest but ive heard of the dendarii i mean obviously they have some renegade barrayarans in their ranks or they wouldnt have named themselves after my districts chief geographical feature unless they had some military history buff who was impressed by my grandfathers guerrilla campaigns their exec officer was some expatriate barrayaran yes i met him their commanders rumored to be betan apparently he escaped betan therapy i thought the dendarii were supposed to be good not notably youre here arent you said miles nettled he controlled himself so are you going back on duty i get to ride a desk or something at hq for a couple of weeks after this vorbergs vague nod indicated the ceremony just concluded makework i dont see why my legs cant finish healing while i travel but evidently the docs think i ought to be able to run away at full speed if required thats the truth miles admitted ruefully if i had only moved a little faster myself he cut off his words for the first time vorberg seemed to become aware of miless subdued civilian garb are you on medical leave too miless voice went curt im on medical discharge oh vorberg had the grace to look embarrassed buti thought you had some kind of special dispensation from um above vorberg might be a little vague on who miles was but he knew exactly who miless father was i exceeded it courtesy of a needle grenade ouch said vorberg that sounds even more unpleasant than plasma fire im sorry to hear it what do you plan to do then i really dont know will you go back to your district no i have um social duties that will keep me in vorbarr sultana for a while the general announcement of gregors betrothal had not yet been made there would doubtless be a leak sometime but miles was determined it wouldnt be from him impsec hq was going to be a very busy place once these nuptial preparations went into full swing if miles were still working there now would be a wonderful time to seek some extended and very distant galactic mission but he couldnt very well warn vorberg of that vorkosigan house is home enough perhaps ill see you around good luck to you you too miles gave him an analysts salute and passed on vorberg of course did not return the salutelike gesture to a civilian but merely nodded politely gregors majordomo ushered miles through to another garden party minus the horse this time and not so intimate gregors close friend count henry vorvolk and his countess were present and a couple of other of gregors cronies the social agenda of the afternoon seemed to be to introduce the prospective bride to the next circle of imperial acquaintances outward from foster family such as alys miles and ivan gregor arrived a little late obviously having just changed from the parade uniform of this mornings award ceremony drou koudelka delias mother presided cheerfully in the absent alyss place drou had formerly been gregors own bodyguard in his childhood before shed married koudelka and had also run security for miless mother miles could see that gregor was anxious that drou and laisa hit it off well gregor neednt have worried madame koudelka immensely experienced in the vorbarr sultana scene got on well with everyone as a close observer of the vor while not one of them she was very well placed to pass on private advice to laisa which seemed to be gregors idea laisa did well too as usual she had the instincts of an ambassador was observant and never made the same mistake twice dropping her down in a barrayaran city slum or the far backcountry and expecting her to survive might be optimistic but it was clear she could handle barrayars galactic interface quite comfortably despite the agenda gregor did manage to get his fiancee to himself for a while when at his broad imperial hint the group broke up for a postprandial stroll through the grounds miles ducked out with delia koudelka to sit on a bench overlooking the formal section of the gardens and watch the minuet as the diligent strollers charitably tried to avoid gregor and laisa along the branching paths hows your da miles asked her when theyd settled i should go see him i suppose yes hed wondered why you seemed to be avoiding him this home leave then we heard about your medical discharge he told me to tell you he was awfully sorry about that did you already know it was coming up that night we went to the state dinner you never let on but it couldnt have been a surprise to you i was still desperately hoping i might skin out of it somehow not strictly true hed been in a state of complete denial not thinking about it at all bad mistake in retrospect hows your captain galeni despite everyones assumption to the contrary duv galeni is not my personal property she pursed her lips impatiently you know what i mean hows he taking laisas engagement to gregor i was sure he was sweet on her that night not real well miles admitted but hell get over it he was just courting too slowly i guess she must have decided he wasnt that interested it would be a nice change from louts trying to crawl all over you delia sighed miles pictured himself with pitons and lots and lots of rope attempting mount delia a very dangerous face that one and how are you getting on with ivan these days i didnt know if i ought to apologize for hijacking you from him that night oh ivan miles smiled faintly are you looking forward to this imperial wedding well mothers all excited at least for gregors sake shes planning all our clothes already and wondering if my sister kareen can get back from beta colony for it i wonder if she thinks weddings are contagious we keep getting these little hints that ma and da would like the house back for themselves someday or at least the bathrooms and you well there will be dancing she brightened and maybe interesting men ivans not an interesting man i said men not boys hes almost thirty youre what twentyfour its not the years its the attitude boys just want to get laid men want to get married and get on with their lives im pretty sure men want to get laid too miles said rather apologetically well yes but its not such an allencompassing desire they have some brain cells left over for other functions you cant tell me women dont reciprocate maybe were more selective your argument is not supported by the statistics almost everybody seems to get married they cant be that selective she looked thoughtful apparently struck by this only in our culture kareen says on beta colony they do it differently they do everything differently on beta colony so maybe it is just contagious so how come i seem immune im surprised none of you girls have been snapped up yet its because theres four of us i think delia confided fellows get close to the herd and then get all confused as to whos their target i can see that miles allowed en masse the koudelka blondes were a most unnerving phenomenon looking to ditch your sisters are you any time delia sighed the vorvolks strolled by and stopped to chat miles and delia ended up drifting back to madame koudelka in their wake and the party broke up miles returned to vorkosigan house to scrounge around diligently for any task other than the homework the departing lady alys had dropped on him miles was ensconced in the yellow parlor after dinner in a close review of tsipis s monthly financial report making notes and still ignoring the pile of leatherbound dusty volumes in the corner when martin barged in somebody came to the door martin announced in a tone of mild amazement as an apprentice butler a chore he had picked up by default in addition to his duties as driver and occasional dishwasher martin had received instructions on the appropriate methods for ushering visitors inside and guiding them through the labyrinth of the house to its living inhabitant it was perhaps time for a short review of the principles involved miles set down his readerunit so did you let him her or it in not a salesperson i trust the gate guards usually good about keeping them out duv galeni stepped in behind martin miles swallowed his patter galeni was in uniform still the undress greens of his days office duties he did not appear to be armed in fact he mostly looked just tired and a little disturbed but without that subtle manic edge that miles had learned to redflag oh miles managed come in have a seat galenis hand opened dryly acknowledging the invitation despite the fact that he was in already he settled stiffly into a straight chair would you care for a drink no thank you ah that will be all then martin thank you after a beat martin took the hint and decamped miles had no idea where this was going so merely raised his brows galeni cleared his throat uncomfortably i believe i owe you an apology i was out of line miles relaxed perhaps it was going to be all right yes and yes but it was understandable which is enough said galeni nodded shortly back to his normal cool mode um i hope i was your only confidant that night yes but that is only the preamble to what i came for something rather more difficult has come up now what please no more complicated lovelives oh what sort of something its a professional dilemma not a personal one this time im out of impsec miles carefully did not point out he waited curiosity aroused galeni frowned more deeply tell me have you ever caught simon illyan in a mistake well he fired me said miles wryly galenis hand twitched rejecting the joke no i mean an error miles hesitated hes not superhuman ive seen him get led astray down some incorrect line of reasoning though not too often hes pretty good about constantly rechecking his theories against new data not complex mistakes simple ones not really miles paused have you never before this i havent worked intimately with him you understand theres a weekly briefing with my department and the occasional special request for information but there have been four odd incidents in the last three days incidents eh what sort the first one he asked me for a digest i was preparing i finished it and sent it upstairs then two hours later he called down and requested it again there was a moment of confusion then his secretary confirmed from the office log i had delivered it and said hed already handed it in to him illyan then found the code card on his desk and apologized and i didnt think anything more about it he was impatient miles suggested galeni shrugged the second thing was so small just a memo from his office with the wrong date i called his secretary and had it corrected no problem mm galeni took a breath the third thing was a memo with the wrong date addressed to my predecessor who hasnt been there for five months and asking for the latest report on a certain joint komarranbarrayaran trade fleet that had gone on a long circuit out past tau ceti and which had returned to home orbit six months ago when i called up to find out just what kind of information he wanted he denied asking for any such thing i shot the memo back to him and he got real quiet and cut the com that was this morning thats three then there was the weekly briefing this afternoon with my department the five of us komarran affairs analysts and general allegre you know illyans normal delivery style long pauses but very incisive when he does speak there were more pauses and what came out in between seemed to jump around sometimes bewilderingly he dismissed us early before we were half done um what was todays topic galenis mouth shut yes i understand you really cant tell me but if it was gregors upcoming matrimonial projectmaybe he was editing out things for your benefit on the fly or something if he didnt trust me he shouldnt have had me there at all snapped galeni he added reluctantly its a good theory but it doesnt quite i wish you had been there miles set his teeth against the obvious quips what are you suggesting i dont know impsec spent quite a lot of money and time training me as an analyst i look for changes in patterns this is one but im the new face in town and a komarran to boot youve known illyan all your life have you seen this before no miles admitted but those all sound like normal human errors if theyd been more spread out i doubt id have noticed i dont needor wantto know details but is illyan under any special strain in his personal life right now that none of us in the office know about like you are duv i dont think illyan has a personal life never married lived in the same little apartment six blocks from work for fifteen years till they tore the building down he moved into one of the witness apartments on the lower level of hq as a temporary stopgap two years ago and still hasnt bothered to move out i dont know about his early life but there havent been any women lately nor men either nor sheep though i suppose i could see sheep they cant talk even under fastpenta thats a joke he added as galeni failed to smile illyans life is regular as a clock he likes music never dances notices perfumes and flowers with a lot of scent and odors generally its a form of sensory input that isnt routed through his chip i dont think it does somatic stuff either no touch just audio and visual yes i was wondering about that chip do you know anything about that supposed chipinduced psychosis i dont think it can be the chip i dont know that much about its tech specs but all those folks were supposed to have gone wonky within a year or two of its installation if illyan was going to go nuts he should have done it decades ago miles hesitated one does wonder about stress ministrokes hes sixtyplus hell maybe hes just tired hes had that damned job for thirty years i know he was planning to retire in five years miles decided not to explain how he knew that i cannot imagine impsec without illyan the two are synonyms im not sure he actually likes his job hes just very good at it hes had so much experience hes almost impossible to surprise or panic he has a very personal system for running the place galeni observed its quite vorish really most nonbarrayaran organizations attempt to define their tasks so as to make the people who hold them interchangeable parts it assures organizational continuity and eliminates inspiration illyans leadership style isnt very flashy i admit but hes flexible and infinitely reliable galeni cocked an eyebrow infinitely usually reliable miles corrected quickly for the first time miles wondered if illyan was naturally drab hed always assumed it was a response to the highsecurity aspects of illyans joba life with no handles for enemies to grab and twist but maybe instead his colorless approach was how he dealt with whatever it was about the memory chip that had overwhelmed others galeni placed his hands out flat across his knees ive told you what ive observed do you have any suggestions miles sighed watch wait what youve got here so far isnt even a theory its a handful of water my theory is theres something very wrong with this handful of water thats an intuition which is not an insult by the way ive learned a deep respect for intuition but you mustnt confuse it with proof i dont know what to say if illyan is developing some sort of subtle cognitive problems its up to his department heads to what mutiny go over illyans head the only two people on the planet with that kind of elevation were prime minister racozy and emperor gregor if this is something real other people are going to notice it eventually and its better that it should be pointed out first by anyone else in impsec but you except me that would be worse what if they all feel that way i miles rubbed his forehead im glad you talked to me only because you were the one person i knew whose knowledge of illyan had a really long baseline otherwise im not sure i should be talking about it at all not outside of impsec nor inside of impsec either though theres haroche hes worked directly under illyan for almost as long as i did that may be why i found it difficult to approach him well talk to me again huh if anything else disturbs you maybe its all hot air said galeni not very hopefully miles could recognize denial at a hundred meters these days yeah urn you want to change your mind about that drink yeah sighed galeni two mornings after this miles was deeply involved in an inventory of his closets limited civilian contents making a list of gaps and wondering if it would be simpler to just hire a valet and say take care of it when his bedroom comconsole chimed he ignored it for a minute then clambered up off the floor next to the pile of discarded clothing and slouched to answer it illyans stern face appeared and miless spine automatically straightened yes sir where are you illyan asked abruptly miles stared vorkosigan house you just rang me here i know that said illyan irritably why werent you here at as ordered excuse me what orders my orders be there at sharp and bring your notepad youll like this one its a breakout i thought youd be early miles recognized the style of an illyanesque verbatim selfquote all right the content rang a very faint bell it was an alarm bell whats this all about something my cetagandan analysts have cooked up and spent a week pitching to me it could be a very highresult lowcost bit of tactical judo theres a gentleman by the name of colonel tremont whom they think may be the best man to give the fading marilacan resistance a shot in the arm theres just one little hitch hes presently a guest in the cetagandan prison camp on dagoola iv the experience should have given him lots of motivation if he can be freed anonymously of course i plan to give you considerable discretion as to the method but those are the results i want a new leader for maniac and no connection with barrayar miles didnt merely recognize the mission he could swear those had been the exact words that illyan had first used to describe it at a highly secret morning conference at impsec hq long ago simon the dagoola mission was completed five years back the marilacans threw the last of the cetagandans off their planet last year you fired me over a month ago i dont work for you anymore have you lost your mind illyan demanded and stopped abruptly they stared at one another illyans face changed froze excuse me he muttered and cut the com miles just sat staring at the empty vid plate hed never before felt his heart pound like this while sitting perfectly still in an empty room galenis report had worried him now he was terrified chapter fourteen miles sat unmoving for ten minutes galeni had been right hell galeni hadnt guessed the half of it illyan wasnt just forgetting things that were there he was remembering things that werent flashbacks hey if the man cant tell what year it is i see a way you could get your old job back it wasnt very funny what to do miles was surely the one person on barrayar who dared not say a word in criticism of illyan it would be attributed instantly to a posttermination snit or worse attempted vengeance but he could not ignore the situation not knowing what he knew now orders flowed from illyans office and people obeyed them trustingly thirty years of accumulated trust was a bank it would take time to break how much damage could illyan do in the meantime now of all times suppose illyan flashed back to some of the messier moments of the komarr revolt and how long had this been going on before galeni noticed it seemed sudden but perhaps it was only suddenly visible how many weeksmonthsof orders were tainted with this unreliability somebody was going to have to go back over every message that had emanated from illyans office all the way back towhen someone but not me and was the malfunction sited in the chip or in illyans own neural tissue or was it some subtle synergistic dysfunction that was a medical and bioengineering question and it would take a technical expert to answer it again not me in the end he turned to exactly the solution if you could call it that which galeni had fallen back on bounce the information to someone else and hope theyll do something so how long was it going to take the committee of concerned illyanobservers to stop tossing the hot ball back and forth and unite in effective action its not my decision i wish to hell it were reluctantly he punched in a comconsole code this is lord vorkosigan connect me to the office of domestic affairs please he told the impsec corporal who answered general haroche wasnt in have him call me as soon as you can reach him miles told the office clerk its urgent he turned back to his piles of clothing while he waited he scarcely knew which ones to pitch and which ones to put back haroche didnt call miles tried his office two more times before he finally ran the man down haroche frowned impatiently at him from the comconsole imager yes what is it lord vorkosigan miles took a deep breath simon illyan called me a short time ago i think you should review the call excuse me go up to illyan s office and get his secretary to replay the call for you in fact you should both see it i know it was recorded its standard operating procedure why indeed why should haroche take the word of a security pariah whom he had witnessed his respected superior illyan not only discharge but personally escort from his hq general its really important its really urgent and i really would rather you judged it for yourself youre being theatrically mysterious lord vorkosigan haroche frowned unamused disapproval im sorry miles kept his voice flat and level youll understand when you see it haroche raised one eyebrow oh maybe i will then thank you miles cut the com no use in asking haroche to call back after viewing the vid it would be out of miless hands for certain then there hed done it done the right thing as nearly as possible under the circumstances he felt quite sick now should he call gregor it was unfair to let the emperor be blindsided in this but god haroche would do so soon enough miles supposed as soon as he caught up with events and put illyan under proper medical care haroche would by default and the chain of command become acting chief of impsec and his immediate next duty would be to notify gregor of this unpleasant turn of events and determine the emperors will in the matter it would all be over before the day was done maybe the cause of illyans confusion was something simple easily fixed maybe hed be back on duty within days a short circuit in his chip say theres nothing simple about that chip but impsec would take care of its own miles sighed and returned to his list of selfimposed little chores barely attentive he tried to read but could not concentrate it wasnt possible for illyan to be covering his tracks in this was it suppose haroche had gone up to view that call and it wasnt on the log anymore but if illyan had that degree of selfawareness he ought to have turned himself in for medical treatment the day dragged on interminably in the evening when he broke and called both gregor and haroche he could not reach either mutually tied up on this crisis perhaps he left messages requesting return calls which did not come he slept badly he hated being out of the information circuit by the following evening miles was ready to go in person to pound on impsecs back door and demand secret reports to which he had no entitlement whatsoever when galeni turned up at vorkosigan house hed obviously come straight from work still in uniform and looked grim even by his own morose standards drink said miles after one look at his face when martin ushered him into the yellow parlor with a proper announcement this time dinner drink galeni flung himself into the nearest armchair and leaned his head back as if his neck ached right down to the base of his spine ill think about dinner im not hungry yet he waited until martin had departed to add its over talk what happened illyan broke down completely in the middle of the alldepartments briefing this afternoon this afternoon you mean general haroche didnt turn him over to the impsec medical department yesterday what miles described his disturbing call from illyan i notified haroche immediately please dont tell me the man didnt do what i told him to i dont know said galeni i can only report what i saw as a trained analyst not to mention historian galeni had a keen sense of the difference between eyewitness testimony hearsay and speculation you always knew which category whatever he was recounting fell into illyans under medical care now isnt he miles demanded in worry oh god yes sighed galeni the briefing started out almost normally the department heads gave their weekly precis reports and listed all the red flag items they want the other departments to watch out for illyan seemed nervous more restless than usual fiddling with objects on the table he snapped a data card in half then muttered some apology he stood up to give his usual list of chores for everyone and it came out one line never tracked another he was all over the map not as if he thought it were the wrong day but as if it were the wrong twenty days every sentence was grammatically correct and completely incoherent and he didnt even seem to be aware of it till he began looking at all of us staring at him with our jaws hanging open and ran down then haroche stood upi swear it was the bravest thing i ever saw and said sir i believe you should present yourself for medical evaluation immediately and illyan barked back that he wasnt sick and told haroche to sit the hell down except the look in his eyes kept flashing back and forth between rage and bewilderment he was shaking where is that hulking teenager of yours with the drinks probably took a wrong turn again and is lost in the other wing hell sort himself out eventually please go on ah galeni rubbed his neck illyan didnt want to go haroche called for a medic illyan countermanded him said he couldnt leave in the middle of a crisis except the crisis he seemed to think we were in the middle of was the cetagandan invasion of vervain ten years ago haroche who was about the color of milk by then took him by the arm and tried to steer him outthat was a mistake because illyan started to fight him haroche yelled oh shit get a medic and hurry which was bright of him damn but illyan fights dirty when he fights id never seen that neither have i said miles sickly fascinated two other men needed medics by the time the medic got there they sedated illyan to the eyeballs and tied him down in the impsec hq clinic and that was the end of that committee meeting and to think i used to complain that they were boring ah god miles pressed his hands to his eyes and massaged his face the scenario could hardly have been worse had it been deliberately engineered for maximum chaos and humiliation and number of witnesses haroche is staying late at work tonight needless to say galeni went on the whole buildings in a suppressed uproar haroche gave us all orders not to talk to anyone of course except me he forgot to except you for some reason said galeni dryly so you didnt get this from me you didnt get this period quite i understand i assume hes reported this to gregor by now one hopes dammit haroche should have had illyan under medical care before quitting time last night he looked pretty scared we all did arresting the chief of imperial security in the middle of impsec hq is not an easy task no no i shouldnt criticize the man whos in the line of fire i suppose he would have had to take enough time to make sure its not the sort of thing you dare make a mistake on if you value your career which haroche does taking illyan down in such a public arena seemed needlessly cruel at least illyan fired me in private but on the other hand it was absolutely clear no ambiguity about it no room for confusion or rumor or innuendo or argument bad timing for this miles went on though i dont suppose there is such a thing as a good time to have a biocybernetic breakdown i wonder if the strain of all these upcoming um imperial demands was causal it hardly seems possible illyans weathered much worse crises than a wedding a strain doesnt have to be the worst to be the last galeni pointed out this thing could have been hanging by a thread since who knows when galeni hesitated i dont suppose this could have already been underway when he fired you i mean might you argue that his judgment was already impaired miles swallowed not certain he was grateful to galeni for saying out loud something he scarcely dared think i wish i could say so but no there was nothing wrong with his judgment then it followed quite logically from his principles so when did this start its a critical question yes ive asked it of myself everyone else will be asking too im sure well all have to wait on the impsec physicians to tell us i guess speaking of which was there any word yet as to exactly what did cause this thing nothing that trickled down to me but they can hardly have started to examine the problem yet i suppose theyll have to fly in obscure experts martin appeared at last with their drinks and galeni elected to stay to dinner a bit of news that made martins face fall since ma kosti served the two men elegantly and abundantly on zero notice miles could only assume martin had been forced to give up his portion to the guest and been required to subsist on sandwiches having seen ma kostis idea of a quick snack miles did not feel overly guilty about this though her art tonight was somewhat wasted on his and galenis distraction still the worst was over with illyan and the larger dangers averted the rest would just be cleanup the pressed gargoyles on the lintel over the side door to impsec hq were looking particularly suffused this morning miles thought as if weighed down with sorrow and about to burst from the internal pressure of their sinister secrets and the expressions on the faces of some of the men he passed bore a subtle resemblance to those of their granite mascots the clerk at the security desk in the lobby looked up at him with a harried blink may i help you sir im lord vorkosigan im here to see simon illyan the clerk checked his comconsole you arent on my roster my lord no i just dropped by to visit him the clerk and everyone else had to at least know that illyan was off duty if only because they had to have been informed that haroche was now their acting chief in the clinic give me a tag and let me in please i cant do that my lord of course you can its your job whos duty officer today major jarlais my lord good he knows me call him for your authorization then jarlaiss face appeared on the clerks comconsole within a couple of minutes yes the clerk explained miless request i dont think thats possible my lord jarlais said uncertainly to miles who was leaning into range of the vid pickup over the clerks shoulder miles sighed call your boss no hell its going to take thirty minutes to work my way up the entire chain of command lets cut out the middlemen eh i hate to bother him when hes as busy as he undoubtedly is this morning but just call general haroche jarlais obviously was equally reluctant to interrupt his superior but a vor lord in ones lobby was hard to dismiss and impossible to ignore they got through to haroches comconsole in a mere ten minutes good work under the circumstances miles thought good morning general miles said to haroche s image over the desk clerks vid plate i came in to see simon impossible rumbled haroche miless voice grew edged its impossible only if hes dead i think you are trying to say that you dont wish to allow it why not haroche hesitated corporal set your cone of silence and give up your comconsole seat to lord vorkosigan for a moment please the clerk obediently slid aside a shadow fell around miles and haroches image from the security generator over the station chair where did you hear about this haroche demanded suspiciously as soon as their privacy was assured miles raised his brows and switched gears without a moments pause i was worried when you didnt call me back after my call to you of day before yesterday and didnt return any of my other messages i finally called gregor oh said haroche his suspicion faded into mere irritation that was a close one miles realized if haroche hadnt reported to gregor yet it could have been a major stumble potentially very damaging to galeni hed better be carefully vague about when hed supposedly talked to the emperor until he actually did i want to see illyan illyan may not even be able to recognize you said haroche after a long pause hes babbling classified material at a meter a minute i had to assign guards of the highest security levels so what im cleared at the highest security levels hell he was classified material surely not your clearance must have been revoked when you were discharged check it ah hell haroche had access to all of illyans files now he could look up the full true story of miless termination any time he had a minute miles hoped he hadnt had too many spare minutes to devote to such inquiries in the last day haroche after a narroweyed look at miles tapped out a code on his comconsole your clearance is still on file he said in some surprise there you go illyan must have forgotten to alter it was he growing confused as early as that well his hand tapped on i revoke it now you cant do that miles bit back the outraged scream haroche most certainly could miles stared at him frustrated so what was he going to do flounce out of impsec with an angry cry of well just see about that im going to tell my big brother on you no gregor was a card he dared only play once and only in the direst emergency he let out his breath and his anger in a carefully controlled sigh general prudence is one thing paranoia that cant tell friend from foe is quite another lord vorkosigan said haroche equally tightly we dont yet know what we have here i dont have time to spend entertaining idly curious civilians this morning friendly or not please do not pester my staff any more whatever the emperor chooses to pass on to you is his business my only duty is to report to him good day he cut the com with a firm swipe the cone of silence vanished from around miles leaving him in the lobby again with the clerk staring earnestly at him that did not go well the first thing he did upon returning to vorkosigan house was lock himself in his bedroom and call gregor it took fortyfive minutes to get through if it had taken fortyfive hours he would have persisted just the same gregor miles began without preamble when the emperors face appeared over his vid plate what the hell is going on with illyan where did you hear about it asked gregor unconsciously echoing haroche and looking worried miles summed up illyans call to him and his call to haroche of two days ago he again left galeni out of it and then what happened somethings happened obviously gregor gave him a brief precis of illyan s breakdown minus most of the harrowing details supplied by galeni haroche had him admitted to impsecs own clinic which makes sense under the circumstances yes i tried to see illyan this morning haroche wouldnt let me in they can bring whatever equipment or experts they need in there ive personally granted funds and authority for anything haroche wants to requisition gregor track this for a moment haroche wouldnt let me in to see illyan gregors fingers spread in a frustrated gesture miles give the man a break he has his hands full suddenly taking over all illyans duties transferring his own department to the administration of his secondlet him settle for a few days without jogging his elbow please when he feels more in control im sure he will relax you have to admit simon would be the first to approve a cautious approach to such an emergency true simon would prefer to be in the hands of people who really cared about security but im beginning to think i would prefer it if there were any signs he was in the hands of people who really cared about simon illyan he remembered the lingering nightmare of his own bout of postcryorevival amnesia it had been one of the most terrifying periods of his life to have so lost his memories himself was illyan experiencing something like that right now or something even more grotesque miles had been lost among strangers illyan seemed lost among what should have been friends miles sighed all right ill leave poor haroche alone god knows i dont envy him his job but would you keep me posted on the medical bulletins i find all this unexpectedly dismaying gregor looked sympathetic illyan really was a mentor to you wasnt he in his own acerbic and demanding way yes it was an excellent way in retrospect but before that even he served my father for thirty years my whole life until i was eighteen years old i called him uncle simon till i was admitted to the service academy after which i just called him sir he had no surviving family of his own by then and his job and im beginning to think that damned chip in his head ate any chance of his starting a new one for himself i didnt realize you thought of him as some sort of foster father miles miles shrugged a foster uncle anyway its a family matter and i am vor pleased to hear you admit it murmured gregor one wonders if you realize the fact sometimes miles flushed what i owe to illyan is something all mixed up between a foster uncle and a family retainer and im the only vorkosigan on the planet at the moment it feels like no it is my responsibility the vorkosigans granted gregor were always nothing if not loyal it gets to be kind of a habit gregor sighed of course ill keep you informed once a day haroche will be giving you bulletins once a day i know with your morning impsec briefing yes illyan and my coffee always used to arrive together sometimes if he came in person hed bring the coffee himself i always felt it was a polite hint sit up and pay attention miles grinned thats illyan once a day yes oh very well look i must go now thanks gregor the emperor cut the com miles sat back partially satisfied he had to give events and people time to sort themselves out he thought of his own placid advice to galeni about intuition versus proof his intuition demon could just go back in its boxhe pictured himself stuffing a small naismithshaped gnome into a trunk and fastening the lid with straps and little tiny meeping and banging noises coming from inside i didnt become illyans top agent because i was better at following the rules than anybody else but it was too damned early to say theres something wrong with this picture or even to think it very loudly impsec would take care of its own it always did and he wasnt going to make a fool of himself in public again he would wait chapter fifteen the week dragged past the daily short briefings via comconsole from gregor seemed all right at first but as each one fell atop the last with little sense of progress impsecs caution began to seem downright glacial to miles he complained of this to gregor youre always impatient miles gregor pointed out nothing ever goes fast enough to suit you illyan shouldnt have to wait on doctors other people must maybe but not him dont they have any conclusions yet they ruled out stroke they ruled out stroke the first day then what what about the chip there is apparently some evidence of deterioration or damage to the chip we guessed that already too what kind when how why what the hell are they doing in there all this time theyre still working on ruling out other neurological problems and psychological ones its apparently not easy miles hunched grouchily i dont buy the iatrogenic psychosis idea hes had that chip in too long without any signs of problems like this before well thats just the point it seems illyan has had this particular neural augmentation in place and running for longer than any other human being ever there are no standards for comparison hes the baseline no one knows what thirtyfive years of accumulated artificial memory does to a personality we may be finding out i still think we ought to be finding out faster theyre doing all they can miles youll just have to wait like the rest of us yeah yeah gregor cut the com miles stared unseeing into the empty space over the vid plate the trouble with synopsized information was that it was always so nebulous the devil was in the details the raw data embedded therein were all the tiny clues that fed the intuition demon until it became strong and fat and sometimes grew up to become an actual theory or even a proof miles was at least three layers away from reality the impsec physicians synopsized it to haroche who boiled it down for gregor who filtered it to miles there werent enough facts left in the clarified drippings by that time to color an opinion lady alys vorpatril returned from her official journey to komarr the following morning that afternoon she called miles on his comconsole he braced himself for the impact of descending social duties some repressed inner voice cried incoming and dove for cover uselessly the inner man would simply have to be dragged out again by the heels and propped upright to march on her orders but instead her first words were miles how long have you known about this dreadful nonsense going on with simon um a couple of weeks did it never occur to any of you three young louts that i would wish to be informed young loutsivan miles and gregor she was upset there was nothing you could do you were halfway to komarr and you already had a toppriority job but no i confess i didnt think of it fools she breathed her brown eyes smoldered um how did things go by the way on komarr not terribly well laisas parents are rather upset i did what i could to soothe their fears given that i judge some of their anxieties to be quite well founded i asked your mother to stop on her way and speak to them some more mothers on her way home soon i hope ah are you sure my mother is the best person for that job she can be awfully blunt in her opinions of barrayar and shes not always the most diplomatic no but shes absolutely honest and she has this peculiar trick of making the most outlandish things seem perfectly sensible at least for the duration of the time shes talking to you people end up agreeing with her and then spending the next month wondering how it happened i have at any rate accomplished all the proper forms and duties of gregors baba so is gregors wedding on or off oh on of course but there is a difference between things done in a scramble and things done superbly well there will be enough tensions that i cant ease i dont intend to leave any hanging that i can eliminate goodwill is going to be at a premium she frowned fiercely speaking of goodwill or the lack of itthey told me simon was in the impsec headquarters clinic so of course i went immediately to see him that idiot general whatshisname wouldnt let me in haroche ventured miles yes that was it not a vor that fellow and it shows miles cant you do something me i have no authority but you worked with those those those men for years you understand them presumably i am impsec hed once told elli quinn hed been quite proud to identify himself with that powerful organization as if theyd flowed together to become some sort of higher cyborg well he was amputated now and impsec seemed to be stumping along without him in perfect indifference i dont work for them anymore and if i did id still be just a lowly lieutenant lieutenants dont give orders to generals not even vor lieutenants haroche wouldnt let me in either i think you need to talk to gregor i just did he was quite maddeningly vague about it all maybe he didnt want to distress you i gather illyan is in a pretty disturbing mental state right now not recognizing people and so on well how can he if no one he knows is allowed to see him um good point look i have no intention of defending haroche to you im pretty annoyed at him myself not annoyed enough snapped lady alys haroche actually had the nerve to tell meme that it was no sight for a lady i asked him what he had been doing during the war of vordarians pretendership her voice trailed off in a hissmiless ear was not quite sure but he thought it detected suppressed barracks language i can see gregor is thinking he may have to work with haroche for a long time yet he didnt say it in so many words naturally but i gather haroche has persuaded gregor that his status as acting chief of impsec is too new and fragile to bear interference from such dangerously unauthorizedand femalepersons such as myself simon never had any such qualms i wish cordelia were here she was always better than i at cutting through masculinist drivel so to speak said miles thinking of vordarians fate at his mothers hands but lady alys was quite correct illyan had always treated her as a valued though different member of gregors support team haroches new and tighter professional order must have come as a bit of a shock to her miles went on haroche is in an excellent position to persuade gregor hes in total control of the flow of all information to him though you couldnt call that a change in how things were done it had always been that way but when illyan had been the sluice keeper it had somehow never bothered miles alyss dark brows twitched she said nothing aloud to this beneath her speculative frown the silence grew noticeable to break the discomfort his unguarded words had engendered miles said lightly you could go on strike no wedding till gregor twists haroches arm for you if something sensible isnt done and done soon i just might i was joking he said hastily i was not she gave him a curt nod and cut the com martin cautiously shook miles awake shortly after dawn the next morning um mlord you have a visitor downstairs at this ungodly hour miles rubbed his sleepnumbed face and yawned who says his names lieutenant vorberg one of your impsec sticks again i guess vorberg miles blinked here now why he wants to talk to you so i guess youd better ask him quite martin um you didnt leave him standing on the doorstep did you no i put him in that big downstairs room on the east side the second receiving room thats fine tell him ill be down in just a minute make some coffee bring there on a tray with two cups and the usual trimmings if theres any of your mothers pastries or breads left over in the kitchen stuff em in a basket or something and bring them too right good curiosity aroused miles pulled on the first shirt and trousers that came to hand and padded barefoot down two flights of the curving front staircase then turned ft and made his way through three more rooms till he came to second rec martin had pulled a cover off one clair for the guest and left it in a white heap on the floor fingers of sunlight poked through the heavy curtains leaving the shadows in which vorberg sat somehow denser the lieutenant was wearing undress greens but his face was gray with a faint beard stubble he frowned wearily at miles good morning vorberg said miles cautiously polite what brings you to vorkosigan house so early i the day its late in the day for me said vorberg i just came off night shift his brows lowered they found you a job did they yes im night guard commander for the close security on the clinic miles sat down on a covered chair abruptly awake even without coffee vorberg was one of illyans guards but of course as a courier he already had the kind of clearance required he was at loose ends readily requisitionable for a physically light if mentally demanding duty and he was an hq outsider no close old friends there to gossip with miles tried to keep his tone level noncommittal oh whats up vorbergs voice went tight almost angry i do think its bad form of you vorkosigan almost petty under the circumstances illyan was your fathers man for years passed the message on at least four times why havent you come miles sat very still excuse me i think ive missed the first half of something what ah could you please tell me exactly whats been going on in there how long have you been on this duty since the first night they brought him in its been pretty ugly when hes not sedated he babbles when he is sedated if hes been combative again he still babbles but you cant make out what hes saying the medics keep him restrained almost all the time its as if hes wandering through history in his mind but every once in a while he seems to pass through the present and when he does he asks for you at first i thought it was the count your father he wanted but its definitely you miles he says and get that idiot boy in here and havent you found him yet vorberg its not like you can mistake the hyperactive little shit sorry vorberg added as an afterthought thats just what he said i recognize the style whispered miles he cleared his throat and his voice grew stronger im sorry this is the first ive heard of this impossible ive passed it on in my night report four or five nights in a row now gregor would not have failed to redirect such a word gregor hadnt a hint of this the break was somewhere else up in vorbergs chain of command we will find out oh yes we will what kind of medical treatment or tests is he receiving i dont know nothing much happens on my shift i suppose thats reasonable they both fell silent as martin brought the coffee and rolls on a baking sheet for a makeshift traymake a note for lesson six in butlering finding the serving utensils snagged a roll for himself smiled cheerily and strolled back out vorberg blinked at this odd turn of service but sucked down coffee gratefully he frowned again at miles more speculatively this time ive been hearing a lot of strange things from the man in the deep night between the times the sedatives wear off and before he goes uh goes noisy and wins another dose yes i would imagine so do you know why illyan is asking for me not exactly even in his more lucid moments it comes out sounding pretty garbled but ive been getting the damnedest unpleasant feeling that the problem is half in me because i dont know the background i cant decipher what may be perfectly clear statements i have figured out you were never a bloody courier no covert ops a sunbeam was creeping over his chair arm making the coffee in the thin cup perched here glow red high level covert ops said vorberg watching him in the shadows and light beams the highest i dont quite know why he discharged you ah miles smiled bleakly i really must tell you someday its true about the needle grenade just not complete part of the time he doesnt seem to know he discharged you but part of the time he does and he still asks for you even then have you ever reported this directly to general haroche yes twice what did he say thank you lieutenant vorberg i see i dont well neither do i completely but now i think i can find out ah i think perhaps this conversation had better not have taken place vorbergs eyes narrowed oh that conversation we had on the steps outside the residence will do instead if anyone inquires ho and just what are you to the dendarii mercenaries vorkosigan nothing now well you covert ops fellows were always the worst bunch of weasels i ever met so i dont know even now if i trust you but if youre being straight with me im glad for the sake of the vor that you havent just abandoned your fathers liegeman theres not many of us left who care enough to enough to i dont know how to say it who care enough to make vor real suggested miles yes said vorberg gratefully thats right damn straight vorberg an hour later miles strode through the graying morning to the side portal of impsec hq clouds were blowing in from the east chilling the promise of the early sun he could smell rain in the air the granite gargoyles looked blank and surly in the shadowless light the building above them rose big and closed and blocky and ugly haroches first concern had been to place guards with the highest security clearances around illyan not a word about doctors with the highest clearances or medtechs or god forbid the best experts possible cleared or not he wasnt treating illyan so much as a patient as a prisoner a prisoner of his own organizationdid illyan appreciate the irony miles suspected not so was haroche paranoid and thickheaded by nature or merely temporarily panicked by his new responsibilities haroche couldnt have arrived where he was by being stupid but his new and complex job had fallen into his lap suddenly and with little warning haroche had started his career in service security as a military policeman as domestic affairs assistant and then chief hed largely interfaced downward and inward dealing with predictable military subordinates illyan had been impsecs upward and outward face dealing smoothly with the emperor the vor lords all the unwritten and sometimes unacknowledged rules of the idiosyncratic vor system illyans handling of alys vorpatril for example had been subtly brilliant giving him a wide open pipeline of information into the private side of vor society in the capital that had more than once proved an enormously valuable supplement to more official dealings in his first encounter with her haroche had deeply offended this potential ally as if the fact that she didnt appear in the governments organizational flow chart meant her power didnt exist chalk up a big one in favor of the thickheaded hypothesis but as for the paranoiamiles had to acknowledge illyans head was so stuffed with the hottest barrayaran secrets of the last three decades it was a wonder it hadnt melted down long before this you couldnt let him go wandering off down the street not knowing what year it as haroche s caution was in fact commendable but it might to have been tinged with more what respect courtesy grief miles took a breath and marched through the doors martin who had been unusually fortunate in finding large enough parking place quite nearby for the counts armored groundcar trailed him uncertainly clearly awed at the sinister building despite his family connection miles planted himself before the security desk and frowned at the clerk the same fellow whod been on duty last week good morning again im here to see simon illyan um the clerk tapped his comconsole youre still not on my roster lord vorkosigan no but i am on your doorstep and i intend to stay here until i get some results call your chief the clerk hesitated but came down in favor of letting someone with more status face down a vor lord even so short and odd a one as miles they hung up briefly at the level of haroches formerly illyans secretary but miles evicted the clerk from his station chair and bulled through to haroche himself good morning general im here to see illyan again i thought id settled that illyan is in no condition to socialize i didnt think he was i request admittance to see him request denied haroches hand moved to cut the com miles controlled his temper and tried to muster soft words and weasely arguments he was willing to talk all day till he talked himself inside no not soft wordsharoche favored a blunt approach for all that he assiduously tailored his own speech to vorbarr sultana upperclass standard haroche talk to me this is getting old what the devils going on in there that has the hairs up your butt so bad im trying to help dammit for a moment haroche frowned less deeply but then his face hardened again vorkosigan you have no business in this place now please remove yourself no then i will have you removed then i will return haroches lips thinned i dont suppose i can have you shot considering who your father is and besides its known that you have mental problems but if you go on making a nuisance of yourself i might have you arrested on what charge trespass in a restricted area alone is good for a year in detention i imagine i could come up with others resisting arrest is almost a sure bet but i wouldnt hesitate to have you stunned he wouldnt dare how many times how many times do you propose to make it necessary miles said through his teeth you cant count past twentytwo even with your boots off haroche it was serious insult to imply extra digits on this mutationscarred planet both martin and the listening clerk watched the rising temperature of this exchange with increasing alarm haroche s face reddened that does it illyan was soft in the head to discharge youid have had you courtmartialed get out of my building now not until i see illyan haroche cut the com about a minute later two armed guards appeared around the corner and marched toward miles who was badgering the clerk to try haroches secretary again dammit he wouldnt darewould he he would without preamble each guard took an arm and began hustling him toward the door they didnt quite care if his toes touched the ground or not mark trailed after them like an overexcited puppy not sure whether to bark or bite through the door through the outer gates they deposited him on the sidewalk outside the perimeter wall on his feet but only just barely the senior officer said to the gate guards general haroche has just given a direct order that if this man tries to enter the building again he is to be stunned yes sir the senior guard saluted and stared uneasily at miles miles face flushed gulped for breath against a chest tight with humiliation and rage the guards wheeled and marched back inside a rather bare strippark across the street had benches viewing impsecs infamous architecture empty now in the gathering chill mist miles shaken walked across to one and sat down staring up at the building that had defeated him for the second time martin followed him uncertainly and sat down gingerly on the far end waiting orders not daring to speak wild visions of a naismithstyle covert ops raid coursed through miless mind he pictured himself leading grayuniformed mercenaries descending ninjastyle over the side of impsec hq crap he really would get himself shot wouldnt he scorn puffed from his lips illyan was one prisoner who was outside of naismiths range how dare haroche threaten me miles had raved inwardly hell why shouldnt haroche dare mad to be judged solely on his own supposed merits miles himself had spent the last thirteen years eviscerating lord vorkosigan hed wanted to be seen as himself not his fathers son nor his grandfathers grandson nor the descendant of any other vorkosigan for the last eleven generations trying so hard no wonder hed succeeded in convincing everyone even himself that lord vorkosigan didnt count naismith was obsessed with winning at all costs and being seen to have won but vorkosigan vorkosigan couldnt surrender it wasnt quite the same thing was it failing to surrender was a family tradition vorkosigan lords through history had been stabbed shot drowned trampled and burned alive most recently and spectacularly one had even been blown nearly in half then quickfrozen thawed out sewn up and pushed off to stagger punchdrunkenly on his way again miles wondered if the vorkosigans legendary obduracy wasnt partly luck whether good or bad he could not say maybe one or two had actually tried to surrender but missed their chance as in the tale of the general whose last words were reputed to have been dont worry lieutenant the enemy cant possibly hit us at this ran the joke about the dendarii district was that theyd wanted to give in but no one could be found who was literate enough to decipher the cetagandan amnesty offer so theyd fought on to a bewildered victory there is more hillman in me than id thought he should have suspected it of a man who secretly liked the taste of maple mead naismith could demonstrably get vorkosigan killed he could stripmine the little lord for every positive human trait down to bare and naked dendarii bedrock cold and sterile naismith had embezzled his energy ransacked him for time nerve wit leached the very volume from his voice even stolen his sexuality but at that point even naismith could go no further a tollman dumb as his rocks just didnt know how to quit i am the man who owns vorkosigan vashnoi miles threw back his head and laughed tasting the metallic tang of the misting rain sifting into his open mouth my lord said martin uneasily miles cleared his throat and tried to rub the weird smile back off his face sorry i just figured out why it was i hadnt gone to get my head fixed yet and hed thought naismith was the sly one vorkosigans last stand eh it struck me as funny hilarious in fact he stood up stifling another giggle youre not going to try and go back in there are you asked martin in alarm no not directly vorkosigan house first home martin he showered again to wash off the mornings accumulation of rain and city grime but mostly to scrub out the unpleasant lingering scent of shame his mothers peoples custom of the baptism crossed his thoughts as well a towel around his waist he visited several closets and drawers to lay out his clothing for inspection he had not worn his vorkosigan house uniform for several years not even for the emperors birthdays or the winterfair balls casting it aside in favor of what had seemed to him the higher status of real imperial military service uniforms dress greens or parade redandblues he laid the brown fabric out on his bed empty as a snakes shed skin he inspected the seams and the silver embroidery of the vorkosigan logos on collar and shoulders and sleeves carefully for wear or damage but some meticulous servant had put it all away clean and covered and it was in excellent shape the dark brown boots too came out of their protective bag still softly gleaming counts and their heirs honorably retired from more active imperial service were permitted by ancient custom to wear their military decorations on their house uniforms in recognition of the vor s official and historical status aswhat was that dippy phrase the sinews of the imperium the emperors right arm nobodyd ever called them the brains of the imperium miles noted dryly so how come no one had ever claimed to be say the gall bladder of the imperium or the emperors pancreas some metaphors were best left unexamined miles had never once worn all his accumulated honors in part because fourfifths of them related to classified activities and what fun was a decoration you couldnt tell a good story about and in part because why because theyd belonged to admiral naismith ceremoniously he laid them all out on the brown tunic in what would be the correct order the bad luck badges like the one vorberg had just won for getting wounded filled one whole row and part of another his very first medal ever was from the vervani government his most recent high honor had drifted in rather belatedly from the grateful marilacans by jumpmail hed loved covert ops it had taken him to such very strange places he laid out no less than five barrayaran imperial stars in metals of various denominations depending more on how much salt illyan had sweated back at hq during the particular missions they represented than the amount of blood miles personally had shed on the front lines bronze only represented his commanders nails bitten to the second knuckle gold signified gnawing to the wrist he hesitated then arranged the gold medallion of the cetagandan order of merit on its colorful ribbon properly around the tunics high collar it was cool and heavy under his hand he could be one of the few soldiers in history ever to be decorated by both sides in the same war though to be truthful the order of merit had come later and actually had been presented to lord vorkosigan not the little admiral for a change when they were all arranged the effect was just short of looney separated into all the little secret compartments he hadnt realized just how much hed accumulated till he put it all together again no not again for the first time lets lay it all on the line smiling grimly he fastened them down he donned the white silk shirt that went underneath the silverembroidered suspenders the brown trousers with the silver sidepiping the gleaming riding boots lastly the heavy tunic he fastened his grandfathers dagger in its cloisonne sheath with the vorkosigan seal in the jeweled hilt on its proper belt around his waist he combed his hair and stepped back to regard himself glittering in his mirror going native are we the sarcastic voice was growing fainter if you expect to open a can of worms he spoke aloud for the first time youd best trouble to pack a canopener martin engrossed in reading a handviewer looked up at the sound of miless booted step and did a gratifying doubletake bring my car round to the front portico miles instructed him coolly where are we going my lord to the imperial residence i have an appointment chapter sixteen gregor received miles in the serene privacy of his office in the residences north wing he was seated behind his comconsole desk perusing some visual display and didnt look up till after the majordomo had announced miles and withdrawn he tapped a control and the holovid vanished revealing the small smoldering brownuniformed man standing across from him all right miles whats this all abgood god gregor sat up startled his brows climbed as he began to take in the details i dont think ive ever seen you come the vor lord with intent at this point said miles intent should be steaming out both my ears i would bethis catchphrase used to be i would bet my impsec silver eyes anything you please that there is a bigger mess with illyan than haroche has reported to you gregor said slowly his reports are necessarily synopses ha youve sensed it too havent you did haroche ever once pass on the word that illyan had requested to see me no has he and how do you know i had it from a how shall i say it a reliable anonymous source how reliable to imagine he set me up with a false tale would be to attribute a mind bordering on the baroque to a person i judge to be almost painfully straightforward and then theres the problem of motivation lets just say reliable enough for practical purposes gregor said slowly as i understand it illyan is at present well to be blunt dangerously out of his mind hes been demanding a lot of impractical things a jumpship raid on the hegen hub to turn back an imaginary invasion was mentioned to me it was real once you were there ten years ago how do you know this isnt just more of the same hallucinatory raving thats just the point i cant judge because i havent been permitted to see him no one has you heard from lady alys er yes haroche has now blocked me twice this morning he offered to have me stunned if i continued to make a pest of myself how much of a pest were you you can doubtless requestid make that request and require if i were youa review of haroches comconsole recording of our last conversation you might even find it entertaining but gregori have a right to see illyan not as his exsubordinate but as my fathers son a vor obligation that passes completely around impsecs military hierarchy and comes in through another door to their dismay no doubt but thats their problem i suspect i dont know what i suspect but i cant sit still till i figure it out do you think theres something smoky not necessarily miles said more slowly but stupidity can be just as bad as malice sometimes if this chip crash is anything like my cryoamnesia it has to be hell for illyan to lose yourself inside your own head it was the loneliest ive ever been in my life and nobody came for me till mark bulled through at the very least haroche is mishandling this due to nerves and inexperience and needs to be gentry or maybe not so gently straightened out at the worstthe possibility of deliberate sabotage has to have crossed your mind too even though you havent talked about it much with me gregor cleared his throat haroche asked me not to miles hesitated finally read my files has he im afraid so haroche has rigorous standards of loyalty yeah well its not his standards of loyalty im questioning its his judgment i still want in to see illyan i can order that i suppose its getting to be time in my estimation no more than that i want to go over every scrap of raw data pertaining to the case medical or otherwise i want oversight haroche will not be pleased haroche will go mulish i expect and i cant be calling you every fifteen minutes to reiterate your backup i want some real authority i want you to assign me an imperial auditor what even impsec has to bend and spread em for an imperial auditor an auditor can legally requisition anything and all haroche or anyone else can do is fumeand hand it over an auditor speaks with your voice they have to listen you cant pretend this isnt important enough to justify an auditors attentions no indeed but what would you be looking for if i knew already i wouldnt have to look all i know is that this thing has a he spread his handsa wrong shape the reasons may turn out to be trivial or not dont know gotta know which auditor did you have in mind um can i have vorhovis my top man i know i think i could work with him unfortunately hes on his way to komarr oh nothing too serious i hope preventive maintenance i sent him along with lord and lady vorobyev to help grease the arrangements with the komarran oligarchy for announcing my upcoming marriage he has considerable diplomatic talents hm miles hesitated hed really had vorhovis in mind when this inspiration had struck vorlaisner valentine and vorkalloner are all a trifle conservative afraid theyd side with haroche against you um gregors eyes glinted theres always general vorparadijs oh god spare me gregor rubbed his chin thoughtfully i foresee a problem here whatever auditor i assign to you theres about a fifty percent chance youd be back here the following morning demanding another one to keep the first one under control you dont really want an auditor you want an auditorshaped shield to cover your back while you do your very own investigating well yes i dont know maybe maybe i could do something with vorparadijs after all his heart sank contemplating this vision an auditor said gregor is not just my voice hes my eyes and ears as well very much in the original sense of the word my listener a probe though most surely not a robot to go places i cant and report back with an absolutely independent angle of view yougregors lip twisted uphave the most independent angle of view of any man ive ever met miless heart seemed to stop surely gregor couldnt be thinking of i think said gregor it will save ever so many steps if i simply appoint you as an acting imperial auditor with the usual broad limits on a ninth auditors powers of course whatever you do has to be at least dimly related to the event you are assigned to evaluate in this case illyans breakdown you cant order executions and in the unlikely event you direct any arrests well i would appreciate it if they came attached to sufficient evidence for successful prosecutions one expects a certain um traditional decorum in an imperial auditors investigations and due care anything worth doing miles quoted countess vorkosigan is worth doing well he wondered if his eyes were starting to glow they felt like embers gregor recognized the source and smiled just so but gregorharoche will know its a scam gregors voice went soft then haroche will be dangerously mistaken he added i was not happy with the way events seemed to be progressing either but short of going down there in person i didnt see what to do now i do does that satisfy youlord vorkosigan oh gregor you cant begin to guess how much working in the chain of command for the last thirteen years has been like trying to waltz with an elephant slow lumbering ready to step on you at any moment and reduce you to grease dyou have any idea how nice it would be just once to be able to dance on top of the damned elephant instead of under it i thought youd like it like it itll be downright orgasmic dont get carried away gregor cautioned his eyes crinkling no miles caught his breath but i think this will work just fine thank you i accept your charge my liege gregor called in his majordomo and sent him off to the residences vault for an auditors symbolic chain of office and the very nonsymbolic electronic seal that went with it while they were waiting for him to return miles ventured its traditional for an auditor to make his first visit unannounced he added reflectively probably a hell of a lot of fun for them too i have long suspected it agreed gregor but i would rather not be stunned walking through impsecs front gate dyou think you ought to personally call haroche and set up my first appointment do you want me to mm im not sure in that case go with tradition gregors voice took on a cool scientific tinge lets see what happens miles stopped seized with suspicion you sound just like my mother when you say that what do you know that i dont i know less than you do right now im increasingly sure but ive been thinking about haroche watching him except for this business with illyan about which he seems understandably rattled he seems to be taking over impsecs normal routine smoothly if illyan does not recover sooner or later i must be faced with the decision of whether to confirm haroche in his job or appoint another man im curious to see what hes made of you could be a test for him on more than one level are you saying you want to give him an opportunity to screw up better sooner than later miles grimaced does that work in reverse as well are you giving me a chance to screw up too a very slight smile curved gregors mouth lets just say a parallax view of the problem could be most revealing he added i did have a thought about the question of sabotage versus some natural deterioration in illyans neural augmentation yes sabotage ought to have been followed up promptly by some sort of attack during the confusion immediately after illyan went down or better still just before he went down said miles right but nothing out of the ordinary except illyans im not sure what to call it illness indisposition indisposed is a good term miles allowed illness implies an internal cause injury implies an external cause im not sure i could use either word with certainty right now quite anyway nothing else unusual except illyans indisposition has so far occurred illyans destruction noted said miles unless the motivation was something like say personal revenge not a onetwo punch just a onepunch have you started to develop a list of potential suspects by chance miles groaned if you start allowing personal motivations as well as political onesit could have been in return for anything impsec has done to anyone any time in the last thirty years it doesnt even have to be sanesomeone could have been nursing a grudge all out of proportion to the original injury that is not the end of the problem to start with its too damned vast id prefer to start with the chip theres only one of it he cleared his throat theres still the problem of not getting stunned at the door i hadnt intended to take on impsec singlehanded id assumed id have a real auditor to hide behind one of those portly retired admirals sayand i still think i would like to have a witness an assistant to be sure but really a witness someone i can trust and you can trust someone with the requisite amount of security clearance but who is not himself in impsecs hierarchy do you have someone in mind asked gregor my god said ivan unconsciously echoing gregor as he gaped at miles is that real his finger reached out to tick the heavy gold chain of the imperial auditors rank and office now hanging around miless neck its thick links connected big square enameled plaques chased with the vorbarra arms and logos it ran over miless shoulders and dipped across his chest and weighed about a kilo miles judged the electronic seal appended from the center in a gold clasp also engraved with gregors arms you want to try to peel off the foil wrapping and eat the chocolate inside miles inquired dryly urgh ivan looked around gregors office the emperor sat on the edge of his comconsole desk one leg swinging when gregors liveried man came galloping into hq and yanked me off work i thought the damned residence was burning down or my motherd had a heart attack or something but it was only you coz thats lord auditor coz to you for the duration ivan appealed to gregor tell me this is a joke no said gregor quite real an audit is exactly what i want i or to put it more officially we are not happy with current progress as you know an imperial auditor may request anything he pleases the first thing he requested was an assistant congratulations ivan rolled his eyes he wanted a donkey to carry his luggage and the first ass he thought of was me so flattering thanks lord auditor coz im sure this is going to be just a joy miles said quietly ivan were going in to audit impsecs handling of illyans breakdown i dont know what kind of load ill be asking you to carry but theres at least a chance itll be high explosives i need a donkey i can rely on absolutely oh ivans irony dropped abruptly away he straightened oh illyan huh he hesitated then added good about time somebody lit a fire under somebody over that mother will be pleased i hope so said gregor sincerely ivans lip curled up despite the new seriousness in his eyes well well miles i must say it does look right on you i always thought you needed a chokechain miles had martin pull the groundcar up to impsecs front gates this time he let the two imperial armsmen in vorbarra livery gregor had loaned him get out first then motioned them to flank him as he approached the gate guards ivan trailed watching in fascination miles allowed the two armsmen and ivan to present their identifications to be scanned and confirmed first good afternoon gentlemen miles addressed the guards cordially the moment these rituals were complete and the lights on their machines flashed green uncertainly eyes narrowing they braced searching their consciences miles hoped miles focused on the senior sergeant please get on your comconsole and tell general haroche that the imperial auditor is here i request and require him to meet me in person at his front gate now arent you the same fellow we threw out of here this morning asked the sergeant in worry miles smiled thinly not exactly no ive been through a few changes since then he held out his empty hands note please that i am not trying to enter your premises i have no intention of throwing you into the dilemma of trying to choose whether to disobey a direct order or else commit an act of treason but i do know it takes approximately four minutes to physically get from the chiefs office to the front gate at that point your troubles will be over the senior sergeant withdrew into his kiosk and spoke urgently into his com with interesting hairtearing gestures when he exited again miles noted the time on his chrono now lets see what happens as gregor would say ivan sucked on his lower lip and kept his mouth shut at length a flurry of uniforms appeared around the side of impsecs oversized front steps haroche marched quickly forward across the rainslicked cobblestones trailed himself by a minion of note illyans secretary four minutes twentynine seconds murmured miles to ivan not bad can i go behind the bushes and throw up now ivan muttered back watching impsecs power bearing down on them no quit thinking like a subordinate miles came to a parade rest and waited for haroche to puff to a halt before him he permitted himself one brief glorious moment of enjoyment of the appalled expression on the generals face as haroche too took in the details then set it aside he could take the memory out and treasure it later his inner vision of the medically tormented illyan drove him forward now good afternoon general vorkosigan i told you not to come back here try again miles said grimly haroche stared at the chain glittering across his chest despite the flanking vorbarra armsmen both personally known to him he choked that cant be real the penalty for counterfeiting an imperial auditors credentials miles stated flatly is death miles felt he could almost hear the gears grinding in haroche s head some long seconds crawled past then haroche corrected himself in a slightly cracked voice my lord auditor thank you miles husked now they were onscript his new authority formally recognized and acknowledged and they could proceed my imperial master gregor vorbarra requests and requires me to audit impsecs handling of the current situation i request and require your full cooperation in this examination shall we continue this in your office haroches brows drew down a faintly ironic light started in his eye oh i think we should my lord auditor miles dismissed his two vorbarra outriders to be driven back to the imperial residence by martin and led haroche inside the flat filtered air of illyans office was fraught with memory miles had sat or stood in here a hundred times to receive orders or deliver results hed been fascinated excited certainly challenged occasionally triumphant sometimes exhausted sometimes defeated sometimes in pain sometimes in great pain this room had been the center from which his life had radiated all that was gone now miless position across from illyans comconsole desk was the same but the flow of authority was reversed hed have to watch out for old reflexes haroche pulled up a chair from the side wall for him with his own hands after a moment ivan retrieved one for himself and sat flanking miles haroche settled his bulk in illyan s chair tented his hands above the black glass and waited cautiously miles leaned forward and counted off with his right hand fingers pressing the cold surface all right as you should have deduced by now gregor is seriously displeased with the way this organization has been treating simon illyans breakdown so this is what i want and this is the order i want it in first i want to see illyan then i want a conference with his full medical staff i want them to bring everything they have learned so far and be prepared to brief me after that ill figure out what else after that you have necessarily my full cooperation my lord auditor now that were down to business you can shelve the formalities but youve given me a dilemma and a moment of near heart failure too miles hoped nastily but no there was no place for personal animosities now oh it was and remains premature to accuse any man of sabotage in the matter of illyans chip failure before the cause of the chip failure is determined potentially very embarrassing if the cause turns out to be natural im conscious of this too yes you would be but i cant help thinking ahead in fact its my job so i have a little list that im holding in limbo pending the arrival of some data with which to pin it to reality only a little list illyan always divided his lists into the short one and the long one a kind of triage i suppose seems a good system but on my short listyou are very near the top oh miles echoed suddenly haroches obstructionism fell into place and now youve made yourself untouchable haroche added the full phrase is untouchable vor bore miles said i see this was exactly the sort of humiliating suspicion hed most dreaded in taking on illyans rescue well too bad they stared steadily at one another across the black glass haroche continued so the very last thing in the world i want is to admit you to illyans presence where you can get off some kind of second shot now it appears i must do so but i want to formally register the fact that i do so under protest my lord auditor noted miless mouth was dry do you have a motive to go along on your list with my opportunities and the asyetnonexistent method isnt it obvious haroches hands opened illyan terminated you very abruptly destroyed your career illyan helped create me he had a right to destroy me under the circumstancesof which haroche was fully apprised by now miles could see it in his eyesalmost an obligation he terminated you for falsifying your reports a documented fact that i would also like to formally register my lord auditor haroche glanced at ivan who remained wonderfully bland a defensive response hed spent a lifetime perfecting one report once and gregor already knows all about it miles could almost feel the ground shifting under his feet how had he ever classified this man as thickheaded he was losing his momentum almost as fast as hed gained it but he tightened his jaw against all temptation to defend explain protest apologize or otherwise be diverted from his goal i dont trust you lord vorkosigan well youre stuck with me i cant be removed except by the emperors own voice which appointed me or a threequarters vote of impeachment by the council of counts and the council of ministers in full joint session assembled something i dont think you can arrange then it would likely be useless for me to go to gregor and request a different auditor for this case you can try ha that answers that and even if you were guilty im starting to wonder if i could do anything about it the emperor is the only appeal and you appear to already have him sewn up would attempting to take you out be career suicide well if our positions were reversed i wouldnt give up till id nailed you to the wall with the biggest spikes available miles added after a moment but if after i go in to see illyan some sort of second shot occurs you can bet ill be measuring its trajectory with utmost care haroche vented a long sigh this is premature ill be more relieved than anyone if the medics bring in a diagnosis of natural causes it would shortcircuit a world of trouble miles grimaced reluctant agreement youve got that right general they regarded each other with a certain steady reserve in all miles thought he felt more relieved than unnerved haroche had certainly been as blunt as miles could have desired about clearing the air maybe he could work with this man after all haroches study of miles hung up on the magpie collection of military baubles on his tunic his voice went unexpectedly plaintive vorkosigan tell meis that really a cetagandan order of merit yeah and the rest of it i didnt clean out my fathers desk drawer if thats what youre asking everything here is accounted for in my classified files you may be one of the few men on the planet who doesnt have to take my word for it hm haroches brows quirked well my lord auditor carry on but ill be watching you good watch closely miles rapped the black glass and rose ivan scrambled up behind him in the corridor on their way downstairs to the hq clinic ivan murmured ive never seen a general tapdance sitting down before it feels like a minuet in a minefield to me miles admitted watching you become the little admiral at him was worth the price of admission though what he almost stumbled wasnt it on purpose youre acting just like you do when you play admiral naismith except without the betan accent full tilt forward no inhibitions innocent bystanders scramble for their lives i suppose youll say terror is good for me clears the arteries or something were admiral naismiths decorations acting as some kind of magic talisman for him miles didnt even want to try to digest the implications of this right now instead he said lightly do you consider yourself an innocent bystander god knows i try to be sighed ivan the air of the clinic which along with the forensic laboratories occupied a whole floor of impsec hq was thick with familiar odors too miles thought as he entered unpleasant medical ones hed spent all too many hours in here himself over the years from his very first visit with incipient pneumonia from hypothermia to his most recent physical exam the one that had returned him to the illfated duty of rescuing lieutenant vorberg the smell of the place gave him the shivers all the four private rooms save one had been cleared of other patients and stood dark and empty and open a greenuniformed guard stood stolid duty outside the one closed door an impsec colonel with medical tags on his tunic popped up breathlessly at miles s elbow as he entered my lord auditor im dr ruibal how may i serve you ruibal was a short roundfaced man with furry eyebrows pinched together now in one crooked line of worry tell me about illyan no take me to illyan well talk after this way my lord the doctor gestured the guard aside and led miles into the windowless room illyan lay faceup on the bed halfcovered by a sheet his wrists and ankles bound with what the medics dubbed soft restraints he breathed heavily was he sedated his eyes were open glazed and unfocused heavy beard stubble shadowed his normally clean face the warm room smelled of dried sweat and worse organics miles had spent a week forcing his way in here using some of the most extreme methods hed ever dared attempt now all he wanted to do was turn tail and run out again why is this man naked he asked the colonel is he incontinent no said ruibal procedures miles didnt see any tubes probes or machines what procedures well none at present but he isnt easy to handle getting him in and out of clothes as well as the other presents problems for my staff indeed the guard now hovering inside the door sported a maroonpurple black eye and ruibals own mouth was bruised his lower lip split i see he forced himself nearer and halfknelt by illyan s head simon he said uncertainly illyan s face turned toward him the glazed eyes flickered focused lit with recognition miles miles thank god youre here his voice cracked with urgency lord vorvanes wife and childrendid you get them out alive commodore rivek at sector four is going frantic miles recognized the mission it was about five years old he moistened his lips yeah it was all taken care of we got them out all right and tight hed been awarded a gold star for that one it hung third from the left in its row on him now good good illyan sighed lay back his eyes closed his stubbled lips moved his eyes opened and lit again with recognition miles thank god youre here his hands moved and came up short against their restraints what is this get me out of this simon what day is this its the emperors birthday tomorrow or is it today youre dressed for it i have to be there no said miles the emperors birthday was weeks ago your memory chip is malfunctioning you have to stay in here till they figure out whats wrong and fix it oh four minutes later illyan turned his head back to miles his lips rippled in startlement miles what the hell are you doing here i sent you to tau ceti why cant you ever obey an order simon your memory chip is malfunctioning illyan hesitated what day is it where am i miles repeated the information dear god whispered illyan now thats a bitch he lay listlessly looking dismayed five minutes later illyan looked up at him and said miles what the hell are you doing here shit he had to stand up and turn around for a minute i dont know how much of this i can take he became aware that dr ruibal was watching him closely has it been this bad all week he asked ruibal shook his head there has been a definite and measurable progression his how can i describe it his moments of temporal confusion have been getting steadily closer together the first day i thought i noted six perceptual jumps yesterday they were coming six an hour it was twice that now miles turned back in a little while illyan looked up at him and his face lit with recognition miles what the hells going on patiently miles explained again it didnt matter if he repeated the wording he realized illyan wasnt going to get tired of it or remember it five minutes later on the next round illyan frowned across at him who the devil are you miles vorkosigan dont be absurd miles is five years old uncle simon look at me illyan stared earnestly at him then whispered watch out your grandfather wants to kill you trust bothari oh i do sighed miles three minutes later miles what the hells going on where am i miles repeated the drill the guard with the black eye remarked how come he believes you all the time he only believes us about one time out of five the other four times he tries to kill us i dont know said miles feeling harried beyond measure again miles vorberg found you yes yes miles sat up straight simon what day is this god i dont know my damned chip is fucked up beyond repair its turning to snot inside my head its driving me crazy he grasped miless hand hard and stared into his eyes with the uttermost urgency i cant stand this if the thing cant be fixed swear youll cut my throat for me dont let it go on forever i wont be able to do it for myself swear to me your word as vorkosigan god simon i cant promise that you have to you cant abandon me to an eternity of this swear i cant miles whispered is this what you sent vorberg to get me for illyans face changed again the desperation unfocusing into bewilderment whos vorberg then a sudden hard suspicion who the hell are you illyan shook free of his hand miles went five more rounds then walked out into the corridor he leaned against the wall head down till the nausea passed his body shook suppressed shudders that traveled from bottom to top dr ruibal hovered ivan too took the opportunity to step out and breathe deeply you see what were up against said ruibal this is graceless miless voice was a whisper but ruibal flinched ruibal you get him washed shaved give him some clothes back theres a complete supply of civvies in his apartment downstairs i know maybe if illyan didnt look so much like an animal they wouldnt treat him so much like one my lord said the colonel im reluctant to ask my corpsmen to risk losing more teeth but if youll stay for it well try youre the only person ive seen he hasnt tried to slug yes of course miles saw the process through having a familiar person present did seem to be a calming influence on illyan people hed known for the longest time would be best then whatever day and year he opened his eyes every five minutes he would see a known face who could tell him a story he might trust clothed again illyan sat up in a chair and ate from a tray a corpsman brought apparently the first meal for a couple of days that he had not tried to turn into a projectile weapon an officer appeared at the door and spoke to ruibal the briefing you requested has been prepared my lord auditor ruibal told miles his obsequious tone wasnt just in honor of miless auditors menace because he added wistfully will you came back afterwards oh yes meantime miless eye fell on ivan i would rather stated ivan quietly charge a lasercannon site naked than be in here by myself ill keep it in mind said miles in the meanwhilestay with him till i get back yeah ivan took over the chair at illyans elbow as miles vacated it as miles followed ruibal out the door he heard illyans voice for a change more amiable than stressed ivan you idiot what are you doing here chapter seventeen the clinic s conference chamber bore a strong generic resemblance to every other impsec briefing room in which miles had ever spent endless hours a round black table featured a secured holovid projector with a control panel that looked like a jumpship navcomp five station chairs were presently set closely around it occupied by three men who rose hastily and stood at attention when ruibal ushered miles inside when they were all assembled there was no one in the room below the rank of colonel except miles this was not all that unusual for vorbarr sultana at imperial service hq across town where ivan worked the joke was that the colonels carried the coffee no he was neither above nor below them in rank miles reminded himself he was outside them altogether it was apparent that however accustomed they might be to generals and admirals this was their first close encounter with an imperial auditor the last imperial audit impsec had suffered had been almost five years ago and more traditionally financial in scope miles had brushed up against it on the opposite side that time as the auditor had choked on certain aspects of mercenary accounting that investigation had had a dangerous political tinge from which illyan had insulated him ruibal introduced the team ruibal himself was the neurologist next or perhaps first in importance was a rear admiral dr avakli the biocyberneticist avakli was on loan from the medical group who did all the imperial service jumpship pilots neural implants the one neuroenhancement technology up and running on barrayar with any resemblance to that which had produced illyans eidetic chip avakli in nice contrast to the rounder ruibal was long thin intense and balding miles hoped the last was a sign of a high intellectual temperature the other two men were tech support assistants to avakli thank you gentlemen miles said when introductions were complete he sat they sat except for ruibal who was apparently elected spokesgoat where would you like me to begin my lord auditor ruibal asked miles um the beginning obediently ruibal began to rattle off a long list of neurological tests illustrated with holovids of the data and results excuse me said miles after a few minutes of this i did not phrase myself well you can skip all the negative data go directly to the positive results there was a short silence then ruibal said in summation i did not find evidence of organic neurological damage the physiological and psychological stress levels which are quite dangerously high i judge to be an effect rather than a cause of the biocybernetic breakdown do you agree with that assessment miles asked avakli who nodded though with a little judicious lippursing to indicate the everpresent possibility of human error avakli and ruibal exchanged a nod and avakli took ruibals place at the holovid projector avakli had a detailed holovid map of the chips internal architecture which he began to display miles was relieved hed been a little afraid they were going to tell him impsec medical had lost the owners manual in the intervening thirtyfive years but they appeared to have quite a lot of data the chip itself was an immensely complex sandwich of organic and inorganic molecular layers about five by seven centimeters broad and half a centimeter thick which rested in a vertical position between the two lobes of illyans brain the number of neurological connections that ran from it made a jumppilots control headset look like a childs toy the greatest complexity seemed to be in the information retrieval net rather than the proteinbased data storage though both were not only fiendishly ornate but largely unmappedit had been an autolearningstyle system which had assembled itself in a highly nonlinear fashion after the chip had been installed so is the damage or deterioration were seeing confined to the organic or the inorganic parts or both miles asked avakli organic said avakli almost certainly avakli was one of those scientists who never placed an unhedged bet miles realized unfortunately avakli went on it was never originally designed to be downloaded there is no single equivalent of a dataport to connect to just these thousands and thousands of neuronic leads going into and out of the thing all over its surface in view of the chips history as emperor ezars ultrasecure data dump this made sense miles would not have been surprised to learn the thing had been customized to be especially nondownloadable now i was under the impression the thing worked in parallel with illyans original cerebral memory it doesnt actually replace it does it that is correct my lord the neurological input is only split from the sensory nerves not shunted aside altogether the subjects apparently have dual memories of all their experiences this appears to have been the major contributing factor to the high incidence of iatrogenic schizophrenia they later developed a sort of inherent design defect not of the chip so much as of the human brain ruibal cleared his throat in polite theoretical or perhaps theological disagreement illyan must have been a born spy to hold more than one reality balanced in your mind until proof arrived without going mad from the suspense was surely the mark of a great investigator avakli then went into a highly technical discussion of three projected ideas for extracting some kind of data download from the chip they all sounded makeshift and uncertain of result avakli himself describing them didnt sound too happy or enthusiastic most of them seemed to involve long hours of delicate microneurosurgery ruibal winced a lot so miles interrupted this at length what happens if you take the chip out to use laymans terminology said avakli it goes into shock and dies its evidently supposed to do so apparently to prevent um theft right miles pictured illyan mugged by chipspies his head hacked open left for dead someone else had anticipated that picture too theyd been a paranoid lot in ezars generation it was never designed to be removed intact from its organic electrical support matrix avakli continued the chance of any coherent data retrieval is vastly reduced anyway and if its not taken out the protein chain arrays show no signs of slowing in their dissociation or in scientists language the chip is turning to snot inside illyans head one of you bright boys apparently used just that phrase in his hearing by the way one of avakli s assistants had the grace to look guilty admiral avakli what are your top theories as to what is causing the chip to break down avakli s brows narrowed in order of probabilitysenescence that is old age triggering an autodestruction or some sort of chemical or biological attack id have to have it apart to prove the second hypothesis so there is no question of removing the chip repairing it and reinstalling it i hardly think so and you cant repair it in situ without knowing the cause which you cant determine without removing it for internal examination which would destroy it avaklis lips compressed in dry acknowledgment of the inherent circularity of the problem repair is out of the question im afraid ive been concentrating on trying to evolve a practical downloading scheme as it happens miles went on you misunderstood my initial question what happens to illyan if the chip is removed avakli gestured back to ruibal a tossthehotball spasm we cant predict with certainty said ruibal can you guess with reasonable odds does he for example instantly go back to being twentyseven years old again no i dont think so a plain removal with no attempt to save the chip would in fact be a reasonably simple operation but the brain is a complex thing we dont know for example to what extent it has rerouted its own internal functions around the artifact in thirtyfive years and then theres the psychological element whatever hes done to his personality that has allowed him to work with it and stay sane will be unbalanced like taking away a crutch and discovering your legs have atrophied perhaps so how much cognitive damage are we talking about a little a lot ruibal shrugged helplessly have any aging galactic experts in this obsolete technology been located yet miles asked not yet said ruibal that may take several months by which time said miles grimly if i understand this the chip will be jelly and illyan will be either permanently insane or dead of exhaustion ah said ruibal that about sums it up my lord said avakli then why havent we yanked the damned thing our orders my lord noted avakli were to save the chip or as much of the chips data as could be retrieved miles rubbed his lips why he said at length avaklis brows rose i would presume because the data is vital to impsec and the imperium is it miles leaned forward staring into the brightly colored biocybernetic nightmare chipmap hanging before his eyes above the tables central vid plate the chip was never installed to make illyan into a superman it was just a toy for emperor ezar who fancied owning a vid recorder with legs i admit its been handy for illyan gives him a nice aura of infallibility that scares hell out of people but thats a crock and he knows it even if they dont the chip has nothing to do with running impsec really he was promoted to the job because he was standing at my fathers right hand the day vordarians forces murdered his predecessor and my father liked and trusted him there was no time for a talent search in the middle of a raging civil war of all the qualities that made illyan the best chief in impsec s history the chip is surely the most trivial his voice had fallen to nearly a whisper avakli and ruibal were leaning forward to hear him he cleared his throat and sat up there are only four categories of information on that chip miles went on old and obsolete current which is all backed up in realityillyan has always had to function with the everpresent assumption that he could drop or be dropped dead at any time and haroche or somebody would have to take over in midstream then theres trash data personal stuff of no use to anyone except illyan maybe not even to illyan thirtyfive years of showers meals changing clothes filling out forms not too damned many sex acts im afraid lots of bad novels and holovid dramas all in there verbatim a thousand times more of that than anything else and somewhere in all the billions of images maybe a dozen hot secrets that no one else knows or perhaps even ought to know what do you wish us to do my lord auditor asked ruibal into the silence that stretched after this soliloquy you wanted authority now youve got it boy miles sighed i want to talk with one more man in the meanwhile assemble everything you need for the surgical removal of the chip equipment to be sure but mostly the man i want the best pair of hands you can get in impsec or out of it when should we start my lord asked ruibal id like you to be finished in two hours miles rapped the table and rose thank you gentlemen dismissed miles called gregor on a secured comconsole right from the clinic level so have you found what you wanted gregor asked i didnt want any of this but ive made progress im pretty sure it wont be a surprise to you to learn the problems not in illyans brain its in the damned chip its doing uncontrolled data dumps about every five minutes it floods his mind with a new set of crystalsharp memories from random times in the past the effect is hideous cause unknown they cant fix it removal will destroy the data still on it leaving it in will destroy illyan you see where this is heading gregor nodded removal it seems indicated it should have been well if not done already at least proposed and prepared for the problem is illyans in no condition to consent to the operation i see they also dont know what the effects of removing it will be full recovery partial recovery personality changes cognitive changestheyre rolling dice down here what im saying is you still may not get your chief of imperial security back i see now is there anything you want saved off that chip that i dont know about gregor sighed your father is perhaps the only other person who would be able to answer that question and in the over fifteen years since i reached my majority he hasnt seen fit to confide any to me the old secrets appear to be keeping themselves illyan is your man now do you consent to pulling the chip my liege dyou advise it my auditor miles blew out his breath yes gregor chewed on his lower lip for a moment then his face set then let the dead bury their dead let the past go do it yes sire miles cut the com this time miles was admitted to harochesillyans office without delay or a murmur of protest haroche studying something on his comconsole display waved him to a chair miles pulled it wrongwayaround and sat astride it his arms across its back well my lord auditor said haroche turning off his vid i trust you found the cooperation of my subordinates to be fully satisfactory illyan did irony better but you had to give haroche credit for trying yes thank you i admitharoche gestured to the comconsolei misestimated you id seen you flitting in and out of here for years and i was aware you were covert ops but i was not always fully aware of which covert ops or how many no wonder you were illyans pet his gaze on miless decorated tunic was now more calculating than disbelieving reading my record were you miles refused to flinch in front of haroche scanning the synopses and some of illyans annotations a full study would take a week my time is at a premium at the moment yes ive just talked with gregor miles inhaled weve concluded that the chip has to be removed haroche sighed id hoped that could be avoided it seems so permanent and so crippling not nearly as crippling as whats going on right now incidentally illyan definitely should have had someone familiar by him from the start for his comfort it seems to make a tremendous difference in his level of combativeness he could possibly have avoided most of the sedation and the humiliating restraints not to mention the wear and tear on the corpsmen much earlier i still wasnt sure what we were dealing with mm but it was wrong to leave him alone in agony i admit i had not gone down to the clinic to inspect in person the first day was bad enough understandable if cowardly ivan and i were able to do a lot just by being there ive thought of another person who could do even more i think lady alys vorpatril should sit with him until the surgery is prepared haroche frowned his forehead wrinkling you and lieutenant vorpatril are or at least were oathsworn military personnel shes a civilian and barred by her gender from most oaths but hardly a nonperson for all of that if i must i will order her admittance on my authority as auditor but i wanted to give you a chance to mend your mistake if nothing else you should be alive to the fact that as gregors baba and closest senior female relative she will be in charge of all the social arrangements for the emperors wedding you may still be acting head of impsec at that time how this fits into your security challenges should be obvious the empress laisa may make new arrangements once shes installed but in the meantime lady alys is the old guard in charge of the transition its vor custom the military in an admirable effort to promote merit before blood spends a lot of time pretending that vor is not real the high vor whose safety and good behavior are going to be your particular charge as long as you sit behind that desk spend at least as much energy pretending vor is real haroches brows rose so which are right miles shrugged my mother would call it the clash of two competing fantasies but whatever your personal opinion of the merits and defects of the vor systemand i have a few thoughts of my own about it that i wouldnt necessarily spout on the floor of the council of countsits the system we are both oathsworn to uphold the vor really are the sinews of the imperium if you dont like it you can emigrate but if you stay this is the only game in town so how did illyan get along so well with you all he was no more vor than i actually i think he rather enjoyed the spectacle i dont know what he thought when he was younger but by the time i really came to know him in the last ten years or so i think hed come to feel that the imperium was a creation he helped to maintain he seemed to have a vested interest in it an almost cetagandan attitude in a weird way more of an artist to his medium than a servant to his master illyan played gregors servant with great panache but i dont think ive ever met a less servile human being ah haroches eyes were alert as he took this in his fingers drummed once on the black glass a downright illyanesque gesture the man was actually listening by god and learning a heartening thought haroches lips compressed with decision and he tapped out a code on his comconsole lady alyss secretary appeared after a few murmured words of greeting and explanation alyss own face formed over the vid plate she frowned at haroche milady he nodded shortly to her his hand gesture might be interpreted either as a modified analysts salute or a man tugging his forelock the nuance was nicely vague ive reconsidered your request for admittance to the impsec clinic chief illyan may be facing surgery shortly id take it as a personal favor if you would be willing to come down here and stay with him for a while beforehand familiar faces seem to help him to um stay calm with fewer drugs alys straightened i told you that yesterday yes milady said haroche meekly you were right may i send a car to your residence for you and how soon for this alys stated i can be ready in fifteen minutes miles wondered if haroche appreciated what an awesome statement this was it could take a high vor lady fifteen hours to get ready to go places sometimes thank you milady i think this could be a great help thank you general she hesitated and thank lord vorkosigan too she cut the com huh said haroche his mouth twitched lopsidedly she is sharp in certain areas within her personal expertise one of the sharpest one wonders how lord ivan ah well how was that my lord auditor extraordinary a noble apology she had to accept you wont be sorry as hard as it may be for you to grasp considering the history of your attitude to most of your commanding officersharoche tapped his comconsolejust which files had he been readingi do want to do a good job do your duty is not enough the lower ranks are filled with men who merely do their duty and no more i know im not a suave mannever have been neither was illyans predecessor captain negri ive heard miles offered haroche smiled bleakly i didnt ask for this emergency i will likely never be as smooth and polished as illyan but i mean to do as good a job miles nodded thank you general miles returned to the clinic level to relieve ivan miles found him still sitting next to illyan though as far back in his chair as he would go smiling in a pained way one boot tapped softly on the floor in a nervous pattern ivan rose hastily and came to the door when he saw miles leaning there watching thank god its about time you got back he muttered hows it been going what dyou think i can see why they sedated him even without his trying to tear their heads off just so they didnt have listen to hour after hour of this miles this is a nightmare yes i know he sighed i have some help on the way for this part though ive asked your mother to come in and sit with him oh said ivan good idea better her than me anyway miless mouth twisted youre not afraid itll be too hard on her oh um hell shes tough tougher than you shell be good at this ivan promised somewhat desperately take a break ivan yeah ivan didnt wait for a second invitation but scooted past him and ivan ivan paused suspiciously yeah thanks oh no trouble miles took a deep breath and entered illyan s room it was still very warm he took off his tunic and folded it over the back of a chair and rolled up his silk sleeves and sat illyan first ignored him for a bit then stared at him in puzzlement then his face cleared it began again miles what are you doing here simon listen to me your chip has gone glitchy over and over it was a little bit like talking to someone with multiple personalities miles decided after a while the thirtyyearold illyan gave way to the illyan of fortysix each man profoundly different from the illyan of sixty miles waited patiently for the card he desired to be dealt again from the deck endlessly repeating the date the facts the situation would it ever reach the point where all the illyans had been informed or would he continue to divide infinitesimally at last the illyan he was waiting for came around again miles did vorberg find you shit this is a nightmare my damned chip has gone glitchy its turning to snot inside my head promise mepromise me by your word as vorkosiganyou wont let this go on listen simon i know all about it but im not bloody going to cut your throat weve scheduled surgery instead to take the chip out no later than tomorrow if i have anything to say about it and i do it cant be fixed so were going to remove it illyan paused remove his hand touched his forehead but how can i function without it same as you did in the first twentyseven years of your life before you ever had it installed is the best medical guess illyans eyes were solemn and afraid will it take all my memories will i lose my whole life oh god miles he was silent for a time then added i think id rather have you cut my throat thats not an option simon illyan shook his head and dissolved again into another illyan another round of miles what are you doing here what am i doing here he stared down at his bland civilian clothes illyan either favored really boring fashions or else did not trust his own taste im supposed to be at the council of counts in full dress uniform right now they must be toldthey must be told miles couldnt decide if it constituted informed consent or not under the circumstances was it informed was it even consent but it seemed the best he could do he repeated the drill again again at length dr ruibal escorted lady alys into the room hed briefed her as miles had requested miles could see it in her set disturbed face hello simon her voice was quiet a melodic alto lady alys illyans face worked as he searched his mind for miles knew not what i am so sorry about the death of lord vorpatril illyan said at last if i had only known where you were in the city i was trying to get admiral kanzian out if only id known did you save the child apologies and condolences on the murder of her husband thirty years ago kanzian had been dead of old age for half a decade now alys glanced in suppressed anguish at miles yes simon its all right she said lieutenant koudelka brought us through vordarians lines its all right now miles nodded and repeated the orienting drill as a model for alys she listened to the exchange carefully and watched illyans face go through the usual array of emotions startlement denial distraught dismay illyans blunter barracks language disappeared abruptly from his speech in her presence miles slipped out of the chair beside illyans and offered it to her she sat without hesitation and took illyans hand illyan blinked and looked up at her lady alys his face softened what are you doing here miles withdrew to the doorway where ruibal watched thats interesting said ruibal checking a monitor readout on the wall his blood pressure dropped a bit there yes im not surprised come out in the hall and talk to me i want a word with avakli too the three of them miles and ruibal and avakli all in shirtsleeves now sat at the medtechs station and drank coffee it was deep night outside miles realized he was becoming as temporally confused as illyan tasting his mechanistic eternity so youve convinced me the surgical facility here is adequate miles said tell me more about the man hes my second senior surgeon for installing and maintaining jumppilots neural implants said avakli why arent we having your first senior surgeon hes good too but this one is younger more recently trained i feel hes the optimum tradeoff between most recent training and maximum practical experience do you trust him let me put it this way said avakli if youve ever ridden in an imperial fast courier vessel in the last five years youve probably trusted him with your own life already as surely as youve trusted it to the engineers who calibrated the ships necklin rods he did the implant for the emperors personal pilot too very good i accept your choice so how soon can we get him here and how soon can he go to work we could fly him in from vordarians district tonight but i think its better to let him get a good nights sleep at home first id allow a day at least for him to study he problem and plan his surgical approach after thatit will be up to him were likely looking at surgery the day after tomorrow at the earliest i see very well there was nothing more miles could do to push that part of things along that gives dr avaklis team two more days to play with their part of the problem let me know if you come up with any new approaches that wont involve putting illyan through more of this and oh i have a suggestion when the surgery is complete dr avaklis team will become the chip coroners i want an autopsy done on the damned thing even if it is dead what caused the malfunction impsec and i both want to know i thought of a man to add to the team who might be able to lend you some interesting galactic expertise he has a lab in the imperial science institute biofacility just outside of vorbarr sultana where he does some secured work for the imperium names vaughn weddell once known is dr hugh canaba of jacksons whole an early dendarii mission had brought him incognito as a refugee o a new life face and name on barrayar along with some of the most secret genetic research in the galaxy sergeant taura had been one of his earlier and more ambiguous projects hes a molecular biologist by trade and training but his early experiences included an extraordinary range of really oddball stuff kind of a wild card and ah a bit of a prima donna in personality but if nothing else i think youll find his ideas interesting yes my lord avakli made a note a lord auditors suggestions had the weight of an imperial command miles realized anew he really had to watch his mouth and that seemed to be all he could do for today he longed to flee back to vorkosigan house and sleep instead he bedded down for four hours in one of the adjoining patient rooms then relieved alys vorpatril in the night watch to take turn about lieutenant vorberg coming on duty seemed pleased to cede them the place by illyans bedside and took up his own post by the clinic door illyan slept only fitfully waking about every twenty minutes in a new burst of confusion and fear it was going to be a very long two days till the surgery chapter eighteen the two days stretched to three agonizingly for the last full day illyan was never coherent enough to beg for death nor express his terror of the upcoming surgery a respite to miles of sorts illyans flickering sequences of disorientation and distress passed too quickly now for reassurance he became dumb only his twitching face not his words reflecting the kaleidoscopic chaos inside his head even alys found it unbearable her rest breaks lengthened and her visits to illyan grew shorter miles stuck it out wondering why he was doing so would illyan remember any of this will i ever be able to forget it illyan was no longer combative but his lurching movements were abrupt and unpredictable it was decided no attempt would be made to keep him conscious during the surgery monitoring of his higher neural functions would have to wait till after the fact it was a profound relief to miles when the techs came to anesthetize illyan and prep him and he became still at last as gregors appointed observer miles followed the procession right into the surgery near the labs a few steps down the corridor from the patient rooms no one even suggested he stay out where does the forty kilo imperial auditor sit anywhere he wants to a tech assisted him into only slightly oversized sterile garb and provided him with a comfortable stool with a good view of the holovid monitors that would record every aspect of the procedure inside illyans skull and out and a reasonable glimpse of the top of illyans head past the surgeons shoulder on the whole miles thought he would rather watch the monitors the tech depilated a little rectangular patch in the center of illyans scalp almost unnecessary in the thinning hair miles felt he ought to be inured to bloodshed of all kinds by now but his stomach still turned as the surgeon deftly cut through scalp and bone and peeled them back for access the incision was tiny really a mere slot then the computeraided microwaldoes were moved into place concealing the cut and the surgeon leaned into his vid enhancers hunching over illyans head miles switched his attention back to the monitors the rest of it took barely fifteen minutes the surgeon lasercauterized the tiny arterioles that fed the chip with blood and kept its deteriorating organic parts alive and swiftly burnt through the cilialike array of neural connectors finer than spider silk across the chips surface the most delicate surgical handtractor lifted the chip neatly from its matrix the surgeon dropped it into a dish of solution held out for it by the anxious dr avakli hovering nearby avakli and his tech headed for the door hustling the dead chip off to the lab avakli paused and glanced back at miles as if theyd expected him to follow it are you coming my lord avakli inquired no ill see you later carry on admiral miles was barely able to interpret what he was seeing on the monitors but at least he could read dr ruibal attending to illyans physiological state alongside the surgeon ruibal was attentive but relaxed no emergencies yet then the surgeon fitted the sliver of skull back into its place with biotic glue and closed the incision and cleaned it nothing but a neat thin red line showed on the pale scalp zap the cat had left gorierlooking scratches on human flesh than this the surgeon stood and stretched thats it then hes all yours dr ruibal that was simpler than i had anticipated miles commented several orders of magnitude simpler than installing it must have been agreed the surgeon i had a horrible few minutes when i first looked at the map of the thing thinking that i was going to have to go in and remove all those neural connectors from their other ends throughout the brain until i realized they could just be left in situ there wont be any consequences from leaving them all in there no theyll just sit there inert and harmless like any other sort of cut wire theres no circuit now nothing flows the anesthetist inquired of dr ruibal and the surgeon are you ready for me to administer the antagonist now ruibal took a deep breath yes wake him up lets find out what weve done a hiss of a hypospray the anesthetist watched illyans quickening breathing then at a nod from the surgeon removed the tubes from illyans mouth and loosened the headrestraints a little more color warmed illyans pale features the deathwarmedover look of unconsciousness fading illyans brown eyes opened he squinted and his gaze flicked from face to face he moistened his dry lips miles he husked where the hell am i what are you doing here miles s heart sank momentarily at this instant replay of the opening of most of illyans conversations of the last four days but illyans gaze though uncertain remained steady on his face miles shouldered forward through the medical mob who gave way to him simon youre in surgery at impsec hq your eidetic memory chip broke down irreparably weve just removed it entirely oh illyan frowned what is the last thing you can remember sir ruibal asked watching closely remember illyan winced his right hand twitched rose to the side of his head waved forward clenched and fell back i its like a dream he was silent a moment a nightmare miles thought this an admirable demonstration of coherence and correct perception though ruibals forehead wrinkled who illyan added decided this a vague wave at his head me miles admitted or rather i advised gregor he consented did he gregor put you in charge here yes miles quailed inwardly good illyan sighed miles breathed again illyans eyes grew more intent and impsec whats happening how long general haroche is flying your comconsole right now lucas oh good he has everything under control no major crises aside from yours you can rest i admit murmured illyan im tired he looked absolutely beaten im not surprised said miles this has been going on for over three weeks has it now illyans voice went lower even more tentative once more his hand made that strange gesture beside his face as if calling up as if trying to call up a vid image that failed to appear before his minds eye his hand jerked again then closed he almost seemed to force it back to his side ruibal the neurologist stepped in then and administered his first few tests illyan reported no worse overt effects than a slight headache and some muscle pain illyan studied his own bruised knuckles with some bemusement but did not inquire about them nor about the marks on his wrists miles trailed after as they trundled illyan back to the patient room in the clinic ruibal briefed miles in the corridor after illyan was put back to bed as soon as his physical recovery is establishedas soon as hes eaten eliminated and sleptill start the battery of cognitive tests how soon can he no i suppose its too early to ask that miles began i was about to ask how soon could he go home such as home was for illyan miles remembered his own longago sojourn in those windowless witness apartments downstairs and shuddered inwardly ruibal shrugged barring new developments id be willing to release him after two days of close observation he would need to come back in for daily followup testing of course that soon as you saw the surgery was not very invasive it almost qualified as minor physically and nonphysically well have to find that out miles returned his sterile gear to a tech and hunted up his tunic and its assorted decorations again as soon as hed dressed he poked his head around the corner to a side office lady alys vorpatril sat patiently there she looked up at the motion all done miles reported its all right so far he seems to be back to something like normal on track though hes a bit subdued i dont see why you couldnt see him if you want yes i want lady alys rose and swept past him miles paid a visit to the secured lab down the corridor that avaklis team had taken over avakli had the chip under a scanner already but hed not yet started to take it apart a new face in the team a tall lean man who hung back apart from the others caught miless eye at once dr vaughn weddell nee dr hugh canaba of jacksons whole had paler skin now darker hair and light hazel eyes in place of the original dark brown color hed sported when miles had first met him a higher arch to his cheekbones and nose lent him an even more distinguished look his air of earnest intellectual superiority was still the same though weddels eyes widened seeing miles miles smiled grimly he hadnt thought the good doctor would have forgotten admiral naismith miles stepped aside with him and lowered his voice good morning dr weddell and how are you enjoying your new identity these days weddell processed his surprise smoothly well thank you and uh how are you enjoying yours this is my old identity actually really weddells eyebrows rose as he studied and decoded the meanings of miless barrayaran house uniform and its decorations and the flashy chain around his neck hm do i understand then that you are the imperial auditor i have to thank for this interruption of my work at the science institute correct we subjects of the imperium do have our surprise duties sometimes you must realize by now the price of being barrayaran one of the prices at least sighed weddell your climate is an improvement over jacksons whole indeed and weddell was not referring only to the weather im very pleased things have worked out satisfactorily for you said miles if i had realized i was going to be seeing you id have brought greetings from sergeant taura my word is she still alive oh yes no thanks to you admiral avakli has presumably briefed you on the very delicate problem we assigned to his team im hoping should it yield any interesting galactic connections your somewhat eclectic background might help pick them out do you have any ideas yet several do they tend to natural causes or sabotage ill be looking for signs of sabotage if i cant find an y we may end up dubbing it natural causes by default t he analysis will take several days if its done thorughly i want you to be thorough molecule by molecule if necessary oh it will have to be and um remember that while you are inside impsecs labs and certainly part of a team you are not inside impsecs chain of command youll be reporting directly to me weddels brows drew down thoughtfully thats very interesting carry on then weddell tilted his chin in slightly ironic acknowledgment yes my lord ah vorkosigan is it or my lord auditor would be correct this week rarefied i could scarcely go higher here without risking a nosebleed is that a warning to me orientation only a courtesy ah thank you weddell nodded and drifted back to watch the proceedings over avaklis shoulder weddellcanaba was still an ass at heart miles reflected but he did know his molecular biology after a conversation with admiral avakli miles called gregor to report the success of the surgery he then turned to see illyan one more time he found the impsec chief sitting up in bed dressed again with lady alys seated nearby illyan actually smiled slightly as he entered the first unharrowed expression miles had seen on his features for days hello sir its good to have you back miles illyan nodded carefully then touched his hand to his head as if to make sure it was going to stay on how long have you been here come over here only about four days i guess or five miles went to his other side illyan too studied his house uniform and its assorted ornaments he reached out to lightly tick the gold auditors chain across miless shoulders it rang with a faint pure note now thats rather unexpected general haroche didnt want to let me in gregor decided this would save argument how creative of gregor illyan vented a brief surprised laugh which miles was not quite sure how to interpret i would never have thought of it but waste not want not if you seem to be able to watch out for yourself now sir i thought id take a break and go home for a bit ill stay for a while alys volunteered then added you did a good job miles miles shrugged hell i didnt do that much just got the tech boys into motion i suppose with an effort he converted a parting salute into a more civilian polite nod and halfbowed himself out back in his bedroom at vorkosigan house miles hung up his house uniform to await attention from a laundry and divested it of its decorations which he put away carefully it would likely be a long time before he wore them again if ever still theyd finally served a useful purpose lastly he held up the gold chain of his ersatz auditors office and let it turn in the light studying its exquisite detail well that was amusing while it lasted he supposed he ought to take the chain back promptly to the residence to be returned to the vault from which it had come it seemed a little careless to leave an object of that much historical and artistic value lying around in ones bureau drawer still a job was never over till the reports were written a decade in imp sec had taught him that if nothing else and until avakli and his merry men turned in their report miles could not very well offer his final one to gregor he tucked the chain away atop a stack of shirts chapter nineteen reluctantly but firmly miles seated himself at his comconsole the next day and rang up the imperial military hospitals veterans treatment division and scheduled a preliminary examination for the diagnosis of his seizures impmil was the most logical place to go they had as much experience with cryorevival cases as anybody else on barrayar and they had immediate and privileged access to all his medical records classified or not his dendarii fleet surgeons notes alone should save weeks of repetitive horsing around sooner or later ivan would remember his threats to drag miles bodily to the clinic of his choice or worse rat about miless footdragging to gregor this spiked ivans guns mission accomplished miles sighed pushed back from his comconsole and rose for an aimless ramble around the echoing corridors and chambers of vorkosigan house it wasnt that he missed ivans company exactly it was just that he missed company even ivans vorkosigan house wasnt meant to be this quiet it had been designed to host a fulltime roaring circus with its complement of guardsmen and staff maids and grooms and gardeners hurrying couriers and languid courtiers vor visitors trailing their retinues children with the successive counts vorkosigan as ringmasters the hubs around which the whole great gaudy wheel turned counts and countesses vorkosigan the party had been at its height in his greatgrandparents day miles supposed just before the end of the time of isolation he paused before a window overlooking the curving drive and pictured horses and carriages pulling up below officers and ladies disembarking with a glitter of swords and a swirl of fabrics running the dendarii mercenaries had been something like that at least the roaringcircus aspect miles wondered if the dendarii fleet would outlast its founder by as long as vorkosigan house had outlasted the first count eleven generations ago and if it would be knocked down and completely rebuilt as often strange to think he might have created something so organic and live that it would continue in his absence without him to prop and push the way children went on living without any further act of will on the parents part quinn was surely his worthy successor he ought to give up any pretense of his return to the dendarii and just promote her to admiral period or would personnel assignments now be haroche s job miles would have trusted illyan to handle quinn but did haroche have the insight the imagination required he sighed unease his peregrinations brought him to the secondfloor succession of rooms with the best view of the back garden that had been his formidable grandfathers lair for the last years of the old mans life miless father and mother had not chosen to move into them after the old counts death instead retaining their own extensive chambers on the floor above but theyd had the old counts rooms refurbished as a sort of imperialgrade guest suite bedroom private bath sitting room and study even ivan a connoisseur of comfort had not had the nerve to claim the elegantly appointed space on his recent sojourn hed taken instead a small bedroom down the hall from miles though that might have been for convenience in keeping an eye on his erratic cousin staring around the silent chambers miles was seized an inspiration kidnapping murmured general haroche eyeing miles over illyans comconsole desk the following morning miles smiled blandly hardly that sir an invitation to illyan to enjoy the hospitality of vorkosigan house during his convalescence offered by me in my fathers name and place ive no doubt he would approve admiral avaklis team has not yet ruled out sabotage of the chip though i find im drifting more and more to the natural explanation myself but given that uncertainty er vorkosigan house really secure enough compared to impsec hq if illyans chip was sabotaged it may well have happened in impsec environs thats where illyan mostly was after all impsec is demonstrably no protection and ah if vorkosigan house is not securable by impsec it will certainly be news to the former lord regent i might even call it a major scandal haroche bared his teeth point taken my lord auditor he glanced at ruibal seated beside miles and how does this removal look in your medical opinion dr ruibal a good idea or a bad one mm more good than bad i think said the pudgy neurologist illyan is physically ready to return to normal light activitythat does not include work of course a little extra distance between him and his office might help prevent arguments about that haroche s brows rose he had apparently not considered this awkward possibility before dr ruibal added let him take medical leave rest and relax do a little reading or whatever keeping a log of any further problems i can give him his daily examination there as well as here certainly further problems miles noted ruibals turn of phrase what are his current problems how is he shaping up now well hes physically fine if understandably fatigued motor reflexes normal but his shortterm memory to put it plainly is shot to hell at present his scores on cognitive tasks that involve shortterm memoryand most of them doare all well below his norms his former norms of course were extraordinary its too early to tell if this will be a permanent condition or if his brain will retrain itself over time or if some kind of medical intervention will be required or god help me what form that intervention might take my prescription is for a couple of weeks of rest and varied activity and then well see thus buying time for ruibal to scramble for solutions it sounds reasonable to me miles said haroche nodded agreement on your head be it then lord vorkosigan after another personal call on avakli in his lab miles trooped over to the impsec clinic to pitch the invitation to illyan there he found an unexpected ally in his selfappointed mission of persuasion in lady alys visiting illyan again she was impeccably turned out as usual today in something dark red and vorishly feminine ie expensive but its a splendid notion she said as illyan began to hesitantly demur very right and proper of you miles cordelia would approve do you think so said illyan yes indeed and the suite has windows miles pointed out helpfully lots and lots of windows thats what i always missed most whenever i was stuck in here illyan glanced around his blankwalled patient room windows eh not that they are necessarily an advantage you were done in when evon vorhalas fired that gas grenade through your parents bedroom window i can remember that night his hand twitched he frowned its like a dream the incident had occurred slightly over thirty years ago thats why all the windows in vorkosigan house were subsequently forcescreened miles said no problem now its pretty quiet there at present but i have this new cook ivan mentioned your new cook illyan admitted at length yes said lady alys a faintly calculating look crossing her fine featureswas she regretting that the days of horse cattle and serf raids upon neighboring lords property were gone forever and it will be ever so much more convenientand comfortablefor people to visit you there than in this dreadful depressing place simon hm said illyan he smiled briefly at her looking thoughtful thats true well miles yes thank you i accept excellent said lady alys do you need any help would you care to use my car i have my car and driver outside said miles i think we can manage then in that case i believe ill meet you there im sure you havent thought of everything miles men never do lady alys nodded decisively rose in a sweep of skirts and hurried out whatever can she intend to provide that vorkosigan house doesnt already have illyan wondered in some bemusement flowers hazarded miles dancing maids er soap and towels she was right he hadnt thought of everything i can hardly wait to find out well whatever she comes up with im sure it will be done right with her you can count on that agreed illyan reliable woman unlike some men of illyan s generation miles knew he did not seem to find this a contradiction in terms he hesitated and looked through narrowed eyes at miles i seem to remember she was here at some rather unpleasant moments that she was in style with lady alys how else illyan glanced around the little patient room as if really seeing it for the first time in weeks your respected aunt is right this place is dismal then lets blow out of here they decamped from impsec hq with only one valise and very little further fuss illyan had been traveling light for more years than miles had been alive after all martin wafted them back to vorkosigan house in the fusty luxury of the old armored groundcar they arrived at illyans new digs to find alys directing a cleanup crew who were just departing flowers soap and towels and fresh sheets had been laid on if miles ever made good his threat to turn vorkosigan house into a hotel he knew who he wanted to hire for his general manager martin spent all of five minutes distributing illyans meager belongings to their new storage then was packed off by alys to the kitchen illyans slight awkwardness at all these attentions was relieved by the return of martin trundling a tea cart laden with a mighty afternoon snack a la ma kosti he laid the spread on the sitting rooms table overlooking the back garden through an outcurving window lady alyss hand was apparent in the service all the correct trays and utensils seemed to have been found at last and put to their proper uses but after a round of tea and cream little sandwiches stuffed eggs meatballs in plum sauce the famous spiced peach tarts sweet wine and some decorated killer chocolate things with the density of plutonium that miles didnt even know the name of everybody was relaxed into the replete and meditative silence that followed the demolishing of the tea miles at last dared to float a question so simon whats it like what can you remember now of the last few weeks and um before what have we done to you illyan halfengulfed by the soft upholstery of the armchair in which he leaned back grimaced the last few weeks seem very fragmentary before that is fragmentary too the hand twitch again it feels like as if a man whod always had perfect vision had a glass helmet all smeared with grease and mud fastened over his head except i cant get it off cant break it cant breathe but said miles you do seem to be i dont know in possession of yourself this doesnt seem like my cryoamnesia for instance i didnt know who i was hell i didnt even recognize quinn god i miss quinn ah thats right youve been through worse i suppose illyan smiled grimly i begin to appreciate it i dont know if it was worse or not i do know it was pretty disturbing a slight understatement i seem to be able to recognize things illyan sighed i just cant recall them properly nothing comes up theres nothing there his hand clenched to a fist this time he sat up alys was instantly alert to illyans sudden rise in tension all the past is like a dream she noted soothingly its how most people remember all the time maybe you can think back to your youth before old ezar ever had the chip installed if things come back to you about like those times do why thats perfectly normal normal for you mm she frowned and sipped the dregs of her tea as if to mask her lack of an answer for this i have a practical reason for asking said miles im not sure if anyones explained it all to you but gregor appointed me an acting imperial auditor with the mandate to oversee your case yes i was wondering how you engineered that we needed something to top impsec you see and theres not much else that can after admiral avaklis team gets done with their examination of the chip im going to have to turn in a proper auditors report to the emperor if they deliver a verdict of natural causes well thats the end of it but if they dont i was wondering if you would be able to recall anything any moment or event that might have cloaked the administration of some form of biosabotage illyan spread his hands and placed them slowly to the sides of his head in a gesture of frustration if i had my chip and a defined timewindow i could run every waking moment past my minds eye see very detail it would take time but it could be done nail the bastards dead to rights no matter how subtly theyd slipped it to me if this was sabotage theyve destroyed the evidence against themselves quite neatly he snorted unhappily mm miles sat back disappointed but not surprised he poured himself a half cup of tea and decided not to attempt that last peach tart canted lonely and forlorn on the crumbscattered doily pressing illyan further would seriously agitate him miles sensed deadend for now time to change the subject so aunt alys hows the preparation for gregors betrothal ceremony coming along ohshe cast him a grateful look for the straight linequite well all things considered whos in charge of security for it illyan asked is haroche trying to handle it himself no hes delegated colonel lord vortala the younger oh good choice illyan relaxed again and fiddled with his empty cup yes said alys vortala understands the way things are done the official announcement and ceremony will take place at the residence of courseive been trying to help laisa with the intricacies of barrayaran traditional dress though we are debating if komarran styles might be appropriate for the betrothal barrayaran dress will be required for the wedding itself of course she was off on a lengthy dissertation of what miles mentally dubbed the socialtechnical aspects of her job the topic was soothing and happy and both he and illyan kept her going with leading questions for a while after martin cleared away the tea things miles suggested a game of cards to pass the time it was not of course to pass the time but to provide a private check of illyan s neural function a nuance illyan did not miss but illyan went along with it startarot oneup was a mediumcomplicated game and required a certain amount of tracking of cards played held in opponents hands and probably upcoming to beat the odds miles had never in his life seen anybody win against illyan over any lengthy series of rounds except by overwhelming luck in a particular draw after six rounds miles and lady alys had split the points between them and illyan pleaded fatigue miles gave way at once illyan did look weary his face drawn and anxious but miles didnt think that was his real reason for quitting ruibal hadnt exaggerated illyans shortterm memory and eye for detail were practically nonexistent he seemed to hold his own in casual conversation where one comment triggered the next in flowing succession but so what do you think of haroches appointment for security for gregors wedding miles asked casually who did he appoint asked illyan who would be your first pick colonel vortala i think he knows the capital scene well as any man i have ah said miles alys rising to take her leave winced illyan frowned suddenly his eyes narrowing but he added nothing more faintly defiant he waved miles back to his seat and saw lady alys out to her car with courtly punctilio miles stood and stretched more tired than the days accomplishments could justify this is going to be strange the new if still rather quiet household routine was quickly established miles and illyan arose when they chose and might or might not cross paths in the kitchen in the morning cadging breakfast though they met more normally for ma kostis lunches and dinners miles went out daily to impmil the vast imperial service hospital complex on the other side of the river gorge which bisected the old town the first day they kept him waiting in the corridors like any other veteran seeking treatment he casually dropped mention of his new status as an acting imperial auditor and that didnt happen again well gregors chokechain had to be good for something duv galeni came the second evening illyans new residency in the old counts chambers seemed to catch galeni by surprise he tried to excuse himself from dinner but miles wouldnt let him the komarranborn officer was stiff and uncomfortable dining with his formidable former chief all that history weighing on his mind miles supposed galeni diplomatically pretended not to notice illyans frequent lapses of memory and attention and swiftly picked up miless technique of sprinkling little reminderremarks through his conversation to help illyan stay on track or at least maintain the illusion he was doing so lady alys visited often as promised though the pace of her life was picking up as the emperors betrothal ceremony approached shed laid on not one but two new social secretaries in her office in the residence ivan dropped by always just in time to be invited for a meal a halfdozen aging military acquaintances of illyans generation stopped to say hello to him they too quickly learned to turn up around tea time their number included impsecs komarran affairs sectionchief guy allegre but happily the man had the wit not to let illyan agitate himself trying to talk shop the courtesyguard impsec had provided on the absent viceroy of sergyars residence was increased from one man per shift to a more serious three with the unfortunate side effect of blocking corporal kostis private box lunches but he routinely dropped by to visit in the kitchen after his shift so miles supposed he was in no danger of starving vorkosigan house s grocery bills were becoming nicely impressive though they still had a long way to go to equal the counts former households miles called admiral avakli daily for an update on his teams progress avakli was scientifically guarded in his comments but miles was able to construe that they were making steady progress at least in the elimination of negative hypotheses miles did not lean on avakli for more definitive statements this was one case where they really couldnt afford hurried mistakes in either direction and there was no need for haste whatever harm was going to be done had been done and there was no way miles avakli or anyone else could undo it now the medical breakthrough miles was itching for came on the sixth day but not from avaklis team the impmil cryonicist and neurologist who had teamed up to tackle his case at last managed to trigger one of miless seizures in their lab miles came up out of the alltoofamiliar colored confetti and blackness to find himself still lying on the examination table head clamped in a scanner half the size of the room body wired every which way the three med techs stationed around him had perhaps been forced to keep him from spasming off the table but more likely to keep the monitors correctly adjusted colonel dr chenko the neurologist and captain dr dguise the cryonicist were bouncing up and down and chortling loudly pointing out fascinating readouts to each other it was apparently the best show since the cycleriding bear had come to the hassadar fair and spooked the horses miles groaned but it did not gain any immediate attention the monitors were apparently much more engrossing the doctors didnt really start talking to him instead of each other until he was dressed again and awaited in dr chenko s office even his imperial auditors status didnt rush them this time chenko a fit and energetic middleaged man who seemed a walking advertisement for the medical profession came in at last assortment of data disks in his hand his initial air of pleased excitement had by this time subsided to mere smugness we know whats happening with you lord vorkosigan he announced seating himself at his comconsole as wed guessed the mechanism of your seizures was idiosyncratic but we have it now wonderful said miles flatly what is it undaunted by his tone chenko plugged the data disks into his comconsole and made the holovid display models and graphs to illustrate his points as he talked apparently after your cryonic revival your brain began generating an unusually high level of neurotransmitters these build up over time in their neural reservoirs to a quite abnormal level of engorgement as you see here so theres a layover view of a normal reservoir by way of contrast dyou see the difference then something happens to trigger some unusually heavy brain activitystress or excitement of some kind sayand the reservoirs cascaderelease all at once thats this spike in this graph here this shuts down your normal neural functions temporarily and incidentally accounts for the hallucinatory effects you report after a minute or two your neurotransmitter reservoirs empty out to normalactually belownormallevels thus the few minutes of unconsciousness that follow then equilibrium begins to reassert itself and you return to consciousness though in a somewhat fatigued mode and the cycle begins again it is an entirely biochemical rather than phaseelectrical form of epilepsy quite fascinating and unique dr dguise wants to write it up for the impmil medical journalyour patientanonymity will be protected of course miles digested the news of his upcoming place in medical history in silence so he said at last what can you do about it mm the cause is global spread throughout large parts of your brain though perhaps fortunately its concentrated in the frontal lobes rather than the brain stem so the seizures dont kill you outright it does not obviously lend itself to surgical treatments nobody chops up my brain you yoho im glad to hear it what treatment does it lend itself to ah dr chenko hesitated actually he fell silent ah hm he added after a time miles waited clutching his fragile patience dr chenkos medical creativity would surely not be enhanced by having an imperial auditor launch himself over the comconsole and attempt to strangle him miles also wasnt sure if his auditors legal immunity extended to personal assault one approach for phaseelectrical epileptic defects said dr chenko after a time is to install a destabilization chip in the subjects brain when a seizure begins to occur the biochip senses it and generates a countersurge of electrical impulses to dephase the offending brainwave feedback pattern sort of a surgesuppressor in reverse not a cure exactly but it alleviates the major symptoms im not so sure i trust biochips miles mentioned particularly neural ones oh its quite a reliable and mature piece of technology dr chenko assured him i just dont think its right for your case theres a cure but you cant have it right so what is dr dguise and i are going to have to consult on that one now that we have some proper data to work with i think we may be able to evolve a couple of possible approaches as your case is unique they must of course be experimental we may have to try several ideas before finding an optimum one reasonable enough miles supposed so are we talking days weeks months years no not months if its any reassurance after that seizure in the lab today i think it will be some time before you are chemically primed for another episode which in fact gives me an idea an abstracted look came over dr chenkos face he began to tap out a few notes on his comconsole paused then began tapping harder data displays fountained and folded miles watched him for a while then rose and quietly tiptoed out ill call you tomorrow my lord dr chenko called hastily after him as the door hissed closed miles entered the blackandwhite paved foyer of vorkosigan house to find illyan sitting on the upholstered bench at the foot of the curving stairs he was showered shaved combed and wearing full dress greens with all his insignia and proper decorations miles suffered a horrible moment thinking illyan had become confused and thought he was off for a conference with the emperor or miles had become confused and illyan really was off for a conference with the emperor whats up simon he asked with feigned casualness ah there you are miles where did you say youd gone oh impmil that was it sorry yes lady alys has asked me to be her escort at a concert she wishes to attend this evening a concert i didnt know you had an interest in concerts where the vorbarr sultana company hall i dont know if i have an interest in concerts or not for all the times ive run security on that building for gregor when he attended i never once had a chance to sit down and watch and listen to the show myself maybe ill find out why all those pretty people like your aunt go there to be pretty for each other i suppose said miles though thats probably not the only reason seats are sold out two years in advance the vorbarr sultana company is supposed to the best on barrayar a concert how unexpected illyans first appearance in public since his breakdown would certainly have an interesting effect on the capitals rumor mills he looked as sharp as he ever did when he troubled to clean up and play the imperial officer the surgical scratch was almost healed and with his thinning hair combed over the bare patch hardly noticeable unless you knew what to look for it was not even obvious that the new vague uncertainty in his eyes was different from the abstracted inward look he used to get when accessing his chip but if it had been sabotage some kind of attack would somebody want to try again miles could imagine a depressed illyan courting assassination but it seemed unfair to take miless only aunt down with him so what are you doing for security simon well miles thats impsecs problem tonight i think ill leave it to them an odd smile played around illyans lips ah here she is the sound of lady alyss purring groundcar came from the porte cochere that sheltered the front door the whine of the canopy lifting the drivers tread then lady alyss quick steps miles opened the door for his smiling aunt tonight she was wearing something beige with subdued glitters winking from the fall of fabric and very vorish hello miles dear she patted him on the shoulder in passing better than the regulation auntish peck on the cheek miles supposed at least she didnt pat him on the head simon illyan rose and bowed over her hand milady well lady alys probably wouldnt let him wander off and get lost miles stepped back as she swept out bearing her prize who seemed pleased enough to be captured illyan was a guest not under house arrest for heavens sake um be careful he called after them illyan waved jauntily then paused wait there was something i forgot alys waited yes simon message for you miles it was important his right hand rubbed his temple i put the message disk on your comconsole what was it oh yes from your lady mother shes just leaving komarr and will be here in five days miles managed to keep an oh shit from popping out of his mouth oh my fathers not with her is he i dont believe so no hes not alys put in i had a message from cordelia myself this afternoonshe must have dispatched them all together i shall be so glad to have her assistance for the betrothalwell not assistance exactly you know how indolent your mother can become when presented with these little social challenges but her moral support anyway and we have so much to catch up on illyans lips twitched you dont look overjoyed miles oh ill be glad to see her i suppose but you know the way she tries to take my emotional temperature betanstyle the thought of all that incoming maternal concern makes me want to duck and run mm said illyan in judicious sympathy dont be childish miles his aunt alys said firmly her pokerfaced driver raised the canopy and illyan helped her settle herself and her dress neatly within all those years of close observation of the vor class had certainly taught him the moves miles had to admit and they were off leaving miles to another evening of wandering around vorkosigan house talking to himself so why didnt he take ladies to conceits what was stopping him well the thing with the seizures of course and the crisis with illyan hanging unresolved but both looked to be ended soon and then what not dear god more double dates with ivan miles shuddered in memory of some historic disasters he needed something new he was still stuck somewhere in limbo somehow prisoner of old habits he was too young to be retired dammit if only quinn were here he hoped his aunt alys would be careful tonight he and illyan had gone out for a walk one afternoon corporal kosti trailing discreetly and illyan had become lost within two blocks of vorkosigan house he would have felt less nervous if illyan and lady alys had stayed in and played cards again a form of mild cognitive therapy dr ruibal had approved illyan and lady alys did not return till two hours after midnight long past the end of the concert somewhat grouchily miles met his houseguest at the door illyan seemed mildly surprised hello miles are you still up illyan looked all right if slightly rumpled and notably redolent of the esters of fine wine and perfumes where were you all this time miles demanded all what time since the concert ended oh we rode around had a late supper talked you know talked well lady alys talked i listened i found it restful did you play cards not tonight go to bed miles im certainly going to yawning illyan headed up the stairs to his suite so how do you like concerts miles called after him illyans voice floated back very well dammit the rest of us are going crazy over this chip thing why arent you no unfair to blame illyan for declining to well to go into a decline perhaps the impsec chief had concluded the failure was natural and was dealing with it or perhaps he was just more patient and subtle than miles about stalking his stalker that would not be news anyway why shouldnt illyan have a normal night out he didnt fall over and have convulsions in public miles growled and went to bed but not to sleep it was going to be a wearing wait for chenkos call from impmil dr chenko leaned intently into his comconsole pickup and spoke this is what weve managed to come up with so far lord vorkosigan weve ruled out the possibility of a purely medical approach say the administration of drugs to slow your production of neurotransmitters if only one or a few related chemicals were involved it might be possible but you are apparently overproducing dozens or even hundredsmaybe even all of them we cant suppress them all and in any case even if we could it would only reduce the frequency of the seizures not eliminate them and in fact upon closer examination of the data i dont think the malfunction is nearly so much on the production side as it is on the reservoirs molecularreleasemechanism side a second approach looks more promising we think we can microminiaturize a version of the neural stimulators we used in the lab to trigger your seizure the other day this array could be permanently installed under your skull along with feedback sensors that would report when your neurotransmitter reservoirs were becoming dangerously overloaded you could use the stimulator to voluntarily trigger a seizure in a controlled time and place and thus so to speak defuse yourself safely done on a schedule the attacks ought to be milder and shorter in duration too would i be able to drive fly command mm if the levels were properly monitored and maintained i dont see why not if it works after a short internal struggleagainst whom miles blurted i was medically discharged over these seizures would i becould i be reinstated returned to duty yes i dont quite understand you should have been sent to impmil before your discharge was finalized hm well if you were a lieutenant still serving you might be able to petitionor pull whatever strings you ownand arrange to be assigned to desk work since you are already discharged you would certainly need more strings chenko smiled in prudent unwillingness to underestimate lord vorkosigans inventory of strings desk work not ship duty not field command field command i thought you were an impsec galactic affairs operative ah lets just say i did not end up in that cryochamber as the result of a training accident though it was surely a learning experience hm well thats most certainly not my department impsec is a law unto itself impsecs own medical corps would have to decide what youre fit for as far as the rest of the service goes youd need extraordinary mitigating circumstances to engineer yourself anything but office work i could provide some i bet but desk work was no temptation no threat to the continued existence of lord vorkosigan to spend the rest of his career in charge of the laundry or worse as weather officer on some backwater base waiting forever for promotionno be sensible hed doubtless end up in a comfy cubicle down in the bowels of impsec analyzing data garnered by other galactic affairs agents collecting pay raises on a regular schedulebut spared the stresses of promotion to department head or chief of impsec going home every night to sleep in his own bed in vorkosigan house just like ivan toddling off to his flat sleeping alone not even that necessarily if only he hadnt falsified that thricedamned report miles sighed this is all entirely hypothetical im afraid as for the scheduledseizures idea its not really a cure is it no but while youre waiting for someone brighter than myself to come up with one it will control your symptoms suppose no one brighter than yourself comes along will i have these damned things for the rest of my life chenko shrugged honestly i have no idea your condition is unique in my neurological experience miles sat silent for a time all right he said at last lets try it and see what happens he smiled briefly at gregors habitual turn of phrase a private joke very good my lord chenko made a flurry of notes well need to see you again mm in about a week he paused and looked up forgive my curiosity my lord but why in the world would an imperialauditor wish to be reinstated into the service as a mere impsec lieutenant impsec captain i wanted to be reinstated as an impsec captain im only an acting auditor im afraid my tenure ends when my case is closed um and what is your case highly sensitive oh quite sorry shutting down his comconsole miles reflected on chenkos very good question he didnt seem to have a very good answer for it chapter twenty as the days slipped by without incident miles was with reluctance drawn more to haroches growing opinion that the chip failure had been from natural causes the new impsec acting chief was certainly acting less tense about it all yet why should haroche remain twitchy when there had been no followup no other attack during the timewindow of confusion the transition of power had gone smoothly if the putative plot had been intended to derail impsecs organization instead of illyan personally it had been a notable flop three days before countess vorkosigan was due to arrive at the capital miless nerve broke and he decided to flee to vorkosigan surleau he had neither hope nor truly desire to avoid her altogether on her visit home he just wasnt quite ready to face her yet maybe a couple of days in the quiet of the country would help him marshal his courage besides it would be good security for illyan out in that thinly populated area where strangers were immediately noticed it was easier to spot trouble coming miless one doubt about the retreat to the country house was whether he could persuade his cook to accompany them however martin proved a potent bribe to draw ma kosti out of her familiar city into the doubtful hinterlands miles began to consider raising not his cooks pay but her sons to entice him and therefore her to stay longer but maybe soon he wouldnt need a driver illyan was amenable to the proposed excursion if not wildly enthusiastic this weeks probably the very last of the good fall weather down there miles pointed out indeed the capital was undergoing a succession of colder and rainier days with a nasty hint of early snow it will be interesting to see the place again allowed illyan see if its as i remember more of illyans quiet selftesting illyan didnt talk much about it perhaps because the results of so many of his little tests were so discouraging or perhaps because he lost track of the results too quickly a mornings very mild flurry of activityboth miles and illyan traveled light by training and habitresulted in a restful afternoon tea taken on the long front porch of the lake house it was impossible to stay tense in the warm afternoon sitting in the shade and gazing down over the green lawn to the sparkling stretch of water cradled in the hills the autumn trees were almost denuded of their colorful leaves which opened up the view and the demands of digestion cured the viewer of any remaining residue of ambition if this went on miles thought he was going to have to take up an exercise program or end up looking like his clonebrother mark which would rather defeat marks purposes he made a mental note to keep mark and ma kosti separated for as long as possible during a lull in the arrival of delectables illyan glanced down over the lawn huh thats about the spot where captain negri died isnt it the opening shot in the war of vordarians pretendership so im told said miles were you here then did you see it no no i was up in the capital being taken by surprise by vordarians forces along with almost everyone else illyan sighed meditatively or so i construe the only image i can call up is of one of my subordinates running in with the first wordi cant remember his name and of going somewhere in a groundcar and of being sickscared i remember that vividly how my guts felt odd why should i remember that and not all the more important facts i suppose said miles because you always did have to remember it did your chip record your emotions not really though it was possible to reconstruct them when i was recalling deduced not felt more or less that would be strange i got used to it illyan smiled ironically staring down across the sunlit grass almost my first job when your father promoted me to chief of impsec was to investigate the murder of my predecessor come to think of it that could be said to have been negris first job too doubtless made easier by the fact that he helped engineer the murder of his predecessor but still anything done twice on barrayar is a tradition i believe i got off lightly i never thought id get out of this job alive though your fathers retirement last year was rather inspiring is that when you started to think about targeting me for your successor oh i had you targeted long before that or gregor and i did miles wasnt sure he wanted to think about that so after a week to reflect on it do you now think your chip failure was natural illyan shrugged nothing lasts forever people devices well admiral avakli will advise in due course i wonder what lady alys is doing today triaging guest lists and choosing stationery and prodding her new secretaries through calligraphy practice or so she said lady alys had told them both that yesterday ah said illyan pastries arrived and silence fell for a time broken only by the sound of munching and little appreciative mumbles so illyan said at last what do a couple of retired officers and gentlemen do on a country weekend what they please sleep in weve been doing that all week do you have any interest in horseback riding not really your grandfather the general insisted on giving me lessons from time to time when i was down here i can stay alive on a horse but i dont recall its being what you would call a sybaritic pleasure more in the masochistic line ah well theres hiking and swimming though that might be imprudent for me i could wear a floatjacket i suppose the waters a little cold by now isnt it not as bad as in the spring ill pass i think it all sounds a bit youthfully athletic oh this was a great place to be a kid miles thought it over theres fishing i suppose i never did much of that sergeant bothari wasnt fond of cleaning fish that sounds sedate enough tradition is you take the local beer from the villagetheres a woman there who homebrews it extraordinary stuffand hang the bottles over the side of the boat to stay cold when the beer gets too warm to drink its too hot to fish what season is that never as far as i could tell let us by all means observe tradition said illyan gravely it took half a day to get the power boat out of storage which put them out on the lake in the hazy warmth of the next afternoon instead of the foggy chill of the early morning this suited miles fine the basic mechanics of fishing were not something miles had forgotten and he never had gone in for the refinements the need for sticking hooks into wriggling unhappy live things had been technologically relieved by the invention of little protein cubes which the package assured him were guaranteed to attract fish in droves or shoals or whatever he and illyan arranged their beer in a net bag over the side of the boat and their awning overhead and settled down to enjoy the peace and the view the impsec guard onshift one of three assigned by hq to trail illyan around down here got to sit on shore with a little pontoonfitted lightflyer and watch from a distance out of mind if not out of sight the two lines ploinked over the side nearly simultaneously and the bait and sinkers disappeared into the water gliding smoothly down at this distance from the shore the green view of the rocky bottom was replaced by a depth of black shadow miles and illyan settled back in their padded chairs and opened their first beers the brew was smooth and nearly as dark as the lake waters and doubtless swimming with vitamins it slid down miless throat with a pleasantly bitter fizz and its earthy aroma filled his nose this would be more like a stakeout illyan remarked after a while if the fish were armed and could fire back if fish fished for men what kind of bait would they use miles pictured a line tossed onto the shore tipped with a spiced peach tart lets go manning i dunno what kind of bait did you used to use ah the motivations of men money power revenge sex they were almost never actually that simple the screwiest case that i can recall dear god why can i remember this when i cant oh well in the event thenprime minister vortala was engaged in heavy negotiations with the polians over the wormhole access treaty and was trying anything he could think of to sweeten the deal the polian ambassador indicated to vortala that what hed really always secretly wanted most in his life was an elephant to this day i dont know if he really wanted an elephant or if it was just the most absurd and impossible thing to ask for he could think of on the spur of the moment so anyway the word came down it was really the head of galactic affairs department but i gave the assignment to my impsec agent personally just so i could watch i still can see this glazed look that came over his face as he choked and and how big does this elephant have to be sir there arent many moments like that in my job i cherish em it was before your time or you know who would have been the first man id have thought of oh thanks so did your agent locate an elephant he was impsec to the core of course he did a small one i assigned myself to the detail the day vortala delivered it to the polian embassy too in that fruity deadpan voice of his a gift from my imperial master gregor vorbarra gregor must have been about ten then and likely would have preferred to keep the beast himself your father prudently didnt let him know hed ever given away an elephant and did vortala get his treaty of course i think the ambassador really did want an elephant because after he got over being stunned and flummoxed he was clearly delighted they kept it in back of the embassy compound for about a year and he used to bathe and groom it himself till he took it home with him it expanded my world view ever after money power sex and elephants miles snorted he wondered about his own motivations which had driven him so hard so long so far to death and beyond he was unexcited by money he supposed because he had never felt its lack except in the astronomical quantities necessary to repair battle cruisers mark by contrast was in his own quiet way downright greedy power miles had no hankering for the imperium or anything like it but it itched like fire when others had power over him that wasnt lust for power that was fear fear of what fear of being made victim of their incompetence fear of being destroyed for a mutant if he could not constantly prove his superiority there was a bit of that underneath well quite a lot really his own grandfather had tried to kill him for his deformities hed been told and there had been a few other ugly little incidents during his childhood usually though not always cut short by the timely intervention of sergeant bothari but that was hardly a hidden motivation not the unselfaware kind that got you into deep trouble and you didnt know why he swallowed another chill and smoky slug of beer identity thats my elephant the thought came with certainty without the question mark on the end this time not fame exactly though recognition was some kind of important cement for it but what you were was what you did and i did more oh yes if a hunger for identity were translated into say a hunger for food hed be a more fantastic glutton than mark had ever dreamed of being is it irrational to want to be so much to want so hard it hurts and how much then was enough illyan too took another swig of homebrew and wriggled the carbonfiber highstrength fishing rod which like miles s had come from the boathouses stores you sure there are fish down there oh yes have been for centuries you can lie on the dock and watch the little ones nosing around the rocks or swim with them this lake was actually first terraformed long before the end of the time of isolation in the old crude way which was by dumping every kind of organic waste they could lay hands on into it followed by stolen weeds and minnows and hoping an earthlifeformsupporting ecosystem would result there was a lot of argument over it back about the time of the first counts since the local farmers also wanted the assorted shit for their fields since the countmygrandfathers day theres been a string of fellows who work out of the counts office in hassadar in charge of scientifically terraforming and stocking the districts waters so its back to being safe to drink and the fish are genetically improved lake trout bass freshwater salmon theres some good stuff down there illyan leaned over and stared a little doubtfully down into the clear water really he wound up his line and examined his hook his baitcube was gone did i put bait on this thing yes i saw you fell off likely lightfingered fish but illyan resisted any impulse to make a more extended mutantfish joke he rebaited the hook more firmly and ploinked it into the water again they opened another beer each miles perched on the edge of the boat and cooled his bare feet in the water for a time this is very inefficient illyan noted after adjusting the awning to reposition the creeping shade ive wondered about that myself i dont think it was designed to be efficient i think it was created to give the appearance of doing something while actually doing nothing to repel chorebearing wives perhaps ive been doing nothing for a week illyan hesitated it hasnt seemed to help not true youre doing better at oneup ive been tracking you i thought you and lady alys had colluded to let me win last time nope ah illyan looked slightly cheered but only for a moment the ability to play oneup without losing all the time is not enough to make me fit to return to impsec im afraid give yourself time youve scarcely begun rehabilitation miless feet were getting wrinkled he returned to his padded seat illyan stared at the farther shore all green and brown in the westering sun no there is an edge to a performance when youve balanced on that edge played at the very top of your form you cant go back to anything less to invert your mothers old saying anything that cant be done well is not worth doing and running impsec is about as far from play as anything i know there are too many other peoples lives on the line every day mm said miles covering his lack of useful comment in another swig of beer ive had my twicetwentyyears in the emperors service illyan said started when i was eighteen in officers training for old ezar not the imperial service academy you needed more points and money and syllables in front of your name to get in back then i went to one of the regional schools i never thought to make it to a threetimestwentyyears man i knew id stop sometime before that i just didnt know when ive been serving gregor since he was five years old hes fulladult now god knows thats your achievement surely said miles illyan nodded not mine alone but i cant be who i amwhat i wasand not know that i never made it to the end of my first twenty years said miles glumly not even close illyan cleared his throat and studied his line was that a nibble there no i dont think so the rod would dip more just the current playing with the weight of the line i wouldnt have picked now to quit mind you said illyan i would have liked to have seen gregor through his wedding and the next crisis after that miles twitted him and the next crisis after that and illyan grunted resigned agreement so maybe this isnt so bad he added after a time do you suppose all the fish in your lake have been stolen theyd have to catch em first ah good point illyan paused to fish up the net bag and open another beer for himself and hand one to miles he was halfway through the bottle when he said i know how much the dendarii meant to you im pleased you survived he did not say im sorry miles noted miles s disaster had been a selfinflicted wound death where is thy sting he jiggled his rod hook where is thy fish no suicide wasnt an option for me anymore i found not like good old adolescent angst im no longer of the secret opinion that death will somehow overlook me if i dont do something personally about it and given life it seems stupid not to make the most of what i do have not to mention deucedly ungrateful dyou think you and quinn how to put this delicately dyou think you will be able to persuade captain quinn to take an interest in lord vorkosigan ah illyan was trying to apologize for screwing up miles s lovelife that was it miles drank more beer and thought it over seriously i never was able to before i want to try i have to try one more time with her again when how where it hurt to think of quinn it hurt still to let himself think of the dendarii at all therefore he would not much more beer as for the rest of it he sipped and smiled bitterlythere is some convincing evidence that i was slowing down too much to play a moving target much longer really my favorite missions lately scarcely engaged any military force you were getting frigging clever is all opined illyan gazing at miless distorted form through the colored glass of his bottle though even a war of maneuver requires a credible force to maneuver with i liked the winning miles said softly that i really liked illyan chucked his bottle into the box with the rest of the empties and leaned over to squint down into the lake water he sighed and got up and adjusted the awning again and pulled up the string bag once more in lieu of fish miles held up his halfempty bottle to repel the offered refill and settled back and watched his still white line descending down and down into secret darkness i always got away with it somehow any way i could on the table or under it i won this seizure thing seems like the first enemy i couldnt outsmart illyan s brows rose quizzically some of the best fortresses were taken at the last by betrayal from within they say i was beaten miles blew thoughtfully across the top of his bottle making it hum yet i survived didnt expect that i feel very unbalanced about that i had to win always or die so what else was i wrong about ill take that other beer now thanks illyan popped the cap for him and handed it over the lake water was getting nicely icy now definitely too late in the year for swimming or drowning maybe said illyan after a very long while generations of fishermen have culled this population of all fish stupid enough to bite hooks s possible miles allowed his guest was getting bored he feared as a proper host he ought to do something about that i dont think there are any fish down there its a scam vorkosigan naw ive seen em if i had a stunner i could prove it to you you walking around these days without a stunner boy not bright hey im an imperial auditor now i get hulking goons to carry my stunners for me just like the big boys anyway you couldnt stun anything through all those meters of water said illyan firmly well not a stunner a stunner power pack ah illyan looked immediately enlightened then more doubtful you can bomb fish can you i didnt realize that oh its an old dendarii hillfolk trick they didnt have time to sit on their asses dangling strings into the water thats a vor perversion they were hungry and wanted their dinners also the lakes lords considered it poaching in their preserve so there was incentive to get in and out quickly before the counts armsmen came riding along after about another minute illyan mentioned i happen to have a stunner on me dear god we let you get out armed oh illyan put down his beer and pulled the weapon from his pocket here i offer it as sacrifice i have to see this trick ah well miles put down his own beer handed his rod to illyan and looked over the stunner regulation issue fully charged he pulled out the power pack and proceeded to bugger the cartridge in the best approved impsec covert ops how to turn your stunner into a hand grenade style he took another swig of beer counted a moment and flipped the power cartridge overboard youd better hope that sinks noted illyan it will see the metallic gleam vanished into the darkness how many seconds asked illyan you never quite know of course thats one of the things that always made that maneuver so damned tricky a half a minute later the darkness was lit by a faint radiant flash a few moments after that a roiling boil of water surfaced beside the boat the noise it made could much better be described as a belch than a boom the boat rocked onshore the impsec guard stood up abruptly and studied them through his powerbinocs miles gave him a cheery beery reassuring wave slowly he sat back down well said illyan peering down into the water just wait about two minutes later a pale gleaming shape shimmered up from below and then another and another two more silvery and sleek popped to the surface goodness said illyan sounding impressed fish he upended his beer bottle respectfully in a toast to miles fish and then some the smallest was half a meter long the largest nearly twothirds of a meter salmon and lake trout including one that must have been lurking down there since miless grandfathers day their eyes were glassy and reproachful as miles leaned precariously overboard and tried to collect them with the net they were cool and slippery and miles almost joined them in their watery grave before he managed to snag them all illyan prudently hung on to one of his ankles as miles swung and splashed their prey made an impressive row laid out on the boat deck scales iridescent in the late afternoon light we have fished illyan announced staring at the mass which almost equaled miless own can we go in now you got another stunner pack no any beer left that was the last then we might as well illyan grinned malignantly i can hardly wait he murmured till somebody asks me what we used for bait miles managed to dock the boat without crashing it despite a desperate need to pee and upanddown sensations that had nothing to do with the waves in the water he listed upslope toward the house lugging the two smaller fish on a line strung through their gills and let illyan struggle with the larger three do we have to eat all these illyan wheezed in his wake maybe one the rest can be cleaned and frozen by whom will ma kosti mind i really dont think you want to offend your cook miles by no means miles stopped and nodded upward what dyou think minions are for anyway martin attracted by the return of the boatand probably about to angle for permission to take it out himselfwas clumping down the path toward them ah martin miles caroled in a tone of voice that would have made the more experienced ivan turn and run just the man i want to see take these to your motherhe unloaded his burden into the appalled young mans armsand do what she tells you to do with em here simon smiling blandly illyan handed over his own dead fishes thank you martin they left martin ruthlessly not even looking back at his plaintive my lord and lurched on up toward the cool stone house the greatest ambition in miless world right now was for a lavatory a shower and a nap in that order it would be enough miles and illyan settled down at dusk to a fish dinner in the lake houses dining room ma kosti had prepared the smallest lake trout which was enough to feed the whole household with a sauce that would have made baked cardboard delectable and rendered the fresh fish a feast for minor gods illyan was clearly amused at this proof of their prowess as primitive providers did you do this often down here feed your whole family once in a great while then i figured out my betan mother who never eats anything but vatprotein if she can help it was munching it down bravely and lying through her teeth about what a good boy i was and i stopped um challenging her culinary preferences i can just picture her illyan grinned dyou want to go out again tomorrow lets at least wait until the leftovers are gone the barn cats may help us out there there are about four of them hanging around the kitchen door right now trying to soften up my cook when last seen they were succeeding miles made his glass of wine last taking tiny sips a great deal of water the nap and some medication had relieved his incipient beerandsun hangover it was a strange and unfamiliar sensation to be truly relaxed not going anywhere on overdrive or at any other speed enjoying the present the now that partakes of eternity martin trundled in not bearing more food miles glanced up my lord comconsole for you whoever it is tell them ill call back tomorrow or next week no it might be the countess landing early or calling from orbit he was ready to face her now he thought who is it says hes admiral avakli oh miles put down his fork and rose at once ill take it thank you martin in the private comconsole chamber off the back corridor of the house avaklis lean face waited above the vid plate a disembodied head miles slid into his seat and adjusted the vid pickup yes admiral my lord auditor avakli nodded my team is ready to make our report we can present it simultaneously to you and general haroche as you requested good when avakli hesitated i would recommend as soon as possible miless belly chilled why do you wish to discuss this over a comconsole no miles licked lips gone dry i understand it will take me about two hours to get back to vorbarr sultana and for this conference hed better allow time to dress we could meet say at hours unless you would prefer first thing tomorrow morning your choice my lord auditor avakli wasnt objecting to a midnight meeting a mild verdict of natural causes did not require such haste miles would get no sleep anyway anticipating this tonight then very good my lord avaklis parting nod was approving miles shut down the comconsole and blew out his breath life had just speeded up again chapter twentyone it was latenightquiet in the impsec hq building the clinics conference chamber seemed almost like a tomb the black vid projection table was ringed by five station chairs ah yet another medical briefing miles was learning these days altogether more than hed ever wanted to know about the insides of peoples heads including his own we seem to be a seat short miles said to admiral avakli nodding toward the table unless you are proposing to have general haroche stand ill fetch another my lord auditor avakli murmured back we werent expecting his eyes shifted to illyan seating himself to the left of the place reserved for miles next to colonel ruibal and across from dr weddell miles had been uncertain about the wisdom of dragging illyan along for this but avaklis obvious unease filled him with a cheery ruthlessness it will save my having to repeat it all to him later miles murmured back and offhand i cant think of a man on the planet with a greater right to know i cant argue with that my lord youd better not avakli went out after the extra chair miles was kitted out in his full brownandsilver house uniform though hed left the military ornaments in his bureau drawer this trip he didnt want the clutter to distract the eye from his auditors chain formally draped across his chest illyan had chosen soft civilian clothing an openthroated shirt loose trousers and jacket giving himself an offduty and convalescent air as a courtesy to his struggling replacement haroche except illyan had worn civvies onduty so often that the message if any was a little ambiguous avakli and haroche arrived back in the briefing room together haroche s lips moved in startlement as he saw illyan illyan turned his head and nodded greetings hello lucas haroches deep voice softened hello sir its good to see you on your feet again though he turned aside and whispered to miles is he going to be all right is he up to this oh yes miles smiled concealing his own clueless state on that score at a brief negating handmovement from haroche the company skipped the exchange of military salutes tonight with illyan present there was perhaps some lingering confusion as to who ought to be saluting whom there was a rustle and creak as they seated themselves serious and attentive admiral avakli remained standing at the vid display podium my lord auditor began avakli general haroche gentlemen chief illyan he gave illyan a special if slightly uncertain nod i dont expect it will come as any real surprise to you that we have found the damage to chief illyans eidetic neural implant to have been an artificially created event haroche vented a long sigh and nodded i was afraid of that i had hoped it would be something simpler miles had hoped such hopes himself on many occasions he couldnt help but sympathize he too had usually been disappointed simple said avakli is the last word id use to describe it were dealing with a case of deliberate sabotage then said haroche avakli sucked on his lower lip that sir is your department i think i prefer to stand by my original wording for the moment an artificially created event to explain this i will now turn you over to dr weddell who wasa slight wrinkle passed over avaklis high browinstrumental in assembling the chain of causality dr weddell if you please by which wrinkle miles deduced weddellcanaba was carrying on as usual brilliantly and obnoxiously if his brilliance ever failed hed doubtless be quite surprised at what a load of retribution his obnoxiousness had bought him but avakli was too honest a scientist to claim anothers achievement as his own weddell took the podium his patrician features weary tense and a little smug if you would like to look at the culpritthe immediate culprit that ishere is its portrait weddell fiddled with the holovid control the plate projected a bright green topologically complex blob which turned slowly in air the color is a computer enhancement of coursei took a little artistic license thereand the magnification several million times that gentlemen is a bioengineered apoptotic prokaryote or so i have reconstructed it a what said miles simplify please weddell flashed a pained smile doubtless searching his mind for words of one syllable miles regretted his last four beers a little bug that eats things weddell essayed by way of further translation not that simplified said miles dryly the barrayarans around the table knowing the power of an imperial auditor cringed at his tone immigrant weddell did not never argue with a pedant over nomenclature it wastes your time and annoys the pedant miles let it go a prokaryote so reconstructed ill get to that in a moment my lord auditor it barely qualifies as a lifeform being smaller and simpler than the smallest bacterium but it does perform two lifefunctions in a manner of speaking it eats specifically it manufactures a proteolytic enzyme that breaks down the protein matrix found in the eidetic chip and several related galactic neuroenhancement applications it destroys that and nothing else and after absorbing the resulting nutrients it reproduces by simple binary fission a population of these prokaryotes presented with a field as it were of chip proteins upon which to graze will double and redouble in the usual geometric progressionup to a point after a number of doublings the prokaryote is programmed to selfdestruct by the time we obtained the chip for analysis almost all of them had done so leaving me a pretty jigsaw puzzle of fragments to play with another week and there would have been nothing left to analyze haroche winced so said miles was this engineered for illyan specifically or is it a commercial product or what your first question i cannot answer but i could read much of its product history off its molecular structure first of all whoever made this did not begin from scratch this is a modification of an existing patented apoptotic organism originally designed to destroy neural plaque the galactic patent code for that perfectly legitimate medical application was still readable on some of the molecular fragments the modified prokaryote however bore no identifications of laboratories of origin licensing or patent markings the original patent is about ten years old by the way which gives you the first point in your timewindow problem that was going to be my next question said miles i hope we can narrow things down more than that of course but you see how much we learn already just from the codes and their absences the original medical prokaryote was pirated for the new purpose and the people who modified it were obviously not concerned with legitimizing it for mass trade it has all the signs of being a oneoff job for a onetime customer illegal jacksonian work by chance asked miles you would know the kind of shortcuts taken in its design strongly suggest it im not personally familiar with it unfortunately not something from bharaputra labs weddellcanabas former employer then that would have been a happy chance but there were a dozen other jacksonian houses who might have taken on small work like this for a fee so how much did this cost to make or rather to have made mm weddell stared thoughtfully into space actual lab costs something under fifty thousand betan dollars who knows what the markup might have been any special demand for secrecy on the part of its purchasers would have driven the cost up oh about fivefold or more depending on what the market would bear not the work of a lone nut then unless he were a fabulously rich lone nut an organization perhaps komarran terrorists sprang to mindthey always did unfortunately could this be cetagandan work asked general haroche oh no i dont think so said weddell its not in their style at all genetically speaking cetagandan work is distinguished by its quality originality and how shall i put it elegance this is by comparison slapdash effective mind you but slapdash on a molecular level illyans lips twisted but he said nothing the selfdestruct sequencing weddell went on could have been a safetycheck simply left over from the original design or it could have been deliberately intended to destroy the evidence can you tell which there were some slight modifications in it compared to the original medical prokaryote it was deliberately left in the design anyway i can give you facts my lord i cannot give you the intentions of unknown persons thats my job right so when was it administered to illyan and how administered is an assumptive term though under the circumstances probably allowable the first gross symptoms of breakdown were when again four weeks ago said haroche at the alldepartments briefing about a week before that actually said miles according to my informant haroche gave him a sharp look really illyan stirred as if about to add something but then kept his peace hm the prokaryote does not reproduce very rapidly much depends on how large a dose was initially introduced yes and how was it done miles put in for that matter how is this stuff stored and transported whats its shelf life does it require any special conditions its stored dry in an encapsulated form at room temperature though it would not be harmed by mild freezing shelf lifeheavens years though its obviously less than a decade old it is activated by wetting presumably upon administration which requires moist contact through mucous membranesit could have been inhaled as a dustinjected as a solution or introduced as a contaminant into a scratch broken skin and moisture would do it it wouldnt have to be a large scratch swallowed most of the prokaryotes would be destroyed by stomach acids it could be done but would require a larger initial dose to be certain enough entered the bloodstream to be carried to the chip so when whats the maximum possible timewindow for exposure cant you use its reproductive rate to calculate when it was administered only crudely thats one of the several variables im afraid my lord administration must have been between ten weeks and one week before the appearance of the first symptoms miles turned to illyan can you remember anything like that illyan shook his head helplessly haroche said is there any way could it is it possible the exposure might have been accidental weddell screwed up his mouth possible who can say likely thats the question and he looked as if he was glad he didnt have to answer it have there beenmiles turned to harocheany reports of anyone else on barrayar who possesses related chip technologies undergoing a mysterious breakdown for that matter did anyone else on barrayar possess a related chip not that i know of said haroche i would like impsec to doublecheck that please yes my lord haroche made a note the jumppilots neural implants use an altogether different system put in avakli thank god he blinked presumably at an inner vision of the chaos that would result from some sort of pilotplague this prokaryote is not communicable by ordinary means weddell assured them rather offhandedly miles thought we must assume a worstcase scenario i think said miles indeed sighed haroche it looks like sabotage to me miles went on pinpoint deliberate knowledgeable and subtle and cruel lord something cruel we now know what and how and some of when but who and why ah the motivations of men again i have touched the elephant and it is very like a what were the six answersrope tree wall snake spear fan we have the method the motive remains obscure you have too many enemies simon and none of them are personal i dont think you werent sleeping with anyones wife or daughter or anything like that that we dont know about were you illyans mouth twisted in bleak amusement alas no miles so it had to be someone who was mad at impsec generally political motivations damn that still leaves too wide a field though they did have money to burn and um patiencehow long would you estimate it took to develop that microbeastie dr weddell laboratory time oh a couple of months unless they paid for a rush job a month at least plus travel time this plot has to have started at least six months ago id think haroche cleared his throat it appears probable that it came from off barrayar id like to know what laboratory it came from and when with your permission my lord auditor ill immediately alert galactic affairs to put their agents onto the jacksonian end of this tangle with an eye to other possible sources for biowork on this orderescobar for example jacksons whole does not possess a complete monopoly on shady deals after all yes please general haroche said miles it was exactly the sort of tedious legwork impsec could do much better than miles a real imperial auditor normally possessed a staff of his own to whom to delegate such jobs hed have to check the reports personally to be sure ah he was going be stuck down in the bowels of impsec hq after all he must be fated and added haroche ill review of all of chief illyans movements for the last say sixteen weeks to five weeks ago i was mostly here at hq said illyan two trips out of the city i think i know i never left barrayar in that time there was gregors state dinner miles pointed out and a few other events you personally supervised yes haroche made another note well need a list of every galactic visitor chief illyan could have physically encountered at those functions the list will be large but finite is there anything else you can do to narrow the timewindow miles asked avakli and weddell weddell spread his hands avakli shook his head and said not with our current data my lord is there anything else at all you can add asked general haroche head shakes all around not without moving into realms of speculation said avakli its such an odd attack said miles targeting illyans function yet not his life im not sure you can rule out murderous intent my lord put in dr ruibal if the chip had not been removed he might well have died eventually of exhaustion or met some accident during his periods of confusion haroche sucked in his breath quite miles thought and if someone was targeting impsec chiefs for assassination haroche could well be next on the list haroche sat up straight gentlemen you have all done an outstanding job my personal commendation will be added to all your secret files as soon as you have your final report ready to turn in you may return to your regular duties tomorrow most probably said avakli can i go home tonight put in weddell my poor laboratory has been in the hands of my assistants for a week i shudder to think of what awaits me upon my return avakli glanced at miles tossing this one his wayyou foisted him on me you deal with him i dont see why not said miles i do want a duplicate copy of the report certainly my lord auditor said admiral avakli and anything else your office generates general haroche of course haroche started to say more then opened his hand to miles my lord auditor you called this meeting miles smiled and rose gentlemen dismissed and thank you all in the corridor outside illyan paused with haroche and miles waited for him well sir haroche sighed youve bequeathed me an ugly puzzle i must say illyan grinned welcome to the hot seat i was telling miles yesterdaythat my first job as chief of impsec was to investigate the assassination of my predecessor the triumph of tradition you were telling me that this afternoon simon you werent murdered at least said haroche ah illyans smile thinned i forgot he glanced at haroche and his voice fell to a murmur that haroche had to bend his head to hear get the bastards for me will you lucas ill do my best sir we all will gravely and despite illyans civilian garb haroche saluted him as they turned to leave miles did not fall asleep easily that night or rather morning despite replacing his expected insomnia of anticipation with what informationindigestion he supposed he turned in his bedsheets and stared into a darkness considerably less opaque than the problem that had just landed in his lap when he had leapt at the chance of playing imperial auditor hed expected it to be exactly that a charade acted out just long enough to spring simon illyan from impsecs clumsy medical clutches not that difficult a task really in retrospect but now now he faced a problem that would give a real auditor with all his staff and support galloping insomnia the hollowness of his office issued to him merely on gregors whim echoed in his head he missed his dendarii backup if hed thought for a minute this appointment was going to go real even temporarily hed have started building a staff of suitable experts raided from though independent of all other barrayaran organizations he knew a number of good fellows from impsec for instance close to their twentyyear anniversaries who might be willing to retire and lend their training to his use study the other auditors staffs and model his from theirs pin lord auditor vorhovis to the nearest wall and not let him go until hed disgorged everything he knew about doing his job a new apprenticeship im doing it backwards again dammit a familiar unfamiliarity youd think id learn so what should he do next or rather first his one piece of physical evidence the bioengineered prokaryote appeared to lead back to jacksons whole if he could trust weddells technical expertise which he did should he go haring off to jacksons whole to supervise the search the thought made him shudder that sort of fieldwork was just the sort of thing to delegate to a team of field agents of the kind hed formerly been himself speaking of expertise so the obvious thing to do was delegate it except if impsec itself was tainted with suspicion if the production of the prokaryote had been a purely commercial enterprise there was no motivation to be found on jacksons whole well maybe revenge admiral naismith had seriously annoyed several jacksonian great houses there on his last visit if theyd finally figured out who he was working for yet house fell which could command the resources for this nasty piece of sabotage had not been seriously discommoded by him house bharaputra which had been more upset was perhaps not crazy enough to start a private war with barrayarthere was no obvious profit in it after all house ryoval which both had the resources and was crazy enough was dismembered baron ryoval dead no the weapon might have come from jacksons whole but the crime had been committed here intuition boy so what was he supposed to do lie in wait trying to ambush his own subconscious hed go quietly mad maybe he needed to give his intuition demon more to chew on stir up impsec stir up your own assassination maybe at least it would be entertaining and less frustrating than this blankness do you really think its an inside job the intuition demon as usual was too coy to give him a straight answer but there was this anyone could go scope out jacksons whole only an imperial auditor could get inside impsec hq solving this puzzle was not going to be a oneman job but it was all too apparent what his part in it must be impsec it is then the crack of noon found miles up fully uniformed in his house brownandsilver and his auditors chain he was sipping the last of his coffee sitting on the padded bench in the blackandwhite paved front vestibule and waiting for martin to bring the counts groundcar around when a commotion arose out in the porte cochere too great to be martinat least miles hadnt heard a crunch as of a groundcar hitting a pillar but there were several groundcars and canopies opening and voices and scuffling footsteps he set down his coffee and stood up to answer the door but it swung open on its own oh of course countess vorkosigan and her retinue had evidently made orbit this morning while he still slept two brownandsilver uniformed armsmen preceded her into the vestibule bowing her inside before turning to salute miles she sailed through the mob of guards secretaries maids servitors drivers porters dependents and more guards like a fine yacht cutting through choppy water and they parted around her like a bow wave spinning aside in little eddies to their various appointed directions she was a tall redhaired woman of quiet presence dressed in something creamcolored and sweeping enhancing the nautical effect well preserved did not do her idiosyncratic beauty justice she was after all betan and in her midsixties had barely reached middleage by that planets standards a secretary tugging at her elbow was waved aside as countess vorkosigan saw her son miles love he abandoned his coffee cup and bowed over her hand trying to shortcircuit a maternal embrace she took the hint saying only my how formal for this hour of the morning im on my way to work miles explained more or less youll enlarge upon that of course she took him by the arm and towed him out of the traffic pattern of arriving luggage that reminded miles of a column of army ants they ducked into the next room the antechamber to the great library her minions carried on competently without her she stood him at arms length and looked him over how are you her smile did not quite conceal an anxious edge coming from her that was a question of potentially dangerous depth he floated a fine thanks really she asked quietly really you actually look better than id expected not so zombielike as in some of your ahem exceedingly brief communiques i had a few bad days right after you know i got over it your father and i almost came home several times im glad you didnt not that im not glad to see you now he added hastily hm i thought that might be how the wind lay i might still have had my head up my ass he admitted ruefully but events intervened youve heard about simon yes but not all about simon though alys has been more helpful than either you or gregor how is he hes fine hes here sleeping in we had a late night last night i think id better let him tell you about it as much as he can he added cautiously hes physically recovered but hes a little well hes a lot vaguer than the simon youre used to im afraid youll figure it out pretty quickly when you talk to him i see she frowned faintly as soon as possible i have a brunch meeting with alys in an hour im extremely anxious to meet laisa so did you succeed in soothing her parents where lady alys says she could not oh alys did a good job of laying the groundwork laisas parents feelings are naturally mixed of course as those toscanes they are understandably excited by the prospect of gaining more influence both for themselves and their company and to their credit for komarr generally theyre mistaken there if thats what they think gregors too conscious of the need to appear evenhanded to do too many open favors for his wifes relations so i gently let them know theyre not without wit i am happy to say their excitement was dampened by a genuine concern for their daughters safety and personal happiness though they are certainly as puzzled how this is to be achieved as any other set of parents she smiled dryly at him was that to his address unquestionably so how is father how did he take all this a shrug of miles s shoulder in no particular direction indicated his new civilian life she cleared her throat mixed feelings mixed reactions he gave me all sorts of logically conflicting assurances for you which i think i shall simply boil down to you have his support always i knew that that wasnt the question exactly was he very disappointed she shrugged in turn we all know how hard you worked for what you had achieved and in the face of what odds she evades the answer dammit she added he was more worried about what would happen to you afterwards left at loose ends one long finger tapped his chain of office this was very clever of gregor i must say the boys growing quite gratifyingly subtle in his maturity waitll simon explains to you what load im expected to tow with this damned chain her brow rose but she did not press him he reflected for a moment upon countess vorkosigans cool maternal style in contrast to the handson attempted arrangements of lady alys versusand it was versus ivan on the whole he found the countesss quiet respect a hell of a lot more daunting than any overt interference could possibly have been one found oneself wishing to be worthy of it the countess played the disinterested observer almost convincingly a style gregor had no doubt learned from her martin stuck his face around the door frame his expression awed as he took in the countess my lord um your cars ready and all the countess waved miles away if you need to go go along ill tackle simon next its going to be my job to prod his formerhe disliked the taste of that formerdepartment it seems haroche has been slow to get into gear on this problem though i dont suppose i can fault impsec for refusing to reason in advance of its data why not they have before often enough now now dont be snide milady mother miles bowed himself out very vorishly she called after him im glad to find you here anyway where else she hesitated then admitted wryly i bet aral that you would choose the little admiral chapter twentytwo miles haunted haroches office for the rest of that day rechecking everything impsec had done since last night and monitoring the new orders flying out he devoured the detailed log of illyans locations and movements for the past three months till he was crosseyed and beginning to be afraid hed miss something haroche patiently endured his nervous kibitzing it would be weeks before anything could come back from the galactic inquiries haroche was concentrating mainly on the jacksons whole connection their one physical lead which exactly suited miless theories or prejudices any sidebranch haroche missed miles pointed out and haroche promptly mended the oversight by the end of the afternoon there seemed nothing more to do with jacksons whole short of miles going there in person an idea that occurred independently to haroche you do seem to have had an extraordinary amount of experience dealing with the jacksonian houses haroche observed mm said miles neutrally concealing the pull of the idea on his own imagination returning to jacksons whole in his new persona of an imperial auditor with all the barrayaran imperial warships he cared to requisition as backup made a delightful little powerfantasy no he said vaguely i dont think so the answer is here inside impsec i just wish i knew how to phrase the question restless and frustrated miles left jacksons whole to the agents assigned there and haroche to himself for a while and set off for a rambling tour of the building hed thought hed memorized impsec hq but there were nooks and crannies hed never penetrated before whole departments hed never neededtoknow well he certainly had the run of the place now he poked into a couple of such offices at random thoroughly alarming their inhabitants then decided to make his tour systematic he would inspect every department from the top floor down not excepting physical plant and food service he left behind a trail of disruption and dismay as every department head frantically searched his conscience for a reason why the imperial auditor might be visiting him ha guilty every one of em miles thought dryly several made a point of explaining their budgetary expenditures in what miles felt was excessive detail though one blurted out a wholly unaskedfor defense of his recent galactic vacation watching these normally closemouthed men babble in panic was highly entertaining miles had to admit he led them on with lots of welltimed neutral noises like um and hm but it seemed to bring him no closer to formulating his right question enough of the departments ran on barrayars whole hour diurnal cycle that miles could have continued his tour all night but in the late evening he broke it off impsec was a big building care not speed was called for now miles woke the next morning to find vorkosigan house full of the unaccustomed bustle of his mothers retainers they were reordering the place whisking away the furniture covers efficiently taking over care of his houseguest illyan and blocking his path with inquiries of what they might do for him mlord as he attempted to wander the place halfdressed thinking and drinking his morning coffee it was the way it should be but still he was inspired to go off to work early as long as he was being official or officious about it all miles decided to begin with a personal report to gregor at the imperial residence in his best auditors style besides gregor might have an idea miles felt particularly empty of ideas just now his auditors style melted rapidly into his usual style once he reached gregors office and they were alone they sat in the comfortable chairs overlooking the garden window and miles put his feet up on the low table and scowled at his boots anything new inquired gregor leaning back in his own chair not so far what has haroche told you gregor rattled off a tolerably complete precis of the midnight meeting and of the orders and inquiries haroches office had disgorged under miless eye yesterday he said illyan was awfully quiet at your briefing gregor added i gather haroche believes that illyans a lot more damaged than he lets on mm illyan thinks he is too im not sure hes damaged so much as he is out of practice its like hes forgotten how to pay attention the inside of his head must be a strange world for him right now i think lady alys could probably give you better observations than haroche on that score so what have you done miles grimaced nothing im stuck twiddling my thumbs till the galactic reports start coming back ive been poking through closets at impsec hq playing inspector general it provides some amusement while i wait and wait youve only been waiting one day its the anticipation are you any happier with haroche now yes in fact hes doing all he should and he learns fast and doesnt make the same mistake well more than twice at most its the situation im not happy with it seems singularly devoid of handles strings there are no loose ends to yank and see what happens or none ive found yet gregor nodded in sympathy youve just started the real investigation yeah miles hesitated this thing has blown up a lot bigger and more complicated than i was anticipating back when i was just being pissed at the way impsec was handling illyans medical treatment its no joke now are you sure you dont want to put a real auditor on the case vorhovis for example vorhovis is still on komarr it would take a week to recall him and i want him there or one of the others what is this funk gregor studied miles through narrowed eyes do you want me to relieve you miles opened his mouth closed it and finally said i thought you should have an opportunity to change your mind i see gregor sucked on his lower lip thank you lord vorkosigan but no i hope youre not making a major mistake gregor but he didnt say it out loud the coffee gregor had ordered upon miless arrival appeared at last borne on a tray not by gregors majordomo but by lady alys vorpatril herself she had laisa toscane in tow gregors face lit are you ready for a break gentlemen lady alys inquired setting the tray down with a flourish and frowning at miless boots he hastily removed his feet from the table and sat up straight yes said gregor holding out his hand to laisa who took it and satsnuggledin beside him miles felt a momentary pang of envy were actually done i think added miles for today my report is theres nothing to report feh a concerned and quizzical halfsmile curved laisas lips gregor and lady alys have told me about illyan i suppose i feel sorry no thats not the right word awed maybe that such an icon has fallen he was such a legend on komarr and yet when i finally met him he seemed just an ordinary fellow hardly that said lady alys well not really ordinary but thats the impression he seemed to want to give so quiet he was not what i expected not a monster laisa was a polite komarran you had to give her credit for that real monsters observed miles answering her thought instead of her words often are just ordinary men only more confused in their thinking illyan was one of the least confused men i know laisa colored faintly on her it looked good she cleared her throat and forged on we actually came in for a reason lord vorkosigan you may as well start calling me miles in private she glanced for approval to gregor who nodded miles she went on lady alys has proposed a reception and dance here at the residence next week for gregors and my particular friends theres nothing political about it for a change or so you can wish but lady alys nodded confirmation if not politically it was certainly socially calculated was this a reward for laisa working so hard to be a good apprentice vor laisa went on wont you come lomiles your duties permitting as a friend to us both miles seated halfbowed to his future empress my duties permitting id be honored it was likely hed have time on his hands then still waiting for the galactic reports and youre welcome to bring a guest of course laisa added she glanced again at gregor and they exchanged one of those maddening private smiles do you have a regular she groped for a proper barrayaran termyoung lady not at this time hm she gave him a speculative look gregor who still held it squeezed her hand if shed had a younger sister miles would have known exactly how to interpret that glance love it seemed was not only contagious it was aggressively contagious miles has proven immune to our vor ladies put in his aunt alys not approvingly good god was she about to give up on trying to alter ivans single state and start in on him instead in sheer frustration laisa looked as if she was trying to work out whether lady alys had meant to imply miles preferred boys without being so rude as to ask or at least not till she was alone again with her mentor not immune miles put in hastily only unlucky so far my former travel schedule was pretty disruptive to romance at home anyway now that im based in vorbarr sultana permanently who knows um maybe ill ask delia koudelka laisa smiled her pleasure id love to see her again alys poured the coffee all around laisa watched carefully she didnt scribble notes but miles bet she would remember next time that he took his black alys led the conversation into lighter concerns for the time it took to drink one cup no refills then rose to usher laisa back out again off to the ladies lavatory to dissect miles in absentia dont be so twitchy boy under alyss tutelage laisa seemed to be making rapid connections with the vor womens world and unlike haroche she did not seem to be underestimating its importance to her future gregor released laisa with obvious reluctance lady alys he added looking thoughtful if you think hes up to it why dont you bring simon to the lunch laisa and i are having with you and lady vorkosigan i find i miss his conversation he caught miless eye and smiled wryly i thought simons conversations with you were mostly reports miles said its rather fascinating to find out what all those reports were displacing all these years lady alys remarked certainly gregor i think it will be good for him she shepherded laisa out miles followed shortly miles continued his selfinflicted inspection of impsec hq where hed left off personally he would have preferred a pinpoint rapier thrust to this bruteforce bludgeoning of the data but when you didnt know what the hell you were looking for you had to look at everything cryptography proved cryptic their overt cooperation turned into a slyly technical explanation of their doings that lost him on the third turn if you cant dazzle em with daring hang em up with horseshit miles smiled through it all and made a mental note to recheck this department again later finance seemed simply delighted that somebody cared and threatened to go on forever miles fought his way clear of the spreadsheets and escaped housekeeping and physical plant proved unexpectedly fascinating miles had known the headquarters building was highly secured but he hadnt realized in detail just how this was accomplished he now learned where all the steelreinforced walls and floors were and just how much thought had gone into questions of blast containment air circulation and filtration and water purification his respect for the buildings late mad architect rose a notch the building wasnt merely designed by a paranoid it was well designed every room had its own biolab grade filtration system in addition to the central unit that filtered and flashcooked all returning air to destroy possible poison gases or microbes before it was recirculated or vented the heat generated was also used to distill the water which explained its peculiar flat taste miles had seen spaceships with systems less tight no colds were going to be transmitted amongpersonnel here the janitorial staff were all serving soldiers veterans of at least ten years standing they were also he discovered the best paid of their classification of any such men in the imperial service morale was high among them once theyd realized his visit implied no criticism of the quality of their work they became not merely cooperative but downright friendly it seemed no inspecting officer had actually been willing to crawl through the ductwork in person with them for quite some time but then most senior inspectors were a lot older stiffer and stouter than miles he also discovered along the way what had to be the most boring job in impsec hqchecking the vid monitors of all the kilometers of ductwork and piping in the building he could only marvel that it had never fallen to his lot before during one of his earlier periods of semidisgrace janitorial was quite pleased with their imperial auditor by the time he reluctantly departed and vice versa their combination of competence and camaraderie put him in mind for a brief and breathtakingly painful moment of the dendarii till his mind shied away from the comparison his busyness blocked excessive morbid reflection on the general weirdness of his current situation on the whole miles thought he preferred it that way he was an impsec outsider a civilian for the first time in his adult life and yet he was obtaining a better view of the organization hed so passionately served than hed ever had before was this some sort of final goodbye enjoy it while it lasts conscienceprodded he broke off early enough that night to actually go home and have dinner with his mother and illyan a welcome touch of human civility he successfully kept the conversation focused on the progress of the imperial colony on sergyar about which indeed the countess had much of interest to tell he returned to hq early the next morning and breathed down haroche s neck for a bit till haroche began once more to wistfully enumerate the benefits of a jaunt to jacksons whole miles grinned and continued his inspection miless visit to analysis took the most time that day among other things he stopped in to talk with galeni and with the analysts now assigned to this internal impsec problem they too were mostly waiting for the return of galactic reports he checked on the men working other problems as well the high priority of illyans chip sabotage did not mean that all other crises went on hold miles had a long and interesting chat with komarran affairs chief general allegre which understandably tended to turn to gregors betrothal a topic miles had carefully avoided with galeni miles wondered if it would be worth a trip at least as far as komarr to talk in person with allegres counterpart in galactic affairs stationed there colonel olshansky in sergyaran affairs inquired politely after the countess miles invited him to dinner with her a courtesy the colonel seemed to find a bit daunting but which he accepted with alacrity what miles had been thinking of as the dessert of his inspection thus fell not by accident the last thing that afternoon the impsec evidence rooms were sited in the subsubbasement occupying the chambers of the old prison blockchambers of horrors miles had always thought of them the block had been the best modern dungeon in mad emperor yuris blatant last days with a distinctly medical flavor that miles found more chilling than dripping walls and spiderwebs and chains and scuttling vermin emperor ezar had used it too much more discreetly for his political prisonersstarting with yuri s own gaolers a grace note of cosmic justice in a generally ruthless reign miles felt it was one of the better quiet achievements of his fathers regency that the sinister prison had then been converted into effectively a museum it really ought to feature a lifelike tableau in wax of old mad yuri and his goon squads but as evidence storage rooms went it had to be one of the most secure on the planet it now housed all the most interesting trinkets and toys impsec had collected in the course of its many investigations the several rooms were stuffed with documentation weapons biologicalswell sealed miles trusteddrugs and even more bizarre items confiscated from the evil and the unlucky awaiting prosecutions further investigations or reclassification and culling as obsolete matter he fancied a meditative visit to the weapons room it had been a couple of years since hed last been down here bringing home some interesting goodies from one of his dendarii missions on one of the back shelves hed discovered a corroded metal crossbow and some emptied soltoxin gas canisters they were the last physical remains aside from himself of the poisoning attempt upon the thennew imperial regent lord aral vorkosigan and his pregnant wife thirty years and a few months ago alpha and omega boy beginnings and endings the sergeant in charge at the front desk sited in the old prisonerprocessing chamber at the sections only entrance was a pale young man with the mild air of a monastic librarian he shot up out of his comconsole station chair when miles entered and stood at attention obviously uncertain whether to bow or salute he ducked his head by way of compromise my lord auditor how may i assist you sit down relax and cycle me in i want a tour miles told him certainly my lord auditor he reseated himself as miles experienced in the procedures approached the desk and laid his palm on the readpad and stretched his neck to catch the retina scan he smiled a little gratefully at miles for thus relieving him of having to decide whether an imperial auditor was above standard security or not and if not how the devil he was to attempt to enforce his rules his relief was shortlived as his panel lights blinked red and his comconsole made disapproving noises my lord you are explicitly listed as notcleared by order of general haroche what miles trod around the comconsole desk to look over his shoulder ah check the date thats a leftover from a few weeks back if it bothers you call haroches office and get the change authorized ill wait nervously the sergeant did so while he was negotiating with haroches secretary who sped the authorization back along with an apology the moment he understood the problem miles stared at the flat readout screen projected above the vid plate it listed the dates and times of every visit hed ever made down here going back nearly a decade together with codes for the items hed carried in and out mostly in there was the safely lobotomized zvegan smart bomb ah yes and those strange cetagandan genetic samples now undergoing further investigation under the aegis of dr weddell he suspected and what the hell miles leaned closer excuse me this comconsole lists me as visiting the evidence room twelve weeks ago it was the date of his return from his last dendarii mission in fact the fatal day illyan had been out of town the time logged was right after hed reported in to and out of illyans office about the time hed been walking home in fact his eyes widened and his teeth snapped shut how interesting he hissed yes my lord said the sergeant were you on duty that day i dont remember my lord id have to check the roster um why do you ask sir because i didnt come down here that day or any other day since year before last youre listed sir i see that miles grinned his lips peeling back hed found what hed been subliminally looking for the last three days all right and tight the loose end this is either the jackpot or a trap i wonder which so was he meant to find it was he meant to find it now could any seer have predicted this subterranean visit assume nothing boy just go on carefully open a secured channel to ops on your comconsole he told the sergeant i want captain vorpatril and i want him now ivan made good time coming over from the operations building on the other side of the city by luck miles had caught him on a day he hadnt skinned out of work early miles sitting on the edge of the evidence room entry ports comconsole desk one booted leg swinging smiled grimly at ivans entrance shaking off his impsec internal escortyes yes see im not lost you can go away now thank you the evidence room sergeant and his supervisor a lieutenant waited on the lord auditors pleasure the lieutenant was green and shaking ivan took one look at miless face and his brows rose so lord auditor coz did you find some fun do i look cheerful more like manic its a joy ivan an absolute joy the impsec internal security system is lying to me tricky that said ivan cautiously whats it saying it thinks i visited the evidence room here on the day of my return from my last mission furthermore the entry desk log upstairs has been altered to matchit lists me as having left the building half an hour later than i really did the security records at vorkosigan house still show the actual time of my arrival thoughjust enough time in the gap for me to have taken a groundcar home except that i walked that day furthermoreand this is the creamthe evidence rooms internal vid monitor cartridge for that day was found to be guess what ivan glanced at the obviously distraught impsec lieutenant missing got it in one ivans face screwed up why why indeed the very question i propose to answer next i suppose this could be totally unconnected with illyans sabotage want to take a side bet nope ivan stared at him glumly does this mean i need to cancel my dinner plans yes and mine too call my mother and give her my apologies but i wont be home tonight then sit down here at this desk he pointed to the sergeants station chair the sergeant scrambled out of it i declare this evidence room sealed let no one in ivan no one at all without my auditors authorization you twohis arm swung to point at the two impsec men who flinchedare my witnesses that i personally did not enter the storage areas today he added to the lieutenant tell me about your inventory procedures the lieutenant swallowed the comconsole records are continually updated of course my lord auditor we do physical inventory once a month it takes a week and the last one was done when two weeks ago anything turn up missing no my lord anything missing in the last three months no the last year no do the same fellows always do the inventory it rotates its not a popular chore ill bet not miles glanced at ivan ivan while youre sitting here call ops and requisition yourself four men with top security clearances who have never worked for or with impsec theyre going to be your team ivans face screwed up in dismay oh god he groaned youre not going to make me inventory the whole damned thing are you yes for obvious reasons i cant do it myself somebodys planted a red flag here with my name on it if they wanted my attention theyve certainly got it biologicals too the cold room too ivan shuddered all of it what will i be looking for if i knew that we wouldnt have to do an inventory now would we what if instead of something taken out something was added what if its not a lead youve got hold of but a fuse ivan asked his hand flexed in nervous pantomime then i trust you will stamp it out he gestured the two impsec men into his wake come with me gentlemen were going to go see general haroche haroche too came on the alert the minute he saw miless face as miles and his little train marched into his office haroche sealed his doors behind them shut down his comconsole and said what have you found my lord approximately twentyfive minutes of revised history your comconsoles have been buggered haroches face grew unhappy indeed as miles explained his discovery of the added time with corroboration from the evidence room supervisor it darkened further with the news about the missing vid record can you show where you were he asked when miles had finished prove you walked home miles shrugged possibly i passed plenty of people in the street and i am ah a bit more memorable than the average man scrounging for witnesses ages after the fact is the sort of thing the municipal guard has to do all the time investigating their civil crimes i may put them on it if it seems necessary but as an imperial auditor my word is not on trial yet er right miles glanced at the evidence room men gentlemen will you wait for me in the outer office please go nowhere and speak to no one he and haroche waited until theyd cleared the room then miles continued what is certain at this point is that you have a mole in your internal security systems now i can play this one of two ways i can shut impsec down entirely while i bring in outside experts to check them there are certain obvious disadvantages to this method haroche groaned a slight understatement my lord yes taking all of impsec offline for a weekor morewhile people unfamiliar with your system attempt to learn and then check it seems to me an invitation to disaster but running an internal check using internal personnel also has um obvious drawbacks any ideas haroche rubbed his forehead i see your point suppose suppose we set up a team of men to do the checking at least three who must work together at all times they watch each other that way one mole i must grant but three chosen at random they can freeze the system in sections with the minimum disruption to impsecs ongoing duties if you like i can give you the list of qualified personnel and you can select the men yes said miles slowly that works good do it haroche breathed obvious relief im grateful you are reasonable about this my lord im always reasonable haroches lip twitched but he didnt argue he sighed this thing is growing uglier all the time i despise internal investigations even if you win you lose but what i confess i dont understand this business with the evidence room what do you make of it miles shook his head it looks like its meant to be a frame but most frames come with pictures in them this ones empty its all very backwards i mean usually you start with the crime and deduce the suspects im having to start with the suspect and deduce the crime yes but who would be fool enough to try to frame an imperial auditor it seems just short of insane miles frowned and paced the room back and forth in front of haroches desk how many times had he paced like this in front of illyan as theyd hammered out his mission plans that depends i want your systems analysts to look particularly for this that depends on how long this thing has been sitting down there in the evidence room comconsole it was a buried mine set to go off only when touched when were the changes made in the records i mean it could have been any time between the day i arrived downside and this morning but if they were done more than a few weeks backsomebody maybe didnt think they were framing an imperial auditor i dont see how they could have foreseen my getting that appointment when i didnt myself they were framing bluntly a cashiered junior officer who had departed impsec under a cloud the obscure son of a famous father and some kind of demimutant to boot i might have been tailormade to be an easy target then i dont like being a target im downright allergic to it anymore haroche shook his head in wonder you confound me lord vorkosigan i believe im finally beginning to understand why illyan always why illyan what miles prodded after a long moment a lopsided smile lightened haroches heavy face came out of your debriefings swearing under his breath and then promptly turned around and sent you out again on the stickiest assignments he had miles essayed a short ironic salaam in haroches direction thank you general chapter twentythree ivan found it two hours before dawn not quite by chance it was in the fifth aisle of the second room hed tackled weapons iv hed placed biologicals poisons and the cold room last on his list for this very contingency in the hope that he might not have to do them at all miles would have chosen to knock off the worst rooms first sometimes he had to admit ivan was not such an idiot as he feigned ivan trod out to the reception area miles had been crosschecking the inventory lists on the comconsole there for the last several hours ever since hed overseen haroches threeman security systems analysis team selected and put to work upstairs im in a weapons room right ivan demanded waving his inventory sheaf of plastic flimsies miles tore his attention away from the chemical description of the ninehundredandninth item in alphabetical order in the poisons room ophidian scrapings polian three grams if you say so right so whats a little box labeled komarran virus doing on aisle five shelf nine bin twentyseven what the hell is it and shouldnt it be in biologicals did somebody misclassify it im not unsealing the damned thing till you find out what it is it might make me break out in green fungus or bloat up like those poor suckers with the sergyaran worm plague or worse the worm plague has to have been the most disgusting in recent history miles agreed but it wasnt very lethal as plagues go let me look was it on the weapons room listing oh yes right where it should be they think so its got to be a weapon maybe miles marked his place and refiled the poisons list hed been examining on the evidence rooms library comconsole and pulled up that of the weapons section instead the komarran virus had a code classification that blocked access to its description and history to any but men of the very highest security clearances impsec hq was crammed with such men miles smiled slightly and overrode the lockout with his auditors seal he hadnt read more than the first three lines before he began to laugh very softly he would swear but he couldnt think of any invective foul enough what snapped ivan craning around to peer over miless shoulder not a virus ivan somebody in classification needs a lecture from dr weddell its a bioengineered apoptotic prokaryote a little bug that eats things specifically neurochip proteins the prokaryote illyans prokaryote its no danger to you at all unless youve acquired a neurochip i dont know about oh god this is where it came from or rather this is where it came from last he settled in and began to read ivan hanging over the back of his station chair knocked his hand aside when he tried to advance screens before ivan had finished too this was it hidden in plain sight buried in an inventory of tens of thousands of other items it had been sitting here demurely in bin twentyseven shelf nine collecting dust for nearly five years ever since the day it was delivered to the impsec evidence room by an officer from komarran affairs it had been picked up at that time by imperial counterintelligence right here in vorbarr sultana on an arrestsweep of komarran terrorist cells associated with the late ser galen killed on earth while trying to launch his last complicated dramatic and futile plot for bringing down the barrayaran imperium and freeing komarr the plot for which galen had created miless clonebrother mark oh hell said ivan has your damned clone got something to do with this brother corrected miles swallowing the same fear i dont see how hes been on beta colony for almost the last halfyear my betan grandmother can confirm it if you want confirmation said ivan then you must be thinking what im thinking could he have been pretending to be you again not without going on one hell of a crash diet ivan grunted halfassent could be done with the right drugs i dont think so i promise you the last thing mark wants is to be me ever again ill have his whereabouts formally checked anyway just to stop everyone from galloping down a blind alley the impsec office at the embassy on beta colony keeps him in their sights just because mark is who he is miles read on the jacksonian connection was quite real too the chipeating prokaryote had indeed been made to order there for the komarran terrorists by one of the houses minor more usually known for its tailored drugs and illyan had been its intended target from the beginning the disruption of impsec had been timed to coincide with the assassination of thenprime minister count aral vorkosigan the impsec investigation of five years ago had traced the prokaryote right back to its building of origin and the komarran payment to the jacksonian biochem teams bank accounts the new search just launched must sooner or later turn up the exact same data later if they had to totally reconstruct the first tedious investigation sooner if the organization overcame its collective amnesia and spotted the data in its own files three to eight weeks depending miles estimated this explains the frame at least miles muttered ivan cocked an eyebrow how so i came at it in the wrong order my ersatz visit here was meant to be found yes inevitably but it wasnt meant to be found first this data miles waved at the comconsolewhen it finally arrived here would have focused attention on the evidence rooms instead of starting with the comconsole records and then checking the inventory the investigators would have begun with bin twentyseven and then checked the security records of people going in and out where they would have been quite pleased with themselves for finding me a recently cashiered officer with no business here gone at that way it would have been a much more convincing frame miles sat for a moment ordering his thoughts then he called impsec forensics and requisitioned the senior officer on call after that he put through a call to dr vaughn weddells home console the machine blocked him and tried to take a message weddell didnt care to have his beauty sleep interrupted it appeared he tried once more with the same results waited a full three seconds to recover his patience and then called the imperial guards miles had the duty officer dispatch a couple of their largest uniformed men to weddells flat with instructions to wake him up by whatever means were required and bring him at once to impsec hq carried bodily if necessary it still seemed an eternityalmost dawn outside miles gaugedbefore miles had his team assembled and marched them all before him into weapons room iv weddell was still whining under his breath about being awakened so rudely in the middle of the night as long as he prudently kept his complaints sotto voce miles chose to ignore them neither he nor ivan had gotten any sleep at all not that miles was the least tired right now the forensics man was given first crack at the exterior of the little sealed biocontainer its been moved a few times he reported some fingerprints some smudges none very fresh he duly recorded them by laserscan for crossmatch with evidence rooms personnel and the rest of the population of the empire if necessary the screamersignal circuit to detect the containers removal from the evidence rooms has never been activated no hairs or fibers i wouldnt expect much dust given the air filters here thats all i can say its all yours gentlemen he stepped back ivan stepped forward drew the box from its shelf and positioned it on the lighted examination board brought in for the purpose the box was sealed with the simplest of numeric codelocks designed more to keep it from popping open if accidentally dropped than for any real securityfor one thing the accesscode was listed right in the inventory description ivan referred to the flimsy and tapped in the sequence the little lid swung up right drawled ivan peering inside and then at his inventoryflimsy again the box was lined with a shockproof gelpack scored by six parallel slots three slots were filled with tiny brown capsules small enough for a child to swallow the other three were empty six sealed vectordelivery unitsthats what theyre called on here anywayto start with one taken out for examination five years ago and listed as destroyed five supposedly leftonly now there are three he opened his hand with a flourish the forensics man again stepped forward and bent over the box to begin checking the seal from the inside right right miles howled inwardly with a small mental reservation for that one capsule removed five years back that was going to complicate things but perhaps the laboratory records would help once retrieved you mean moaned weddell i racked my brains for a week reassembling that damned crap and a whole undamaged sample was sitting downstairs all that time yep miles grinned i hope you like irony not at this hour of the morning the forensics man looked up and reported the lock has never been forced all right miles said the box goes to forensics for a full examination ivan i want you to go with it dont let those weasels up there sneak it out of your sight weddell you take one of those samples for a molecular analysisi want you to confirm itis the same crap you flushed out of illyans chip and i want to know anything else you can figure out about it it and you dont leave the buildingyou can have the same lab in the clinic again and any supplies you care to requisition but no oneno onebut you is to touch the sample you report to no one but me the last two units go back into the new box on the shelf locked under my auditors seal i trust it will stay there this time though im beginning to think it would be safer in my pocket haroche the rat had gone home to sleep last night after the systems team was assigned an hour after midnight while waiting for his return miles took a break for breakfast in the impsec hq cafeteria this was a mistake he realized catching himself dozing off into his coffee mug he dared not stop somehow getting started again was a lot harder than it used to be he was yawning in haroches outer office when the impsec chief entered also yawning haroche blearily swallowed his yawn and motioned miles to follow into his inner sanctum miles pulled up a chair and sat as haroche settled behind his desk so lord vorkosigan any progress oh yes rapidly miles brought haroche up to speed on the events of the last hours haroche hunching forward on the edge of his station chair wasnt yawning by the time he finished damn haroche breathed leaning back again damn there goes the last hope of this being anything other than an inside job im afraid so so now we have another list how many men could have known the samples were down there five years worth of evidence rooms inventory teams for starters miles said the men who captured and delivered it haroche added and anyone working here at the time who might have been close friends with the men who captured and delivered it miles began to tick off the count on his hands he wondered if he was going to have enough fingers it was filed under the seal of the komarran affairs chief who preceded allegre allegre himself was still working on komarr itself at that time as the local section head i checked also any komarrans in those revolutionary groups who escaped capture at the time or who were imprisoned and have been recently released people they might have talked to in prison that list had better be checked too i suppose though as you say the comconsole tampering compels me to believe its an inside job too haroche made a note right not a short list yet im afraid by any means no though its a lot shorter than the three planets full of people we started with miles hesitated then added reluctantly i dont know if my brother lord markmy clone that isknew about this stuff or not it will be necessary to check i suppose haroches gaze rose to meet miless his expression arrested do you suppose not physically possible miles asserted mark has spent the last six months on beta colony been to school every day since the term began i hope his whereabouts are eminently provable hm haroche reluctantly subsided do you remember anything about that period i was still assistant domestic affairs sectionchief it was just before my last promotion i remember the flurry of activity over komarrans in vorbarr sultana the case that had riveted domestics attention right about then had to do with an antigovernment group in vorsmythes district suspected of trying to import proscribed weapons ah well i hope your data boys can help triangulate this miles went on whoever did this must have had recent access to impsecs internal systems plus a lot of wit and nerve the short list is going to consist of the men who are on both lists why are you assuming its only one man asked haroche oh miles deflated right thank you haroche miles reminded himself was not without experience in this sort of thing not that i wouldnt prefer it that way admitted haroche id much rather find myself dealing with one than a conspiracy mm but one man or a group the motivation is growing complex why me why was i picked to be the goat is there some special hatred at the bottom of this or was it chancewas i simply the only impsec officer to be cashiered in the right timewindow if i may presume to advise you my lord motivations are a slippery thing in this sort of business too wispily cerebral i always got further faster following the facts you can spin theories about motivation later over your victory beer when you know who youll know why i admit thats a philosophical preference when i know why ill know who its true there may be nothing personal in it as soon as the crime was discovered to be a crime the the i cant call him a killer i suppose haroche halfsmiled not happily were short a body for one thing illyan for all his new vagueness was hardly a zombie but miles remembered that hoarse distraught voice begging him earnestly for a clean death the assassin he went on was absolutely required to supply a goat to take the heat off himself because this is not a case that can ever be closed except by being solved no hold pending further data till its dusty and forgotten this time he had to know impsec would never rest youre damned right haroche growled that crap downstairs was carefully arranged to be found because it was inevitable once the hunt was up too many records existed in too many places for it to just be made to disappear all ive done miless voice slowed was alter the timetable three days haroche smiled crookedly you went through all of impsec in just three days not all of impsec just the headquarters building and it was more like four days still somebody must be squirming i hope if they meant to hook exlieutenant vorkosigan and instead got lord auditor vorkosigan it must have felt like putting in your line for a trout and pulling up a shark i may have arrived just in time downstairs after all given the several more weeks of lead time he was expecting our assassin might well have thought to yank his plant in the evidence room and try something else god id love to know who hates me and works here could lieutenant vorberg have found out who admiral naismith really was vorberg couldnt possibly be so twisted as to destroy illyan just to destroy miles could he surely i was a secondary target he had to be a secondary target the alternative was too horrible to think about nonetheless youve made extraordinary progress lord vorkosigan said haroche ive cracked cases which started with far less data than what youve uncovered its good solid work miles tried not to be too pleased with haroches measured praise though he felt his face warm anyway haroche was such a contained man his brief words were clearly the meaningful sort men might strive to win surely it was not disloyal to illyan to hope his successor might yet grow to fill his place not the same but as well its a shame haroche sighed that so many men in impsec hq are fastpentaproofed its much too early to think of starting to pull out peoples fingernails said miles nibbling on one of his own tempting as it is i suppose that we now wait on the reports from your systems analysis team i suppose another yawn cracked his facethat i might as well go home and get some sleep while i wait call me the minute they have anything to report please yes my lord auditor oh hell will you just call me miles everyone else does this lord auditor stuff is only fun for the first twenty minutes after that its just work not quite true but haroche gave him wave that nearly qualified as an analysts salute as he departed martin returned miles to the front door of vorkosigan house in the midmorning seductive visions of his soft bed filled his head dutifully he went first to find his lady mother and say goodmorning or goodnight two or three retainers conflicting directions eventually brought him to one of the downstairs sitting rooms on the east side filled with unusually pleasant morning light for this chill early winter the countess was sipping coffee and leafing through an old leatherbound tome miles thought he recognized from lady vorpatrils imperial wedding history assignment the one that he had ducked better her than me hello love she answered his greetings she indulged herself by planting a maternal kiss upon his forehead he stole a gulp of her coffee you were out late any progress on your case i think so the first crack anyway miles decided not to disturb her morning by explaining that the first crack consisted of discovering himself being framed for the crime ah i wasnt sure if the abstracted look was that or lack of sleep both im on my way to bed but i want to talk to illyan first is he up yet do you know i think so pym just took him up his breakfast breakfast in bed halfway to noon what a life i think hes earned it dont you the hard way he sucked up some more of her coffee and rose to go upstairs oh knock first she advised him as he passed the doorway why hes having breakfast with alys that explained the book lady alys had delivered it he wondered what piece of vorish history she was making poor illyan read as advised he knocked politely on the door of the secondfloor guest suite no response he knocked again pym had not lingered to serve the breakfast it appeared because instead of the retainer opening it illyans voice finally floated through the wood who is it miles i have to talk to you just a minute the minute became two or three or four as he leaned against the door frame and scuffed his boot on the patterned carpet he knocked again cmon simon let me in dont be so impatient miles his aunts voice admonished him firmly its a bit rude he closed his teeth on a snappish reply and scuffed the carpet some more and fingered his auditors chain and while he was about it unfastened the high collar of his brownandsilver tunic some shuffling and clinking noises came from within and a low laugh at long last lady alyss light step approached the door a click as she unlocked it and it swung aside good morning aunt alys he said dryly good morning miles she responded much more cheerfully than hed been expecting she waved him inside to the sitting room the cluttered breakfast tray was jammed onto the little table in the bay window overlooking the back garden only crumbs left alas lady alys was dressed oddly formally for this hour of the day miles thought in a gown more suitable for dinner than breakfast and was apparently experimenting with her hairstyle it was loose brushed in burnished black and silver waves down her back illyan appeared from the direction of the bathroom shrugging on a tunic over his shirt and trousers and still wearing bedroom slippers good morning miles he echoed lady alys right down to the repellent morningperson chirp in his voice his smile faded as he took in miles s rumpled upallnight look his tone flattened whats happening i found some very interesting things at impsec hq last night progress two steps forward three sideways um he frowned at his aunt wondering how to throw her out politely she failed to take a hint instead seating herself on the little sofa beside the table and attending to him with sharpened interest illyan sat beside her miles decided cravenly to let illyan do the dirty work this is all highly classified or its going to be he waited a beat while they both looked at him do you really think its appropriate for lady alyss ears he added bad choice of phrasing illyan merely replied certainly out with it miles dont keep us in suspense well if illyan thought it was all right miles took a breath and began a fastforward description of his last daycycles investigation at impsec neither of his listeners interrupted him though lady alys muttered good for ivan when he got to the description of finding their prize needle in the haystack of weapons room iv illyans cheerful air had vanished altogether he sat tensely lady alys watched his profile in concern and took his hand he squeezed hers in turn what i need to know miles finished is if you remember anything anything at all about the time that sample was brought in during the thwarting of that last komarran fling illyan rubbed his forehead its pretty blank i remember ser galens plot of course and that initial horrific fuss over discovering the existence of lord mark the countess was very upset in her most betan style drove your father to distraction i remember your report from earth a masterpiece of its literary genre that sector four adventure where you smashed both your arms was right after that right yes but surely someone must have reported on the prokaryote to you i can see why you might not have risked inspecting it in person im sure someone did illyans right hand released lady alyss and clenched into a fist they doubtless gave me all the details and i doubtless put them where i always put the details but theres nothing left now lady alys frowned irritatedly at miles as if it were somehow all his fault who ought to have given you that report miles pushed on general diamant i suppose komarran affairs chief before allegre you remember him died just two years after he retired the poor sod miles i really cant i would surely have been reminded before this if it were in here he clutched his head in frustration lady alys recaptured his hand and stroked it soothingly does your friend captain galeni have any ideas illyan went on more calmly he might have some inside track it was his fathers plot after all miles smiled unhappily illyans eyes narrowed you know hes going to turn up on your short list as soon as its generated yes did you tell haroche no why not it would have been redundant duv will be checked along with everyone else and ive done him enough bad turns lately arent you prejudging your datamy lord auditor yow know galeni not so well as you do just so im not judging data at all here im judging the mans character motivations if you like hm said illyan just watch your own motivations there old son yes yes i know i not only have to be impartial i have to appear so you taught me that one he added rather nastily in a way im not likely to forget i did when never mind he pressed the bridge of his nose he was not only exhausted he was getting a fatigue headache it was time to quit for the night or hed be unable to function properly on the next round all right he sighed last thing do you remember at any time in the last four months anyone ever giving you a small brown capsule to swallow no theres two missing he might have taken one himself at the same time right along with you whoever he was no illyan sounded more certain than usual i havent taken any medication in the past thirty years except what my personal physician gives me with his own hands miles recalled haroches morethanoneman theory it might even have been your own physician its the small brown capsule im trying to track illyan shook his head miles levered himself up and made polite farewells and staggered off to bed he woke in the midafternoon and spent a futile halfhour trying to return to sleep while his mind worried his new problems he gave up rose and checked in with haroche by comconsole the systems analysis team had not yet offered their report a call to weddell in the impsec clinic labs elicited mostly snarls at the interruption but also a promise of more information soon soon but not yet his restless prowling around his room was interrupted in turn by a call from a very bleary ivan who reported the original biocontainer box had been duly examined and returned by forensics and could he for gods sakes give the damn thing to somebody else and go offduty and go to bed now miles flinched guiltily glad ivan could not detect sleep on his breath over a comconsole and ordered him to return the box to the guardianship of the evidence rooms and take the rest of the day off he was just stepping into the bath when his comconsole chimed again this time it was dr chenko from the imperial military hospitals veterans clinic lord vorkosigan chenko ducked his head in cheery greetings my apologies for taking so long these microengineering challenges always prove a little more complex in the execution than the planning but weve worked up a device small enough to insert under your skull to we hope safely trigger your seizures and were finally ready to test it on you if it works properly we can go ahead with the final calibrations and schedule surgery to install it oh said miles good work bad timing when can you come in tomorrow haroche might call with the systems teams report at any time and when that happened miles suspected things would start to move very quickly and somewhere in vorbarr sultana was a very clever impsectrained man who had made miles his special target did chenkos experimental gizmo use any protein circuits and what had happened to that missing capsule the thought of people he didnt know very well installing devices he didnt understand into his brain gave him cold chills just now i probably not tomorrow ill have to get back to you on scheduling doctor chenko looked disappointed have you had any more episodes since the one we forced in the lab not so far hm well id advise you not to wait too long my lord i understand ill do my best and avoid stress chenko added as an afterthought as miles reached for the disconnect thank you doctor miles growled at the empty vid plate he was halfway through his shower when he suddenly recalled that this was the night of laisas party his attendance had been just short of imperially commanded and his duties it appeared were going to permit at the very least it would be well to seize the chance beforehand to get in an interim report to gregor all he needed was to dredge up a dance partner he dressed carefully and called delia koudelka hi he greeted her blondness at least he didnt get a crick in his neck looking up over a comconsole what are you doing tonight im rather busy she responded politely why do you ask oh damn his own fault for waiting till the last minute and just assuming orthis doesnt have anything to do with your imperial auditor thing does it she added in worry a vision of a splendid opportunity to abuse his new powers danced in his head briefly regretfully he pushed it aside no just a milesthing sorry she said sounding sincere um is martya in shes busy tonight too im afraid and olivia her too ah well thanks anyway whatever for she cut the com chapter twentyfour miless verbal report to gregor made them both late for the party gregor had dozens of questions most of which miles could not yet answer he chewed on his lip in frustration as they paused in the shadowed vestibule opening onto one of the imperial residence s smaller reception rooms it was already bright and crowded with people in the chamber next to it visible through arched doors thrown open a small orchestra was tuning up colonel lord vortala the younger in charge of the residences security tonight had escorted miles and the emperor there personally vortala who looked both neat and harried simultaneously now saluted and broke away back into the hallway already answering some subordinate though his headset its hard to get used to not having illyan at my back sighed gregor staring after him though vortalas doing a fine job he added hastily he glanced down at miles try not to look so grim even without your auditors chain it will make people curious what weve been up to and then well both have to spend the rest of the evening trying to squelch gossip miles nodded same goes for you he couldnt think of any good or even awful jokes just at the moment think of laisa he advised gregors face lightened right up smiling dryly in turn miles followed him into the chamber there they completed gregors happiness by finding dr toscane under lady alyss wing as usual countess vorkosigan also stood with them chatting amiably oh good said the countess here they are gregor captured laisas hand and placed it on his arm possessively she smiled up at him with starry eyes the countess continued alys now that her proper escort is here why dont you let me play baba for a while you ought to relax and enjoy yourself at one of these things for a change a slight inclination of her head miles followed the nod to notice illyan quite sharp in a dark and unusually well cut civilianstyle tunic and trousers yet managing by pure habit to look notquitethere as if light parted to flow around him thank you cordelia murmured lady alys after gregor greeted his former security chief and they exchanged some standard howareyoufeeling fine sire youlookwell party chat alys determinedly bore illyan off before he could slip back into any land of attempted workmode his convalescence does seem to be going well said gregor watching this byplay in approval you can thank lady alys for that countess vorkosigan told him your son too so i understand miles bowed slightly and not altogether ironically he glanced after illyan and his aunt who were apparently heading for the refreshment tables not that im intimately familiar with the contents of illyans closet but theres something different about the way hes dressed i swear conservative as hell as always but countess vorkosigan smiled lady alys finally persuaded him to let her recommend a tailor his taste or lack of it in clothing has made her tear her hair for years i always thought it was part of his impsec persona blandly invisible that too certainly gregor and laisa began comparing what they had been doing for the interminable four hours since theyd last met a conversation mainly absorbing to its principals miles having spotted ivan across the room left them together under his mothers indulgent eye ivan was escorting martya koudelka ah ha martya was a younger shorter and tawnier version of delia though no less striking in her own way she wore something pale green tonight in a shade perfectly calculated to complement imperial dress uniforms as miles neared them martya poked her partner and said ivan you twit stop watching my sister you asked me to this dance remember yes but i asked her first you were too slow off the mark serve you right if i step on your boots and spoil the shine she glanced aside at miles and added to him im going to be so glad when delia finally picks someone and moves out im getting as tired of handmedown men as i am of handmedown clothes as well you should be milady miles bowed over her hand and kissed it that got ivans attention he repossessed martyas hand and patted it soothingly sorry he apologized but his eyes shifted left for one more surreptitious glance miles looked too and spotted the bright blond head at once delia koudelka was seated on one of the little sofas next to duv galeni they were apparently sharing the plate of hors doeuvres balanced on galenis knee the dark head and the blond bent together for a moment then delia laughed galenis long teeth flashed in one of his more saturnine smiles galenis knee was touching delias miles noted with unexpectedly keen interest a servitor with a tray of glasses circulated near would you care for a drink ivan asked martya yes please but not that red stuff white please ivan departed in pursuit of the servitor and martya confided to miles when i dribble it on myself it wont show that way i dont know how delia does it she never spills anything some days i feel like shes practicing to be lady alys galeni hadnt mentioned he would be herewith deliawhen theyd spoken at impsec hq only yesterday how long has this been going on miles asked martya with a jerk of his head in galenis direction martya smirked delia told our da a month ago that duv was going to be the one she likes duvs style she says i think hes all right for an old fellow i have style too miles pointed out one all your own martya agreed blandly miles prudently decided not to follow up on that straight line um and when did old duv find out delias working on it some fellows you have to hit with a brick to get their attention some you have to hit with a big brick as miles was trying to figure out which category she thought he fell into ivan returned balancing beverages a few minutes later the first strains of music sounded from the next room ivan rescued martyas gown from its rendezvous with spiced wine and bore her away for the dancing if the civilian strangers faces here were workfriends of laisas from the shippers consortium there was quite a sprinkling of other komarrans in the crowd nothing political about this party hah galenis presence miles suspected must be due to laisas hand in the guest list her best old friend of course miles grazed for a time on the hors doeuvres splendid as always then drifted into the next room to listen to the music and watch the dancers he became keenly aware that his failure to pack along his own partner left him odd man out and not the only one the ratio of men to women present was easily ten to nine if not ten to eight he cadged one or two dances with women who knew him well enough not to mind his height such as henri vorvolks countess but all of them were depressingly married or attached the rest of the time he practiced his best sinister illyanesque holdingupthewall pose illyan himself danced past with alys vorpatril ivan pausing beside miles to fortify himself with a cup of hot spiced wine stared in astonishment i didnt know old illyan could dance he commented i sure didnt know he could dance that well miles agreed ivan was not the only one doing a doubletake henri vorvolks wife watching alys and her partner sail by whispered some comment in her husbands ear he looked up with a bemused smile ive never seen illyan do anything like that before i suppose he was always onduty always dr ruibal had mentioned personality changes as well as cognitive changes as a possible side effect of the chip removal hell just removing that thirtyyear burden of crushing responsibility could account for it a wisp of hair escaped lady alyss elaborate beflowered coiffure and she brushed it back from her forehead the image of her en deshabille at breakfast burst in miless memory and he had the sudden sensation of being hit with a big brick he choked on his own wine good god illyans sleeping with my aunt and vice versa or something he wasnt sure if he should be indignant or pleased the only clear thought that came to him was a suddenly renewed admiration for illyans cool nerve are you all right ivan asked him oh yes i think i will let ivan figure this one out for himself he hid an uncontrollable grin by knocking back another gulp of wine he escaped ivan and retreated into the reception room at the buffet there he ran into captain galeni selecting snacks for delia who waited demurely nearby she favored miles with a little distant wave of her fingers you ah found a new dance partner i see miles commented to galenis ear galeni smiled like a pleased fox with its mouth full of feathers yes i was going to ask her to this thing she said she was busy tonight too bad miles is this some kind of skewed symmetry galenis black brows twitched i dont pretend im above a little revenge but im an honorable man i asked her first if she thought you were serious about her she said no oh miles pretended to nibble on a fruit pastry and are you serious about her he felt like a standin for commodore koudelka demanding to know galenis intentions deathly galeni breathed his smile for a moment utterly gone from his eyes miles almost recoiled galeni blinked and continued more lightly with her background and connections shed make a superb political hostess dont you think the slow smile widened the brains and beauty dont hurt either no fortune miles pointed out galeni shrugged i can do something about that myself if i put my mind to it miles had no doubt of it well it would not quite do to say better luck this time would you ah like me to put in a good word for you with her da the commodore i hope you wont take this in bad part miles but i would really rather you didnt try to do me any more favors oh i can see that i guess thank you i dont care to repeat mistakes im going to ask her tonight on the way home galeni nodded in determination and abandoned miles without a backwards look duv and delia delia and duv they made an alliterative couple anyway miles fended off queries from two acquaintances who had heard garbled rumors about his imperial auditors appointment then ducked back into the music chamber where conversation was more difficult his brain inexorably began turning over last nights data as he leaned and watched with unseeing eyes as the dancers swirled past ten or so minutes of this aimless glowering and people were beginning to stare at him he pushed off from the wall and went to beg a dance from laisa while there was still time gregor would surely claim the last couple of rounds for himself he was absorbed in keeping the beat to a rather fastpaced mirror dance with laisa and trying not to appreciate his emperors fiancees wellpadded figure too openly when he caught a glimpse of galeni through the arched doors into the reception room an impsec colonel and two enlisted guards in ordinary undress greens had accosted him galeni and the colonel stood arguing in some fierce undertone delia stood a little away from them blue eyes wide her hand touching her lips galeni was stiffbacked his face set in that blank and burning look that suggested wellsuppressed but dangerous rage what impsec emergency could be dire enough to send them to fetch their top komarran analyst out of a party worried he slid and dipped and turned so as to put laisas back to the archway the colonel gesturing urgently put his hand on galenis sleeve galeni shook it off one of the guards went for a grip on his stunner loosening it in his holster laisa breathless froze with him then realized this was not a move of the dance miles whats wrong excuse me milady i have to attend to something please go back to gregor now he bowed hastily and slipped around her inevitably her gaze followed him as he walked a little too quickly through the archway what seems to be the trouble gentlemen miles asked quietly coming up to the tense little group if he couldnt alter the tone of the proceedings he might at least lower the volume half the people in the room were staring already the colonel gave him an uncertain nodhe wasnt wearing his auditors chain but the impsec man had to know who he was my lord general haroche has ordered the arrest of this man miles concealed shock and kept his voice down why the charge was not specified im required to remove him immediately from the imperial residence galeni hissed to miles what the hell is this vorkosigan do you have a hand in it no i dont know i didnt order this was this connected with his case and if so how dare haroche make a move on it that blindsided him ivan and martya drifted up too looking concerned the colonel looked increasingly rigid watching his doubtless orderedtobequiet arrest slipping out of his control you got any unpaid traffic fines i dont know about duv miles continued trying to lighten the tone both guards had their hands on their stunners now no goddammit where is general haroche right now miles demanded of the colonel hq no my lord hes following on hell be here shortly to report to gregor haroche had better have an explanation for this miles sucked in his breath look duv i think youd better go along quietly ill look into it the colonel shot him a grateful look galeni one of baffled suspicion and enormous frustration it was a lot to ask of galeni to eat this moment of public humiliation but it could be worse letting him get stunned or knocked around for resisting arrest at the emperors reception sprang to miless mind that would capture the attention of all the people in the room galeni glanced at delia a flash of agony in his dark eyes then at ivan ivan will you see delia gets home all right of course duv delia was biting her lip ten more seconds and she was going to mix into this explosively miles gauged from some experience of her at miless hasty nod the colonel and the guards eased galeni out of the room wisely letting him travel under his own steam not touching him miles waved ivan away and followed down the corridor as hed feared the minute they turned the corner the two guards jammed galeni up against the nearest wall and began frisking and binding him miles raised his voice a split second before galeni rounded and swung on them thats not necessary gentlemen they paused galeni with visible effort unclenched his fists if not his jaw and shrugged them off rather than attempting to throw them bodily across the corridor hell go like a brother officer if youll just permit it his stern glance added silently wont you duv galeni brushed his tunic straight again and nodded stiffly colonelwhat is captain galeni charged with really the colonel cleared his throat he dared not evade answer to an imperial auditor regardless of what orders for public discretion haroche might have given him treason mlord what galeni bellowed as miles snapped horseshit miless cautionary hand on galenis sleeve stopped more physically violent denial miles took three breaths for control and to set galeni a good example and said duv ill come see you as soon as ive talked to haroche all right galenis nostrils flared but he echoed all right his teeth set fortunately on any further comment he managed a reasonably dignified stride down the corridor as the arrestsquad escorted him out miles boiled back toward the reception rooms in the corridor just outside he was intercepted by a posse consisting of gregor laisa delia and his mother whats going on miles gregor asked why did those men take duv away laisa added her eyes wide and alarmed miles do something delia demanded countess vorkosigan just watched one arm crossed over her torso the other hand to her mouth i dont know and i bloody should know miles sputtered galenis just been arrested by impsec onhe stole a glance at laisasome vague charge by order of lucas haroche himself apparently i must assume he had a reason began gregor i must assume he made a mistake said delia hotly cordelia help countess vorkosigans gaze flicked up past miless shoulder if you want your information ungarbled go to the source here he comes now miles wheeled to see haroche round the corner led by one of gregors armsmen haroches face was no less heavy than his tread he strode up to the group and gave gregor a formal nod sire and a more abbreviated one to miles my lord auditor i came as quickly as i could what the hell is going on lucas gregor said quietly impsec has just arrested one of my guests from the middle of my reception i trust you can explain why did haroche know gregor well enough to detect the anger under that slight emphasis on the my my profound apologies sire and to you too dr toscane i fully appreciate the awkwardness but impsecs mandate is to keep youand yoursa small nod to laisasafe i was given reason just this evening to suspect the loyalty of the man and then discovered to my alarm that he was actually in your presence i may err on the side of caution many times but i dare not err on the side of carelessness even once my first priority had to be the physical removal captain galeni everything else including explanations could wait he glanced at the women and meaningfully away for those i am now at your disposal sire oh gregor turned to countess vorkosigan and made a vague frustrated gesture at delia and laisa cordelia would you countess vorkosigan smiled very dryly come ladies the gentlemen need to go talk but i want to know whats going on protested laisa we can get it later ill explain the system to you its really stupid but it can be made to work which come to think of it could also sum up a great many other vor customs in the meantime we need to keep the show going out thereshe nodded toward the reception roomsand repair what damages we can from this aha sharp glance at haroche which should have made him winceunfortunate exercise in caution repair damages how asked laisa lie dear alys and i will show you the drill countess vorkosigan shepherded them away delia looked back over her shoulder at miles and mouthed do something dammit wed better continue this in your office sire haroche murmured well want the comconsole i brought copies of my security system teams report for each of you he touched his tunic and smiled grimly at miles i figured youd want to see it as soon as possible my lord auditor oh good yes admitted miles he fell in behind the two men as they paced down the corridor and descended the turning stairs at its end the armsman brought up the rear and took up his post outside gregors office gregor sealed the door behind them my short list shrank abruptly and unexpectedly said haroche if you will sire he nodded to the comconsole gregor turned it on haroche slotted one secured data card into the readslot and handed its twin to miles im sure youll want to study this in more detail later but i can give you the quick synopsis now as frames go miles yours was very nearly perfect the insertion of your false visit into the evidence rooms log was extremely well executed my team had the damnedest time finding any trace of how it was done i was really starting to wonder then it occurred to me to have them recheck your retina scan your retina scan was subtly altered by your cryorevival were you aware miles shook his head though im not surprised a lot of me was subtly altered by my cryorevival its said that every criminal makes one mistake in my experience this isnt necessarily true but it happened this time the retina scan on the evidence rooms log was a copy from one made last year not identical to your current one as you can see on this overlay haroche made the two scans coalesce above the vid plate of gregors comconsole the alterations sprang out highlighted in purple a malignant hungover cyclops stare and so you are cleared my lord auditor haroche opened his hand thanks growled miles i was never accused what does this have to do with duv galeni bear with me from the evidence or lack of it my team says that the evidence room comconsole record had to have been altered by a mole program galeni physically inserted via its readslot that machine is one of the isolated ones there was no other way galeni or someone miles corrected haroche shrugged thats not how we tagged galeni however the other point of attack i turned them loose on was of course the buildings own admittancelog that proved more fruitful the log wasnot altered onsite but at a remove via its data links to other impsec hq systems my team had to peel it right down to the undercode level to find this one i commend their dedication and patience to you sire as well as their expertise haroche zipped though screen after screen of logiclinks the significant items are highlighted in red you can follow it out yourselves they traced the alteration through to the sectionhead levelthe system has lockouts in sections up to that level ysee which the sectionheads can overridemyself or rather my secondincharge at domestic affairs nowallegre olshansky the galactic affairs chief when hes here they traced it through allegres comconsole down to his analysts level to captain galenis comconsole haroche sighed the affairs analysts in all our departments have an enormous amount of discretion as to the data they can access i cant say too much in all honesty its their job to review everything since vital decisions are taken at higher levels based upon their reports and recommendations and opinions i spent a couple of years in that job myself in domestic but galeni apparently used his analysts codes to gain access to his superiors comconsole and from there to leapfrog into the larger system or somebody using galenis comconsole did miles suggested he felt sick to his stomach the highlights on the vid display looked like smears of blood is this really evidence if one frame why not two or as many as necessary till they came up with a suspect miles neither knew nor liked haroche looked glum it may be all we can get id give my arm to be able to question the man under fastpenta but he was given the allergy treatment when he was promoted to his current position fastpenta would kill him so we have to build our case the old hard way any physical evidence for the crime went up in smoke long ago were back to your motivations after all my lord auditor which men in the komarran affairs analysis department had both access to knowledge of the bioengineered prokaryote and some reason to do this he had the access he met with his father ser galen on earth just before the original komarran plot came to grief i know said miles shortly i was there oh god duv i dont know how much weight to give the fact that your clonebrother shot galenis father if that were going to be a problem it would have been a problem before this perhaps but it must have left some residue of feeling then on top of that you recently became instrumental in destroying his marital plans hes over that what marital plans asked gregor miles gritted his teeth haroche you idiot at one time duv was rather interested in laisa which is how he came to escort her to your ambassadorial reception where you met duv has since um found another love interest oh said gregor looking stricken i didnt quite realize things were that serious between laisa and galeni it was onesided haroche shook his head im sorry miles but the man called you and i quote a smarmy goddamn little pimp haroches gaze grew abstracted his expression for a moment so like illyan giving one of his verbatim quotes from his chip that miles drew in his breath and went on to declaim quite passionately vor does mean thief and you goddamn barrayaran thieves stick together all right you and your fucking precious emperor and the whole damn pack of you and you seriously expect me to construe he merely felt mild inconvenience gregors eyebrows rose it was to my face snapped miles from the look on gregors the emperor did not see why this remark constituted a defense not to my back miles tried to explain never to my back not galeni its not his style he added to haroche where the hell did you get that does impsec have all its analysts private comconsoles monitored now or had someone targeted galeni before illyan ever went down haroche cleared his throat not galenis comconsole in fact my lord yours what all the public channels in vorkosigan house are monitored by the impsec chiefs own office for security they have been for decades the only three that are not are the count and the countesss personal machines and your personal machine surely your parents mentioned this to you before they knew monitored by illyan of course his father and mother would not have objected to that and hed taken galenis call that night in the comconsole station in the guest suite right miles subsided seething but mostly with his mind whirling trying to remember everything hed said in the last three months to anyone over any comconsole in vorkosigan house your loyalty to your friend does you great credit miles haroche went on but im not so sure hes any friend of yours no said miles no i know what galeni paid to get here he wouldnt piss it down the wind for some personal ire this is a trail of smoke and mirrors and anyway even granted galeni has some motivation to frame me what about the original crime what motive did he have to take out illyan in the first place haroche shrugged political perhaps there are thirty years of bad blood between impsec under illyan and some komarrans i agree the case is not complete by any means but it should be easier to pursue now that we have a real direction gregor looked almost distraught i had hoped my marriage might do some little part toward healing things with komarr a truly unified empire it will miles assured him doubly so if galeni ends up marrying a barrayaran if he doesnt get jailed first on some trumpedup treason charge that is you know how imperial fashions go youre sure to start a big fad in crossplanetary romances and given the shortage of barrayaran girl babies our parents created in our generation a mob of us are going to have to import wives anyway gregors lips crooked up in sad appreciation of miless attempted humor miles gripped his copy of the report i want to review this please do said haroche sleep on it and if you can find anything in it that i havent let me know im not happy to find any of my impsec people are disloyal regardless of their planet of origin haroche took his farewells miles followed immediately sending a residence servant to find martin and have his car brought around if he went back to the party hed be jumped by women demanding explanations and action neither of which he could offer right now he did not envy gregor his task of returning and having to socialize as if nothing had happened he was in the counts groundcar halfway between the imperial residence and impsec when his view through the canopy of some dilapidated buildings with brightly lit towers behind suddenly sharpened they took on an abrupt unreal reality as if grown denser overpowering as if about to be outlined in green fire he had just time to think oh shit oh shit oh shi before the whole scene dissolved into the familiar colored confetti then darkness he returned to consciousness laid out on the cars backseat with martins panicked form looming over him in the dim yellow light his tunic was ripped open the canopy was raised to the night mist and he shivered in the cold lord vorkosigan my lord oh hell are you dying stop it stop it unh he managed it came out a muffled groan to his ringing ears his mouth hurt he touched his wet lips and his fingers came away smeared redbrown in this light with fresh blood s all right martin only uh seizure is that what they look like i couldnt think but what youd been poisoned or shot or something martin looked only slightly relieved he tried to sit up martins big hands opened in hovering uncertainty whether to help him up or shove him back down both his tongue and his lower lip were bitten and bleeding freely over his best house uniform should i take you to a hospital or a doctor my lord which one no let me take you back home at least then maybe martins harried face brightened with hope maybe your lady mother will be there soon and take me off your hands miles grunted a pained laugh shes not going to kiss it and make it well martin no matter how much she might like to he wanted desperately to go on to impsec hq hed promised galeni but he hadnt properly reviewed the new data and the team of men hed want to question about it when he had were undoubtedly gone home to a wellearned nights rest and he was still shaken and dizzy with the postseizure lassitude the military medical people were all too right the stresstriggered aspect of the damned seizures virtually guaranteed they would always occur at the most inconvenient possible moment unfit for duty indeed any duty unfit i hate this home martin he sighed chapter twentyfive miles woke the next morning with what he was coming to recognize as a postseizure hangover a couple of painkiller tablets helped only slightly if anything the symptoms were getting worse with time not better or maybe he was simply becoming more accurate in identifying them now that they were not masked by a stunnermigraine or suicidal depression i have to see chenko soon he carried a carafe of coffee up to his room and locked himself in with his comconsole and haroches report he spent or wasted the rest of the morning reviewing it then rereviewing it the very scantiness of the data made it all the more convincing if this was supposed to be a doubleframe there ought to be more of it it was strongly suggestive but not quite proof but try as he might he could spot no flaw in its reasoning no break in the flow of its logic with nothing more optimistic to report than this he dreaded seeing galeni again impsec had held the komarranborn officer overnight in the temporary cells at impsec hq a small section which had replaced the more extensive downstairs dungeons of ezars times there galeni sat pending the formal leveling of charges after which he would presumably be moved to some more official and dreary military prison held on suspicion barrayaran military law was a trifle unclear just how long one could be held on suspicion held on bloody paranoia is more like it his sour meditations were interrupted by a call from dr weddell plaintively demanding to know when he could go home miles promised to come take his report and let him out if he couldnt spring one impsec prisoner he at least might spring another he donned a fresh if secondbest house uniform and his auditors chain daubed more stimsalve on his lacerated lip and called martin to bring his car around the medicinal and chemical odors of the impsec hq clinic still gave miles unpleasant fluttering sensations in his belly he entered and found the laboratory chamber weddell had taken over a rumpled cot in the corner gave evidence that the galactic bioexpert was following orders and had not left the sample or his data unattended weddell himself was still wearing his same clothes from yesterday morning though hed obviously managed to shave between times he was somewhat less bleary than miles which wasnt saying much well my lord auditor you probably wont be surprised to learn i have positively identified your find as the same prokaryote that was used on chief illyan its even the same batch he led miles to the labs comconsole and embarked on a detailed comparison of the two samples with visual aids and highlights and mild selfcongratulations when the silent imperial auditor was not forthcoming with any i spoke with illyan said miles he reports no memory of ever having swallowed a small brown capsule in the last four months unfortunately his memory isnt what it used to be oh it wasnt swallowed weddell stated positively it was never designed to be swallowed how do you know the capsule was neither permeable nor soluble it was meant to be brokena pinch of the fingers would doand the sample mixed with air and breathed the vector encapsulation design is obviously meant to be airborne its quite sporelike the which what here weddell banished the vid of the molecular chain presently occupying the vid plate and brought up an image of an object that looked for all the world like a spherical satellite bristling with antennae the actual prokaryotes would have been unmanageably tiny if someone had simply attempted to load them naked into those large capsules instead they are contained in these hollow sporelike particlesweddell pointed to the vid platewhich float in air until they contact a wet surface such as mucous membrane or bronchia at that point the delivery units dissolve releasing their load could you see them in the air like smoke or dust smell them if the light was strong i suppose one might see a brief puff as they were initially distributed but then they would appear to vanish they would be odorless how long would they hang in the air several minutes at least depending on the efficiency of the ventilation miles stared in fascination at the malignantlooking sphere this is new information though he did not offhand see how it helped much it was not possible to reconstruct it from the eidetic chip noted weddell a bit stiffly as no part of the vector encapsulation would ever reach the chip there were several other potential means of administration i quite understand yes thank you he pictured himself going back to illyan can you remember every breath you took in the last four months once illyan might have a bleep from the comconsole interrupted his thoughts the deliveryspore vanished and was replaced by the head of general haroche my lord auditor haroche nodded diffidently at miles my apologies for interrupting you but since youre in the building i wonder if you could stop in and see me at your convenience of course when youre done in the labs and so on miles sighed certainly general at least it gave him an excuse to put off seeing galeni for a few more minutes ill be up to your office shortly miles took possession of the codecard containing weddells report and the resealed residue of the sample and released the man who departed gratefully miles s step quickened as he paced down the toofamiliar hallways of impsec hq up and around to illyans old office haroches new one maybe pray god haroche had found something fresh to share something to render this whole tangle less painful haroche locked his office door behind miles and courteously pulled up a chair for the imperial auditor close to his comconsole desk have you had any second thoughts since last night my lord haroche inquired not really weddell has identified the sample all right youll probably want to make a copy of this he handed weddells data card across to haroche who nodded and ran it through his comconsole s readslot thank you he handed the original back to miles and went on ive been taking a closer look at the other four senior komarran affairs analysts in allegres department none were as well positioned as galeni to know of the existence of the komarran sample and two can be eliminated outright by that very test the other two lack any motivation that i can uncover the perfect crime muttered miles almost the truly perfect crime is the one which is never discovered at all this came very close your frame now was by all indications a backup plan of some kind and necessarily less than perfect i never rammed a perfect tactical plan through to reality in my whole time with the dendarii mercenaries miles sighed the best i ever did was good enough you can be assured domestic affairs never did much better haroche admitted this is all very circumstantial without a confession yes and im not sure how to elicit one fastpenta is out i wondered if you might be able to help in that regard given your knowledge of the man use your noted powers of persuasion on him i might said miles if i thought galeni was guilty haroche shook his head we may want more evidence but im not optimistic that were going to get more you often must proceed with the imperfect because you must proceed you cant stop let the juggernaut roll on regardless of what gets squashed underneath miless brows rose how are you planning to proceed a courtmartial probably the case must be closed properly as you pointed out this one cant be left hanging what would a courtmartial make of this with impsec breathing down its neck urging swift decision guilty not guilty or a more foggy not proven he must find a top military attorney to evaluate the case no dammit i dont want a panel of military judges guessing and then going home to dinner if the outcome is to be guessed i can guess myself all day long i want to know you have to keep looking we cant just stop with galeni haroche blew out his breath and rubbed his chin miles youre asking me to unleash a witchhunt here potentially very damaging to my organization youd have me turn impsec upside down and for what if the komarran is guiltyand im provisionally convinced he isyoull have to go very far indeed to oil produce a suspect more to your taste where will you stop not here for damn sure the empresstobe is not going to be happy with you or with me haroche grimaced im aware she seems a very nice young woman and it gives me no pleasure to think this may cause her distress but i took my oath to gregor so did you yes if you have nothing more concrete to offer im ready to lay the charges and let the courtmartial sort it out you can lay the charges but ill not light the fuse i could decline to close my auditors case if the courtmartial convicts youll have to close it my lord no i wont the realization made him blink he could keep his auditors inquiry open forever if he so chose and there wasnt a damned thing haroche could do about it no wonder haroche was being so exquisitely polite today miles could even veto the courtmartial but imperial auditors were traditionally circumspect with their vast powers from a large pool of experienced men they were chosen not for the glory of their former careers but for their long records of utmost personal probity fifty years of lifes tests were normally considered barely enough to smoke out the likely candidates he ought not to screw with impsec s internal rules any more than the bare minimum necessary to haroche smiled wearily we may end up having to agree to disagree but try to see my view galeni was your friend once and i sympathize with your dismay at the turn things have taken this is what i can do i can drop the treason charge and reduce it to assault on a superior officer minimize the distress a year in prison a simple dishonorable discharge and galeni walks away you might even use whatever pull you have to gain him an imperial pardon and spare him the prison ive no great objection as long as hes gotten out of here thus destroying galenis career and any future political ambitions and galeni had been an ambitious man anxious to serve komarr in that new and more peaceful future gregor had envisioned immensely conscious of his opportunities there a pardon is for the guilty said miles its not the same thing as an acquittal haroche scratched his head and grimaced again or maybe that was intended to be a smile i really had another reason for asking you up here lord vorkosigan im looking to the future on more than one front haroche hesitated for a long moment then went on i took the liberty of requisitioning a copy of your impmil neurologists medical reports on your condition your seizure disorder i thought his plan of treatment sounded promising impsec miles murmured always was ubiquitous as cockroaches first tap my comconsole then my medical files remind me to shake out my boots tomorrow morning my apologies my lord i think youll forgive me i had to know the particulars before i could say what im about to say but if this controlledseizure device proves to work as you hope it only controls the symptoms its not a cure haroche opened his hand dismissing the difference a matter of medical definition not practical use im a practical man ive been studying the reports of your dendarii missions for impsec you and simon illyan made an extraordinary team we were the best oh yes miles grunted neutrally suddenly uncertain of just where haroche was leading haroche smiled wryly filling illyans place is a damned big challenge im reluctant to give up any advantage now that ive had a chance to work with you in person and look over your records in real detail im increasingly sure that illyan made a serious mistake when he discharged you it was no mistake i more than deserved what i got his mouth was growing dry i dont think so i think illyan overreacted a written censure appended to your records would have been enough in my view haroche shrugged you could have added it to your collection ive worked with your sort before willing to take risks no one else is willing to take to get results no one else is able to obtain i like results miles i like them a lot the dendarii mercenaries were a great resource for impsec they still are commodore quinn will take your money and deliver your goods his heart was beginning to pound this woman quinn is unknown to me and not barrayaran id much preferif your medical treatment is successfulto reinstate you he had to swallow in order to breathe everything to be as it was before take up where i left off the dendarii admiral naismith not exactly where you left off no by my calculations you were about two years overdue for your promotion to captain for one thing but i think you and i could be a team just as you and illyan were a small twinkle lit haroches eye you will perhaps forgive me my touch of ambition if i say maybe even better id be proud to have you on board vorkosigan miles sat stunned for a moment all he could think idiotically was im sure glad i had that seizure last night or id be rolling on this carpet again right now i i his hands were shaking his head exploding with joy yes yes yes id have to close this case first give gregor back his chokechain but then sure his injured lip split again as it stretched painfully into an unstoppable grin he sucked salt blood from it yes said haroche patiently thats exactly what ive been saying an icewater wash seemed to pour down through the middle of miless chest quenching his hot exaltation what he scarcely felt able to think straight a memory filled his inner vision of a docking bay crammed walltowall with dendarii troopers chanting naismith naismith naismith my first victory do you remember what it cost his grin had become fixed i i i he swallowed twice and cleared his throat as if echoing from some faroff tunnel he heard his voicewhich him saying im going to have to think about this general please do said haroche genially take your time but dont leave me in suspense foreveri can already imagine a use for the dendarii in a certain situation which looks to be looming out near kline station id love to discuss it with you if youre in id like your advice miless eyes were wide and dilated his face pale and damp thank you general he choked out thank you very he scrambled out of his chair still smiling with bleeding lips he almost caromed off the door frame like a drunken man haroche keyed the door open for him just in time a mumbled word to haroches secretary had martin and the groundcar waiting for miles by the time he reached the buildings exit miles waved martin away and sat alone in the rear compartment he silvered the canopy and wished he might as easily blank out the shocky expression on his face he felt as if he was fleeing a battlefield but where was the wound in all this grinning glory he didnt stop retreating till he was back at vorkosigan house he ducked past his mothers retainers and swung wide around illyans guest suite he locked himself in his own bedroom and began to pace till he found his gaze fixated on his comconsole it seemed to stare back at him with horus eyes he fled up one floor further to the little spare room with the old wing chair it felt small enough at last to contain him soothing as a straitjacket he didnt bring the brandy or the knife this time they would have been redundant he locked the door and flung himself into the wingchair not just his hands but his whole body was shaking his old job back everything to be as it was before tell me about denial now huh hed thought he was over naismith lord vorkosigan had the upper hand right pretend not to care naismith was gone pretend to walk on water while he was about it why not so thats why i feel like im drowning the truth comes out you want it want the dendarii back yes but was he medically fit for it really so hed have to stay in the damned tactics room and not go out with the squads anymore what was new about that he could manage the thing hed been defying his disabilities all his life this was just another one in a long string he knew how i can do it somehow he could have quinn back and taura for all the precious bit of time she had left except for the small sly demonic whisper at the back of his brain theres just one little hitch finally painfully he sidled around to look at it out of the corner of his eye then squareon haroche wants me to sacrifice galeni miles closing his case and letting haroche get on with running impsec unimpeded was to be miless ticket back to the dendarii an imperial auditor had broad powers but they surely stopped short of ordering impsec to reemploy one that authority was wholly at haroches discretion he rocked in his chair his feet tapping in a fractured rhythm but what if galeni was guilty speaking of denial haroches witchhunt fears were very compelling miles and galeni had been friends if it had been any other man accused someone he didnt know would he be so picky about it right now or would he have been quite content with haroches evidence dammit this wasnt about friendship it was about knowledge character judgment i used to be good at personnel i thought was he to doubt that judgment now but hell people were strange subtle and twisty you never really knew everything about them even after years of friendship relatives even less his hands flexed on the chair arms he found himself suddenly thinking of that jumppilot hed ordered sergeant bothari to question on his very first encounter with the dendarii and his destiny thirteen years ago it bothered him extremely that he could not now remember the mans name though he had spoken hypocritically at his funeral theyd desperately needed the pilots accesscodes to save lives and bothari had got them through the roughest of ready means and they had saved lives miles supposed though not the jumppilots his first military career had begun with a human sacrifice maybe another one was required for its renewal hed sacrificed friends enough before god knew led them into one bloody good cause or another but not led them back out and they hadnt all been volunteers i want i want had haroche read the naked longing in his face yes of course miles had seen the knowledge in haroches smug eyes in the easy certainty of his smile in his casually tented hands reflected darkly in the black glass powerful hands that could give or withhold so much at will he sees me oh yes miless eyes narrowed and his sore lips parted his breath puffed on the chill air of the tiny room as if hed just been rabbitpunched in the stomach oh god this isnt just a job offer this is a bribe lucas haroche had just tried to bribe an imperial auditor tried or succeeded well get back to that and what a bribe what a sweet bribe could miles even prove it was a bribe and not sincere admiration im sure oh im sure lucas haroche you subtle son of a bitch i underestimated you from day one so much for miless vaunted character judgment he should not have underestimated haroche haroche was just as much illyans handpicked man as miles was illyan liked weasels but illyan had a knack for keeping them under control haroche s bland controlled formernoncom style was a mask for a razorsharp mind haroche too got results any way he could or he would not have risen to head of domestic affairs not under illyan haroche would not have dared to float his suggestion unless he was sure of miles and why not with access to all of illyans files hed had ample opportunity to study admiral naismiths career from end to end especially this end haroche knew what a fellow weasel the little admiral was he could confidently predict miles would sacrifice everything up to and including his integrity to keep naismith because hed already done it once no virgins here his captaincy his captaincy haroche certainly had no trouble figuring out where my onswitch was located but haroche was a loyal weasel miles would swear loyal to gregor and the imperium a true brother in arms if money meant anything to the man miles had seen no hint of it his passion was his impsec service like illyan himself like miles too the work he had taken over from illyan miless breath stopped for a moment he felt as frozen as any cryocorpse no the work haroche had taken away from illyan oh miles bent double in his chair and began to swear softly and horribly he was dizzy with fury and shame but mostly with fury im blind blind blind motive whats an elephant got to do around here to advance and be recognized it was haroche haroche all the time had to be haroche whod blown out illyans brains in order to steal his job of course the comconsole records were all beautifully choreographed haroche had all of illyans override codes lots of time to play and a decades knowledge of the impsec hq internal system miles shot out of his chair and began to pace practically running from side to side in the tiny room slapping his palm into the wall hard enough to sting at every second turn this elephant was very like a snake all right its haroche dammit i know it is oh yeah prove it imperial auditorboy all the physical evidence had gone up in smoke and all the documentation was entirely under haroches control miles had a hell of a lot less on haroche than haroche had on galeni he couldnt just accuse the man out of thin air hed be counteraccused of godknewwhat hysteria at the very least an imperial auditor had power but so did the chief of impsec hed get one chance only then haroche would turn on him real strange things could start to happen to me untraceable things in fact the moment he failed to come back with an acceptance of haroches fantastic bribe haroche would know miles knew theres not much time motivation judgment proof smoke he flung himself to the floor and lay glaring at the ceiling his clenched fists pounded once on the worn and frayed carpet but suppose he played along with haroche took his bribe and lay in wait to get him later at some better opportunity miles could have the dendarii and justice yes haroche and miles would belong to each other for a time or haroche could be lulled into thinking so belatedly it occurred to miles that if this was a bribe haroches oily flattery of him back in illyans office all that you and illyan were such a great team was pure horseshit haroche was not in love with admiral naismith and how long would it be till haroche arranged miless accidental death and no cryorevival this time an impsec field agents life was a gamble anyway honor among thieves hah it would be a fascinating race to see who could get the other first death the traditional reward of treason on a slow fuse burning from the middle toward both ends what a life wed lead for a little while highly stimulating a knock at the door derailed his thoughts crashingly he flinched in place on his back on the floor hyperreactive who is it he gasped miles came his mothers low alto vibrant with concern are you all right in there youre not having one of your seizures are you illyans voice seconded the countess no no im all right what are you doing the countess asked we heard a lot of footsteps and a thump through the ceiling he fought to keep his words even just wrestling with temptation illyans voice came back amused whos winning miless eye followed the cracks in the plaster overhead his voice came out high and light on a sigh i think im going for the best two falls out of three illyan laughed right see you later ill be down soon i think their footsteps receded voices muted and gone lucas haroche i believe i hate you but suppose miles could know in advance that haroche was going to play straight with him it was possible suppose the offer had been only and exactly what it had seemed no knife to the back later what answer then what answer ever haroche had admiral naismith figured all right forward and back naismith would cry yes and try to weasel out of the deal after but haroche didnt know lord vorkosigan how could he practically no one did not even miles i just met the man myself hed known a boy by that name long ago confused and passionate and armymad properly that boy had been left behind by admiral naismith striking out for his larger identity his wider world but this new lord vorkosigan was someone else altogether and miles scarcely dared guess his future miles was abruptly weary sick to death of the noise inside his own head haroche the puppetmaster had him running in circles trying to bite himself in the back what if he didnt play haroches dizzying game what if he just stopped what other game was there who are you boy who are you who asks on the thought a blessed silence came an empty clarity he took it at first for utter desolation but desolation was a kind of free fall perpetual and without ground below this was stillness balanced solid weirdly serene no momentum to it at all forward or backwards or sideways i am who i choose to be i always have been what i chose though not always what i pleased his mother had often said when you choose an action you choose the consequences of that action she had emphasized the corollary of this axiom even more vehemently when you desired a consequence you had damned well better take the action that would create it he lay drained of tension not moving and content to be so the oddly stretched moment was like a bite of eternity eaten on the run was this quiet place inside something newgrown or had he just never stumbled across it before how could so vast a thing lay undiscovered for so long his breathing slowed and deepened i elect to be myself haroche dwindled to a tiny figure in the distance miles hadnt realized he could make his adversary shrink like that and it astonished him but my futures gonna be short unless i do something truly in fact haroche had killed no one so far and the death of an imperial auditor in the middle of an unclosed case would arouse the wildest suspicions in miless empty place would arise hydraheaded a halfdozen other auditors at least experienced annoyed and immune to horseshit of all kinds haroche could not possibly control them all it was galenis life which would not be worth spit what was more traditional than for a disgraced officer to commit suicide in his cell it was the vorish thing to do it would be taken as a confession of guilt a gesture of expiation case closed oh yeah it would doubtless be a very wellstaged suicide haroche had lots of practical experience in such things and would not make amateurish mistakes as soon as haroche knew miles knew it would be a race against time and all miles had was a trail of mirrors and smoke smoke air filters miles s eyes widened chapter twentysix a scant hour before impsec hq quitting time at least for those men there so fortunate as to work day shift miles marshaled his little troop at the side door for what he mentally dubbed the assault on cockroach central he was grateful at last for the embarrassing dimensions of the counts old groundcar because hed been able to fit everyone in the rear compartment and finish his mission briefing on the way over from the imperial science institute thus saving a few more precious minutes hed pressed ivan into service again and simon illyan himself in the undress greens with full insignia miles had insisted he wear dr weddell followed carefully carrying an old shipping carton labeled but not containing petrimice frozen lot a dozen last but by no means least important delia koudelka swung out her long legs and hurried to catch up the corporal on duty at the front desk looked up anxiously as miles entered miles strode up to him and smiled tightly general haroche has left your station orders to report to his office when i go in and out has he not why yes my lord auditor the corporal glanced around miles and saluted illyan who returned the courtesy well dont uh yes my lord auditor the corporal looked faintly panicked like a grain of wheat foreseeing itself about to be ground between two stones its all right smetani illyan assured him in passing the corporal relaxed gratefully the cavalcade continued on into the corridors of impsec miles s first stop was the new detention area now located in an inner quadrant of the second floor miles braced the officer in charge in a short time im coming back here to interview captain galeni i expect to find him alive when i arrive an outcome for which i will hold you personally responsible in the meanwhile miss koudelka here will be visiting him you will permit no one elseno one not even your own superiors especially your own superiors to enter the prisoners block until i return is that crystal clear yes my lord auditor delia dont leave duv alone for so much as a second till i get back i understand miles her chin rose firmly and thanks miles nodded he hoped this blocked any chance of a lastminute convenient suicide attempt upon galeni haroche had to be ready by now to move on that plan at a moments notice the trick was to deny him the moment miles led the rest of his people onward to janitorial where he cornered the department head an aging colonel once the man was reassured that miless intense interest in the schedule of air filtration maintenance was no adverse reflection upon his departments services he became very cooperative miles brought him along miles wanted to be in four places at once but the thing had to be taken in as strict an order as any proof in space math inspiration was one thing demonstration quite another after collecting a tech from forensics he hurried his team along to the subsubbasement and the evidence rooms in a very few more minutes he had his array of impeccable witnesses lined up in aisle weapons room iv weddell set his box down and leaned against the shelf frame arms crossed his air of skeptical intellectual superiority for once almost masked by his fascination with the proceedings shelf was inconveniently out of reach miles had to have ivan hand him down the familiar little biosealed box his auditors seal was unbroken the two remaining brittle brown capsules waited demurely he picked up one and rolled it between his thumb and forefinger all right watch closely all here goes he pressed firmly and the capsule snapped he waved it twice over his head a smoky tan cometstrail of exquisitely fine powder hung a moment in the air then dissipated a little smudge clung to his fingers ivan was holding his breath miles noticed how long should we wait miles asked dr weddell id give it at least ten minutes to get all over the room weddell advised miles attempted to compose his soul in patience illyan stared at the air his expression hard yes thought miles here is the weapon that murdered you you cant touch it but it can touch you brickcolored ivan gave up and started breathing again before he turned altogether purple and passed out at last weddell bent down and opened his box from it he drew a small transparent bottle of clear fluid and an atomizer dispenser which he filled for customdesigning that precious liquid on three hours notice miles was ready to forgive him all his sins of pride for the next five years and kiss him to boot weddell himself seemed to regard it as trivial scientifically perhaps it was a simple chelation solution hed dismissed it the vector encapsulations exterior structure is nicely regular specific and unique if you wanted something to detect the presence of the prokaryotes themselves that would be a real challenge now said miles to the colonel in charge of janitorial we go to the returnair vent and filters this way my lord auditor they all filed through the aisle and around to the far wall where a small rectangular grille about the size of a standard plastic flimsy at ankleheight marked the returnair duct go ahead and pull off the outer cover miles instructed the colonel its the very top filter im interested in the whole crew of them ended up on their knees watching over the colonels shoulder he pulled off the outer grille to reveal the sealed rectangle of fiber designed to catch dust dirt hairs mold spores smoke particles and the like the tiny prokaryotes themselves if freed from their sporelike cases would have slipped right through this barrier and gone on possibly even to penetrate the electrolytic resin barrier behind it only to be destroyed at the last when they reached the central flashunit at miless nod the colonel gave way to dr weddell who sat crosslegged on the floor and earnestly saturated the air around the vent with his atomizer so whats he doing the colonel whispered to miles miles suppressed the reply were spraying for traitors pesky vermin this time of year dont you find watch and see weddell then pulled an ultraviolet handlight from his box and directed it at the filter a pale red fluorescence slowly grew more brilliant as the black light played over the surface there you are my lord auditor weddell said the vector encapsulations were caught in the filter all right just so miles scrambled to his feet thats our baseline then on to the next you therehe pointed to the forensics techdocument bag label and seal all that and follow as quickly as you can the parade took their positions and followed him once more this time he led them to the department of komarran affairs where miles asked the disturbed general allegre to join the procession they all fetched up crowded into captain galenis cubiclesized office fourth door down the komarran analysts corridor do you remember ever personally visiting galeni in here in the last three months miles asked illyan im sure i stopped in a few times i came down here almost every week to discuss items in his reports of particular interest as soon as the forensics tech arrived out of breath the colonel from janitorial repeated his performance with the cubicles returnair vent identical to the one in weapons room iv weddell sprayed again liberally this time miles held his breath the results of this test could force a major fork in his planned strategy if haroche had anticipated himthere had been two missing capsules after all weddell on one hand and his knees played his black light over the filter huh miless heart seemed to stop theres nothing here that i can see do you see anything miles inhaled gratefully as the other men bent to examine the filter also it remained a slightly dirty and nowdamp white can you ascertain that this hasnt been changed since the last scheduled maintenance at midsummer miles asked the colonel the colonel shrugged the filters are not individually numbered my lord theyre interchangeable of course he checked the report panel he carried no one in my department has done so anyway its not due to be changed again till next month at winterfair it looks to have about the normal amount of accumulation for this point in its cycle thank you colonel i appreciate your precision he rose and glanced at illyan who was watching stonyfaced your old office is next simon would you care to lead the way illyan shook his head politely declining there isnt much joy for me in this miles either way your results come out i lose a trusted subordinate but wouldnt you rather lose the one whos actually guilty yes illyans snort was not wholly ironic carry on my lord auditor they trooped up three floors and down one to the level of illyan s old office if miles had managed to surprise haroche with his arrival in force the general showed no sign of it but was there maybe just a little discomfort in his eyes as haroche greeted his old boss and offered illyan a chair no thanks lucas said illyan coolly i dont think well be here very long what are you doing haroche asked as the colonel practiced went straight for the grille low on the wall to the right of his comconsole desk the increasingly burdened forensics tech followed him air filters said miles you didnt think of the air filters youve never been on space duty have you lucas no unfortunately believe me it makes you very conscious of things like air circulation systems haroche s brows rose as weddell began vigorously spraying around the vent he rocked back in his station chair asifcasually he sucked thoughtfully on his lower lip and did not ask have you considered my offer miles he was a cool hand and patient and perfectly capable of waiting for the answer to emerge no reason for him to flinch yet whether the filters here were jammed full of vector encapsulations or not it would prove nothing lots of people went in and out of illyan s office no said weddell after a moment take a look for yourselves gentlemen he passed the black light along to ivan and general allegre youd think it would be here commented allegre peering over ivans shoulder miles had given it about a twentyfivepercent chance personally though hed upped the odds after finding galenis vent clear that left one of the conference chambers or find anything asked haroche miles made a small show of going over and borrowing the handlight from ivan not in here dammit i was hoping it would be simple if the prokaryote vectors are caught in the filters they show up bright red ysee we tested one downstairs what are you going to do next theres nothing for it but to start at the top of the hq building and check every filtered air vent till i get to the basement tedious but ill get there in the end you know i said if i knew why id know who ive changed my mind i now think if i know where ill know who oh really have you tried captain galenis office first place we looked its clear hm perhaps one of the briefing rooms id give odds bite haroche bite my hook come on come on very good if you want to save steps put in ivan on cue you ought to start with the places illyan went most and work out from there rather than from the top down good thinking said miles shall we start with the outer office thenexcuse me general allegre but i must be completethe offices of the department heads then the briefing rooms then all the affairs analysts offices we should probably have done the whole of komarran affairs while we were first down there after that well see from the look on the forensics techs face he was mentally kissing his dinner goodbye a regret perhaps blunted by his obvious fascination with the proceedings allegre nodded they all straggled back out and the colonel began the drill again with the grille in the outer office miles wondered if anyone had noticed yet that weddell didnt have nearly enough chelation solution to check every air filter in impsec hq illyan exchanged abstracted greetings with his old secretary after a few moments general haroche excused himself illyan did not look up miles watched out of the corner of his eye as haroche exited into the corridor hook set yes now the line plays out he began counting in his head timing out how a man in a suppressed panic might walk to one room then another he motioned weddell to desist with his spray when he reached one hundred he spoke all right gentlemen if you will follow me one more time quietly please he led them out into the corridor and turned left and right again at the second intersection in the middle of that hallway he met the commodore who had taken over domestic affairs from haroche oh my lord auditor the commodore hailed him how fortunate general haroche just sent me to get you where did he tell you to look for me he said youd gone down to the evidence rooms youve just saved me some steps oh yes tell me was haroche carrying anything a flimsyfolder did you want it i rather think so hes just in here eh come along miles led the way back up the corridor and into the domestic affairs outer office the door to haroches old inner office was locked miles overrode its codes with his auditors seal it hissed aside haroche was crouched to the left of his old comconsole desk just levering the vent grille out of the wall in the opened flimsyfolder on the floor by his side lay another fiber filter miles laid a small bet with himself that they would find a disemboweled grille awaiting haroches return in one of the briefing rooms on a direct line between illyans old office and this one a quick switch very cool you think fast general but this time i had a head start timing said miles is everything haroche jerked upright on his knees my lord auditor he began quickly and stopped his eye took in the small army of impsec men crowding into the doorway behind miles even then miles thought haroche might have been capable of some brilliantly extemporized explanation to miles to the whole damned mob but then illyan shouldered forward miles fancied he could almost see the glib lies turning to clotted ashes on haroches tongue though the only outward sign was a little twitch at the corner of his mouth haroche had avoided facing his victims miles had noticed hed never once visited illyan in impsecs own clinic had tried unsuccessfully to avoid miles back when hed doubtless been planning the original version of the frameup and had been careful to enter the imperial residence only after galeni had been arrested and removed he was not perhaps an evil man but only an ordinary smart man tempted to one evil act and then overwhelmed when its consequences proliferated beyond control when you chose an act you chose the consequences of that act hello lucas illyan said his eyes were amazingly cold sir haroche scrambled up and stood emptyhanded colonel dr weddell if you please miles waved them forward and motioned the forensics tech in their immediate wake he himself stood back a little on the other side of the group from where haroche stood when he looked up their eyes accidentally met and both looked quickly away avoiding an unfortunate intimacy this is my moment of triumph why isnt it more fun the motions were all as choreographed and practiced as a dance by now the colonel finished dislodging the grille weddell sprayed an excruciating few seconds wait then the red fluorescence glowed bright and malicious as the black light transmuted the invisible into something resembling blood general allegre miles sighed you are now the acting chief of impsec pending emperor gregors approval i am sorry to inform you that your first duty is the arrest of your predecessor general haroche by my order as an imperial auditor on the serious charge of what sabotage treason stupidity the criminal secretly wants to get caught so ran the popular wisdom not true miles thought the criminal just wants to get away it was the sinner who sought to be brought to light on the long crawl back through confession to absolution and some sort of grace however shattered was haroche a criminal or a sinner on the capital charge of treason miles finished half the men in the room flinched at that last word not treason haroche whispered hoarsely never treason miles opened his hand but if he is willing to confess and cooperate possibly a lesser charge of assault on a superior officer a courtmartial a year in prison a simple dishonorable discharge i think i will let the service court sort that one out by the looks on their faces both haroche and allegre caught the nuances of that speech allegre was galenis superior after all and doubtless had been following the case against his subordinate in detail haroches jaw tightened allegre smiled in acid appreciation may i suggest miles went on to allegre that you march him downstairs and have him trade places with your top analyst for the moment while you play catchup yes my lord auditor allegres voice was firm and determined though he had a moments pause when he realized he had no husky sergeants to do the official handson arresting miles thought eighttoone was odds enough but he forbore making suggestions it was allegres job now allegre after a quick glance at illyan gave him no clues solved his problem by drafting ivanwhat was it about ivanthe colonel and the commodore lucas are you going to give me any trouble i think not sighed haroche his eyes surveyed the room but there were no handy high windows inviting a quick resolution four floors headfirst to the pavement im too old to be that athletic anymore good me too allegre escorted him out illyan watched them go he remarked in an undertone to miles this is a damned sad business impsec really needs to start some new traditions for changing its chiefs assassination and retribution is so disruptive to the organization miles could only shrug agreement he led the way for a quick survey of nearby briefing rooms and found the opened vent missing its filter in the second they tried he oversaw the forensics techs careful bagging and documenting of the last pieces of evidence and sealed the whole set with his auditors seal and sent them down to wait in the evidence rooms for whatever aftermaths eventually unfolded everything from here on out was thank god beyond his mandate as an acting imperial auditor his responsibilities ended with his report to gregor and the turning over of any evidence hed accumulated to the proper prosecuting authorities in this case in all probability the service court i only have to find the truth i dont have to figure out what to do with it though he supposed any recommendations he made would bear weight finished in the office of domestic affairs and unhurried at last he and illyan strolled side by side down the corridor after the tech i wonder how haroche will try to play this miles wondered aloud hope to be assigned a good defender and try to tough it out he spent so much time and effort himself doctoring the comconsole evidencewhich was i think all that distracted him from thinking of those damned filters before i didi thought hed cry plant first thing or will he fall back on the old vorish solution he looked pretty pale there at the end he folded quicker than i thought he would you hit him harder than you thought you had you dont know your own strength miles but no i dont think suicide is lucass way said illyan and anyway its difficult to arrange without cooperation from his jailers do you believe i ought to hint for such cooperation miles asked delicately dyings easy illyans drawn features grew distant how much did he remember of his agonized pleading to miles for an easy death so few weeks ago livings hard let the son of a bitch stand his courtmartial every last eternal minute of it ah breathed miles the new impsec hq detention area was a lot smaller than the old one but shared the design of a single entrance and prisoner processing area at the front comconsole desk they found captain galeni delia koudelka by his side just completing his exit documentation under the eye of general allegre and the duty officer ivan looked on haroche it appeared had already been processed in miles hoped hed been given galenis cell galeni was still in the dress greens hed worn to gregor s reception now very rumpled he was unshaven redeyed and pale from lack of sleep a dangerous tension still hung about him like a fog he swung on his heel to face miles as he and illyan entered goddammit vorkosigan where were you all this time ah miles ticked his auditors chain to remind galeni he was still on duty galeni snapped goddammit my lord auditor where the hell were you all this time you said last night youd follow on thought you were going to let me out then i didnt know what the hell to think im quitting this frigging paranoid stupid organization just as soon as i get out of this rattank no more allegre winced delia touched galenis hand he grasped hers and his roiling boil visibly settled to a milder simmer well i had this seizure and then i had to sort through haroches misdirection with the comconsole report and then i had to get weddell from his lab at the imperial science institute and he took forever and i didnt dare contact anyone by comconsole from vorkosigan house i had to go in person and yes im sorry im afraid it took me all day to assemble the evidence to clear you miles said illyan its only been five days since this was discovered to be sabotage its going to take you longer to assemble your auditors report than it did for you to solve the case reports sighed miles yech but duv see it wasnt enough for me to order your release id have been accused of favoritism thats true murmured ivan at first i thought haroche was just being clumsy to have you arrested at the imperial residence in front of so many people ha not him it was beautifully choreographed to destroy your reputation after that neither release nor acquittal for insufficient evidence would have removed suspicion from most mens minds i had to nail the real culprit it was the only way ah galenis brows drew down miles just who was the real culprit oh didnt you tell him yet miles asked delia you told me not to say anything about it till you were done delia protested we just now got out of that dreadful little cell they arent as dreadful as the old cells illyan objected mildly i remember those spent a month under arrest in em myself thirteen years ago he cast a slightly sour smile at miles something about the lord regents sons private army and a certain treason charge with all the things youve forgotten i could wish youd have forgotten that murmured miles no such luck illyan murmured back i had them converted to evidence storage and the new detention area built right after much upgraded just in case i ever ended up in them again galeni stared at illyan id never heard that story in retrospectmuch lateri came to consider it a salutary experience i fancied afterwards that every senior impsec officer ought to undergo something similar for the same reason every doctor ought just once to be a patient it sharpens ones perspectives galeni was silent a moment obviously processing this his dangerous air of rage was almost fully dissipated ivan covertly let out his breath allegre after directing a grateful halfsmile at illyan looked on it was haroche miles added he wanted a promotion galenis brows shot up he wheeled to general allegre who nodded confirmation as soon as those bioengineered prokaryotes were discovered miles went on haroche lost his chance of his sabotage passing undetected which im sure was his firstchoice scenario at that point he had to have a goat it didnt have to be a perfect goat as long as he was able to generate enough fog to justify stopping the search for another he disliked me you had the right profile he hit upon a way to take us both down at once sorry i made delia keep you in the dark but arresting the acting head of impsec in the middle of impsec hq proved to be a bit tricky i didnt want to make any promises till i was sure how it was going to come out galenis eyes were wide forget what i said does that include the part about resigning your commission allegre asked anxiously i dont know why me id never thought haroche was particularly prejudiced against komarrans how much longer am i going to have to wade through this kind of crap what more do they want from me to prove my loyalty i expect youll be wading for the rest of your life illyan answered seriously but every komarran who follows you will have less crap to deal with because of you youve come so far miles pleaded dont let a cockroach like haroche waste your sacrifices the imperium needs your perspectives impsec particularly desperately needs your perspectives because its part of impsecs job to give much of the imperial government its picture of the world if we get straight truth in maybe weve got half a chance of getting good judgment out no damn chance otherwise thats for sure allegre seconded this with a nod besidesmiles glanced at delia who was following all this in deep alarmvorbarr sultana is a very nice posting for any ambitious officer look at the people you meet here for one thing and the opportunities ivan nodded vigorously miles went on um not to interfere in impsecs internal business or anything but i think the department of komarran affairs is going to need a new head man very soon he glanced at allegre the old one being about to inherit a much worse job ysee allegre looked startled then thoughtful a komarran to head komarran affairs radical miles purred but it just might work both allegre and illyan gave him the same quelling look miles subsided besides allegre went on i think youre premature lord vorkosigan its by no means assured that gregor will confirm me as permanent chief of impsec who else is there miles shrugged olshansky isnt seasoned enough yet and the galactic affairs head likes his old job very well thank you with this imperial marriage coming up at long last your depth of experience in komarran matters makes you nearly ideal id say be that as it may allegre looked a little daunted were the full implications just starting to seep in thats tomorrows worry i have enough for today gentlemen will you excuse me i think i had better start with a quick survey of haroches illyans of whatevers waiting in the infile of that comconsole upstairs and and a meeting of department heads to apprise them of hm events any suggestions simon illyan shook his head carry on youll be fine duv allegre continued to galeni at least go home and get dinner and a good nights sleep before you make any important decisions will you promise me that all right sir said galeni in a neutral tone delia squeezed his hand he had not loosened his grip upon her miles noticed the whole time theyd been standing there talking he wasnt risking letting this one get away once he relaxed a bit he would perhaps realize that it would take at least four large men with handtractors to pry her off his arm foolhardy large men ivan noting this byplay at last frowned faintly do you wish to report to gregor first my lord auditor or shall i allegre added ill take care of it you should check in with him as soon as youve triaged your situation upstairs though yes thank you they exchanged sketchy salutes and allegre hurried out are you calling gregor now asked galeni right from here miles said its urgent i let him know whats happened since i couldnt give him any hint of it earlier the impsec chiefs office monitors all of his communications when you do galeni glanced at delia and away though his grip on her hand tightened again will you be sure to will you please ask him to be sure to let laisa know that i am no traitor first thing miles promised my word on it thank you miles detailed a guard to make sure galeni and delia got to the outer door without any laststraw harassment and lent delia the use of martin and the groundcar to convey them to galenis nearby flat miles retained ivan spiking ivans ingenuous offer to see galeni settled and take delia on to her home by pointing out that ivans groundcar was still parked at ops hq then he booted the duty officer from his comconsole station and took it over illyan drew up another station chair by his side to look on miles entered a particular codecard into the comconsoles readslot sire miles said formally when gregors upper body appeared over the vid plate the emperor was wiping his mouth with a dinner napkin gregors brows twitched up at the officiality miles had all his attention yes my lord auditor progress problems im finished good god ah would you care to elaborate on that youll get all the detailsmiles glanced aside at illyanin my report but briefly youre out one provisional chief of impsec it was never galeni it was haroche himself i figured out that the prokaryote vector encapsulations had to be trapped in the air filters did he confess this better we caught him trying to switch the filter in his old office which was where hed apparently dosed illyan i take it this event did not occur by chance miles s lips drew back in a wolfish grin chance he intoned favors the prepared mind as somebody or another said no not by chance gregor sat back looking very disturbed he delivered my impsec daily report to me in person just this morning and all the time he knew i was almost ready to confirm him as impsecs permanent chief miless lips twisted yeah and he would have been a good one almost look um i promised duv galeni i would have you tell laisa he was no traitor will you redeem my word for me of course she was extremely distressed by last nights scene haroches explanations threw us all into the most painful doubt lucas always was smooth murmured illyan why did he do it asked gregor i have a great many questions i still want answers to before i sit down to assemble my report said miles and most of them seem to start with why its the most interesting question of all and the hardest to answer illyan warned where what how who for those i could at least sometimes make physical evidence speak why was almost theological and often proved beyond my scope theres so much that only haroche can tell us said miles but we cant use fastpenta on the bastard mores the pity i think we might get something out of him if we hit him tonight while hes still offbalance by tomorrow hell have recovered his considerable wits and be demanding a military defender and standing pat no not we its clear he hates my guts though once again why simon can you are you up to running an interrogation for me illyan rubbed his hand over his face i can try but if he was willing to take me out i dont see why he wont be willing to stand up to any moral pressure i can bring to bear gregor seemed to study his hands interlaced before him on his comconsole then looked up wait he said i have a better idea chapter twentyseven do i really have to watch this ivan muttered to miless ear as their little party trod down the heavily monitored corridor to haroches cell it promises to be pretty unpleasant yes for two reasons you have been my official witness throughout and will doubtless have to give all kinds of testimony under oath later and neither illyan nor i are physically capable of overpowering haroche if he decides to go berserk you expect him to not really but gregor thinks the presence of a regular guardone of haroches own former menwould inhibit his um frankness tough it out ivan you dont have to talk only listen too right the impsec guard coded open the cell door and stood back respectfully miles entered first the new impsec detention cells were not exactly spacious but miles had seen worse they did have individual if monitored bathrooms the cell still smelled like a military prison though the worst of both worlds two bunks lined the narrow chamber on either side haroche was seated upon one still in the uniform trousers and shirt hed been wearing a scant halfhour ago not yet degraded to prisonersorange smock and pajama pants but he was without his tunic and boots stripped of all signs of his rank and minus his silver eyes miles could feel the absence of those eyes like two burning scars on haroche s neck haroches face as he looked up and saw miles was closed and hostile ivan followed and took up a stand beside the door present but detached as illyan entered haroches expression grew embarrassed and even more closed and miles was suddenly reminded that the root word of mortification meant death only when emperor gregor tall and grave ducked inside did haroches face escape control shock and dismay gave way to a flash of open anguish haroche took a breath and tried to look cold and stern but only succeeded in looking congealed he scrambled to his feetivan tensedbut only said sire in a cracked voice he had either not enough nerve or better sense than to salute his commanderinchief under these circumstances gregor did not look likely to return it gregor motioned his pair of personal armsmen to wait outside miles didnt expect to be of much direct use if haroche exploded into some attack on the emperor but at least he might throw himself between the two men by the time haroche stopped to kill him the reinforcements would arrive the cell door slid closed miles imagined he felt pressure in his ears like an air lock the silence and sense of isolation in here were profound miles after a thoughtful calculation of the angles and forces took up a stance like ivans on the opposite side of the cell door on the extreme available edge of haroches personal space they would be quiet as a mismatched pair of gargoyles and in time haroche would forget their presence gregor would see to that gregor seated himself on the bunk opposite haroche illyan arms folded leaned against the wall as only he could do an eyeofhorus personified sit down lucas said gregor so quietly miles had to strain to hear haroches hands opened as if in anticipation of protest but his knees buckled he sat heavily sire he murmured again and cleared his throat ah yes gregor was right in his estimations general haroche gregor went on i wanted you to give me your last report in person you owe me that and for the thirty years of service you have given menearly my whole life my whole reigni owe you that what haroche swallowed do you want me to say tell me what you have done tell me why begin at the beginning go on to the end put in all the facts leave out all the defenses your time for that will come later it could scarcely be simpler or more overwhelming miles had seen gregor quietly socially charming quietly bravurafey quietly desperate quietly determined hed never before seen him quietly angry it was impressive a weight all around like deep seawater you could drown in it still trying to strike upward to the air weasel out of that haroche if you can gregor is not our master only in name haroche sat silent for as long as he dared then began i had known about the komarran prokaryotes for a long time since the beginning diamant of komarran affairs told me we were coordinating on the sweep of ser galens little group of saboteurs lending men and help back and forth in the crisis i was with him the day he put the capsules away downstairs didnt think anything more about it for years then i won my promotion to head of domestic affairs the yarrow case do you remember that sir this to illyan you said my work on it was superb no lucas illyans voice was falsely pleasant cant say as i do the silence after that threatened to extend itself for rather a long time continue said gregor i began to be more and more aware of vorkosigan in and out of impsec hq there were rumors about him some pretty wild stories that he was some sort of galactic affairs hotshot that he was being groomed as illyans successor it was very clear that he was illyans pet then last year he was suddenly killed though as it turned out not quite dead enough a slight tic of his lip was all the expression gregor allowed himself after a glance at him haroche hurried on for whatever reason during that period illyan reorganized his chain of command clarified his line of succession i was made secondincommand of impsec he told me he was thinking of choosing a new successor in case anyone actually succeeded in dropping him in his tracks and i was it then vorkosigan turned up alive again didnt hear anything more about him one way or another till this last midsummer then illyan asked me if i thought i could stand to work with vorkosigan as my second in domestic affairs warned me he was hyperactive and insubordinate as hell but that he got results said id either love him or hate him though some people did both he said vorkosigan needed a dose of my experience i said id try the implication was pretty clear i wouldnt have minded training my replacement being asked to train my boss was a little hard to swallow thirty years of experience jumped over but i swallowed it gregors attention was wholly on haroche and haroches perforce wholly on gregor it was as if gregor generated his own little personal forcebubble just like those used by a cetagandan hautlady with only the two of them inside haroche grew more intense leaning forward his knee almost touching gregors then vorkosigan shot his foot off so to speak good and proper i didnt have to do him he did himself better than i could ever have imagined he was out i was in i had my chance back but illyan was good for another five years maybe ten theres more young hotshots coming up all the time now while i was still at my peak i wanted my chance illyan was getting stale you could see it feel it getting tired he kept talking about retiring but he never did anything i wanted to serve the imperium serve you sire i knew i could if i got my chance in time in my time and then i thought of that damned komarran powder just when did you think of it that afternoon when vorkosigan came stumbling out of illyans office with his eyes torn off i went down to the evidence rooms on another matter walked right by that shelf as id done a hundred times before but this time i opened the box and pocketed two capsules it was no trouble walking out with them it was the box that was screamertagged not its contents of course i wasnt searched i knew id have to do something about the monitors eventually but even if someone had visually checked them all they would see was me authorized to take anything i wanted we know where when did you administer the prokaryotes to illyan it was a few days later three four days haroches hand jerked in air miles could imagine the stream of tan smoke spinning from his fingers he was always popping into my office to check out facts to get my opinion did you use both capsules then not then nothing seemed to be happening for about a week so i dosed him again i hadnt realized how slowly the symptoms were going to show or how severely but i knew it wouldnt kill him i thought it wouldnt anyway i wanted to be sure it was an impulse and then it was too late to back out an impulse gregor raised his eyebrows devastatingly after three days of premeditation impulse miles broke his own long silence does work as slowly as that sometimes particularly when youre having a really bad idea i should know gregor motioned him to desist miles bit his tongue when did you decide to frame captain galeni gregor asked sternly i didnt not then i didnt want to frame anyone but if i had to i wanted to get vorkosigan he was perfect for it there was a kind of justice in it hed damn near got away with murder in that business with the courier id have courtmartialed the hyper little dwarf but he was still illyans pet even after all that mess then he turned up on my front doorstep with that damned auditors chain around his neck and i realized he wasnt just illyans pet haroches eyes meeting gregors at last were accusing gregors eyes were very very cool go on he said utterly neutral the little git wouldnt leave it alone he pushed and pushedif id been able to hold him off one more week id never have had to frame anyone at all it was vorkosigan forced my hand but it was clear by then vorkosigan was fireproof id never make it stick to him galeni was around him he caught my attention i realized his suspect profile was even better than vorkosigans he wasnt my first choice but he was a lot more disposable he was a potential embarrassment to the empresstobe if nothing else who would miss him gregor had grown so neutral as to seem almost gray so thats what rage looks like on him miles wondered if haroche realized what gregors extreme lack of expression meant the general seemed caught up in his own words indignant speaking faster now the little git still wouldnt give it up three dayshe found those capsules in the evidence room in three days it was supposed to have taken him three months i couldnt believe it i thought i could get him to run all the way to jacksons whole and back but he stuck tight to me all hours of the day or night id turn around and there hed be under my elbow all over my building i had to get rid of him before i strangled him so i advanced the timetable on galeni as much as i dared and delivered him giftwrapped and the little git still wouldnt give it up so i gave him the bait he was hungry for i was sure hed swallow that one i practically stuffed it down his throat but he was salivating so hard by that time the next thing i turn around hes back in my office with that damned arrogant galactic biobird with those frigging filters apart and im down here and hes up haroche paused for breath gregor blinked what bait aw hell haroche you dont have to go into that really when haroche did not reply gregors gaze turned to miles what bait he asked with deceptive mildness miles cleared his throat he offered me the dendarii he said i could go back to work for him on the same terms i used to work for simon oh better he threw in a captaincy three nearly identical astonished stares seemed to pin him to the wall you did not mention this to me said illyan at last no you didnt mention it to me either said gregor no you mean you didnt say yes asked ivan in a stunned voice no yes whatever why not said illyan after what seemed like a full minute didnt think i could prove it was a bribe no i mean i know what a bribe it is god knows you dont have to demonstrate that to me said illyan why didnt you take it and give up galeni to him as a goat and let him run impsec for the next ten twenty years knowing what i knew about him how long dyou think it would have been before he stopped just reporting to gregor and began manipulating him through his reports or more directly for his own good of course and the good of the imperium i would not i would have served you well sire haroche insisted his head bent his voice low gregor frowned deeply hell let him have his denial miles would no more have tried to wrest it from him than he would have tried to take a log from a drowning man he didnt want anything more from haroche not more confession not even revenge he didnt even need to hate him back miles might grieve for the honest haroche of midsummer now lost the haroche of winterfair had chosen his fate you have no mass and cannot move me im tired and i want my dinner are we done yet he sighed gregor sat back im afraid so youre acting like it was murder and it wasnt it wasnt treason haroche insisted you must see that sire try im sorry give up on justification go for mercy youd be surprised what can happen simon wasnt even hurt very deliberately gregor rose and turned his back on him haroches mouth opened on more desperate defenses which did not emerge but seemed to clot there illyan famous for silken verbal venom looked as if he couldnt think of anything to say scathing enough as soon as gregor motioned the door open and ducked through ivan scooted out after him illyan waited for miles by sheer habit not letting him turn his back on a potential hazard unguarded and followed him into the corridor the door hissed closed on haroches last choked protests cutting them off as abruptly as a blade to his throat they were all silent until they reached the processing area again then illyan remarked id thought that crack about wrestling with temptation was a joke best two falls out of three simon it was that close i really dont want to talk about it he did try to bribe one of my auditors then said gregor its a capital charge i dont think i want to try to explain it to a military court sire haroche has enough on his plate he can scarcely be more ruined let it go please if you wish my lord auditor gregor had a strange look on his face staring down at miles miles shifted uncomfortably it wasnt surprise or amazement which would have unraveled to an insult after all awe surely not what stopped you i too want to know why you know you owe me that much i dont quite know how to put it he searched for and rather to his surprise found that odd calm place inside still there it helped some prices are just too high no matter how much you may want the prize the one thing you cant trade for your hearts desire is your heart oh said gregor illyan had estimated the time to compose the auditors report would be equal to the time it had taken to crack the case this turned out to be optimistic he hadnt factored in the interruptions miles spent most of the following week holed up in his bedroom shoving masses of data files and words around on his comconsole after identifying all the missing pieces he trudged back and forth to impsec hq to confer with forensics the clinic and a halfdozen other departments to record depositions or to closet himself with general allegre he made one trip out of vorbarr sultana to collect extra medical testimony from admiral avakli he rechecked everything this was one report he didnt want to see floating back on a tide of clarification queries even if they would lack illyans acerbic marginalia miles was in deep concentration composing a brief neutrally worded account of haroches stonewalling and misdirection during the peak of illyans medical crisis and cursing himself for every clue he had missedoh haroche had handled him all right handled them allwhen ivan barged in unannounced to demand loudly do you realize whats been going on in your guest suite miles groaned and ran his hands through his hair waved ivan to silence tried and failed to remember the brilliant way hed been going to finish that paragraph gave up and shut down his comconsole you dont need to bellow i am not bellowing said ivan im being firm could you please be firm at a lower volume no simon illyan is sleeping with my mother and its your fault i dont think it is somehow its happening in your house anyway youve got some kind of responsibility for the consequences what consequences i dont know what consequences i dont know what the hell im supposed to do about it should i start calling illyan da or challenge him to a duel well you might start by considering the possibility that its none of your business they are grownups last i checked theyre old miles its its its undignified or something scandalous shes high vor and hes hes illyan in a class by himself miles grinned i shouldnt anticipate much scandal if i were you i had the impression they were being reasonably um discreet your mother does everything in good taste besides her being her and him being him who would dare comment its embarrassing after gregors betrothal ceremony and before things start to gear up for the wedding mama told me theyre going to take a vacation on the south coast for a halfmonth together some middleclass prole resort i never heard of that illyan picked because hed never heard of it either and any place thats never once come to the attention of impsec was all right by him she says after the betrothal she wants to sit in a beach chair in the sun all day and not do anything and drink those disgusting drinks with the fruit on a stick in them and all nightshe saidshes sure theyll be able to think of something to do good god miles my own mother how did you think she got to be your mother they didnt have uterine replicators on barrayar back then that was thirty years ago time enough south coast huh it sounds relaxing downright placid in fact warm it was sleeting in vorbarr sultana this morning maybe he could persuade illyan to tell him the name of the place and once he had this bloody report off his hands but miles had no one to go on holiday with but ivan just at present and that wasnt the same thing at all if it really bothers you i suppose you could talk to my mother i tried shes betan she thinks its just great good for your cardiovascular system and endorphin production and all that she and my mother probably plotted it all out together come to think of it possibly look on the bright side chances are aunt alysll be so occupied with her own lovelife she wont have any attention left over for trying to arrange yours isnt that what you said you always wanted yes but think back in the last month how much has she harassed you about courting eligible girls in the last month weve all been pretty busy how many of her acquaintances childrens betrothals weddings or new babies has she described in detail well none now you mention it except gregors of course longest shes ever gone without inflicting the high vor vital statistics roll call on me even when i was doing duty at our embassy on earth shed message twice a month count your blessings ivan ivans mouth screwed up fruit he muttered on little sticks it took miles a full hour to recover his concentration after evicting ivan he did make practical use of the disruption by calling dr chenko at impmil and finally setting up his appointment to calibrate the seizurecontrol device chenko seemed quite anxious to find out if it was going to work miles tried not to feel like a large bipedal lab rat he was getting ready to step out the front door of vorkosigan house for that appointment the next afternoon when he encountered illyan just coming in it was snowing and white flakes clung to illyan s civilian jacket and dusted his thinning hair his face was red with cold and exhilarated he appeared to be alone where have you been miles asked he craned his neck as the door swung shut but didnt see lady alys or a guard or any other companion departing the entryway i took a walk around town by yourself miles tried to keep the alarm out of his voice after all this to lose the man and have to rout out the municipal guard to go hunting for him to find him wandering frightened or bewildered and embarrassed in some oddball corner of the city you got back all right it seems yes illyan positively grinned he held out his hand and displayed the holocube clutched there your lady mother gave me a map it has the entire north and south continents and all the populated islands every city and town and street and mountain range down to the onemeter scale now whenever i get lost i can find my own way back most people use maps simon im an idiot why didnt i think of that before this its been so long since i had to it didnt even occur to me its like an eidetic chip you can hold in your hand it even remembers things you never knew before wonderful he unfastened his jacket and pulled a second device from an inner pocket a perfectly ordinary though obviously bestquality business audionote filer she gave me this too it crossreferences everything automatically by key word crude but perfectly adequate for ordinary use its nearly a prosthetic memory miles the man hadnt had to even think about taking notes for the past thirtyfive years after all what was he going to discover next fire writing agriculture all you have to remember is where you put it down im thinking of chaining it to my belt or possibly around my neck illyan started up the curving stairs toward the guest suite chuckling under his breath the following evening miles broke away from his now almost crosseyed rechecking of his comconsole data to attend a quiet dinner at home just himself the countess and illyan he spent the first half of the meal firmly squelching the countesss broad hints that perhaps ma kosti might be made interested in emigrating to sergyar in which case a place for her could certainly be found on the viceroys household staff shell never leave vorbarr sultana while her sons posted here miles asserted the countess looked thoughtful corporal kosti could be transferred to sergyar no fighting dirty he said hurriedly i found her first shes mine it was an idea she smiled fondly at him speaking of sergyar when is father arriving from there the day before the betrothal well leave together shortly afterwards well return for the wedding at midsummer of course id love to stay longer but we really both need to get back to chaos colony the shorter his stay in vorbarr sultana the less likely hell be to get nailed for new jobs by old political comrades thats one advantage of sergyar they have a harder time getting at him there one still turns up about every month full of ideas for things aral can do in his nonexistent spare time and we have to wine and dine him and shove him gently back out the door she smiled invitingly across the table at him you really should come and visit us there soon its perfectly safe we have an effective treatment for those revolting worms now you know much better than the old surgical removal theres so much to see and do especially do there was something universal miles reflected about the sinister light in the eye of a mother with a long list of chores in her hand well see i expect to have my part of this auditors investigation wrapped up for gregor in a few more days after that im not quite sure what im going to do with myself a short silence fell while everybody applied themselves appreciatively to the dessert course at length illyan cleared his throat and announced to the countess i signed the lease on my new flat today cordelia it will be ready for occupancy tomorrow oh splendid i want to thank you both especially you miles for your hospitality and your help what flat asked miles im afraid ive been living inside my comconsole this week quite right lady alys helped me find it is it in her building and a very exclusive venue that was too could illyan afford it a viceadmirals halfpay was merely decent though come to think of it he had to have amassed considerable savings by now given the enforced simplicity of his workdevoured former life i feel i am less of a menace to my neighbors than i used to be but just in case some old enemy has bad aim its a couple of streets away from her it might not be a bad idea to float a few rumors that i am more mentally incapacitated than i actually am should you get the chance it will make me a less exciting target do you think youll be continuing any impsec service if not as chief then i dont know consultant or something no now that my hm peculiar assassination has been solved ill be opting out dont look so shocked miles fortyfive years of imperial service does not qualify as a career cut tragically short i suppose not gregor will miss you we all will oh i expect ill be around miles finished his auditors report late the following afternoon including the table of contents and the crossreferenced index and sat back in his comconsole chair and stretched it was as complete as he could make it and as straightforward as his indignation with the central crime would allow he only now realized looking over the finished product just how much subtle spin he used to put on even his most truthful dendarii field reports making the dendarii and admiral naismith look good to assure the continued flow of funding and assignments there was a dry serenity in not having to give a damn what lord auditor vorkosigan looked like that he quite enjoyed this report was for gregors eyes first not for gregors eyes only miles had been on the other end of that stick having to devise dendarii missions on the basis of all sorts of dubious or incomplete intelligence he was determined that no poor sod who had to make practical use of the report later would have cause to curse him as he had so often cursed others he decanted the final version onto a codecard and called gregors secretary to arrange a formal appointment the following morning to turn it and his chain of office and seal over to the emperor he then rose for a muscleunkinking stroll around vorkosigan house with an eye to checking his lightflyer chenko had promised the final surgical installation of his seizurecontrol device possibly as early as tomorrow afternoon martin whose longawaited birthday had gone by unnoticed by miles sometime during the recent crisis had delayed his application to the imperial service an extra couple of weeks to save miles having to break in an interim driver but miles knew exactly how anxious the boy was to be gone illyan and his scant belongings had been carried off most helpfully by lady alys in her car this morning and the countesss household staff had restored the guest suite to its original if slightly sterile order miles wandered through it to stare out onto the snowy back garden and be glad he wasnt frozen in a cryochamber this really was the most splendid set of rooms in vorkosigan house with by far the best windows miles remembered the chambers from his grandfathers day jammed with military memorabilia thick with the formidable scent of old books old leather and the old man he gazed around the suites cleanswept emptiness why not he murmured then more loudly why the hell not his mother found him half an hour later leading a pressganged troop consisting of martin and half her retainers they were carrying all miless possessions down one flight and around the corner from the other wing and spreading them through the bathroom bedroom sitting room and study under miless somewhat random direction miles love what are you doing taking over grandfathers rooms nobody else is using them now why not he waited a little nervously for some objection from her mentally marshaling his defensive arguments oh good idea its about time you got out of that little room upstairs youve been in it since you were five for heavens sake thats what i thought we only picked that one for you because illyan calculated it had the most disadvantageous angle for anyone trying to lob a projectile through the window i see he cleared his throat and emboldened added i thought id take over the whole second floor the yellow parlor the other guest rooms and all i might entertain have people in something you can have the whole place when were off to sergyar yeah but i want a space even when youre here i never needed it before i was never around i know now youre here and im gone life is odd like that sometimes she wandered away humming with that many porters the moving job only took an hour spread out into a more reasonable area his life made a thin layer there was at least a metric ton of admiral naismith s possessions back with the dendarii fleet which miles supposed he ought to retrieve somehow no one else was likely to be able to use his clothing or his customized space armor after all he wandered about rearranging things trying to guess how he would use them here it was all wonderfully unconstrained he felt a sympathetic twinge of identification with those rootbound plants that had waited too long to be moved to bigger pots not that he was exactly planning to vegetate spacer quinn would call him a dirtsucker quinn would be halfright he owed her a message he owed her several and a major apology for setting her couple of more recent queries aside in the rush of recent events he settled himself at his newly moved comconsole the city lights reflected in an amber haze from the cloudy sky the back garden seen out his wide study window was luminous and soft in the snowy night he composed his face and his thoughts and began he recorded cheerful reassurances medical and otherwise and sent it by tightbeam shed receive it in a week or so depending on where the dendarii fleet was now rather to his surprise a task that had seemed impossible earlier came easily now maybe hed only needed to free his brain chapter twentyeight miles decided to make a little ceremony out of returning his auditors chain and seal to gregor along with the report the traditional dignity of the office seemed to demand something more than just handing them back through the residence door in a plastic bag so he dressed in his brownandsilver house uniform again with all due care he hesitated a long time before attaching his military decorations to his tunic perhaps for the last time but he was planning to ask gregor for a very personal favor and he would rather the decorations spoke for him than having to speak for himself he had qualms about that favor it was only a little thing taken all in all and he felt obscurely that he ought to be rising above such petty concerns but it mattered to him like that extra centimeter of height that no one else noticed he had martin deliver him to the residences east portico as before martin missed clipping gregors gates this time his handling of the counts old groundcar was really vastly improved miles was ushered once again into gregor s office in the north wing by gregors majordomo gregor too must have had some ceremonial duties on his agenda this morning for he was turned out in his vorbarra house uniform in his usual sharp style that was the envy of all vor lords with less superior valets he was waiting for miles at his blank comconsole his attention undivided by any data display good morning my lord auditor gregor smiled good morning sire miles responded automatically he laid down the data card in its security case on the smooth black glass of the desk carefully pulled the chain and seal over his head and let the heavy links spill through his hands before clinking them gently to the surface there you go all done thank you at a motion from the emperor the majordomo brought miles a chair miles seated himself and licked his lips mentally thumbing through the several choices of opening lines hed rehearsed for his request but gregor waved a small waitplease to both miles and his majordomo and both necessarily waited he opened the security case and ran the data card through his comconsoles readslot then he handed it in its opened case to his majordomo saying you can take this next door now please yes sire the majordomo departed carrying the report on a small plate like a servitor delivering some strange dessert gregor sped through a scan of miless auditors report saying nothing more to indicate his opinion than a muttered huh now and then miless brows rose slightly and he settled back in his chair gregor went back to the beginning and examined selected sections more slowly at last he finished and let the data display fold back into itself and disappear he picked up the auditors chain and let it turn in the light fingering the vorbarra arms incised into the gold this was one of my more fortunate snap decisions i must say miles miles shrugged chance put me in a place where i had some useful expertise was it chance i seem to recall it was intent the sabotage of illyan s chip was an inside job you needed an impsec insider to unravel it all a lot of other men might have done what i did no gregor eyed him measuringly i think i needed a former impsec insider and i cant offhand think of any other man i know with both the passion and the dispassion to do what you did miles gave up arguing about it he only needed to be polite not ingenuous besides he might never get a better straightline upon which to open his plea thank you gregor he took a breath ive been thinking about an appropriate reward for a job well done the emperor added miles let out his breath again oh the traditional one is another job i happen to have an opening for a new chief of imperial security this week neutrally miles cleared his throat so do you want it while it has traditionally been held by a serving military officer there is no law whatsoever saying i cant appoint a civilian to the task no gregor raised his brows at this concise certainty truly he asked softly truly miles said firmly im not playing hardtoget its a desk job stuffed with the most tedious routine in between the terrorweeks and the chief of impsec not only almost never gets offplanet further than komarr he scarcely ever gets out of cockroout of impsec hq i would hate it i think you could do it i think i could do almost anything i had to do if you ordered it gregor is this an order no gregor sat back it was a genuine question then you have my genuine answer guy allegre is much better fitted than i am for this job he has the downside and the bureaucratic experience and hes well respected on komarr as well as on barrayar he is fully engaged with his work and cares a lot about it but hes not distorted by ambition hes the right age neither too young nor too old no one will question his appointment gregor smiled slightly thats what i thought youd say actually what is this then some sort of spiritual exercise i think ive had all of those i want for a while thanks his heart still seemed to ache the way an overstrained muscle twinged when one put weight on it like muscle strain it would pass with a little rest he suspected no said gregor just a courtesy i wanted to give you first refusal he did not ask again which saved miles the embarrassment of refusing him again instead he leaned forward and put down the gold chain and played with it a moment arranging the links in a smooth oval pattern then he asked would you like some coffee tea breakfast no thanks something stronger no thanks i have a spot of brain surgery scheduled for this afternoon dr chenko is ready to install his controlledseizure chip it looks like its going to work im not supposed to eat anything beforehand ah good its about time yes i can hardly wait to get back in my lightflyer will you miss the egregious martin a little i think he grew on me gregor glanced again at his office door was he waiting for something now was a good time for miles s request gregor i wanted to ask you the door to gregors office slid aside and the majordomo entered at gregors nod he turned back to the corridor and said if you will my lords he stepped back respectfully four men entered gregors office miles recognized them at once he was barrayaran enough that his first thought was a consciencestricken my god what have i done wrong good sense reasserted itself his feats of evil would have had to have been downright heroic to rate the attention of four imperial auditors at one time still it was unusual as well as unnerving to see so many auditors in one room miles cleared his throat and sat up straighter and exchanged polite vorish greetings with them as gregors majordomo hurried to arrange seats for them all around gregors desk lord vorhovis was back from komarr it appeared in his early sixties he was the youngest of the crowd but with a formidable career behind him nonetheless soldier first then diplomat planetary ambassador and onetime assistant minister of finance he might be a model for duv galeni to emulate he was a cool lean sophisticated man very much in the modern style of vor lordmiles wondered if he shared gregors tailorand he carried miless data card case in his hand dr vorthys was one of the two recent appointees of gregors who was not in the military mold he was a professor emeritus of engineering failure analysis from vorbarr sultana university and had written the text on his subject several of them in fact he looked a professor stout whitehaired smiling rumpled with a noble nose and big ears late in his career he had become philosophically interested in the connections between sociopolitical and engineering integrity his addition to gregors array of auditors had brought in some welcome technical expertise not that the auditors exactly worked as a team lord vann vorgustafson chatting amiably with him was the other civilian a retired industrialist and noted philanthropist he was short and stouter than vorthys with a bristling gray beard and pink choleric face that alarmed observers about the state of his cardiovascular system surely the most financially unbribable of gregors auditors he routinely gave away money in lumps larger than the average man saw in his lifetime one wouldnt guess his wealth to look at him for he dressed like a workman if there were any workmen so lacking in colorsense admiral vorkalloner was an auditor of the more traditional type retired from the service after a long and impeccable career he seemed socially bland and was notably unaffiliated with any political party conservative or progressive as far as miles had heard tall and thick he seemed to take up a lot of space he nodded cordially to miles before taking a chair good morning so youre aral vorkosigans boy yes sir miles sighed havent seen you around much in the last ten years now i know why miles tried to work out whether that was a positive or negative statement seeing so many of them together miles gained a renewed sense of what an odd lot the auditors were all were experienced accomplished wealthy in their own right in other ways they were downright eccentric outside or perhaps above the norms more than fireproof they were gregors firemen vorhovis seated himself on the emperors left so gregor said to him what do you gentlemen think thisvorhovis leaned forward and laid the data case containing miless auditors report on the comconsoleis an extraordinary document gregor yes seconded vorthys concise coherent and complete do you know how rare that is i congratulate you on it young man do i get a good grade professor simon illyan trained me he didnt have much tolerance for slop if he didnt like my field reports hed fire them back to me for additions it got to be something of a hobby with him i think i could always tell when impsec hq was having a really slow week because my report would come back shot full of little query boxes with these dryly worded corrections for grammar and style ten years of that and you learn to do it right the first time vorkalloner smiled old vorsmydie he noted used to turn in handwritten plastic flimsys never more than two pages he insisted anything important could always be said in two pages illegibly handwritten muttered gregor we used to have to go and squeeze the footnotes out of him in person it became somewhat irritating added vorkalloner vorhovis with a gesture at the data case went on to miles you appear to have left the military prosecutor with very little to do nothing in fact said gregor allegre reported to me last night that haroche has given up and is going to plead guilty trying to reduce his sentence through cooperation well he could hardly have confessed to us and then turned around and tried to pretend innocence to a service judge i wouldnt have bet on that he did have nerve said miles but im glad to hear its not going to be dragged out it was a truly bizarre case vorhovis went on id been worried something might be very wrong when i first heard that illyan had gone down but i could not have unraveled the events as you did lord vorkosigan im sure you would have unraveled them in your own way sir said miles no said vorhovis he tapped the data case by my analysis the critical juncture was when you brought in that galactic biochemist dr weddell it was from that point that haroches plans began to go irretrievably wrong i would not have known of weddells existence and would have left the selection of the chip autopsy team entirely to admiral avakli avakli was good miles said uncertain if this was a criticism the biocyberneticist had done his best certainly wea circular wave of vorhoviss finger indicated the auditors there assembleddo not often work directly together but we do consult with one another what resources do you know of that i dont that might have a bearing on this problem it increases our access to odd knowledge fivefold fivefold i thought there were seven of you vorthys smiled faintly we think of general vorparadijs as a sort of auditor emeritus respected but we dont make him come to meetings anymore in fact muttered vorgustafson under his breath we dont even mention them to him and admiral valentine has been too frail for some years to actively participate vorhovis added i would have urged him to resign but as long as the gap left by the death of general vorsmythe was still unfilled there seemed no need to beg his space miles had been dimly aware of the loss two years ago of the eighth auditor the elderly vorsmythe the position of ninth auditor which miles had lately held was by tradition always left open for acting auditors men with particular expertise called up at the imperiums need and released again when their task was done so we four here vorhovis went on constitute a quorum of sorts vorlaisner couldnt be here hes tied up on south continent but ive kept him apprised that being so my lords said gregor how do you advise us vorhovis glanced around at his colleagues who gave him nods and pursed his lips judiciously hell do gregor thank you gregor turned to miles we were discussing job openings a bit ago it happens i also have a place this week for the position of eighth auditor do you want it miles swallowed shock thats a permanent post gregor auditors are appointed for life are you sure not necessarily for life they can resign be fired or impeached as well as be assassinated or just drop dead arent i a little young and hed just been feeling so old if you take it said vorhovis youll be the youngest imperial auditor in post timeofisolation history i looked it up general vorparadijs will surely disapprove as will likeminded men hell vorparadijs thinks im a mutant general vorparadijs said vorhovis thought i was too young for the job and i was fiftyeight when i was appointed now he can switch his disapproval to you i shall not miss it and along with ten years of quite unique impsec training you have more galactic experience than any three out of four of us in this room right now rather odd experience but very wideranging it will add a great deal of scope to our mutual data store have you ah read my personnel files general allegre was kind enough to lend us complete copies a few days ago vorhoviss glance swept miless chest and the commendations there fortunately for the hang of his tunic the imperial service did not also give out material symbols for ones demerits then you know there was a little problem with my last impsec field report a major problem he corrected himself he searched vorhoviss face for whatever judgment lurked there vorhoviss expression was grave but free of censure didnt he know miles looked around at all of them i almost killed one of our courier officers while i was having one of my seizures illyan discharged me for lying about it there that was as bald and flat and true as he could make it yes we and gregor spent several hours yesterday afternoon discussing that chief illyan sat in vorhoviss eyes narrowed and he regarded miles with the utmost seriousness given your falsification of that field report what kept you from also taking haroches extraordinary bribe i can almost guarantee no one would ever have figured it out haroche would have known galeni would have known and i would have known two can keep a secret if one of them is dead not three you would certainly have outlived captain galeni and you might have outlived haroche what then miles blew out his breath and answered slowly someone might have survived with my name in my body it wouldnt have been me anymore it would have been a man i didnt much like you value yourself do you lord vorkosigan ive learned to he admitted wryly then so perhaps shall we vorhovis sat back an oddly satisfied smile playing about his lips note said gregor as the most junior member of this rather eclectic group you will almost certainly be awarded the worst jobs so true murmured vorhovis a light in his eye it will be nice to pass that position off to someone more ah active every assignment gregor went on may be totally unrelated to any other unpredictable youll be tossed in to sink or swim not entirely unsupported objected vorthys the rest of us will be willing to call advice from shore now and then for some reason miles had a mental flash of the whole lot of them sitting in beach chairs holding drinks with fruit on little sticks awarding him judiciously discussed points for style as he went under frantically gulping and splashing the water filling his nose this wasnt the reward id been planning to ask for when i came in miles admitted feeling horribly confused people never followed your scripts never what reward was that asked gregor patiently i wanted i know this is going to sound idiotic i wanted to be retired retroactively from the imperial service as a captain not a lieutenant i know those postcareer promotions are sometimes done as a special reward usually with an eye to boosting some loyal officers halfpay grade during retirement i dont want the money i just want the title right hed said it it did sound idiotic but it was all true its been an itch i couldnt scratch hed always wanted his captaincy to come freely offered and unarguably earned not something begged as a favor hed made a career out of scorning favor but he didnt want to go through the rest of his life introduced in military reminiscence as lieutenant either belatedly it occurred to miles that gregors job offer wasnt another firstrefusal courtesy gregor and these serious men had been conferring for nearly a week not a snap decision this time but something argued and studied and weighed they really want me all of them do not just gregor how strange but it meant that he had a bargaining chip most other auditors are p his tongue barely cut the accustomed adjective portly retired senior officers admirals or generals you are a retired admiral miles gregor pointed out cheerfully admiral naismith oh he hadnt thought of it like that it stopped him cold for a full beat but but not publicly not on barrayar the dignity of an auditors office really needs at least a captaincy to support it dont you think persistent murmured vorhovis isnt he relentlessly gregor agreed just as advertised very well miles allow me to cure you of this distraction his magic imperial fingerindex not middle thank you gregorflipped down to point at miles congratulations youre a captain my secretary will see that your records are updated does that satisfy you entirely sire miles suppressed a grin so it was a touch anticlimactic compared to the thousand ways hed dreamed this promotion over the years he was not moved to complain i want nothing more but i do said gregor firmly my auditors tasks are almost by definition never routine i only send them in when routine solutions have fallen short when the rules are not working or have never been devised they handle the unanticipated the complex added vorthys the disturbing ones that no one else has the nerve to touch said vorhovis the really bizarre sighed vorgustafson and sometimes said gregor as with the auditor who proved general haroches strange treason they solve crises absolutely critical to the future of the imperium will you accept the office of eighth auditor my lord vorkosigan later there would be formal public oaths and ceremonies but the moment of truth and for truth was now miles took a deep breath yes he said the surgery to install the internal portion of the controlledseizure device was neither as lengthy nor as frightening as miles had expected for one thing chenko who was getting used to his star patients slightly paranoid worldview let him stay awake and watch it all on a monitor carefully positioned above his headclamp chenko allowed him to get up and go home the next morning two afternoons later they met again in chenkos imp mil neurology laboratory for the smoketest do you wish to do the honors yourself my lord dr chenko asked miles yes please i might have to i dont recommend doing this by yourself as your routine particularly at first you ought to have a spotter by you dr chenko handed miles his new mouth guard and the activation unit the device fit neatly in the palm of miless hand miles lay back on the examination table checked the settings on the activator one last time pressed it to his right temple and keyed it on colored confetti darkness miles popped open his eyes pfeg he said he wriggled his jaw and spat out his mouthguard dr chenko hovering happily retrieved it and pressed a hand to miless chest to keep him from sitting up the activation unit now sat on top of a monitor beside him miles wondered if hed caught it on the fly not yet please lord vorkosigan weve a few more measurements chenko and his techs busied themselves around their equipment chenko was humming offkey miles took it for a good sign now now you did encode the activation signals as i asked you chenko i dont want this damned thing being set off by accident when i walk through a security scan or something yes my lord nothing can possibly set off your seizurestimulator but the activator chenko promised him again its required to complete the circuit if i get my head banged around for some reason i dont know a lightflyer crash or something theres no chance this thing will switch on and not switch off no my lord chenko said patiently if you ever encounter enough trauma to damage the internal unit you wont have enough brains left to worry about or with oh good hm hm sang chenko finishing with his monitors yes yes your convulsive symptoms on this run were barely half the duration of your uncontrolled seizures your body movements were also suppressed the hangoverlike effects you reported should also be reduced try to observe them over the next daycycle and tell me your subjective observations yes this should become a part of your daily routine like brushing your teeth check your neurotransmitter levels on the monitorreadout panel of the activation unit at the same time every day in the evening before bed say and whenever they exceed onehalf but before they exceed threequarters discharge them yes doctor can i fly yet tomorrow said chenko why not today tomorrow repeated chenko more firmly after i examine you again maybe behave yourself please my lord it looks like im going to have to i wouldnt bet betan dollars chenko muttered under his breath miles pretended not to hear him lady alys prodded by gregor set the emperors formal betrothal ceremony as the first social event of the hectic winterfair season miles wasnt sure if this represented imperial firmness bridegroomly eagerness or a sensible terror that laisa might wake at any moment from her fond fog to an appreciation of her dangers and run away as far and as fast as possible a bit of all three perhaps the day before the ceremony vorbarr sultana and the three surrounding districts were hit with the worst winterfair blizzard in four decades closing all the commercial shuttleports and severely reducing activity at the military one and stranding the arriving viceroy of sergyar in orbit windwhipped snow sang past the windows of vorkosigan house in a hard horizontal line and drifts piled up with the speed of seafoam as high as secondstory windows in some blocks in the capital city it was prudently decided that viceroy count vorkosigan would not land until the following morning and would go straight to the imperial residence when he did miless intention to take himself off to the residence in his own lightflyer was scratched in favor of accompanying the countess and her retinue in their groundcars his master plan to get them all out the door early met its first check of the day when he opened his closet door to discover that zap the cat having penetrated the security of vorkosigan house through miless quisling cook had made a nest on the floor among his boots and fallen clothing to have kittens six of them zap ignored his threats about the dire consequences of attacking an imperial auditor and purred and growled from the dimness in her usual schizophrenic fashion miles gathered his nerve and rescued his best boots and house uniform at a cost of some high vor blood and sent them downstairs for a hasty cleaning by the overworked armsman pym the countess delighted as ever to find her biological empire increasing came in thoughtfully bearing a catgourmet tray prepared by ma kosti that miles would have had no hesitation in eating for his own breakfast in the general chaos of the morning however he had to go down to the kitchen and scrounge his meal the countess sat on the floor and cooed into his closet for a good halfhour and not only escaped laceration but managed to pick up sex and name the whole batch of little squirming furballs before tearing herself away to hurry and dress the convoy of three groundcars from vorkosigan house took off at last in billowing clouds of snow flung up from their fans after a couple of checks from blocked streets they lumped and bumped over the last snowbanks and wound around through the wroughtiron gates of the residence where a squadron of soldiers and residence servitors were working frantically to keep the paths clear the wind though still a nuisance had fallen from its dangerous velocities of last night and the sky miles fancied hopefully was lighter they were not the only late arrivals government ministers and their wives highranking military officers and their wives and counts and countesses continued to straggle in the fortunate were escorted by spifryshiny armsmen in their manycolored house uniforms the less so by armsmen harried bedraggled and halffrozen after freeing their groundcars from icechoked air intakes or predatory snowdrifts but triumphant upon learning they were not the last to arrive since some of the armsmen were as old or older than the counts they served miles felt consciencestirred to watch them closely for fear of incipient coronary collapse but only one had to be sent to the residences infirmary with chest pains happily most of the important komarrans including laisas parents had arrived safely downside earlier in the week and been put up in the residences extensive guest quarters lady alys had either passed beyond panic to some sort of smiling whiteout overload or was so experienced with arranging gregors social affairs that nothing could disturb her equanimity or possibly some odd combination of both she moved without haste but without stopping greeting and sorting guests her tension grew less edged when she saw the countess and miles arrive lastbutone of her missing principals for the coming ceremony her face lit with open relief a few minutes later when they were followed through the door from the east portico by viceroy count aral vorkosigan himself shaking off snow and solicitous armsmen judging from the neat and glittering appearance of his retainers theyd managed to avoid close personal acquaintance with any drifted ditches between the shuttleport and the residence the count exchanged a hard hug with the countess halfdislodging the flowers from her hair as if it had been a year instead of weeks since theyd parted on sergyar a little ah of pleasure rumbled in his chest like a man eased of some burden i trust he said to his wife holding her at arms length and devouring her with his eyes gregors weatherman has been sent to kyril island for a time to practice his trade until he can get it right he did say snow would fall miles grinned looking on he just missed the part about it falling sideways i gather he felt under some pressure to produce an optimistic forecast for the date hello boy in this public arena they exchanged only a handgrip but the count managed to make it an eloquent one you look well we must talk i believe lady alys has first claim on you sir lady alys was stepping down the stairs her heavy blue afternoonskirt floating about her legs with the speed of her passage oh aral good youre here at last gregors waiting in the glass hall come come as distracted as any other artist in the throes of creation she swept up the three vorkosigans and herded them before her to their appointment with tradition a mere hour late off the mark due to the huge mob of witnessesthe betrothal was the foremost as well as the first social event of winterfairthe ceremony took place in the largest ballroom the bridetobe and her party were arranged in a line opposite the groomtobe and his party like two small armies facing off laisa was elegant in komarran jacket and trousers though in a fine shade of barrayaran winterfair red a compromise nicely calculated by lady alys spearheading the two groups laisa was flanked by her parents and a komarran womanfriend as her second gregor had his foster parents the count and countess vorkosigan and miles as his second laisa clearly had inherited her bodytype from her father a small round man with an expression of cautious courtesy plastered on his face and her milkwhite skin from her mother an alerteyed woman with a worried smile lady alys was of course the gobetween the days were long past when the duties of a second legally included an obligation to marry the surviving fiancee if some unfortunate fatal accident occurred between the betrothal and the wedding nowadays the seconds were limited to marching a collection of ceremonial gifts back and forth between the two sides some of the gifts were obvious in their symbolismmoney in fancy wrappers from the brides parents rather a lot of different food items from the grooms including a bag of colored groats tied up with silver tinsel and bottles of maple mead and wine the silvergilt mounted bridle was a little baffling since it did not come with a horse the gift of a small scalpellike knife with a blunted edge from the brides mother as pledge of her daughters genetic cleanliness had been quietly eliminated miles was glad to see next came the traditional reading of the admonishments to the bride a task that fell to miles as gregors second there were no reciprocal admonishments to the groom a gap that elli quinn would have been swift to point out rising to the occasion miles stepped forward and unrolled the parchment and read in a good clear voice and with a pokerstraight face as if he were giving a briefing to the dendarii the admonishments though traditional in form and content had been subtly edited too miles noted the comments on the duty to bear an heir had been reworded so as not to imply any particular obligation to do so in ones own body using ones real womb with all the inherent dangers that entailed no question whose hand was at work there as for the rest of them miless imagined quinns suggestions of how to roll the parchment and in what part of the admonishers anatomy he might lodge it for storage thereafter and how hard dr toscane less vigorous in her vocabulary only cast one or two beseeching looks at countess vorkosigan to be reassured with a few covert palmdown donttakeittooseriouslydear gestures the rest of the time fortunately she was so occupied with smiling at gregor smiling at her the admonishments slithered past without objection miles stepped back and the fiancees had their hands joined in the last gesture of the ceremony or rather each was permitted to grasp one of lady alys s hands and at this wellchaperoned remove exchange their promissory pledges and if you think this was a circus just wait till the wedding at midsummer then the ceremony was over and the party started since everyone was feeling more or less snowedin the party went on and on gregor had first claim on miless father so miles took himself off to one of the buffets there he encountered ivan tall and splendid in his parade redandblues filling a single plate hello lord auditor coz said ivan wheres your gold leash i get it back next week i take my oath before the last joint session of the counts and ministers before they break for winterfair the word is out you know all sorts of people have been asking me about your appointment if it gets too thick direct em to vorhovis or vorkalloner though not i think to vorparadijs did you bring a dance partner i might borrow ivan grimaced and looked around and lowered his voice i tried to do one better i asked delia koudelka to marry me miles thought he already knew the lay of things but this was after all ivan i figured this stuff would be contagious congratulations he said with synthetic heartiness your mother will be ecstatic no no but she likes the koudelka girls not that delia turned me down the first time i ever proposed to a girl andsquelch ivan looked quite indignant she didnt take you ivan what a surprise ivan awakening to his tone of voice eyed him suspiciously and all my mother said was thats too bad dear i told you not to wait so long and wandered away to see illyan i saw them a couple of minutes ago hiding out in an alcove illyan was rubbing her neck the womans besotted well so she did tell you hundreds of times she knew the demographic odds i figured there would always be room at the top delia says shes marrying duv galeni the damned komarran um competition suggested miles as ivan groped for a noun you knew i had a few clues youll enjoy your untroubled single existence im sure your next decade will be just like your last eh and the next and the next and the next happy and carefree youre not doing any better ivan snapped i didnt expect to miles smiled grimly that was perhaps enough ivantwitting on this topic youll just have to try again martya maybe ivan growled what two rejections inyou didnt ask both sisters on the same day did you ivan i panicked so whos martya marrying anyone but me apparently really so um did you see where the koudelkas went the commodore was here a bit ago hes probably gone off with your da by now i expect the girls will be up in the ballroom as soon as the music starts ah miles started to turn away but then added absently do you want a kitten ivan stared at him why in gods name would i want a kitten it would brighten your bachelor digs you know a bit of life and movement to keep you company on your long lonely nights get stuffed lord auditor coz miles grinned popped an hors doeuvre in his mouth and departed munching thoughtfully he spotted the koudelka clan in the ballroom in a cluster on the far side the three sisters were minus their fourth kareen who was still on beta colony but who would hed been informed be returning for the imperial wedding at midsummer so would lord mark presumably captain galeni stood engaged in serious conversation with his prospective fatherinlaw the commodore delia by his side in her favorite blue upon reflection and some quiet campaigning from his fiancee galeni had decided not to resign his commission to miless immense relief miles was staying out of impsecs internal business this week but hed had a whiff through gregor of just how seriously galeni was being considered for head of komarran affairs and hoped to congratulate him soon madame koudelka looked on benignly it made a nice tableau and would do much toward repairing whatever damages still lingered to galenis reputation from haroches calculatedly clumsy arrest of him here a few weeks ago with four sisters in all galeni was on his way to gaining an array of major barrayaran clan connections by marriage miles wondered if anyone had apprised galeni yet that he stood in some danger of acquiring miless clonebrother mark as his next brotherinlaw if not miles wanted to be there when somebody told him just to savor the look on his face also he wondered if kittens would make good wedding presents a rich raspy baritone voice over his shoulder said congratulations on your promotion sir miles grinned dryly and turned around to greet his father which one sir i admit said viceroy count aral vorkosigan i was thinking of your imperial auditorship but i understand from gregor you slipped a captaincy in there somehow as well you hadnt mentioned it congratulations on that too though that has to be the most roundabout method of acquiring a set of blue tabs ive ever heard of if you cant do what you want do what you can or how you can the captaincy completed something for me im glad you survived long enough to finally grow into yourself so youre not losing your forward momentum with age are you boy the count refrained from following this up with one of those weregettingsoold complaints mainly designed to invite the listener to offer a contradiction i dont think so miless eyes narrowed in a brief moment of introspection his new calmness was still there inside but it did not feel at all weary quite the opposite its just taking another direction vorhovis tells me im the youngest imperial auditor since the time of isolation its not a post you ever held i understand no i missed that one somehow your grandfather never held it either nor your greatgrandfather in fact ill have to look it up but i dont think any count or lord vorkosigan has ever been an auditor i did none has im the first in the family miles informed him smugly i am unprecedented the count smiled this is not news miles chapter twentynine miles stood in the concourse just outside customs processing on one of komarrs larger orbital transfer stations smells like a space station oh yeah it was not a sweet perfume that odd acridity compounded of machinery electronics humanity and all its effluvia and chill air run through filters which never quite succeeded in reducing its complexity but it was familiar universal and an enormously nostalgic odor for him admiral naismiths atmosphere subliminally electrifying even now the station was one of a dozen orbiting the systems only semihabitable planet three more deepspace stations circled komarr s feeble star and each of the six wormhole exits they all served boasted both a military station and a commercial one in this farflung network cargo and passengers loaded unloaded and shuffled bound not only for barrayar but for pol the hegen hub sergyar escobar beyond it and a dozen other connecting routes the reopened trade route to rho ceta and the rest of the cetagandan empire uneasy neighbors though they were also supported a growing stream of traffic the fees and taxes generated here were a vast source of income for the barrayaran imperium far beyond anything squeezed out of poor backcountry groat farmers on the homeworld this too was part of barrayar he must remember to point out to spacebred elli quinn quinn might be almost happy on komarr its domed cities were reminiscent of the space station upon which she had been born true most of lord vorkosigans duties would keep him in a tight little circuit around vorbarr sultana the capital drew all ambitious men like a gravity well but one might maintain a second domicile on one of the stations here a cozy little deepspace dacha it is far from the mountains hed seen the count and countess off from this station yesterday on their way back to sergyar having hitched a ride with them as far as komarr in their government courier ship five days in the relatively uninterrupted confines of a jumpship had actually given them time enough to talk for a change he had also seized the opportunity to beg an armsman for himself from his father the comfortable pym by choice the countess grumbled they should have held out for ma kosti in exchange but gave up her favorite armsman to him nonetheless the count promised to send him a couple more in due time chosen from those whose wives and families had been the most bitterly unhappy at having been forcibly transplanted from their familiar city to the wilds of chaos colony the crowd around the exit door from customs processing thickened as inbound passengers began to spill through and hurry to their further destinations or greet waiting parties with businesslike decorum or familial enthusiasm miles rose on his toes futilely ninetenths of this outrush dissipated before quinn came striding through the doors conservatively incognito in komarran civilian fashion a white padded silk jacket and trousers the outfit set off her dark curls and brilliant brown eyes but then quinn made anything she wore look great including ripped fatigues and mud she too craned to look for him murmured a heh of satisfaction upon spotting him waving a hand behind a few other shoulders and wove through the crowd her stride stretched as she neared she dropped the gray duffel she swung and they embraced with an impact that nearly knocked miles off his feet the scent of her made up for any number of defective space station atmospheric filters quinn my quinn after a dozen or so kisses they parted just far enough to permit speech so why did you ask me to bring all your stuff she demanded suspiciously i didnt like the sound of that did you yes its stuck back in customs they choked on the contents particularly all the weapons i gave up arguing with them after a whileyoure a barrayaran you sort them out ah pym miles gestured to his armsman like miles dressed in discreet streetwear take commodore quinns receipts and rescue my property from our bureaucracy please address it to vorkosigan house and send it by commercial shipper then go on back to the hostel yes my lord pym collected the data codes and plunged back through the doors into customs is that all your personal luggage miles asked quinn as ever off to the hostel then its a nice one the best on the station in fact luxury class i ah got us a suite for tonight youd better have have you had dinner not yet good neither have i a short walk brought them to the nearest bubblecar terminal and a short ride to the hostel its appointments were elegant its corridors wide and thickly carpeted and its staff solicitous the suite was large for a space station which meant nicely cozy for miless present purposes your general allegre is generous remarked quinn unloading her duffel after a quick reconnoiter of the sybaritic bathroom i may like working for him after all i think you will but this is on my bill tonight not impsecs i wanted someplace quiet where we could talk before your official meeting with allegre and the galactic affairs chief tomorrow so i dont quite understand this setup i get one lousy message from you with you looking like a damned zombie telling me illyan caught up with you about poor vorberg and didnt i tell you so then a resounding silence for weeks and no answers to my messages to you you rat then i get another one with you all chipper again saying its all right now and i sure dont see the connection then i get this order to report to impsec on komarr without delay no explanations no hint of what the new assignment is except with this postscript from you to bring your whole kit with me when i come and put the freight charges on impsecs tab are you back in impsec or not not im here as a consultant to get you up and running with your new bosses and vice versa i ah have another job now i really dont understand i mean your messages are usually cryptic its hard to send proper love letters when you know everything you say is going to be monitored by impsec censors but this time it was frigging incomprehensible what is going on with you her voice was edged with the same suppressed fear miles was feeling am i losing you no not fear knowledge i tried to compose a message a couple of times but it was too complicated and all the most important parts were things i didnt want to send tightbeam the edited version came out sounding like gibberish i had to see you facetoface anyway for for a lot of reasons its a long story and most of it is classified a fact that i am going to completely ignore i can you know do you want to go down to the restaurant to eat or order room service miles she said in exasperation room service and explanations he distracted her temporarily with the hostels enormous menu to buy a little more time to compose his thoughts it didnt help any more than the previous weeks hed spent composing those same thoughts in their endless permutations miles put in their order and they settled side by side facing one another on the suites smaller couch to explain about my new job i have to tell you something about how i acquired it and why illyan isnt chief of impsec anymore he told her the story of the past months beginning with illyans breakdown doubling back to explain about laisa and duv galeni growing excited and jumping up to gesture and pace when he described how hed nailed haroche at last his seizure treatment gregors job offer all the easy stuff the events the facts he did not know how to explain his inner journey elli was not after all barrayaran the food arrived stopping ellis immediate reaction her face was tense and introspective yes we should all think before we speak tonight love she did not take up her thread until the hostels human servitor finished arranging the meal on their table and bustled out again it was three bites before she spoke miles wondered if she was tasting her soup as little as he was tasting his when she did she began obliquely in a carefully neutral tone imperial auditor sounds like some kind of an accountant its not you miles it is now i took my oath its one of those barrayaran terms that doesnt mean what you think it does i dont know imperial agent special prosecutor special envoy inspector general its all of those things and none of them its whatever whatever gregor needs it to be its extraordinarily openended i cant begin to tell you how much it suits me you never once mentioned it before as your ambition i never imagined the possibility but its not the sort of job that should ever be given to a man who is too ambitious for it willing yes but not ambitious it calls for dispassion not passion even with respect to itself she sat frowning over this for a full minute at last visibly gathering her courage she took a more direct cut so where does it leave me leave us does it mean youre never coming back to the dendarii miles i might never see you again only the smallest quaver edged her controlled voice thats one of the reasons i wanted to talk to you tonight personally before tomorrows business overwhelms everything else now it was his turn to pause for courage to keep his voice in an even register you see if you were if you stayed here if you were lady vorkosigan you could be with me all the time no her soup would have cooled forgotten if not for the staywarm circuit in the bottom of die bowl id be with lord vorkosigan all the time not with you miles not with admiral naismith admiral naismith was something i made up elli he said gently he was my own invention im an egotistical enough artist i suppose im glad you liked my creation i made him up out of me after all but not all of me she shook her head tried another tack you said the last time you wouldnt ask me that lady vorkosigan thing anymore you said it the last three times you asked me to marry lord vorkosigan in fact one more last chance elli except this time it really is i in all honesty i have to tell you the other half or rather the other side the counteroffer whats coming up tomorrow along with the dendariis new contract contract hell youre changing the subject miles what about us i cant get to us except this way full disclosure tomorrow we that is allegre and impsec and i barrayar if you will were offering you the admiralcy admiral quinn of the dendarii free mercenary fleet youll go on working for allegre in exactly the same capacity that i worked for illyan quinns eyes widened lit fell miles i cant do your job im not nearly ready you have been doing my job youre halfpast ready quinn i say so she smiled at the familiar forwardmomentum passion in his voice that had so often driven them all to results beyond reason i admit i wanted a share of command but not so soon not like this the time is now your time my time this is it she stared intently at him baffled by his tone of voice miles i dont want to be stuck on just one planet for the rest of my life a planets a damned big place elli when you get down to the details and anyway there are three planets in the barrayaran imperium three times worse then she leaned across the table and grasped his hand in both hers hard suppose i make you a counterproposal screw the barrayaran imperium the dendarii fleet does not require its imperial contracts to survive though i admit thanks to you they have been very fine and favorable the fleet existed before barrayar ever came over our event horizon it can go on existing after they sink back into their damned gravity well we spacers we dont need planets sucking us down youcome with me instead be admiral naismith shake the dirt off your boots id marry admiral naismith in a heartbeat if thats what you want we can be such a team the two of us well make legends you and me miles out there she waved one arm in a random circle though the other did not release her grip i tried elli i tried for weeks you dont know how hard i tried to go i was never a mercenary not ever not for one single minute a flash of anger sparked briefly in her brown eyes do you figure that makes you morally superior to the rest of us no he sighed but it makes me miles vorkosigan not miles naismith she shook her head ah denial he recognized the hollow reverberation of it there always was a part of you i could never touch her voice was edged with pain i know i worked for years to extinguish lord vorkosigan i couldnt do it not even for you you cant select from me elli take the parts you favor and leave the rest on the table he gestured in frustration to their drying dinner i dont come a la carte im all or nothing you could be anything you chose miles anywhere why insist on this place he smiled grimly no i have discovered i am constrained on other levels this time his hands enclosed hers but maybe you can choose come to barrayar elli and be and be desperately unhappy with me her breath puffed on a laugh what is this more full disclosure there is no other way for the long haul and im talking about a very long haul miles i cant i mean your home is very pretty for a planet but its dreadful down there you could make it less dreadful i cant i cant be what you want cant be your lady vorkosigan he looked away looked back opened his hands to her i can give you everything i have i cant give you less but you want everything i am in return admiral quinn annihilated lady vorkosigan rising from the ashes im not good at resurrection miles thats your department she shook her head helplessly come away with me stay here with me love does not conquer all watching the struggle in her face he began to feel horribly like admiral haroche perhaps haroche had not enjoyed his moment of moral torture either the one thing you cant trade for your hearts desire he gripped her hand harder willing then not love but truth and with all his heart then choose elli whoever elli is elli is admiral quinn i rather thought she was then why do you do this to me because you have to decide now elli once and for all youre forcing this choice not me yes thats just exactly right i can go on with you i can go on without you if i have to but i cant freeze elli not even for you perfect preservation isnt life its death i know she nodded slowly i understand that part anyway she began spooning her soup watching him watching her watching him they made love one last time for old times sake for goodbye and miles realized halfway through each in a desperate lastditch effort to please and pleasure the other so much they would change their mind wed have to change more than our minds wed have to change our whole selves with a sigh he sat up in the suites vast bed disentangling their limbs this isnt working elli ill make it work she mumbled he captured her hand and kissed the inside of her wrist she took a deep breath and sat up beside him they were both silent for a long time you were destined to be a soldier she said at last not some kind of of superior bureaucrat he gave up trying to explain the ancient and noble post of imperial auditor to a nonbarrayaran to be a great soldier you need a great war there doesnt happen to be one on just now not around here the cetagandans are quiescent for the first time in a decade pol is not aggressive and anyway were in good odor in the whole hegen hub these days jacksons whole is nasty enough but theyre too disunited to be a military threat at this distance the worst menace in the neighborhood is us and sergyar is absorbing our energies im not sure i could lend myself to an aggressive war anyway your father did with remarkable success mixed success you should study our history more closely love but i am not my father i dont have to repeat his mistakes i can invent brightnew ones youre turning into such a political animal these days it goes with my territory and they may also serve who only stand and wait but life is short enough already if the imperium ever wants me in a military capacity again they can forward a bloody comconsole message her brows rose she sat back and plumped pillows around them he drew her head down to rest on his scored chest and stroked her hair curling it around his fingers her free hand idled up and down his body he could feel the lettinggo in them with the easing of the tension and the terror with the slowing of every pulse of their blood not pain or not so much pain but only a just sadness a due measure of melancholy quiet and right now he said at last thats not to say there wont be need for the odd rescue mission or whatever from time to time mind you as admiral quinn the place for your sweet ass is in a nice soft tactics room chair dont you be going out with the squads all the time its not appropriate for a senior staff officer and its way too dangerous her fingernails traced the spidernest lines of his most spectacular scars making the hairs stand up on his arms you are a howling hypocrite my love he elected prudently not to quibble over that one he cleared his throat that brings up another thing i wanted to ask you a favor about sergeant taura she stiffened slightly what last time i saw her i noticed shes getting some gray in her hair you know what that means i talked recently to old canaba about it you remember him he gives no more than two months between the time she starts to go into serious metabolic failure and the end i want you to promise me youll let me know in time time to get out there with the fleet or wherever she is before she goes i dont want her to be alone then its a promise i made to myself once that i mean to keep she settled back all right she said seriously after a moment she added so did you sleep with her um he swallowed she was before your time elli after another minute he was compelled to add and after from time to time very rarely hah i thought so as long as were being morbid how about you was there ever anyone else when i was gone no i was good huh she added after a moment now before your time thats another quinn that dig he decided was within her rights he let it go by it should go without saying but just in case you do know you are free of any personal obligation to me hereafter so you can be too is that what this is all about she touched his face and smiled i dont need you to free me love i can free myself any time i choose thats part i think of what ive always loved about you he hesitated but can you choose any time you choose well thats the other question isnt it she said softly they each of them gazed long at the other as if memorizing the image for some interior cache after a time she added with unerring perceptiveness and wry goodwill i hope you find your lady vorkosigan miles whoever she is i hope so too elli he sighed i dread the search though lazy she murmured that too you were a drunkards dream quinn youve quite spoiled me you know shall i apologize never she came up for breath from the long kiss that followed this to ask till your search prospers shall we have flings from time to time perhaps i dont know if were ever on the same planet at the same time its a big universe then why do i keep running into the same people over and over they fell then to unhurried caresses without agenda no future no past just a little bubble in time containing miles and elli after that things went much better in the afterglow elli murmured into his hair do you think youll like your new job as much as ill like mine im beginning to suspect so you are ready you know ive lately had some sharp lessons on what a bad idea it is to leave competent subordinates unpromoted for too long watch out for that inhe almost said my your staff so is there like a top spot you can go for work your way up to first auditor from eighth auditor say only by longevity which come to think of it could happen im the youngest by three decades but the auditors are numbered for convenience it doesnt denote rank they all seem to be sort of equal when they meet they sit in a circle very unusual for hierarchyconscious barrayar really like the knights of the round table elli suggested miles choked on a laugh not if you could see them he hesitated well i dont know those original round table knights competed for honors obsessively i mean thats why old arthur had to make the table round in the first place to defuse all that but most of the auditors are i cant say not ambitious or they wouldnt all have achieved what they have postambitious these old barrayaran paladins are an amazingly disinterested lot im actually looking forward to getting to know them better he provided her with a few giggles by giving a vigorously worded description of his new colleagues odder quirks she ran a hand through her dark curls grinning despite herself dear godlings miles i begin to think youre going to fit right in after all have you ever come home to a place youve never been before it feels like that its very odd but not at all unpleasant she kissed his forehead for benediction he kissed her palm for luck well if you insist on being a civilian you be a good bureaucratpaladin then she told him firmly do me proud i will elli miless return from komarr to barrayar was uneventful he arrived back at vorkosigan house in the quiet of a late winter evening to find it warm and lit and ready for him tomorrow he would formally invite company to dinner he decided duv and delia and the rest of the koudelkas by choice but tonight he dined in the kitchen with his armsman and ma kosti his cook was a little scandalized either by his stepping out of his role or by his invading her territory but he told her a string of jokes until she laughed and snapped at him with a towel as if he were one of her boys which amused pym no end corporal kosti ducked in at the end of his guard shift to be properly fed as well and to play with the kittens who now lived in or rather obsessively escaped from a ragpadded box near the stove the corporal and ma kosti caught miles up on all the news from martin now suffering through basic training with all the bragging complaints that entailed after his late supper he took himself off to his wine cellar ceremoniously he selected a bottle of his grandfathers oldest and rarest upon opening it he discovered it was going more than a bit off he considered drinking it anyway for the symbolisms sake then decisively he dumped it down the bathroom sink in his new suite and went back for a bottle from a much more recent batch that he knew to be very good with a wineglass of the best crystal this time he sat in the incredibly comfortable chair by the bay window to watch a few fat snowflakes dance past in the garden lights and to hold his own private wake he toasted his ghostly nightreflection in the window this was what admiral naismiths third death once on jacksons whole once in illyans office third and last and astonishingly painful resurrected and dispatched again by lucas haroche on his first death hed been in no position to enjoy a proper wakefrozen lost luggage hed beenon the second his grandfathers dagger opener for a redder wine had held more blandishment than the brandy he settled back and prepared to ration himself one hour of selfpity along with his wine and be done with it instead he found himself leaning back in the warm chair laughing softly he swallowed the laugh wondering if hed lost his grip at last just the opposite haroche was no miracleworker he wasnt even a stage magician hed had no power then or ever to give or withhold naismith though miles felt a cryonic chill thinking how close hed come to delivering himself into haroches hands no wonder he was laughing he wasnt mourning a death he was celebrating an escape im not dead im here he touched his scarred chest in wonder he felt strange and single not to be in pieces anymore not lord vorkosigan ascendant not naismith lost but all of him all at once all the time crowded in there not particularly harra csurik had been almost right it wasnt your life again you found going on it was your life anew and it wasnt at all what hed been expecting his slow smile deepened he was beginning to be very curious about his future
