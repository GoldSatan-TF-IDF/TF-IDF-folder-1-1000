elizabeth george for the sake of elena the fifth book in the inspector lynley series elena weaver awakened when the second light went on in her bedsitting room the first light twelve feet away on her desk managed only to rouse her moderately the second light however positioned to shine directly in her face from an anglelamp on the bedside table acted as efficiently as a blast of music or a jangling alarm when it broke into her dreaman unwelcome interloper considering the subject matter her subconscious had been pursuingshe bolted upright in bed she hadnt started out the previous night in this bed or even in this room so for a moment she blinked perplexed wondering when the plain red curtains had been changed for that hideous print of yellow chrysanthemums and green leaves lounging on a field of what appeared to be bracken they were drawn across a window which was itself in the wrong place as was the desk in fact there shouldnt have been a desk in here at all nor should it have been strewn with papers notebooks several open volumes and a large word processor this last item as well as the telephone beside it brought everything sharply into focus she was in her own room alone shed come in just before two torn off her clothes dropped exhausted into bed and managed about four hours sleep four hourselena groaned no wonder shed thought she was elsewhere rolling out of bed she thrust her feet into fuzzy slippers and quickly drew on the green woollen bathrobe that lay in a heap next to her jeans on the floor the material was old worn down to a feathery softness her father had presented her with a fine silk dressing gown upon her matriculation into cambridge a year agoindeed he had presented her with an entire wardrobe which she had mostly discardedbut she had left it at his house on one of her frequent weekend visits and while she wore it in his presence to appease the anxiety with which he seemed to watch her every move she never wore it at any other time certainly not at home in london with her mother and never here in college the old green one was better it felt like velvet against her bare skin she padded across the room to her desk and pulled open the curtains it was still dark outside and the fog which had lain upon the city like an oppressive miasma for the past fi ve days seemed even thicker this morning pressing against the casement windows and streaking them with a lacework of moisture on the wide sill stood a cage with a small bottle of water hanging on its side an exercise wheel in its centre and an athleticsockturnednest in its far righthand corner curled into this was a dollop of fur the size of a tablespoon and the colour of sherry elena tapped her fingers against the icy bars of the cage she brought her face up to it caught the mixed smells of shredded newspaper cedar shavings and pungent mouse droppings and blew her breath softly in the direction of the nest muhowz she said again she tapped against the bars of the cage muhowz within the small mound of fur a bright brown eye opened the mouse lifted his head his nose tested the air tibbit elena smiled in delight as his whiskers twitched mornun muhowz the mouse scampered from his nest and came to inspect her fingers clearly expecting a morning treat elena opened the cage door and picked him up scarcely three inches of lively curiosity in the palm of her hand she perched him on her shoulder where he immediately began an investigation into the possibilities presented by her hair this was quite long and quite straight its colour identical to the mouses fur these facts seemed to offer the promise of camouflage for he snuggled happily between the collar of elenas robe and her neck where he anchored himself onto the material and began to wash his face elena did the same opening the cupboard that housed the basin and switching on the light above it she went on to brush her teeth to bind her hair back with a bit of ribboned elastic and to rustle through her clothes cupboard for her tracksuit and a jersey she pulled on the trousers and went next door to the gyp room she flipped on the light and examined the shelf above the stainless steel sink cocoa puffs wheetabix corn flakes the sight of all of them made her stomach roll uneasily so she opened the refrigerator pulled out a carton of orange juice and drank directly from it her mouse put an end to his morning ablutions and scuttled back onto her shoulder in anticipation as she continued to drink elena rubbed her index finger on the top of his head his tiny teeth gnawed at the edge of her fi ngernail enough of affection he was getting impatient awright elena said she rooted through the refrigeratorgrimacing at the rank smell of milk gone badand found the jar of peanut butter a fingertip of this was the mouses daily treat and he set upon it happily when she presented it to him he was still working the residue out of his fur when elena returned to her room and placed him on her desk she threw off her robe pulled on a jersey and began to stretch she knew the importance of warming up before her daily run her father had drummed it into her head with monotonous regularity ever since she had joined the universitys hare and hounds club in her first term still she found it horrifically boring and the only way she managed to complete the series of stretches was to combine them with something else such as fantasizing making toast gazing out the window or reading a bit of literature shed been avoiding for ages this morning she combined the exercising with toast and window gazing while the bread was browning in the toaster on her bookshelf she worked on loosening leg and thigh muscles her eyes on the window outside the fog was creating a billowing whirlpool round the lamppost in the centre of north court holding out the guarantee of an unpleasant run out of the corner of her eye elena saw the mouse scooting back and forth across the top of her desk pausing to raise himself on hind legs and sniff the air he was nobodys fool several million years of olfactory evolution told him that more food was in the offi ng and he wanted his share she glanced at the bookshelf to see the toast had popped up she broke off a piece for the mouse and tossed it in his cage he scrambled immediately in that direction his tiny ears catching the light like diaphanous wax hey she said catching the little animal in his progress across two volumes of poetry and three shakespearean criticisms say gbye tibbit fondly she rubbed her cheek against his fur before replacing him in the cage the piece of toast was nearly his size but he managed to drag it industriously towards his nest elena smiled tapped her fi ngers on the cage top grabbed the rest of the toast and left the room as the corridors glass fi redoor whooshed closed behind her she put on the jacket of her tracksuit and pulled up its hood she ran down the fi rst flight of l staircase and swung round the landing by grasping the wrought iron banister and landing lightly in a crouch taking the pressure of her weight in her legs and ankles rather than in her knees she took the second flight at a quicker pace dashed across the entry and flung open the door the cold air hit her like water her muscles stiffened in reaction she forced them to relax running in place for a moment as she shook her arms she breathed in deeply the airwith the fog taking its origin in the river and the fenstasted of humus and woodsmoke and it covered her skin quickly with a watery down she jogged across the south end of new court sprinting through the two passageways to principal court no one was about no lights were on in rooms it was wonderful exhilarating she felt inordinately free and she had less than fifteen minutes to live five days of fog dripped off buildings and trees made wet lattice on windows created pools on the pavement outside st stephens college a lorrys hazard lights flashed in the mist two small orange beacons like blinking cats eyes in senate house passage victorian lampposts reached long fi ngers of yellow light through the fog and the gothic spires of kings college first rose against then disappeared altogether into a backdrop of gloom the colour of grey doves beyond that the sky still wore the guise of a midnovember night full dawn was yet an hour away elena pounded from senate house passage into kings parade the pressure of her feet against the pavement sent an answering quiver up the muscles and bones of her legs and into her stomach she pressed her palms against her hips just where his had been last night but unlike last night her breathing was steady not rapid and urgent and centred singlemindedly on that frantic rise to pleasure still she could almost see his head thrown back she could almost see him concentrating on the heat the friction and the slick profusion of her bodys desire she could almost see his mouth form the words oh god oh god oh god oh god as his hips thrust up and his hands pulled her down harder and harder against him and then her name on his lips and the wild beating of his heart against his chest and his breathing like a runner she liked to think of it shed even been dreaming of it when the light went on in her room this morning she powered along kings parade towards trumpington weaving in and out of the patchy light somewhere not far away a breakfast was cooking for the air held the faint scent of bacon and coffee her throat began to close uneasily in response and she increased her speed to escape the odour splashing through a puddle that sent icy water seeping through her left sock at mill lane she made the turn towards the river the blood was beginning to pound in her veins and in spite of the cold she had started to perspire a line of sweat beneath her breasts was trickling towards her waist perspirations the sign that your body is working her father would tell her perspiration naturally he would never say sweat the air seemed fresher as she approached the river dodging two dust carts that were manned by the first living creature she had seen out on the streets this morning a workman wearing a lime green anorak he heaved a haversack onto the pushbar of one of the carts and lifted a thermos as if to toast her as she passed at the end of the lane she darted onto the pedestrian bridge that spanned the river cam the bricks beneath her feet were slick she ran in place for a moment fumbling with the wrist of her track jacket to get a look at her watch when she realised shed left it back in her room she cursed softly and jogged back across the bridge to have a quick look down laundress lane damn damn double damn where is she elena squinted through the fog she blew out a quick gust of breath in irritation this wasnt the first time shed had to wait and if her father had his way it wouldnt be the last i wont have you running alone elena not at that hour of the morning not along the river we wont have any discussion about this if youd care to choose another route but she knew it wouldnt matter another route and hed only come up with another objection she should never have let him know that she was running in the first place at the time it had seemed an innocuous enough piece of information ive joined hare and hounds daddy but he managed to turn it into yet another display of his devotion to her just as he did when he got hold of her essays prior to supervisions hed read them brow furrowed his posture and expression both declaring look how concerned i am see how much i love you note how i treasure having you back in my life ill never leave you again my darling and then hed critique them guiding her through introductions and conclusions and points to be clarified bringing her stepmother in for further assistance sitting back in his leather chair with his eyes shining earnestly see what a happy family we are it made her skin crawl her breath steamed the air shed waited more than a minute still no one emerged from the grey soup of laundress lane stuff it she thought and ran back to the bridge on the mill pool beyond her swans and ducks etched out their shapes in the gauzy air while on the southwest bank of the pool itself a willow wept branches into the water elena gave one final glance over her shoulder but no one was running to meet her so she herself ran on descending the slope of the weir she misjudged the angle and felt the slight pull of a muscle in her leg she winced but kept going her time was shot to hellnot that she knew what her time was in the first placebut she might be able to make up a few seconds once she reached the causeway she picked up her pace the pavement narrowed to a strip of tarmac with the river on its left and the wide mistshrouded expanse of sheeps green to its right here the hulking silhouettes of trees rose out of the fog and the handrails of footbridges made horizontal slashes of white where the occasional lights from across the river managed to cut through the gloom as she ran ducks plopped silently from the bank into the water and elena reached into her pocket for the last wedge of morning toast which she crumbled and tossed their way her toes were driving steadily into the front of her running shoes her ears were starting to ache in the cold she tightened the drawstring of her hood beneath her chin and from her jacket pocket she took a pair of mittens and pulled them on blowing into her hands and pressing them against her chilled face ahead the river separated into two parts main body and murky streamas it fl owed sluggishly round robinson crusoes island a small mass of land thickly overgrown on its south end with trees and brush and its north end given to the repair of the colleges sculls canoes rowboats and punts a bonfi re had been lit in the area recently for elena could smell its remains in the air someone had probably camped illegally on the north section of the island during the night leaving behind a residue of charred wood hastily extinguished by water it smelled different from a fi re that has died a natural death curious elena looked through the trees as she dashed along the north end of the island canoes and punts piled one on top of another their wood slick and glistening and dripping with the fog but no one was there the path began the rise towards fen causeway which marked the end of the fi rst leg of her run as always she met the gradual acclivity with a fresh burst of energy breathing steadily but feeling the building pressure in her chest she was just beginning to adjust to the new speed when she saw them two figures appeared ahead of her on the pavement one crouched and the other stretched across the width of the path they were shadowy and largely amorphous and they seemed to tremble like uncertain holograms backlit by the wavering fi ltered light from the causeway about twenty yards away perhaps hearing elenas approach the crouched figure turned towards her lifted a hand the other didnt move elena squinted through the fog her eyes went from one figure to the other she saw the size she saw the dimensions townee she thought and rushed forward the crouched figure stood backed off at elenas approach and seemed to disappear into the heavier mist near the footbridge that joined the path with the island elena stumbled to a stop and fell to her knees she reached out touched and found herself frantically examining what amounted to nothing more than an old coat stuffed with rags in confusion she turned one hand on the ground pushing herself to her feet she drew in breath to speak as she did so the heavy air splintered before her a movement flashed on her left the fi rst blow fell it hit her squarely between the eyes lightning shot through her field of vision her body fl ew backwards the second blow crashed against her nose and cheek cutting completely through the fl esh and shattering the zygomatic bone like a piece of glass if there was a third blow she did not feel it it was just after seven when sarah gordon pulled her escort onto the wide section of pavement right next to the university department of engineering in spite of the fog and the morning traffic shed made the drive from her home in less than five minutes charging over fen causeway as if pursued by a legion of ghouls she set the emergency brake clambered out into the damp morning and slammed the door she marched to the boot of the car where she began pulling out her equipment a camp stool a sketch pad a wooden case an easel two canvases when these objects lay on the ground at her feet she stared into the boot asking herself if she had forgotten anything she concentrated on detailscharcoal temperas and pencils in the caseand tried to ignore her increasing nausea and the fact that tremors weakened her legs she stood for a moment with her head resting against the grimy open lid of the boot and schooled herself to think only of the painting it was something shed contemplated begun developed and completed times beyond counting ever since her childhood so all the elements should have been old friends the subject the location the light the composition the choice of media demanded her full concentration she made an attempt to give it to them the world of possibility was opening this morning represented a sacred renaissance seven weeks ago shed marked this day on her calendar november shed written do it across that small white square of hope and now she was here to put an end to eight months of paralysed inactivity utilising the only means she knew to find her way back to the passion with which shed once greeted her work if only she could muster up the courage to overcome a minor setback she slammed home the boot lid and picked up her equipment each object found its natural position in her hands and under her arms there wasnt even a panicfilled moment of wondering how shed managed to carry everything in the past and the very fact that some behaviours did seem to be automatic like riding a bicycle buoyed her for an instant she walked back over fen causeway and descended the slope towards robinson crusoes island telling herself that the past was dead telling herself that shed come here to bury it for too long she had stood numbly in front of an easel incapable of thinking of the healing propensities inherent to the simple act of creating all these months she had created nothing except the means of her own destruction collecting half a dozen prescriptions for pills cleaning and oiling her old shotgun preparing her gas oven making a rope from her scarves and all the time believing that the artistic force within her had died but all that was ended as were the seven weeks of growing dread as november approached she paused on the little bridge spanning the narrow stream that separated robinson crusoes island from the rest of sheeps green although it was daylight the mist was heavy and it lay against her field of vision like a bank of clouds through it the rattling song of an adult male wren shot out from one of the trees above her and the causeway traffic passed with the muted rise and fall of engines a duck wakwacked somewhere nearby on the river a bicycle bell jingled from across the green to her left the boat repair sheds were still closed and shuttered ahead of her ten iron steps climbed up to crusoes bridge and descended to coe fen on the east bank of the river she saw that the bridge itself had been repainted a fact she had not noticed before where once it had been green and orange and patchy with rust now it was brown and cream the cream a series of crisscrossing balusters that glistened luminescently through the mist the bridge itself looked suspended over nothing and everything round it was altered and hidden by the fog in spite of her determination she sighed it was impossible no light no hope and no inspiration in this bleak cold place be damned to whistlers night studies of the thames to hell with what turner could have made from this dawn no one would ever believe she had come to paint this still this was the day she had chosen events had dictated that she come to this island to draw draw she would she plunged across the rest of the footbridge and pushed open the creaking wrought iron gate determined to ignore the chill that seemed to be inching its way through every organ of her body inside the gate she felt the squish and ooze of mud sucking noisily against her plimsolls and she shuddered it was cold but it was only the cold and she picked her way into the copse created by alder crack willow and beech condensation dripped from the trees drops splatted with a sound like slowbubbling porridge onto the sorrel tarpaulin of autumn leaves a thick fallen branch undulated across the ground before her and just beyond it a small clearing beneath a poplar offered a view sarah made for this she leaned her easel and canvases against the tree snapped open her camp stool and propped her wooden case next to it the sketch pad she clutched to her chest paint draw paint sketch she felt her heart thud her fingers seemed brittle her very nails ached she despised her weakness she forced her body onto the camp stool to face the river and she stared at the bridge she made an assessment of every detail trying to see each as a line or an angle a simple problem in composition which needed to be solved like a reflex response her mind began to evaluate what her eyes took in with their late autumn leaves tipped by beads of moisture that managed to catch and refl ect what little light there was three alder branches acted as a frame for the bridge they formed diagonal lines that first stretched above the structure then descended in a perfect parallel to the stairs which led down to coe fen where through a swirling mass of fog the distant lights from peterhouse glimmered a duck and two swans were misty forms on the river which was itself so greya duplication of the air above itthat the birds floated as if suspended in space quick strokes she thought big bold impressions use a smudge of charcoal to suggest greater depth she made her first pass against the sketch pad then a second and a third before her fi ngers slipped losing their grip on the charcoal which slid across the paper and into her lap she stared at the mess she had made of the drawing she ripped it from the pad and began a second time as she drew she felt her bowels begin to loosen she felt nausea begin its process of gripping her throat oh please she whispered and glanced about knowing she had no time to get home knowing also that she couldnt allow herself to be sick here and now she looked down at her sketch saw the inadequate pedestrian lines and crumpled it up she began a third drawing forcing all her concentration on keeping her right hand steady seeking to hold her panic at bay she tried to duplicate the angle of the alder branches she tried to copy the crisscrossing of the bridge balusters she tried to suggest the pattern of the foliage the charcoal snapped in two she pushed herself to her feet it wasnt supposed to be like this the creative power was supposed to take over time and place were supposed to disappear the desire itself was supposed to return but it hadnt it was gone you can she thought fiercely you can and you will nothing can stop you no one stands in your way she thrust the sketch pad under her arm grabbed her camp stool and struck out southward on the island until she came to a small spit of land it was overgrown with nettles but it provided a different view of the bridge this was the spot the ground was loamy matted by leaves trees and bushes formed a web of vegetation behind which at a distance the stone bridge of fen causeway rose sarah snapped open the camp stool here she dropped it to the ground she took a step back and lost her footing on what seemed to be a branch that was hidden beneath a pile of leaves considering the location she should have been more than prepared but the sensation still unnerved her damn it she said and kicked the object to one side the leaves fell from it sarah felt her stomach heave the object wasnt a branch but a human arm mercifully the arm was attached to a body in his twentynine years with the cambridge constabulary superintendent daniel sheehan had never had a dismemberment occur upon his patch and he didnt want that dubious investigatory distinction now upon receiving the telephone call from the station house at twenty past seven hed come barrelling down from arbury with lights fl ashing and siren sounding grateful for an excuse to leave the breakfast table where the tenth straight day of grapefruit wedges one boiled egg and one thin slice of unbuttered toast provoked him into snarling at his teenaged son and daughter about their clothing and their hair as if they were not both wearing school uniforms as if their heads were not wellgroomed and tidy stephen glanced at his mother linda did the same and the three of them tucked into their own breakfasts with the martyred air of a family too long exposed to the unexpected moodswings of the chronic dieter traffic had been locked at the newnham road roundabout and only by driving half on the pavement was sheehan able to reach the bridge of fen causeway at something other than the hedgehog speed at which the rest of the cars were moving he could envision the clogged mess which every southern artery into the city had probably become by now and when he braked his car behind the constabularys scenesofcrime van and heaved himself into the damp cold air he told the constable stationed on the bridge to radio the dispatcher for more men to help move traffic along he hated rubberneckers and thrill seekers equally accidents and murders brought out the worst in people tucking his navy scarf more securely into his overcoat sheehan ducked under the yellow ribbon of the established police line on the bridge a half a dozen undergraduates leaned over the parapet trying to get a look at the activity below sheehan growled and waved the constable over to deal with them if the victim was a member of one of the colleges he wasnt about to let the word out any sooner than he had to an uneasy peace had reigned between the local constabulary and the university since a cockedup investigation at emmanuel last term he didnt particularly want anything to disturb it he crossed the footbridge to the island where a female constable was hovering over a woman whose face and lips were the colour of unbleached linen she was sitting on one of the bottom iron steps of crusoes bridge one arm curved round her stomach and one fi st bearing the weight of her head she wore an old blue overcoat that looked as if it would dangle to her ankles the front of it crusted with brown and yellow specks apparently shed been sick on herself she found the body sheehan asked the constable who nodded in reply whos made it so far everyone but pleasance drake kept him at the lab sheehan snorted just another little tiff in forensic no doubt he raised his chin sharply at the woman in the overcoat get her a blanket keep her here he went back to the gate and entered the southern section of the island depending upon how one looked at it the place was either a dreamcometrue or a crimescene nightmare evidence abounded everything from disintegrating newspapers to partially filled and discarded plastic sacks the whole area looked like a common dumping ground with at least a dozen goodand obviously differentfootprints pressed into the soggy earth hell sheehan muttered wooden planks had been laid down by the scenesofcrime team they started at the gate and travelled south disappearing into the fog he picked his way along these avoiding the regular splattering of water from the trees overhead fogdrops his daughter linda would have called them with that passion for linguistic accuracy which always surprised him into thinking that his real daughter had somehow been left behind at the hospital sixteen years ago and a pixyfaced poet left in her place he paused by a clearing where two canvases and an easel leaned against a poplar and a wooden case gaped open collecting a skin of condensation on a neat row of pastels and eight handlettered tubes of paint he frowned at this looking from the river to the bridge to the great puffs of fog rising like a gas from the fen as the subject for a painting it reminded him of that french stuff hed seen at the courtauld institute years ago dots and swirls and dashes of colour that you could only fi gure out if you stood forty feet away and squinted like the devil and thought about how things might look if you needed specs further along the planks veered to the left and he came upon his police photographer and the forensic biologist they were bundled against the cold in overcoats and knitted caps and they pranced about like two russian dancers hopping from foot to foot to keep the circulation going the photographer looked as pale as he usually did prior to having to document a killing the forensic biologist looked peeved she hugged her arms to her chest shifted from one foot to the other in a bobbling fashion and glanced repeatedly and restlessly in the direction of the causeway as if in the belief that the killer lingered beyond them in the fog and only by plunging through it immediately could they hope to apprehend him as sheehan reached them and began to ask his customary questionwhat dwe have this timehe saw the reason for the forensic biologists impatience a tall fi gure was emerging from the mist beneath the crack willows walking carefully with his eyes on the ground in spite of the cold his cashmere greatcoat was slung indifferently round his shoulders like a cape and he wore no scarf to detract from the crisp clean lines of his italian suit drake the head of sheehans forensic department onehalf of a bickering duo of scientists that had been aggravating him for the last fi ve months he was indulging in his flair for costume this morning sheehan noted anything he asked the scientist drake paused to light a cigarette he pinched the match with his gloved fingers and deposited it in a small jar which he took from his pocket sheehan refrained from comment the bloody man never went anywhere unprepared we appear to be missing a weapon he said i should think were going to have to drag the river for a look wonderful sheehan thought and counted up the men and the hours it would take to complete the operation he went to have a look at the body female the biologist said just a kid as sheehan gazed down at the girl he refl ected upon the fact that there was none of the hush which one would expect to attend a death horns bellowed from the causeway idling engines bawled brakes squealed voices called birds chirruped in the trees and a dog yelped sharply in pain or play life was continuing despite the proximity and the evidence of violence that the girls death had been violent was unquestionable although much of her had been deliberately covered with fallen leaves enough of her body was exposed to allow sheehan to see the worst someone had beaten in her face the tie of her track jackets hood was wound round her neck whether she had died from head wounds or from strangulation would ultimately have to be determined by the pathologist but one thing was clear no one would be able to identify her from a simple glance at her face it was battered sheehan squatted for a careful closer look she lay on her right side her face turned into the earth and her long hair falling forward and coiling on the ground her arms were in front of her wrists together but unbound her knees were bent he gnawed thoughtfully at his lower lip glanced at the river five feet away looked back at the body she was wearing a stained brown tracksuit and white athletic shoes with dirty laces she looked trim she looked fi t she looked like the political nightmare he had hoped she wouldnt be he lifted her arm to see if there was any insignia on her jacket his breath puffed out of him in a sigh of despair when he saw that a shield surmounted by the words st stephens college had been sewn onto the material that covered her left breast god damn he muttered he replaced her arm and nodded at the photographer shoot her he said and moved away he looked across coe fen the fog seemed to be lifting but it might have been the effect of growing daylight a momentary illusion or wishful thinking still it didnt matter if the fog was there or not for sheehan was cambridge born and bred and he knew what lay beyond that opaque veil of shifting mist peterhouse across the street pembroke to pembrokes left corpus christi from there to the north the west and the east sprang college after college surrounding them servicing them owing its very existence to the presence of the university was the city itself and all of itcolleges faculties libraries businesses homes and inhabitantsrepresented more than six hundred years of uneasy symbiosis a movement behind him and sheehan turned to look into drakes moody grey eyes obviously the forensic scientist had known what to expect hed been long anticipating the opportunity to put the thumbscrews to his subordinate back in the lab unless she beat in her own face and made the weapon disappear i doubt anyone will argue this a suicide he said in his london office new scotland yards superintendent malcolm webberly mashed out his third cigar in as many hours and surveyed his divisional dis wondering how merciful they would be about ignoring the egg which he was about to splatter upon his own face considering the length and volume of his diatribe only two weeks ago he knew he could probably expect the worst he certainly deserved it he had expostulated with his team for at least thirty minutes about what he had caustically referred to as the crosscountry crusaders and now he was about to ask one of his men to join them he evaluated the possibilities they were sitting round the central table in his offi ce as usual hale was giving way to nervous energy playing with a pile of paperclips which he appeared to be fashioning into a form of lightweight mail perhaps with the anticipation of doing battle with someone armed with toothpicks stewartthe divisional compulsivewas using the pause in conversation to work on a report a behaviour that was typical to him rumour had it that stewart had somehow managed to perfect making love to his wife and filling out police reports simultaneously and with just about the same degree of enthusiasm next to him macpherson was cleaning his fingernails with a brokentipped pen knife a thistooshallpass expression on his face while on his left lynley polished his reading spectacles with a snowcoloured handkerchief on which the heavily embroidered letter a adorned one corner webberly had to smile at the irony of the situation a fortnight ago he had been expounding on the countrys current penchant for peripatetic policing using as fodder a piece in the times which consisted of an expose on the amount of public funds being poured into the unnatural workings of the criminal justice system look at this he had snarled bunching the newspaper in his hand in such a way that made looking at it impossible weve got the greater manchester force investigating sheffield on suspicion of bribery because of that hillsborough football cockup weve got yorkshire in manchester looking at complaints against some senior officers weve got west yorkshire peeping at the serious crimes squad in birmingham avon and somerset dabbling round the guilford four in surrey and cambridgeshire mucking out northern ireland looking for dust under the beds of the ruc no ones patrolling his own patch any longer and its time that stopped his men had nodded in thoughtful agreement although webberly wondered if any of them had really been listening their hours were long their burdens tremendous thirty minutes given to their superintendents political maundering were thirty minutes they could ill afford that latter thought came to him later however at the moment the craving for debate was upon him his audience was captive he was compelled to continue this is miserable rubbish whats happened to us ccs are running like bashful milkmaids at the first sign of trouble from the press they ask anyone and everyone to investigate their men rather than run their own force conduct their own investigation and tell the media to eat cow dung in the meantime who are these idiots that they dont have the gumption to wash their own dirty laundry if anyone took umbrage with the superintendents display of mixed metaphors no one commented upon it instead they bowed to the rhetorical nature of his question and waited patiently for him to answer it which he did in an oblique fashion just let them ask me to become part of this nonsense ill give them all a real piece of whatfor and now he had come to it with a special request from two separate parties direction from webberlys own superior officer and neither time nor opportunity to give anyone whatfor webberly pushed himself back from the table and lumbered to his desk where he pressed the intercom for his secretary in response the slender box chattered with static and conversation the former he was used to the intercom had not worked properly since the hurricane of the latter unfortunately he was used to as well dorothea harriman waxing warmly eloquent on the object of her not inconsiderable admiration theyre dyed i tell you have been for years that way theres no mascara to smudge up her eyes in pictures and such an interruption of static cant tell me fergies anythingi dont care how many more babies she decides harriman webberly interrupted white tights would look the bestwhen she used to favour those godawful spots thank god shes given them a rest harriman darling hat she had on at royal ascot this summer did you seelaura ashley no i wouldnt be seen dead speaking of death webberly thought and resigned himself to a more primitive stentorian and decidedly effective manner of getting his secretarys attention he strode to the door yanked it open and shouted her name dorothea harriman popped into the doorway as he returned to the table shed had her hair cut recently quite short in the back and on the sides a long glossy bit of blonde mane in the front that swept across her brow in a glitter of artifi cial gold highlighting she wore a red wool dress matching pumps and white tights unfortunately red favoured her as little as it did the princess but like the princess she had remarkable ankles superintendent webberly she asked with a nod at the officers sitting round the table it was a butterwouldntmelt look all business it declared every moment of her day was spent with her nose pressed directly upon the grindstone of her job if you can tear yourself away from your current evaluation of the princess webberly said his secretarys expression was a study in guilelessness princess who was telegraphed across her innocent face he knew better than to engage her in indirect combat six years of her adulation of the princess of wales had taught him he would lose in any attempt to shame her away from wallowing in it he resigned himself to saying theres a fax due from cambridge see about it now if you get any calls from kensington palace ill keep them on hold harriman pressed the very front of her lips together but an imps smile curled both corners of her mouth fax she said cambridge right in a tick superintendent and she added as a parting shot charles went there you know john stewart looked up tapping the top of his pen reflectively against his teeth charles he asked in some confusion as if wondering whether the attention he had been giving to his report had somehow caused him to lose the drift of the conversation wales webberly said whales in cambridge stewart asked what sort of whales where have they opened an aquarium wales as in princes of phillip hale barked the prince of wales is in cambridge stewart asked but that should be handled by special branch not by us jesus webberly took stewarts report from him and used it to gesture with as he spoke stewart winced when webberly rolled it into a tube no prince no wales just cambridge got it sir thank you webberly noted with gratitude that macpherson had put away his pocket knife and that lynley was regarding him evenly with those unreadable dark eyes that were so much at odds with his perfectly clipped blond hair theres been a killing up in cambridge that weve been asked to take on webberly said and brushed away both their objections and their comments with a quick vertical chopping motion of his hand i know dont remind me im eating my own words i dont much like it hillier hale asked astutely sir david hillier was webberlys chief superintendent if a request for the involvement of webberlys men came from him it was no request at all it was law not altogether hillier approves he knows about the case but the request came directly to me three of the dis looked at each other curiously the fourth lynley kept his eyes on webberly i temporised webberly said i know your plates are full at the moment so i can get one of the other divisions to take this but id rather not do that he returned stewart his report and watched as the di assiduously smoothed the pages against the table top to remove the curled edges he continued speaking a students been murdered a girl she was an undergraduate at st stephens college all four men reacted to that a movement in the chair a question cut off quickly a sharp look in webberlys direction to read his face for signs of worry all of them knew that the superintendents own daughter was a junior member of st stephens college her photographgiggling as she inexpertly punted both parents in an endless circle on the river camstood on one of the filing cabinets in the room webberly saw the concern on their faces its nothing to do with miranda he reassured them but she knew the girl thats part of the reason i got the call but not the only reason stewart said right the callsthere were two of themdidnt come from cambridge cid they came from the master of st stephens college and the universitys vice chancellor its a tricky situation as far as the local police are concerned the killing didnt occur in the college so cambridge cid have the right to pursue it on their own but since the victims a college girl they need the universitys cooperation to investigate th university wont gie it macpherson sounded incredulous they prefer an outside agency from what i understand they got their feathers ruffl ed over the way the local cid handled a suicide last easter term gross insensitivity towards everyone concerned the vice chancellor said not to mention some sort of leaking of information to the press and since this girl is apparently the daughter of one of the cambridge professors they want everything handled with delicacy and tact detective inspector empathy hale said with a curl of his lip it was they all knew a poorly veiled attempt to imply antagonism and lack of objectivity none of them were unaware of hales marital troubles the last thing he wanted at the moment was to be sent out of the city on a lengthy case webberly ignored him cambridge cid arent happy about the situation its their patch they prefer to handle it so whoever goes cant expect them to start killing the fatted calf but ive spoken briefly to their superintendenta bloke called sheehanhe seems a decent sortand theyll cooperate he sees the university implying this is a townandgown situation and hes miffed about the idea that his team might be accused of prejudice against the students but he knows that without the universitys cooperation any man he sends in will spend the next six months sifting through sawdust in order to find sand the sound of her light footsteps heralded harriman she presented webberly with several sheets of paper on which the words cambridgeshire constabulary were printed along the top and in the righthand corner a badge surmounted by a crown she frowned at the collection of plastic coffee cups and foulsmelling ashtrays that sat on the table amid folders and documents she clucked tossed the cups into the waste bin by the door and carried the ashtrays at arms length from the room as webberly read the report he passed on the pertinent information to his men not much to work with so far he said twenty years old elena weaver he gave the girls christian name a mediterranean pronunciation a foreign student stewart asked not from what i gathered from the master of the college this morning the mother lives in london and as ive said the dads a professor at the university a bloke shortlisted for something called the penford chair of historywhatever the hell that is hes a senior fellow at st stephens a major reputation in his field i was told thus the red carpet treatment hale interjected webberly continued theyve done no autopsy yet but theyre giving us an initial rough estimate of the time of death between midnight last night and seven this morning face beaten in with a heavy blunt instrument isnt it always hale asked after whichaccording to the preliminariesshe was strangled rape stewart asked no indication of that yet midnight and seven hale asked but you said she wasnt found in college webberly shook his head she was found by the river he frowned as he read the rest of the information cambridge constabulary had sent she was wearing a tracksuit and athletic shoes so they assume she was out running when somebody jumped her the body was covered with leaves some sketch artist stumbled on her round a quarter past seven this morning and according to sheehan got sick on the spot nae on the body i hope macpherson said that certainly plays hell with trace evidence hale noted the others laughed quietly in response webberly didnt mind the levity years of exposure to murder hardened the softest of his men he said according to sheehan they had enough evidence at the scene to keep two or three crime scene teams busy for weeks hows that stewart asked she was found on an island and its used as a general trysting place evidently so theyve at least half a dozen sacks of rubbish to analyse along with their tests on the body itself he tossed the report onto the table thats the limit of what we know right now no autopsy no record of interviews whoever takes the case will be working from the bottom its a nice little mairder nonetheless macpherson said lynley stirred reaching out for the report he put on his spectacles read it over and having done so he spoke for the fi rst time ill take it he said i thought you were working on that rent boy case in maida vale webberly said we tied it up last night this morning rather brought the killer in at half past two good god laddie take a breather sometime macpherson said lynley smiled and rose have any of you seen havers detective sergeant barbara havers sat at one of the green computers in the information room on the ground floor of new scotland yard she stared at the screen she was supposed to be scanning the pnc for information on missing personsat least five years missing if the forensic anthropologist was to be believedin an attempt to narrow down the possibilities on a set of bones found beneath the basement foundation of a building being torn down on the isle of dogs it was a favour for a mate at the manchester road police station but her mind wasnt up to assimilating the facts on the screen let alone comparing them to a list of dimensions of radius ulna femur tibia and fibula roughly she rubbed her index finger and thumb through both eyebrows and glanced at the telephone on a nearby desk she ought to phone home she needed to get her mother on the line or at least to speak with mrs gustafson and see if everything was under control in acton but punching in those seven numbers and waiting with mounting anxiety for the phone to be answered and then facing the possible knowledge that things werent working out any better than they had been for the last weekshe couldnt do it barbara told herself that there was no point to phoning acton anyway mrs gustafson was nearly deaf her mother existed in her own cloudy world of longterm dementia the chance of mrs gustafson hearing the phone was as remote as her mothers ability to understand that the shrill double ringing coming from the kitchen meant that someone somewhere wanted to speak through that peculiar black instrument that hung from the wall hearing the noise she was as likely to open the oven or go to the front door as she was to pick up the telephone receiver and even if she managed that much it was doubtful shed recognise barbaras voice or even remember who she was without endless frustrating hairpulling prodding her mother was sixtythree years old her health was excellent it was only her mind that was dying employing mrs gustafson to stay with mrs havers during the day was barbara knew only at best a temporary and unsatisfactory measure seventytwo years old herself mrs gustafson had neither the energy nor the resources to care for a woman whose day had to be programmed and monitored as carefully as a toddlers three times already barbara had come facetoface with the impediments inherent to giving mrs gustafson even limited guardianship over her mother twice she had arrived home later than usual to find mrs gustafson sound asleep in the sitting room while the television shrieked out a programmes laugh track her mother floated in a mental fugue once wandering at the bottom of the back garden once swaying aimlessly outside on the front steps but the third incident just two days ago had rocked barbara severely an interview connected to the maida vale rent boy case had brought her close to her own neighbourhood and she had gone home unexpectedly to see how things were going the house was empty at first she felt no panic assuming mrs gustafson had taken her mother for a walk and in fact feeling quite grateful that the older woman was even up to the challenge of controlling mrs havers in the street gratitude disintegrated with mrs gustafsons appearance on the front steps less than five minutes later shed just popped home to feed her fish she said and added mums all right int she for a moment barbara refused to believe what mrs gustafsons question implied she isnt with you she asked mrs gustafson raised one liverspotted hand to her throat a tremor shook the grey curls of her wig just popped home to feed the fish she said no moren a minute or two barbie barbaras eyes flew to the clock she felt panic sweeping over her and with it came the wild scattering of a dozen different scenarios comprising her mother lying dead in the uxbridge road her mother floundering through the crowds on the tube her mother trying to find her way to south ealing cemetery where both her son and her husband were buried her mother thinking she were twenty years younger with an appointment at the beauty parlour to keep her mother being assaulted being robbed being raped barbara rushed from the house leaving mrs gustafson wringing her hands and wailing it was just the fish as if that could somehow excuse her negligence she gunned her mini and roared in the direction of the uxbridge road she tore down streets and crisscrossed alleys she stopped people she ran into local stores and she finally found her on the grounds of the local primary school where both barbara and her longdead younger brother had once been pupils the headmaster had already phoned the police two uniformed constablesone male and one femalewere talking with her mother when barbara arrived against the windows of the school building itself barbara could see curious faces pressed and why not she thought her mother certainly presented a spectacle wearing a thin summer house dress and slippers and nothing else at all save her spectacles which were not on her nose but for some reason perched on the top of her head her hair was uncombed her body smelled unwashed she babbled protested and argued like a madwoman when the female constable reached out for her she dodged away adroitly and began running towards the school calling for her children that had been just two days ago yet another indication that mrs gustafson was not the answer in the eight months since her fathers death barbara had tried a variety of solutions to the problem of her mother at first shed taken her to an adult day care centre the very latest thing in dealing with the aged but the centre couldnt keep their clients after seven at night and the calls of policework made her hours irregular had he known of her need to fetch her mother by seven barbaras superior officer would have insisted that she take the time to do so but that would have placed an unfair burden upon his shoulders and barbara valued her job and her partnership with thomas lynley too highly to jeopardise either by giving her personal problems priority shed tried a variety of paid companions after that four in succession who lasted a total of twelve weeks shed worked with a church group shed employed a series of visiting social workers shed contacted social services and arranged for home help and at the last shed fallen back upon mrs gustafson their neighbour against the monitory recommendation of her own daughter mrs gustafson had stepped in as a temporary measure but the fuse on mrs gustafsons ability to deal with mrs havers was a short one and the fuse on barbaras willingness to put up with mrs gustafsons lapses was even shorter it was only a matter of days before something blew barbara knew the answer was an institution but she couldnt live with the thought of placing her mother in a public hospital rife with inadequacies associated with the national health at the same time she couldnt afford a private hospital unless she won the football pools like a female freddie clegg she felt in her jacket pocket for the business card shed placed there this morning hawthorn lodge it said uneeda drive greenford a single call to florence magentry and her problems would be solved mrs flo mrs magentry had said when she answered the door to barbaras knock at half past nine that morning thats what my dears call me mrs flo she lived in a twostorey semidetached piece of uninspired postwar housing which she optimistically called hawthorn lodge grey stucco relieved by a brick facade on the ground floor the house featured woodwork the colour of oxblood and a fi vepaned bow window looking out on a front garden fi lled with trolls the front door opened directly into a stairway to the right of this a door revealed a sitting room into which mrs flo led barbara chatting continually about the amenables which the house offered the dears who came to visit i call it a visit mrs flo said patting barbaras arm with a hand that was soft and white and surprisingly warm seems less permanent that way doesnt it let me show you round barbara knew she was looking for features that she could proclaim ideal she ticked the items off in her mind comfortable furniture in the sitting roomworn but wellmade along with a television a stereo two shelves of books and a collection of large and colourful magazines fresh paint and wallpaper and gay prints on the walls tidy kitchen and a dinette whose windows overlooked the back garden four bedrooms upstairs one for mrs flo and the other three for the dears two loos one up and one down both glistening white with fi xtures shining like silver and mrs flo herself with her largeframed spectacles and her modern wedgecut hair and her neat shirtwaister with a pansy brooch pinned at its throat she looked like a smart matron and she smelled of lemons youve phoned up at just the right time mrs flo said we lost our dear mrs tilbird last week ninetythree she was sharp as a pin went off in her sleep bless her just as peaceful as ever youd want someones passing to be shed been with me a month short of ten years mrs flos eyes became misty in her plumpcheeked face well no one lives forever and thats a fact isnt it would you like to meet the dears the residents of hawthorn lodge were taking a bit of morning sun in the back garden there were only two of them one an eightyfouryearold blind woman who smiled and nodded at barbaras greeting after which she immediately fell asleep and the other a frightenedlooking woman somewhere in her fi fties who clutched mrs flos hands and cowered back in her chair barbara recognised the symptoms can you cope with two she asked frankly mrs flo smoothed down the hair of the hand clutcher theyre no trouble to me dear god gives everyone a burden doesnt he but no ones burden is more than he can bear barbara thought of that now with her fi ngers still touching the card in her jacket pocket is that what she was trying to do to slough off a burden that from laziness or perverse selfishness she didnt want to bear she avoided the question by evaluating everything that made the placement of her mother at hawthorn lodge right she enumerated the positives the proximity to greenford station and the fact that she would only have to change trains onceat tottenham court roadif she placed her mother in this situation and herself took the small studio shed managed to find in chalk farm the greengrocers stand right inside greenford station where she could buy her mother fresh fruit on the way to a visit the common just a street away with its central walk lined with hawthorns which led to a play area of swings seesaw roundabout and benches where they could sit and watch the neighbourhood children romp the string of businesses nearbya chemist a supermarket a wine shop a bakery and even a chinese takeaway her mothers favourite food yet even as she listed every feature that encouraged her to phone mrs flo while she still had a vacancy barbara knew she was deliberately avoiding a few of the qualities of hawthorn lodge which she hadnt been able to ignore she told herself that nothing could be done about the unremitting noise from the a or about the fact that greenford itself was a sandwich of a community squeezed between the railway and a motorway then there were the three broken trolls in the front garden why on earth should she even think of them except that there was something so pathetic about the chipped nose on one the broken hat on another the armlessness of a third and there was something chilling about the shiny patches on the sofa where oily old heads had pressed against its back for too long and the crumbs in the corner of the blind womans mouth minor things she told herself little hooks digging into the skin of her guilt one couldnt expect perfection anywhere besides all of these minor points of discomfiture were inconsequential when one compared them with the circumstances of their lives in acton and the condition of the house in which they now lived the reality however was that this decision went far beyond acton versus greenford and far beyond keeping her mother at home or sending her away the entire decision went right to the core of what barbara herself wanted which was simple enough a life away from acton away from her mother away from the burdens which unlike mrs flo she did not believe she was equipped to bear selling the house in acton would give her the money to support her mother in mrs flos house she would have the funds to set herself up in chalk farm as well no matter that the chalk farm studio was little more than twentyfive feet long and twelve feet wide little more than a converted potting shed with a terra cotta chimney and missing slates on the roof it had possibilities and thats all barbara asked of life any longer just the promise of possibility behind her the door opened as someone slipped an identification card through its locking device she glanced over her shoulder as lynley entered looking quite rested despite their late night with the maida vale killer any luck he asked her next time i offer to do a bloke a favour punch my lights will you this screen makes me blind nothing then i take it nothing but i havent exactly been giving it my all she sighed made a note of the last entry shed read and exited the programme she rubbed her neck how was hawthorn lodge lynley asked her he swung a chair over and joined her at the terminal she did her best to avoid his eyes nice enough i suppose but greenfords a bit out on the central line i dont know how mum would make the adjustment shes used to acton the house you know what i mean she likes having her things about her she felt him watching her but knew that he would not offer advice their positions in life were far too different for him to presume to make a suggestion still barbara knew he was only too aware of her mothers condition and the decisions she herself now faced because of it i feel like a criminal she said hollowly why she gave you life i didnt ask for it no but one always feels a responsibility to the giver whats the best course to take we ask and is the best course the right one or is it just a convenient escape god doesnt give burdens we cannot bear barbara heard herself mouth thats a particularly ridiculous platitude havers its worse than saying things always work out for the best what nonsense things work out for the worst more often than not and godif he existsdistributes unbearable burdens all the time you of all people ought to know that why youre a cop he pushed himself to his feet weve a job out of town itll be a few days ill go on ahead you come when you can his offer irked her filled as it was with the implicit understanding of her situation she knew he wouldnt take another offi cer hed do his work and her own until she could join him how utterly like him she hated his easy generosity it made her his debtor and she did not possesswould never possessthe coin with which he might be repaid no she said ill get things set up at home ill be ready inhow much time do i have an hour two havers ill go havers its cambridge she jerked her head up saw the undisguised satisfaction in his warm brown eyes she shook her head darkly youre a real fool inspector he nodded grinned but only for love anthony weaver pulled his citroën to a halt on the wide gravel drive of his home in adams road he stared through the windscreen at the winter jasmine that grewneat and restrainedon the trellis to the left of the front door for the last eight hours hed been living in the region that lies just between a nightmare and hell and now he was numb it was shock his intellect told him certainly hed begin feeling something again just as soon as this period of disbelief had passed he made no move to get out of the car instead he waited for his former wife to speak but stolidly sitting next to him in the passenger seat glyn weaver maintained the silence with which she had greeted him at the cambridge railway station she hadnt allowed him to drive to london to fetch her to carry her suitcase or to open a door nor had she allowed him to witness her grief he understood hed already accepted the blame for their daughters death hed taken on that responsibility the moment hed identified elenas body glyn had no need to hurl accusations at him he would have agreed with every one he saw her eyes sweep over the front of the house and he wondered if she would remark upon it she hadnt been to cambridge since helping elena get settled into st stephens in her first term and even then shed not set foot in adams road she would he knew see the house as indication of the combined elements of remarriage inheritance and professional egocentricity a veritable showpiece of his success brick three storeys white woodwork decorative tile cladding from second storey to roofline a glassenclosed morning room with a roof terrace atop it this was a far cry from their claustrophobic newlywed digs three rooms on hope street more than twenty years ago this house was set alone at the end of a curved drive not butted up to a neighbours dwelling and squatting less than five feet from the street this was the house of a tenured professor a respected member of the history faculty this was no illlit tenement of dying dreams to the right of the house a copper beech hedgebrilliant with the sunset colours of autumnwalled off the back garden through an opening in the bushes an irish setter bounded joyfully towards the car seeing the animal glyn spoke for the first time her voice low without apparent emotion this is her dog yes we couldnt keep one in london the fl at was too small she always wanted a dog she talked about a spaniel she breaking off glyn got out of the car the dog took two hesitant steps forward tongue hanging out in a slapdash canine grin glyn observed the animal but made no overt attempt to greet him he took another two steps and snuffled round her feet with a rapid blink she looked back at the house she said justines made you a lovely place in the world anthony between brick pilasters the front door opened its polished oak panels catching what little of the quickly fading afternoon light managed to seep through the fog anthonys wife justine stood with one hand on the doorknob she said glyn come in please ive made tea after which she backed once again into the house wisely offering no condolences where they would not be welcome anthony followed glyn into the house carrying her suitcase up to the guestroom and returning to find her and justine standing in the sitting room glyn at the window overlooking the front lawn with its careful arrangement of white wrought iron furniture glistening through the fog and justine by the sofa with the tips of her fingers pressed together in front of her his first and second wives could not have been more dissimilar glyn at fortysix was making no attempt to resist the encroachments of middleage her face was worn with crows feet at her eyes deep lines like trenches from nose to chin tiny indentations shooting out from her lips jawline losing definition from the pull of flesh beginning to sag grey streaked her hair which she wore long drawn back from her face in a severe chignon her body was thickening at the waist and hips and she covered it with tweed and wool and fl eshcoloured stockings and fl at walking shoes in contrast justine at thirtyfive still managed to suggest the fresh bloom of youth blessed with the sort of facial structure that would only enhance her looks as she grew older she was attractive without being beautiful with smooth skin blue eyes knifeedged cheekbones a firm jaw she was tall and lanky with a cascade of dusty blonde hair that hung as it had from adolescence loosely round her shoulders trim and fit she wore the same clothes now in which she had gone off to work this morning a tailored grey suit with a wide black belt grey stockings black pumps a silver pin on her lapel she was perfect as always anthony looked beyond her to the dining room where she had laid the table for afternoon tea it served as demonstration of how justine had spent the hours since he had telephoned her at the university press to tell her of his daughters death while he had been to the morgue to the police station to the college to his offi ce to the railway station while he had identified the body and answered questions and accepted incredulous condolences and contacted his former wife justine had made her own preparations for the coming days of their mourning the result of her efforts was spread across the burltopped dining table on a linen cloth sat the entire tea service from their wedding china a pattern of giltedged roses and curling leaves among the plates and cups and silver and crisp white napkins and vases of flowers lay a poppy seed cake a platter of delicate afternoon sandwiches another of thinly sliced bread and butter fresh scones strawberry jam and clotted cream anthony looked at his wife justine smiled fl eetingly saying again with an airy motion at the table ive made tea thank you darling he said the words felt unnatural badly rehearsed glyn justine waited for the other woman to turn may i offer you something glyns eyes slid to the table from there to anthony thank you no i couldnt possibly eat justine turned to her husband anthony he saw the trap for a moment he felt suspended in the air like the rope in an endless tugofwar then he went to the table he chose a sandwich a scone a slice of cake the food tasted like sand justine came to his side and poured the tea its steam rose in the air with the fruity scent of the modern herbal blend she preferred the two of them stood there with the food spread out before them the silver gleaming and the flowers fresh glyn remained by the window in the other room no one moved towards a chair what did the police tell you glyn asked they never phoned me i told them not to why i thought i should be the one to you anthony saw justine set down her teacup he saw that her eyes remained on its rim what happened to her anthony glyn sit down please i want to know what happened anthony set his plate down next to the cup of tea which he had not tasted he returned to the sitting room justine followed he sat on the sofa motioned his wife down next to him and waited to see if glyn would move from the window she did not do so next to him justine began twisting her wedding band anthony recited the facts for glyn elena was out running someone killed her she was beaten and strangled i want to see the body no glyn you dont glyns voice wavered for the fi rst time she was my daughter i want to see the body not as she is now later when the morticians ill see her anthony he could hear the tight elevation in her voice and knew from experience where it would lead he headed her off with one side of her face is bashed in the bones are showing she doesnt have a nose is that what you want to see glyn fumbled in her handbag and brought out a tissue damn you she whispered then how did it happen you told meyou promised meshe wouldnt run alone she phoned justine last night she said she wasnt going to run this morning she phoned glyns glance moved from anthony to his wife you ran with elena justine stopped twisting her wedding band but she kept her fingers on it as if it were a talisman anthony asked me to he didnt like her running along the river when it was dark so i ran as well last night she phoned and said she wouldnt be running but evidently for some reason she changed her mind how long has this been going on glyn asked her attention going back to her former husband you said elena wouldnt be running alone but you never said that justine she abruptly shifted gears how could you do that anthony how could you entrust your daughters wellbeing to glyn anthony interposed she wouldnt be concerned she wouldnt watch over her she wouldnt take care to see that she was safe glyn for gods sake its true shes never had a child so how could she know what its like to watch and wait and worry and wonder to have dreams a thousand and one dreams that wont come to anything because she didnt run with elena this morning justine hadnt moved on the sofa her expression was fixed a glazed mask of good breeding let me take you to your room she said and got to her feet you must be exhausted weve put you in the yellow room at the back of the house its quiet there youll be able to rest i want elenas room well yes of course thats no trouble at all ill just see to the sheets her voice drifting off justine left the room glyn said at once why did you give her elena what are you saying justine is my wife thats the real point isnt it how much do you care that elenas dead youve got someone right here to cook up another anthony got to his feet against her words he summoned up the image of elena as he last had seen her from the window of the morning room offering him a grin and a final wave from her bicycle as she pedalled off to a supervision after their lunch together it had been just the two of them eating their sandwiches chatting about the dog sharing an hour of love he felt anguish swell recreate elena fashion another there was only one he himself had died with her blindly he pushed past his exwife he could still hear her low harsh words continue as he left the house even though he couldnt distinguish one from another he stumbled to his car fumbled the keys into the ignition he was reversing down the driveway when justine ran outside she called his name he saw her caught for a moment in the headlamps before he plunged his foot onto the accelerator and with a sputter of gravel clattered into adams road he felt his chest heaving his throat aching as he drove he began to weepdry hot tearless sobs for his daughter and his wives and the mess hed made of every part of his life he was on grange road and then on barton road and then blessedly out of cambridge itself it had grown quite dark and the fog was thick especially in this area of fallow open fields and winterdying hedges but he drove without caution and when the countryside gave way to a village he parked and threw himself out of the car only to fi nd that the temperature had fallen further encouraged by the bitter east anglian wind hed left his overcoat at home all he wore was a suit jacket but that was of no account he turned up its collar and began to walk past a kissing gate past half a dozen thatched cottages stopping only when he came to her house he crossed the street then to get some distance from the building but even through the fog he could see in the window she was there moving across the sitting room with a mug in her hand she was small so slender if he held her she would be practically nothing in his arms just a fragile heartbeat and a glowing life that consumed him fired him and had once made him whole he wanted to go to her he needed to talk to her he wanted to be held he stepped off the kerb as he did so a car skidded by horn honking in warning a stifl ed shout from inside it brought him back to his senses he watched her go to the fi replace where she fed wood into the flames as he once had done turning from the fire to find her eyes on him her smile a benediction her hand held out tonio shed murmur his name underscored with love and hed answer her even as he did this moment tigresse just a whisper tigresse la tigresse lynley arrived in cambridge at half past five and drove directly to bulstrode gardens where he parked the bentley in front of a house that reminded him of jane austens home in chawton here was the same symmetry of designtwo casement windows and a white front door below three evenly spaced windows in the same positions above possessing a pantiled roof and several plain chimneys the house was a rectangular solid uninteresting piece of architecture lynley didnt however feel the same disappointment upon seeing it that he had felt in chawton one expected jane austen to have lived in a snug whimsically atmospheric thatched cottage surrounded by a garden fi lled with fl owerbeds and trees one didnt expect a struggling lecturer from the divinity faculty to maintain a wife and three children in that kind of wattleanddaub heaven he got out of the car and shrugged into his overcoat the fog he noted managed to obscure and romanticise features of the house that spoke of a growing indifference and neglect in lieu of a garden a semicircular driveway of leafstrewn pebbles curved round the front door and the inner part of the semicircle comprised an overgrown flowerbed which was separated from the street by a low brick wall here nothing had been done to prepare the ground for autumn or winter so the remains of summer plants were lying blackened and dying against a solid sheet of unturned soil a large hibiscus was fast overpowering the garden wall trailing among the yellowed leaves of narcissi which should long ago have been cleared away to the left of the front door an actinidia had worked its way up to the roof and was sending out tendrils to cover one of the lower windows while to the right of the door the same species of plant was creating an inert mound of diseasespotted leaves as a result the front of the house bore a lopsided appearance at odds with the symmetry of its design lynley passed beneath a birch at the edge of the drive from a neighbouring house he could hear faint music and somewhere in the fog a door slammed like the crack of a pistol shot sidestepping an overturned largewheeled tricycle he mounted the single step to the porch and rang the bell its noise was answered by the shouting of two children who raced to the front door with the accompanying clatter of some sort of popping toy hands which could not yet successfully manage the doorknob pounded frantically instead on the wood auntie leen either the boy or the girl was doing the shouting it was difficult to tell a light went on in the room to the right of the front door sending an insubstantial oblong of illumination onto the driveway through the mist a baby began crying a womans voice called out just a moment auntie leen door i know christian above his head the porchlight went on and lynley heard the sound of the deadbolt turning step back darling the woman said as she opened the door the four of them were framed by the architrave and held in a sideways diffusion of gold light from the sitting room that would have done credit to rembrandt indeed just for a moment they looked very much like a painting the woman in a rose cowlnecked sweater against which she held an infant wrapped in a cranberry shawl while two toddlers clutched the legs of her black wool trousers a boy with a misshapen bruise beneath his eye and a girl with the handle of some sort of wheeled toy in her hand this apparently was the source of the popping sound lynley had heard for the toy was domed in transparent plastic and when the child pushed it along the fl oor coloured balls fl ew up and hit the dome like noisy bubbles tommy lady helen clyde said she took a step back from the door and urged the two children to do the same they moved like a unit youre in cambridge yes she looked over his shoulder as if in the expectation of seeing someone with him youre alone alone what a surprise come in the house smelled strongly of wet wool sour milk talcum powder and nappies the odours of children it was filled with the detritus of children as well in the form of toys strewn across the sitting room fl oor storybooks with torn pages gaping open on the sofa and chairs discarded jumpers and playsuits heaped on the hearth a stained blue blanket was bunched onto the seat of a miniature rocking chair and as lynley followed lady helen through the sitting room into the kitchen at the rear of the house the little boy ran to this grabbed it and clutched it he peered at lynley with defi ant curiosity whos he auntie leen he demanded his sister remained at lady helens side her left hand fixed like an extra appendage to her aunts trousers while her right hand made the climb to her face and her thumb found its way into her mouth stop that perdita the boy said mummy says not to suck you baby christian lady helen said in gentle admonition she guided perdita to a childsized table beneath a window where the little girl began to rock in the tiny ladderback chair her thumb in her mouth her large dark eyes fi xed with what looked like desperation on her aunt theyre not dealing with a new baby sister very well lady helen said quietly to lynley shifting the crying infant to her other shoulder i was just taking her up to be fed hows pen doing lady helen glanced at the children the simple look said it all no better she said let me take the baby up ill be back in a moment she smiled can you manage does he bite only girls thats a comforting thought she laughed and went back through the sitting room he heard her footsteps on the stairs and the sound of her voice as she murmured to the baby gentling its cries he turned back to the children they were twins he knew just over four years old christian and perdita the girl was older by fifteen minutes but the boy was larger more aggressive and from what lynley could see unlikely to respond to friendly overtures from strangers that was just as well considering the times in which they lived nonetheless it didnt make for a comfortable situation he had never been at his best with toddlers mummys sick christian accompanied this announcement by bashing his foot into the door of a kitchen cupboard one two three savage little kicks whereupon he discarded his blanket on the floor opened the cupboard and began pulling out a set of copperbottomed pots the baby made her sick that happens sometimes lynley said shell get better soon i dont care christian pounded a pan against the floor perdita cries she wet the bed last night lynley glanced at the little girl curly hair tumbling into her eyes she rocked without speaking her cheeks worked in and out round her thumb she didnt mean to i imagine daddy wont come home christian selected a second pan which he banged unmercifully into the first the noise was teethjarring but it didnt seem to bother either one of the children daddy doesnt like the baby hes cross with mummy what makes you think that i like auntie leen she smells good here at least was a subject about which they could converse she does indeed you like auntie leen i like her very much christian seemed to feel this planted the seeds of friendship between them he scrambled to his feet and shoved a pot and its cover into lynleys thigh here he said you do this way and he demonstrated his skill at noisemaking by slamming another cover onto a pot of his own really tommy are you encouraging him lady helen closed the kitchen door behind her and went to rescue her sisters pots and pans sit with perdita christian let me get your tea no i play not at the moment you dont lady helen detached his fingers from the handle of a pot lifted him up and carried him to the table he kicked and squalled his sister watched him roundeyed and rocking ive got to get their tea lady helen said to lynley over christians wailing he wont settle till hes eaten ive come at a bad time she sighed you have he felt his spirits sink she knelt and began gathering the pots from the fl oor he joined her in the unforgiving kitchen light he could see how pale she was the natural blush of colour was faded from her skin and there were faint smudges like newly bruised fl esh beneath her eyes he said how much longer will you be here five days daphne comes on saturday for her two weeks then mother for two then pens on her own she brushed a lock of chestnut hair off her cheek i cant think how shes going to cope alone tommy this is the worst shes ever been christian said his fathers not here much lady helen pressed her lips together quite well thats putting it mildly he touched her shoulder whats happened to them helen i dont know some sort of blood score neither one of them will talk about it she smiled without humour the sweet bliss of a marriage made in heaven unaccountably stung he removed his hand im sorry she said his mouth quirked in a smile he shrugged and put the last pot in its place tommy he looked her way it isnt any good you know that dont you you shouldnt have come she got to her feet and began removing food from the refrigerator carrying four eggs butter a wedge of cheese and two tomatoes to the cooker she rummaged in a drawer and dragged out a loaf of bread then quickly without speaking she made the childrens tea while christian occupied himself by scribbling on the table top with a stubby pencil hed removed from between the pages of a telephone directory on a jumblecovered work top nearby perdita rocked and sucked blissfully with her eyes at halfmast lynley stood by the kitchen sink watching lady helen he hadnt removed his overcoat yet she hadnt offered to take it from him what he wondered had he hoped to accomplish by coming to her at her sisters house when she was plagued by worry and worn by the effort of caring for two children and an infant who were not even hers what had he hoped that she would fall gratefully into his arms that she would see him as her blessed salvation that her face would light with joy and desire that her defences would crumble and her spirit surrenderfi nally irrefutably once and for all havers was right he was such a fool ill be off then he said she turned from the stove where she was scooping scrambled eggs onto two beatrix potter plates back to london she asked no im here on a case he told her what little he knew about it concluding with theyve given me digs at st stephens so you can relive your own undergraduate days bedders and gyp rooms and night keys from the porter she took the plates to the table along with the toast grilled tomatoes and milk christian fell to like a victim of famine perdita rocked lady helen placed a fork in her hand touched her dark head and rubbed her fi ngers gently against the childs downy cheek helen he found some comfort in saying her name she looked up ill be off now let me see you out she followed him back through the sitting room to the front door it was colder in this part of the house he looked at the stairway shall i say hello to pen i dont think so tommy he cleared his throat nodded as if she read his expression she touched his arm lightly please understand he knew instinctively that she wasnt talking about her sister i suppose you cant get away for dinner i cant leave her alone with them god only knows when harrys coming home hes staying for formal dinner at emmanuel tonight he may sleep there as well hes done that already four nights this past week will you phone me at the college if he comes home he wont will you phone oh tommy he felt a sudden overpowering surge of hopelessness which prompted him to say i volunteered for this case helen when i knew it was cambridge as soon as the words were out he despised himself he was resorting to the worst form of emotional blackmail it was manipulative dishonest and unworthy of them both she didnt respond in the shadows of the hallway she was darkness and light the glossy unbroken curve of hair to her shoulders the cream of her skin he reached out caressed the line of her jaw she came into the shelter of his overcoat he felt her arms slip warmly round him he rested his cheek on the top of her head christian said he likes you because you smell good he whispered against his chest he could feel her smile did he yes he let himself hold her for a moment longer before he pressed his lips to the top of her head christian was right he said and released her he opened the front door tommy she crossed her arms in front of her he said nothing waiting willing her to take some sort of fi rst step ill phone she said if harry turns up i love you helen he walked to his car lady helen returned to the kitchen for the first time in the nine days that she had been in cambridge she looked at the room dispassionately seeing it as an outside observer would see it dissolution it declared despite the fact that she had scrubbed it herself only three days ago the yellow linoleum floor was once again grimy patched with spilled food and drink from the childrens meals the walls looked greasy with grey handprints smeared like directional indicators against the paint work tops acted as storage space for anything that couldnt be fitted anywhere else a stack of unopened mail a wooden bowl of apples and browning bananas half a dozen newspapers a plastic jar of kitchen utensils and brushes and a childrens colouring book and crayons shared the area with a wine rack an electric mixer a toaster and a shelf of dusty books beneath the burners on the cooker the remains of boilovers lay like sour slop and cobwebs collected on three empty wicker baskets atop the refrigerator lady helen wondered what lynley must have thought seeing all this it was quite a change from the only other time he had been in bulstrode gardens for a quiet summer dinner in the back garden preceded by drinks on a lovely terrace that had since been turned into a sandbox and play area now choked with toys her sister and harry rodger had been livein lovers then consumed with each other and fueled by the delights of early love they were virtually oblivious of everything else they exchanged meaningful glances and knowing smiles they touched each other fondly at the slightest excuse they fed each other small morsels of food and shared a drink they had their own lives by dayharry lecturing at the university and pen working for the fitzwilliam museumbut by night they were one their devotion to each other had seemed excessive and embarrassing to lady helen at the time too cloying to be in particularly good taste but now she questioned the nature of her own reaction to such an overt display of love and she admitted the fact that she would rather see her sister and harry rodger clinging and cooing than witness what they had come to over the birth of their third child christian was still noisily addressing himself to his tea his toast fi ngers had become dive bombers and with accompanying sound effects which he supplied at maximum volume he was flying them gustily into his plate eggs tomatoes and cheese dripped down the front of his playsuit his sister had only picked at her own meal at the moment she was sitting motionless in her chair with a cabbage patch doll laid across her lap she was studying it pensively but she did not touch it lady helen knelt by perditas chair as christian shouted kaboom kaplowy eggs splashed across the table perdita blinked as a bit of tomato hit her on the cheek enough christian lady helen said taking his plate from him he was her nephew she was supposed to love him and under most circumstances she could say that she did but after nine days her patience was at its lowest ebb and if shed ever had compassion for the unspoken fears that underlay his behaviour she found that she couldnt summon it at the moment he opened his mouth for a howl of protest she reached across the table and covered it with her hand enough youre being a wicked little boy stop this right now that beloved auntie leen would speak to him in such a manner seemed to surprise christian momentarily into cooperation but only for a moment he said mummy and his eyes fi lled with tears without the slightest qualm lady helen seized the advantage yes mummy shes trying to rest but youre not making it very easy for her are you he fell silent and she turned to his sister wont you eat something perdita the little girl kept her eyes on her doll which lay inertly across her lap with cheeks shaped like marbles and a placid smile on her lips the appropriate picture of infancy and childhood lady helen thought she said to christian im going up to check on mummy and the baby will you keep perdita company for me christian eyed his sisters plate she dint eat he said perhaps you can persuade her to have a bit she left them together and went to her sister in the upper corridor the house was quiet and at the top of the stairs she took a moment to lean her forehead against the cold pane of a window she thought of lynley and his unexpected appearance in cambridge she had a fairly good idea of what his presence presaged it had been nearly ten months since he had made the wild drive to skye in order to fi nd her nearly ten months since the icy day in january when he had asked her to marry him nearly ten months since she had refused he had not asked her again and in the intervening time they had somehow reached an unspoken agreement to try to retreat to the easy companionship which they once had shared it was a retreat that brought little satisfaction to either of them however for in asking her to marry him lynley had crossed an undefined boundary altering their relationship in ways neither of them could have possibly foreseen now they found themselves in an uncertain limbo in which they had to face the fact that while they could call themselves friends for the rest of their lives if they chose to do so the reality was that friendship had ended between them the moment lynley took the alchemical risk of changing it into love their every meeting since januaryno matter how innocent or superfluous or casualhad been subtly coloured by the fact that he had asked her to marry him and because they had not spoken of it again the subject seemed to lie like quicksand between them one wrong step and she knew shed go under caught in the suffocating mire of attempting to explain to him that which would hurt him more than she could bear lady helen sighed and pulled back her shoulders her neck felt sore the cold window had made her forehead feel damp she was tired to the bone at the end of the corridor her sisters bedroom door was closed and she tapped on it quietly before letting herself in she didnt bother to wait for penelope to answer her knocking nine days with her sister had taught her that she would not do so the windows were closed against the nighttime fog and cold air and an electric fi re in addition to the radiator made the room claustrophobic between the closed windows sat her sisters kingsize bed and looking ashenfaced even in the soft light of the bedside table penelope lay holding the infant to her swollen breast even when lady helen said her name she kept her head tilted back against the headboard her eyes squeezed shut her lips pressed into a scar line of pain her face was sheened with sweat which was forming rivulets that ran from her temples to her jaws then dripped and formed new rivulets on her bare chest as lady helen watched a single inordinately heavy tear trickled down her sisters cheek she didnt wipe it away nor did she open her eyes not for the first time lady helen felt the frustration of her own uselessness she had seen the condition of her sisters breasts with their cracked and bleeding nipples she had heard her sister cry out as she expressed the milk yet she knew penelope well enough to know that nothing she might say could make a difference to her once she was bent upon a course of action she would breastfeed this baby until its sixth month no matter the pain or the cost motherhood had become a fi ne point of honour a position from which she would never retreat lady helen approached the bed and looked at the baby noticing for the first time that pen wasnt holding her rather she had placed the infant on a pillow and it was this which she held pressing the babys face to her breast the baby sucked soundlessly pen continued to weep she hadnt been out of the room all day yesterday she had managed ten listless minutes in the sitting room with the twins squabbling at her feet while lady helen changed the sheets on her bed but today she had remained behind the closed door stirring herself only when lady helen brought the baby to be fed sometimes she read sometimes she sat in a chair by the window most of the time she wept although the baby was now a month old neither pen nor her husband had yet named the child referring to it as the baby she or her it was as if not naming the baby made her presence in their lives a less permanent feature if she didnt have a name she didnt really exist if she didnt exist they hadnt created her if they hadnt created her they didnt have to examine the fact that whatever love lust or devotion moved her making seemed to have disappeared between them fist curled the infant gave over sucking her chin was wet with a thin greenish fi lm of mothers milk releasing a fractured breath pen pushed the pillow away from her breast and lady helen raised the baby to her own shoulder i heard the door pens voice was weary and strained she did not open her eyes her hairdark like her childrenslay in a limp mass pressed to her skull harry no it was tommy hes here on a case her sisters eyes opened tommy lynley what did he want here lady helen patted the babys warm back to say hello i suppose she walked to the window pen shifted in bed lady helen knew she was watching her how did he know where to fi nd you i told him of course why no dont answer you wanted him to come didnt you the question had the ring of an accusation lady helen turned from the window where the fog was pressing like a monstrous wet cobweb against the glass before she could answer her sister continued i dont blame you helen you want to get out of here you want to get back to london who wouldnt thats not true your flat and your life and the silence god oh god i miss the silence most of all and being alone and having time to myself and privacy pen began to weep she fumbled among creams and unguents on the bedside table for a box of tissues im sorry im a mess im no good for anyone dont say that please you know it isnt true look at me just please look at me helen im good for nothing im just a baby machine i cant even be a proper mother to my children im a ruin im a slug its depression pen you do see that dont you you went through this when the twins were born and if you remember i didnt i was fine perfectly completely youve forgotten how it was youve put it behind you as youll do with this pen turned her head away her body heaved with a sob harrys staying at emmanuel again isnt he she flashed a wet face in her sisters direction never mind dont answer i know he is it was the closest thing to an opening pen had given her in nine days lady helen took it at once sitting down on the edge of the bed whats happening here pen hes got what he wants why hang about to examine the damage got i dont understand is there another woman pen laughed bitterly choked back a sob and then deftly changed the subject you know why hes come up from london helen dont pretend youre naive you know what he wants and he intends to get it thats the real lynley spirit charge right towards the goal lady helen didnt reply she laid pens daughter on her back on the bed feeling warmed by the babys fi stwaving legkicking grin she wrapped the tiny fingers round one of her own and bent to kiss them what a miracle she was ten fingers ten toes sweet miniature nails hes here for more reasons than to solve some little murder and you ought to be ready to head him off thats all in the past dont be such a fool her sister leaned forward grabbed onto her wrist listen to me helen youve got it all right now dont throw it away because of a man get him out of your life he wants you he means to have you hell never give it up unless you spell it out for him so do it lady helen smiled in what she hoped was a loving fashion she covered her sisters hand with her own pen darling we arent playacting at tess of the durbervilles tommy isnt in hot pursuit of my virtue and even if he were im afraid hes about she laughed lightly let me try to rememberyes hes just about fifteen years too late fifteen years exactly on christmas eve shall i tell you about it her sister pulled away this isnt a joke lady helen watched feeling surprised and helpless as pens eyes filled again pen no youre living in a dream world roses and champagne and cool satin sheets sweet little babies delivered by the stork adoring children sitting on mamas knee nothing smelly or unpleasant or painful or disgusting well take a good look round here if you mean to get married tommy hasnt come to cambridge to ask me to marry him take a good long look because lifes rotten helen its fi lthy and lousy its just a way to die but you dont think of that you dont think of anything youre not being fair oh i dare say you think about screwing him though thats what you hoped for when you saw him tonight i dont blame you how could i hes supposed to be quite the performer in bed i know at least a dozen women in london wholl be only too happy to attest to that so do what you want screw him marry him i only hope youre not so stupid as to think hed be faithful to you or your marriage or to anything in fact were only friends pen thats the beginning and end of it maybe you just want the houses and cars and servants and money and the title of course we mustnt forget that countess of asherton what a brilliant match at least one of us will end up making daddy proud she turned on her side and switched out the light on the bedside table im going to sleep now put the baby to bed pen no im going to sleep it was always clear that elena weaver had the potential for a first terence cuff said to lynley but i suppose we say that about most undergraduates dont we what would they be doing here if they didnt have the potential to take firsts in their subjects what was hers english cuff poured two sherries and handed one to lynley he nodded towards three overstuffed chairs that were grouped round a gateleg table to the right of the librarys fireplace a twotiered demonstration of one of the more fl amboyant aspects of late elizabethan architecture deco rated with marble caryatids corinthian columns and the coat of arms of vincent amberlane lord brasdown the college founder before coming to the lodge lynley had taken a solitary evening stroll through the seven courts that comprised the western twothirds of st stephens college pausing in the fellows garden where a terrace overlooked the river cam he was a lover of architecture he took pleasure in the evidence of each periods individual caprice and while he had always found cambridge itself to be a rich source of architectural whimsiesfrom trinity great courts fountain to queens mathematical bridgest stephens college he discovered merited special attention it spanned five hundred years of design from the sixteenthcentury principal court with its buildings of red brick and freestone quoins to the twentiethcentury triangular north court where the junior combination room the bar a lecture hall and the buttery were contained in a series of sliding glass panels framed by brazilian mahogany st stephens was one of the largest colleges in the university bound by the trinities as university brochures described it with trinity college to its north trinity hall to its south and trinity lane bisecting its west and east sections only the river running along its western boundary kept the college from being entirely hemmed in the masters lodge sat at the southwest end of the college grounds abutting garret hostel lane and facing the river cam its construction dated from the s and like its predecessors in principal court it had escaped the ashlar refacing that had been so popular in cambridge in the eighteenth century thus it maintained its original brick exterior and contrasting stone quoins and like much of the architecture of the period it was a happy combination of classical and gothic details its perfect balance spoke of the influence of classical design two bay windows jutted out on either side of the front door while a row of dormer windows topped by semicircular pediments rose from a pitched slate roof a lingering love of the gothic showed itself in that roofs crenellation in the pointed arch that comprised the buildings entry and in the fan vaulting of that entrys ceiling it was here that lynley came to keep his appointment with terence cuff master of st stephens and a graduate of exeter college oxford where lynley himself had been a student lynley watched cuff settle his lanky frame into one of the overstuffed chairs in the panelled library he couldnt remember having heard about cuff during his own time at oxford but as the man was some twenty years lynleys senior this fact could hardly constitute an indication of cuffs failure to distinguish himself as an undergraduate he seemed to wear confidence with the same ease with which he wore his fawn trousers and navy jacket it was clear that while he was deeplyperhaps even personallyconcerned about the murder of one of the junior members of the college he did not look upon elena weavers death as a statement about his competence as college head im relieved that the vice chancellor agreed to scotland yards coordinating the investigation cuff said setting his sherry on the gateleg table having miranda webberly at st stephens helped it was easy enough to give the vice chancellor her fathers name according to webberly there was some concern about the way a case was handled by the local cid last easter term cuff rested his head against his index and forefinger he wore no rings his hair was thick and ash grey it was a clearcut suicide but someone from the police station leaked to the local press that it looked to him like a hushedup murder you know the sort of thing an allegation that the universitys protecting one of its own it developed into a small but nasty situation fanned by the local press id like to avoid that happening again the vice chancellor agrees but i understand the girl wasnt killed on university property so it stands to reason that someone from the city may have committed the crime if thats the case youre heading into a nasty situation of another sort no matter what anyone wants from new scotland yard yes believe me i know so the yards involvement cuff stopped lynley with the abrupt words elena was killed on robinson crusoes island are you familiar with it a short distance from mill lane and the university centre its long been a gathering place for young people somewhere they go to drink and smoke members of the colleges that seems a bit odd quite no members of college dont need the island they can drink and smoke in their common rooms the graduates can go to the university centre anyone who wants to get up to anything else can do as much in his own bedsit weve a certain number of rules naturally but i cant say theyre enforced with any regularity and the days of the proctors patrolling are gone then i gather the islands mostly used by the city the south end yes the north ends used to repair rivercraft in the winter college boats some so students and locals might have occasion to bump into one another there cuff didnt disagree an unpleasant runin between a member of a college and someone from the city a few choice epithets the word townee hurled like an execration and a killing as revenge was elena weaver likely to have had that sort of runin youre thinking of an altercation that led up to a lyinginwait its a possibility i should think cuff looked over the top of his glass to an antique globe standing in one of the librarys bay windows the light from the room created the globes duplicate slightly contortedon the imperfect pane to be frank that doesnt sound at all like elena and even if that werent the case if were talking about a killer who knew her and waited for her i doubt it was someone from the city as far as i know she had no city relationship close enough to lead to murder an arbitrary killing then the night porter indicates she left the college grounds round a quarter past six she was by herself it would certainly be convenient to reach the conclusion that a young girl out running was victimised by a killer she didnt know unfortunately i tend to think thats not the case then you believe it was someone who knew her a member of one of the colleges cuff offered lynley a cigarette from a rosewood case on the table when lynley demurred he lit one himself looked away for a moment and said that seems more likely have you any ideas cuff blinked none at all lynley noted the determined tone behind the words and led cuff back to their original topic you mentioned that elena had potential a telling statement isnt it it does tend to suggest failure rather than success what can you tell me about her she was in part ib of the english tripos i believe her coursework concentrated on the history of literature this year but the senior tutor would be able to tell you exactly if you need to know hes been involved with elenas adjustment here in cambridge from her fi rst term last year lynley raised an eyebrow he knew the purpose of the senior tutor it was far more personal than academic so the fact that he had been involved with elena weaver suggested adjustment problems that went beyond a confused undergraduates learning to cope with the mysteries of the universitys system of education there were troubles cuff took a moment to tap the ash from his cigarette into a porcelain ashtray before saying more so than most she was an intelligent girl and a highly skilled writer but quite soon into michaelmas term last year she began missing supervisions which sent the first red fl ag up and the other red fl ags she stopped attending lectures she went to at least three supervisions drunk she was out all nightthe senior tutor could tell you how many times if you feel its important without signing out with the porter i take it that you wouldnt have considered sending her down because of her father is he the reason why she was admitted to st stephens in the fi rst place only partially hes a distinguished academic and wed naturally give his daughter serious consideration but beyond that as i said she was a clever girl her alevels were good her entrance papers were solid her interview wasall things consideredmore than adequate and she certainly had good reason to find the life at cambridge overwhelming at fi rst so when the fl ags came up the senior tutor her supervisors and i met to develop a plan of action it was simple enough other than attending to her studies putting in appearances at lectures and turning in signed chits that indicated shed been to her supervisions we insisted she have more contact with her father so that he could monitor her progress as well she began spending her weekends with him he looked faintly embarrassed as he continued her father suggested that it might be additionally helpful if we allowed her to keep a pet in her room a mouse actually in the hope it would develop her sense of responsibility and no doubt get her back to the college at night apparently she had quite a fondness for animals and we brought in a young man from queensa chap called gareth randolphto act as an undergraduate guardian and more importantly to get elena involved in an appropriate society her father didnt approve of that last item im afraid hed been dead set against it from the very fi rst because of the boy because of the society itself deastu gareth randolphs its president and hes one of the more highprofile handicapped students in the university lynley frowned it sounds as if anthony weaver was concerned that his daughter might become romantically linked with a handicapped boy here was potential for trouble indeed ive no doubt of that cuff said but as far as i was concerned becoming involved with gareth randolph would have been the best thing for her why for the obvious reason elena was handicapped as well when lynley said nothing cuff looked perplexed surely you know you would have been told told no terence cuff leaned forward im terribly sorry i thought youd been given the information elena weaver was deaf deastu terence cuff explained was the informal name given to the cambridge university deaf students union a group that met weekly in a small vacant conference room in the basement of peterhouse library at the bottom of little st marys lane on the surface they were a support group for the not insignificant number of deaf students who attended the university beyond that they were committed to the idea of deafness being a culture in itself rather than a handicap theyre a group with a great deal of pride cuff explained theyve been instrumental in promoting tremendous selfesteem among the deaf students no shame in signing rather than speaking no dishonour in being unable to read lips yet you say that anthony weaver wanted his daughter to stay away from them if she herself was deaf that hardly makes sense cuff got up from his chair and went to the fireplace where he lit the coals that formed a small mound in a metal basket the room was growing cold and while the action was reasonable it also bore the appearance of temporising once the fire was lit cuff remained standing near it he sank his hands into his trouser pockets and studied the tops of his shoes elena read lips cuff explained she spoke fairly well her parentsher mother especiallyhad devoted themselves to enabling her to function as a normal woman in a normal world they wanted her to appear for all intents and purposes as a woman who could hear to them deastu represented a step backwards but elena signed didnt she yes but shed only begun that as a teenager when her secondary school called in social services after failing to convince her mother of the need to enroll elena in a special programme to learn the language even then she wasnt allowed to sign at home and as far as i know neither of her parents ever signed with her byzantine lynley mused to our way of thinking but they wanted the girl to have a good chance to make her way in the hearing world we might disagree with the way they went about it but the fi nal result was that she ended up with lipreading speech and ultimately signing in effect she had it all those are the things she could do lynley agreed but i wonder where she felt she belonged the mound of coals shifted slightly as the fire took them cuff rearranged them deftly with a poker no doubt you can see why we were willing to make allowances for elena she was caught between two worlds and as you yourself have pointed out she wasnt brought up to fit completely into either its such an odd decision for an educated person to make whats weaver like a brilliant historian a fine mind a man of deep committed professional integrity lynley didnt miss the oblique nature of the answer i understand hes in line for some sort of advancement as well the penford chair yes hes been shortlisted for it what is it exactly the universitys main chair in the area of history an offer of prestige more an offer to do exactly what he wants for the rest of his career lecture when and if he wants write when and if he wants take on graduate students when and if he wants complete academic freedom along with national recognition the highest possible honours and the esteem of his fellows if hes selected it shall be the finest moment of his career and would his daughters spotty record here at the university have impeded his chances of being selected cuff shrugged off both question and implication saying i havent been a member of the search committee inspector theyve been reviewing potential candidates since last december i cant tell you exactly what theyre looking into but might weaver have thought the committee would judge him in an ill light because of her problems cuff replaced the poker and ran his thumb over its dull brass head ive always felt its wise to stay clear of the interior lives and beliefs of the senior fellows he replied im afraid i cant be of any help to you in this direction of enquiry only after he finished speaking did cuff look up from the handle of the poker and once again in their interview lynley clearly read the other mans reluctance to part with information youll be wanting to see where weve put you no doubt cuff said politely let me ring the porter it was shortly after seven when lynley rang the bell at anthony weavers home off adams road with an expensivelooking metallic blue citroën parked in its drive the house was not a great distance from st stephens college so he had walked crossing the river on the modern concrete and iron crescent of garret hostel bridge and passing beneath the horse chestnut trees that littered burrells walk with enormous yellow leaves sodden with the fog the occasional bicycle rider passed him muffled against the cold in knit hat scarf and gloves but otherwise the path that connected queens road with grange road was largely deserted lampposts provided sporadicillumination holly fi r and box hedgerowsbroken up by intermittent fencing that ran the gamut from wood to brick to ironserved as boundaries for the walk beyond them stood the russet mass of the university library into which shadowy fi gures scurried for last minutes of work prior to its closing the houses in adams road were all set behind hedges trees surrounded them leafless silver birches that stood like pencil sketches against the fog poplars whose bark displayed every variation of the colour grey alders not yet offering their leaves to the coming winter it was quiet here only the gurgle of water pouring into an outdoor drain broke into the stillness the night air was tinged with the friendly fragrance of woodsmoke but at the weaver house the only scent outdoors came from the dampening wool of lynleys own overcoat it was largely no different inside the door was opened by a tall blonde woman with a face of chiselled refi ned composure she looked far too young to be elenas mother and she didnt appear particularly struck by grief lynley thought as he looked at her that hed never seen anyone with such perfect posture every limb bone and muscle seemed locked into position as if an unseen hand had arranged her stance at the door just moments before he knocked upon it yes she said it as a statement not a question no part of her face moved other than her lips he produced his warrant card introduced himself and asked to see the dead girls parents at this the woman stepped back from the door she said only ill fetch anthony and left him standing on the bronze and peach oriental carpet of a parquetfl oored entrance hall to his left a door opened into a sitting room to his right a glassenclosed morning room held a wicker table that was set with linen and china for breakfast lynley took off his overcoat laid it over the polished handrail of the stairway and went into the sitting room he paused feeling unaccountably put off by what he saw like the hall the sitting room was floored in parquet and like the hall the parquet was covered with an oriental carpet on it sat grey leather furniturea sofa two chairs and a chaise longueand tables with pedestals of peachveined marble and tops of glass the watercolours on the walls had obviously been chosen mounted and framed to match the rooms colour scheme and they hung precisely centred over the sofa the first a bowl of apricots on a windowsill behind which shone a sky of robins egg blue and the second a slim grey vase of salmoncoloured oriental poppies with three blooms fallen to the ivory surface upon which the vase stood both of them were signed with the single word weaver either husband wife or daughter had an interest in art a slender glass tea table against one wall held an arrangement of silk tulips next to this was a single copy of elle and a photograph in a silver frame other than these last two objects and the watercolours there was nothing in the room to indicate that anyone actually lived in it lynley wondered what the rest of the house was like and walked to the tea table to look at the photograph it was a wedding portrait perhaps ten years old judging from the length of weavers hair and the bride looking solemn and celestial and surprisingly youngwas the woman who had just answered the door inspector lynley turned from his perusal of the picture as the dead girls father came into the room he walked quite slowly elenas mother is asleep upstairs shall i wake her for you shes taken a pill darling weavers wife had come to the doorway where she hesitated one hand touching the silver lily pinned to the lapel of her jacket ive no need to see her at the moment if shes asleep lynley said the shock weaver said and added unnecessarily shes just come up from london this afternoon shall i make coffee weavers wife asked shed ventured no further into the room nothing for me lynley said nor for me thank you justine darling weaver smiled at her brieflythe effort it cost him rode directly on the surface of the behaviour itselfand he held out a hand to indicate that she was to join them she entered the sitting room weaver went to the fi replace where he lit a gas fire beneath an artful arrangement of artificial coals please sit down inspector as weaver himself chose one of the two leather chairs and his wife took the other lynley observed the man who had lost his daughter that day and saw in him the subtleties that illustrate the manner in which men are permitted to face before strangers the worst of their grief behind his thick wirerimmed spectacles his brown eyes were bloodshot with crescents of red lining their lower lids his handsrather small for a man of his heighttrembled when he gestured and his lips which were partially obscured by a dark clipped moustache quivered as he waited for lynley to speak he was lynley thought so different from his wife dark his body thickening at the waist with advancing middle age his hair beginning to show strands of scattered grey his skin creasing on the forehead and webbing beneath the eyes he wore a threepiece suit and a pair of gold cufflinks but despite his rather formal attire he managed to seem completely out of place in the cool crafted elegance that surrounded him what can we tell you inspector weavers voice was as unsteady as his hands tell me what we can do to help i need to know that i need to find this monster he strangled her he beat her have they told you that her face wasshe was wearing her gold chain with the little unicorn id given her last christmas so i knew it was elena the moment i saw her and even if she hadnt been wearing the unicorn her mouth was partly open and i saw her front tooth i saw that much i saw that tooth the little chip in it that tooth justine weaver lowered her eyes and clasped her hands in her lap weaver pulled his spectacles from his face god help me i cant believe that shes dead despite his presence in their home as a professional come to deal with the crime lynley was not untouched by the other mans anguish how many times had he witnessed this very scene played out in the last thirteen years and still he felt no more able to assuage grief than he had as a detective constable facing his first interview with the hysterical adult daughter of a woman whod been bludgeoned to death by her own drunk husband in every case hed allowed grief free rein hoping by this means to offer victims the meagre solace of knowing that someone shared their need to see justice done weaver continued to speak as he did so his eyes filled with tears she was tender fragile because she was deaf no because of me when weavers voice cracked his wife looked his way pressed her lips together and once more lowered her eyes i left her mother when elena was fi ve inspector youre going to learn that eventually so you may as well know it right now she was in bed asleep i packed my bags and i left and i never went back and i had no way to explain to a fiveyearold childwho couldnt even hear methat i wasnt leaving her that it wasnt her fault that the marriage itself was so filled with unhappiness that i couldnt bear to live in it any longer and glyn and i were at fault for that not elena never once elena but i was her father i left her betrayed her and she struggled with thatand with the idea that somehow she was at faultfor the next fifteen years anger confusion lack of confidence fear those were her demons lynley didnt even need to formulate a question to guide weavers discourse it was as if the man had only been waiting for an appropriate opportunity for selffl agellation she could have chosen oxfordglyn was determined shed go to oxford she didnt want her here with mebut elena chose cambridge instead can you know what that meant to me all those years shed been in london with her mother id tried to be there for her as best i could but she held me at a distance shed only let me be a father in the most superfi cial ways here was my chance to be a real father to her again to mend our relationship to bring to some sort ofhe searched for a wordsome sort of fulfi llment the love i felt for her and my greatest happiness was feeling the bond begin to grow between us over this last year and sitting here and watching while justine helped elena with her essays when these two women he faltered these two women in my lifethese two women together justine and elena my wife and my daughter and finally he allowed himself to weep it was a mans horrible humiliated sobbing one hand covering his eyes the other clutching his spectacles justine weaver didnt stir in her chair she looked incapable of movement carved out of stone then a single breath eased from her and she raised her eyes and fastened them on the bright artifi cial fi re i understand elena had difficulties in the university at first lynley said as much to justine as to her husband yes justine said the adjustment for herfrom her mother and londonto here she glanced uneasily at her husband it took a bit of time for her to how could she have made the change easily weaver demanded she was struggling with her life she was doing her best she was trying to be whole he wiped his face with a crumpled handkerchief which afterwards he continued to graspcrushedin his hand he placed his spectacles back on his nose but that didnt matter not a bit of it to me because she was a joy an innocent a gift her troubles didnt cause you embarrassment then professional embarrassment weaver stared at him his expression altered in a single instant from ravaged sorrow to disbelief lynley found the sudden change disquieting and despite the occasion for both grief and outrage he found himself wondering if he was being entertained by a performance of some sort my god weaver said what are you suggesting i understand youve been shortlisted for a rather prestigious position here at the university lynley said and what does that have to do with lynley leaned forward to interrupt my job is to obtain and evaluate information dr weaver in order to do that i have to ask questions you might otherwise prefer not to hear weaver worked this over his fi ngers digging into the handkerchief balled into his fist nothing about my daughter was an embarrassment inspector nothing not a single part of her and nothing she did lynley tallied the denials he refl ected upon the rigid muscles in weavers face he said had she enemies no and no one who knew her could have hurt elena anthony justine murmured hesitantly you dont think she and garethmight they have had a falling out gareth randolph lynley said the president of deastu when justine nodded he went on with dr cuff told me hed been asked to act as a guardian to elena last year what can you tell me about him if he was the one ill kill him weaver said justine took up the question hes an engineering student a member of queens college weaver said more to himself than to lynley and the engineering lab is next to fen causeway he has his practicals there his supervisions as well what is it a twominute walk from crusoes island across coe fen a oneminute run was he fond of elena they saw a great deal of each other justine said but that was one of the stipulations set up by dr cuff and her supervisors last year attendance at deastu gareth saw to it that she went to the meetings he took her to a number of their social functions as well she shot her husband a wary look before she finished carefully with elena liked gareth well enough i dare say but not i imagine the way he liked her and hes a lovely boy really i cant think that he hes in the boxing society weaver continued hes got a blue in boxing elena told me that could he have known that she would be running this morning thats just it weaver said she wasnt supposed to run he turned to his wife you told me she wasnt going to run you said that shed phoned you his words had the ring of an accusation justines body retreated fractionally a reaction that was almost imperceptible considering her upright posture in the chair anthony she said his name like a discreet entreaty she phoned you lynley repeated perplexed how on a ceephone justine said some sort of visual phone anthony weaver stirred moved his eyes off his wife and pushed himself out of his chair ive one in the study ill show you he led the way through the dining room through a spotless kitchen fitted with an array of gleaming appliances and down a short corridor that led to the rear of the house his study was a small room that faced the back garden and when he switched on the light a dog began to whine beneath the window outside have you fed him weaver asked he wants to be let in i cant face it no dont do that justine hes just a dog he doesnt understand hes never had to dont do it justine fell silent as before she remained by the door while lynley and her husband went into the room the study was quite different from the rest of the house a worn fl oral carpet covered the floor books crowded onto sagging shelves of cheap pine a collection of photographs leaned against a filing cabinet and a set of framed sketches hung on the wall beneath the rooms single window stood weavers desk large grey metal and utterly hideous aside from a pile of correspondence and a set of reference books on it rested a computer its monitor a telephone and a modem this then constituted the ceephone how does it work lynley asked weaver blew his nose and shoved his handkerchief into his jacket pocket he said ill phone my rooms in the college and walked to the desk where he switched on the monitor punched several numbers on the telephone and pressed a data key on the modem after a few moments the monitor screen divided into two sections split horizontally by a thin solid band on the bottom half appeared the words jenn here a colleague lynley asked adam jenn my graduate student weaver typed quickly as he did so his message to the student was printed on the top half of the screen dr weaver phoning adam im demonstrating the ceephone for the police elena used it last night right appeared on the bottom half of the screen shall i stand by then do they want to see something special weaver cast lynley a querying look no thats fine lynley said its clear how it works not necessary weaver typed ok the response and then after a moment ill be here the rest of the evening dr weaver tomorrow as well and as long as you need me please dont worry about anything weaver swallowed nice lad he whispered he switched off the monitor all of them watched as the messages on the screen slowly faded away what sort of message did elena send you last night lynley asked justine she was still at the door one shoulder against the jamb she looked at the monitor as if to remember she said only that she wasnt going to run this morning she sometimes had trouble with one of her knees i assumed she wanted to give it a rest for a day or two what time did she phone justine frowned pensively it must have been a bit after eight because she asked after her father and he wasnt yet home from the college i told her hed gone back to work for a while and she said shed phone him there did she weaver shook his head his lower lip quivered and he pressed his left index finger to it as if by that action he could control further displays of emotion you were alone when she phoned justine nodded and youre certain it was elena justines fine skin seemed to tauten across her cheeks of course who else who knew the two of you ran in the morning her eyes went to her husband then back to lynley anthony knew i suppose i must have told one or two of my colleagues at the university press others again she looked at her husband anthony do you know of anyone weaver was still staring at the monitor of the ceephone as if in the hope that a call would come through adam jenn probably im sure i told him her friends i should think people on her staircase with access to her room to her phone gareth justine said of course she would have told gareth and he has a ceephone as well weaver looked sharply at lynley elena didnt make that call did she someone else did lynley could feel the other mans growing need for action whether it was spurious or genuine he could not tell its a possibility he agreed but its also a possibility that elena simply preferred to create an excuse to run alone this morning would that have been out of character she ran with her stepmother always justine said nothing lynley looked her way she averted her eyes it was admission enough weaver said to his wife you didnt see her at all when you were out this morning why justine werent you looking werent you watching i had the call from her darling justine said patiently i wasnt expecting to see her and even if i had been i didnt go along the river you ran this morning as well lynley asked what time was this our usual time a quarter past six but i took a different route you werent near fen causeway a moments hesitation i was yes but at the end of the run instead of the beginning id made a circuit of the city and came across the causeway from east to west towards newnham road with a glance at her husband she made a slight change of position as if she were girding herself with strength frankly i hate running along the river inspector i always have so when i had the opportunity to take another route i did just that it was lynley thought the nearest thing to a revelation that justine weaver was likely to make in front of her husband about the nature of her relationship with his daughter elena justine let the dog into the house directly after the inspector left anthony had gone upstairs he wouldnt know what she was doing since he wouldnt come back down for the rest of the night what could it hurt justine wondered to let the dog sleep in his own wicker basket she would get up early in the morning to let the animal out before anthony even saw him it was disloyal to go against her husband this way justine knew her mother would never have done such a thing once her father had made his wishes known but there was the dog to consider a confused lonely creature whose instincts told him something was wrong but who couldnt know what or understand why when justine opened the back door the setter came at once not bounding across the lawn as was usual but hesitantly as if he knew that his welcome was at risk at the door with his auburn head lowered the dog raised hopeful eyes to justine his tail wagged twice his ears perked up then drooped its all right justine whispered come in there was something comforting about the snicksnicking of the dogs nails on the fl oor as he pursued the smells on the kitchen tiles there was something comforting about all his sounds the yelp and the growl when he played the snarf when he dug and got soil in his nose the long sigh when he settled into his bed at night the low hum when he most wanted someones attention he was in so many ways just like a person a fact that justine had found most surprising i think a dog would be good for elena anthony had said prior to her arrival in cambridge last year victor troughtons bitch had a litter not long ago ill take elena by and let her have her pick of the lot justine hadnt protested part of her had wanted to indeed the protest was practically automatic since the doga potential source of mess and troublewould be living in adams road not in st stephens college with elena but another part of her had sparked alive to the idea other than a blue parakeet who had been mindlessly devoted to justines mother and a wonatafête goldfish that on its first night in her possession had suicidally flung itself out of its overfilled bowl to become stuck on a wallpaper daffodil behind the sideboard when she was eight years old justine had never owned what she thought of as a real peta dog to tag along scruffily at her heels or a cat to curl at the foot of her bed or a horse to ride in the back lanes of cambridgeshire these werent deemed healthy by either of her parents animals carried germs germs were not appropriate and propriety was everything once theyd come into her greatuncles fortune anthony weaver had been her break with all that her permanent declaration of impropriety and adulthood she could still see her mothers mouth trembling round the words but what on earth can you possibly be thinking justine heswell hes jewish she could still manage to feel that searing quite physical stab of satisfaction right between her breasts at the palecheeked consternation with which her mother greeted the news of her impending marriage her fathers reaction had been less of a pleasure hes changed his surname hes a cambridge don hes got a solid future that hes been married before is a bit of a problem and id be happier if he werent so much older than you but all things considered hes not a bad catch he crossed his legs at the ankles and reached for his pipe and the copy of punch which hed long ago decided was appropriate gentlemans sunday afternoon reading im damned glad about that surname however anthony hadnt been the one to change it his grandfather had done so altering just two letters the original in became av and there he was born anew not a weiner from germany but a weaver an englishman weaver of course was not exactly an upperclass name but anthonys grandfather couldnt have known or understood that at the time any more than he could have understood the delicate sensibilities of the class to which he aspired sensibilities that would prevent him from ever breaking through the barrier constructed by his accent and his choice of profession the upper crust after all did not generally rub social elbows with their tailors no matter the proximity of their tailors shops to savile row anthony had told her all this not long after theyd met at the university press where as an assistant editor newly graduated from durham university shed been assigned the task of shepherding a book on the reign of edward iii through the final stages of the publication process anthony weaver had been the editorial force behind the volume a collection of essays written by lofty medievalists from round the country in the final two months of the project they had worked closely together sometimes in her small offi ce at the press more often in his rooms in st stephens college and when they werent working anthony had talked his conversation drifting round his background his daughter his former marriage his work and his life shed never known a man so capable of sharing himself in words from a world in which communication constituted a single lift of the eyebrows or a twitch of the lips shed fallen in love with his willingness to speak with his quick warm smile with the way he engaged her directly with his eyes she wanted nothing more than to listen to anthony and for the last nine years shed managed just that until the circumscribed world of cambridge university had no longer been enough for him justine watched as the irish setter rooted in his toy box and brought out a worn black sock for a game of tugofwar on the kitchen tiles not tonight she murmured in your basket stay here she patted the dogs head felt the soft caress of a warm loving tongue on her fingers and left the kitchen she paused in the dining room to remove a loose thread that dangled from the tablecloth and once again in the sitting room to turn off the gas fi re and watch the flames quick sucking disappearance between the coals then nothing more to keep her from doing so she went upstairs in the halfdarkened bedroom anthony was lying on the bed hed removed his shoes and his jacket and justine went automatically to place the former in their rack the latter on its hanger that done she turned to face her husband the light from the corridor glittered on the snailtrack of tears that forked across his temple and disappeared into his hair his eyes were closed she wanted to feel pity or sorrow or compassion she wanted to feel anything save a recurrence of the anxiety that had fi rst gripped her when hed driven away from the house that afternoon abandoning her to deal with glyn she walked to the bed gleaming danish teak it was a modern platform with side tables attached on each of these mushroomshaped brass lamps squatted and justine switched on the one by her husbands head he brought his right arm up to cover his eyes his left hand reached out seeking hers i need you he whispered be with me stay here she didnt feel her heart open as it would have a year ago nor did she feel her body stir and awaken to the implicit promise behind his words she wished she could have used the moment as other women in her position would have done by opening the little drawer in his side table taking up the box of condoms and saying throw these away if you need me so much but she didnt do that whatever selfassurance powered that kind of behaviour shed used up her stock of it long ago what she had left was what remained once all the positives were gone for an age it seemed she had been filled with outrage distrust and a need for vengeance that nothing had yet been able to satiate anthony turned on his side he pulled her down to sit on the bed and laid his head in her lap his arms round her waist in a rote reaction she stroked his hair its a dream he said shell be here this weekend and the three of us will be together again well take a drive to blakeney or practise shooting for the pheasant hunt or just sit and talk but well be a family together justine watched the tears slide across his cheek and drop onto the fine grey wool of her skirt i want her back he whispered elena elena she said the only thing which she knew to be the single absolute truth at this point im sorry hold me please his hands slid beneath her jacket and tightened against her back after a moment she heard him breathe her name he held her closer and eased her blouse from the waistband of her skirt his hands were warm on her back they smoothed the way to unfasten her bra hold me he said again he pushed the jacket from her shoulders and lifted his mouth to nuzzle her breasts through the thin silk of her blouse she felt first his breath then his tongue then his teeth on her nipple she felt her nipple harden just hold me he whispered just hold me please she knew that making love was one of the most normal lifeaffirming reactions to a grievous loss the only thing she couldnt keep herself from wondering was whether her husband had already engaged in a lifeaffi rming reaction to his grievous loss today as if he sensed her resistance he backed away from her his spectacles were on the bedside table and he put them on im sorry he said i dont even know what im doing any longer she stood where did you go you didnt seem to want im not talking about right now im talking about this afternoon where did you go for a drive where nowhere i dont believe you he looked away from her to the teak chest of drawers with its sleek cool lines its starting again you went to see her you went to make love or did you just communicatehow was it between yousoul to soul he returned his gaze to her his head shook slowly you choose your moments dont you thats avoidance anthony thats a play for guilt but its not going to work not even tonight where were you what do i have to do to convince you its over you wanted it that way you named your terms you got them all of them its over is it she played her trump card smoothly then where were you last night i phoned your rooms in the college right after i spoke to elena where were you anthony you lied to the inspector but surely you can tell your wife the truth lower your voice i dont want you to wake glyn i dont care if i wake the dead she recoiled from her words as immediately as he did they served to throw water onto the fire of her anger as did her husbands broken response if only you could justine in the london suburb of greenford detective sergeant barbara havers slowly drove her rusting mini down oldfi eld lane in the passengers seat her mother huddled like an unstrung marionette within the many folds of a dusty black coat round her neck barbara had tied a jaunty red and blue scarf before theyd left acton but sometime during the drive mrs havers had worked the big square knot loose and now she was using the scarf as a muff twirling it tighter and tighter round her hands even in the lights from the dashboard barbara could see that behind her spectacles her mothers eyes were large and frightened she hadnt been this far from her home in years theres the chinese takeaway barbara pointed out and see mum theres the hair dressers and the chemists i wish it was daylight so we could go to the common and have a sit on one of the benches there but well do it soon enough next weekend i should guess in response her mother hummed halfshrunk into the door she made an unconsciously inspired choice of music barbara couldnt have named the origin of the song but she could put the first seven words to the tune think of me think of me fondly something shed heard on the radio enough times over the past few years something which her mother had doubtless heard as well and had called upon in this moment of uncertainty to give definition to what she was feeling behind the muddled facade of her dementia i am thinking of you barbara wanted to say this is for the best its the only option left instead she said with a desperately forced heartiness just look how wide the pavement is here mum you dont see that sort of pavement in acton do you she didnt expect an answer and didnt get one she turned the car onto uneeda drive see the trees along the street mum theyre bare now but in the summer think how pretty theyll be they wouldnt of course create that sort of leafy tunnel one often saw along the streets of the fi ner neighbourhoods in london they were planted too far apart for that but they managed to break the bleak monotony created by the line of stuccoandbrick semidetached houses and for this reason alone barbara noted them with gratitude as she did the front gardens pointing them out to her mother as they slowly cruised by pretending to see details that the darkness obscured she chatted amiably about a family of trolls some plaster ducks a birdbath and a fl owerbed of winter pansies and phlox it didnt matter that she hadnt seen any of this her mother wouldnt recall that in the morning she wouldnt even recall it in a quarter of an hour indeed barbara knew that her mother didnt remember the conversation theyd had about hawthorn lodge soon after her arrival home this afternoon she had telephoned mrs flo had made the arrangements for her mother to become one of the lodge visitors and had gone home to pack her mothers belongings now mummy wont need everything with her at first mrs flo had said kindly just bring a suitcase with a bit of this and that and well move her in gradual call it a little visit if you think shell take to that after years of listening to her mother plan holidays which they would never take barbara wasnt oblivious of the irony of packing the suitcase and talking about a visit to greenford it was a far cry from the exotic destinations that had occupied her mothers disjointed thinking for so long but the very fact that she had given herself so much to the idea of taking a holiday had made the sight of the suitcase less frightening than it otherwise might have been her mother had noticed however that barbara wasnt packing any of her own things into the large vinyl case shed even gone to barbaras room and rustled through her clothes bringing back an armload of trousers and pullovers that comprised the staple of barbaras wardrobe youll be wanting these lovey shed said especially if its switzerland is it switzerland ive wanted to go there for such a long time fresh air barbie think of the air shed explained to her mother that it wasnt to be switzerland adding the fact that she herself could not go shed ended with the lie but its only a visit only for a few days ill be with you at the weekend and with the hope that somehow her mother would hold on to those thoughts long enough to get her installed in hawthorn lodge without trouble but now barbara saw that confusion had vanquished the moment of rare lucidity during which shed listed the advantages of a stay with mrs flo and the disadvantages of any further reliance upon mrs gustafson her mother was chewing at her upper lip as her bewilderment increased as if from the primary chink in a sheet of glass from which a starburst of breakage grows dozens of tiny lines radiated from her mouth and formed a fretwork up her cheeks to her eyes her hands twisted in the muff of the scarf the tempo of her humming accelerated think of me think of me fondly mum barbara said as she pulled to the kerb at the nearest spot she could find to hawthorn lodge there was no response other than the humming barbara felt her spirits plummet for a time this afternoon she had thought this transition was going to be easy her mother had even seemed to greet the idea with anticipation and excitement as long as it was labelled a holiday now barbara saw that it promised to be as wrenching an experience as she had previously expected she thought about praying for the strength to carry her plans through to their completion but she didnt particularly believe in god and the thought of calling upon him at convenient moments to suit her own needs seemed as useless as it was hypocritical so she garnered what little resolution she had pushed open her door and walked round to help her mother from the car here we go mum she said with a cheerful bravado that she summoned from a repertoire of inadequate coping skills lets meet mrs flo shall we in one hand she grasped her mothers suitcase in the other she held her mothers arm she eased her down the pavement towards the grey stucco promise of permanent salvation listen mum she said as she rang the front bell from inside the house deborah kerr was singing getting to know you perhaps in preparation for the new visitor theyve got music on hear it smells of cabbage her mother said barbie i dont think a cabbagehouse is suitable for a holiday cabbage is common this wont do at all its coming from next door mum i can smell cabbage barbie i wouldnt book us a room in a cabbagehotel barbara heard the growing querulous anxiety in her mothers voice she prayed for mrs flo to come to the door and rang the bell again we dont serve cabbage in our home barbie never to guests its all right mummy barbie i dont think mercifully the porchlight snapped on mrs havers blinked in surprise and shrank back against barbara mrs flo still wore her neat shirtwaister with the pansy pin at her throat she looked as fresh as she had that morning youve arrived splendid she stepped out into the night and took mrs havers arm come and meet the dears love weve been talking about you and were dressed and ready and excited to meet you barbie her mothers voice was a plea its all right mum im right behind you the dears were in the sitting room where a videotape of the king and i was playing deborah kerr sang melodiously to a group of preciouslooking oriental children the dearson the couchswayed in time to the music here we are my dears mrs flo announced her arm going round mrs havers shoulders heres our new visitor and were all ready to get to know her arent we oh i wish mrs tilbird were here to share the pleasure dont you introductions were made to mrs salkild and mrs pendlebury who remained shoulder to shoulder on the couch mrs havers hung back casting a panicked glance in barbaras direction barbara smiled at her reassuringly the suitcase she carried seemed to pull upon her arm shall we take off your nice coat and scarf dear mrs flo reached for the top button of the coat barbie mrs havers shrilled now its all right isnt it mrs flo said theres not a thing to worry about were all so anxious to have you join us for a bit i smell cabbage barbara placed the suitcase on the fl oor and came to mrs flos rescue her mother was clutching onto the top button of her coat as if it were the hope diamond spittle gathered at the corners of her mouth mum its the holiday youve wanted barbara said lets go upstairs so you can see your room she took her mothers arm its usually a bit difficult for them at fi rst mrs flo said perhaps noting barbaras own incipient panic they get riled a bit at the change its perfectly normal youre not to worry about it together they guided her mother from the room as all the oriental children chimed daybyday in unison the stairway was too narrow to allow them to climb it three abreast so mrs flo led the way continuing to chat in a lighthearted manner underneath her words barbara heard the calm determination in her voice and she marvelled at the womans patient willingness to spend her life caring for the elderly and infi rm she herself only wanted to get out of the house as quickly as possible and she despised that feeling of emotional claustrophobia guiding her mother up the stairway did nothing to ameliorate barbaras need for escape mrs havers body had gone rigid each step was a project and although barbara murmured encouraged and kept a supportive hand fixed round her mothers arm it was like leading an innocent animal to its death in a slaughterhouse in those last horrible moments when it first catches on the air the unmistakable scent of blood the cabbage mrs havers whimpered barbara tried to steel herself against the words she knew there was no smell of cabbage in the house she understood that her mothers mind was clinging to the last rational thought it had produced but when her mothers head lolled back against barbaras shoulder and she saw the milky pattern tears made through the face powder which she had donned impulsively in girlish preparation for her longcoveted holiday barbara felt the crushing grip of guilt she doesnt understand barbara thought shell never understand she said mrs flo i dont think at the top of the stairs mrs flo turned and held up a hand palm out to stop her words give it a moment dear this isnt easy for anyone is it she crossed the landing and opened one of the doors at the rear of the house where a light was already burning to welcome the new dear the room had been furnished with a hospital bed otherwise it was as normallooking as any other bedroom barbara had ever seen and admittedly far more cheerful than her mothers room in acton look at the lovely wallpaper mummy she said all those daisies you like daisies dont you and the rug look therere daisies on the rug as well and youve got your own basin and a rocker by the window did i tell you that you can see the common from this window mum youll be able to watch the children playing ball please she thought please just give me a sign clinging to her arm mrs havers mewled give me her case dear mrs flo said if we pop things away quickly shell settle all the sooner the less disruption the better for mum youve brought photos and little mementoes for her havent you yes theyre on the top lets have them out first shall we just the photos for now i think a quick bit of home there were only two photos together in a hinged frame one of barbaras brother and the other of her father as mrs flo fl ipped open the suitcase took the frame out and opened it upon the chest of drawers barbara realised suddenly that shed been in such a hurry to clear her mother out of her life that she hadnt thought to include a picture of herself she grew hot with the shame of it now doesnt that look nice mrs flo said stepping back from the chest of drawers and cocking her head to one side to admire the photographs what a sweet little boy is he my brother hes dead mrs flo clucked sympathetically shall we have her coat off now he was ten barbara thought there was no member of the family at his bedside not even a nurse to hold his hand and make his passing gentle he died alone mrs flo said lets just slip this off dearie next to her barbara felt her mother cringe barbie a note of unquestionable defeat sounded in the two syllables of her name barbara had often wondered what it had been like for her brother whether hed slipped away easily without rising from his final coma whether hed opened his eyes at the last to fi nd himself abandoned by everyone and everything save the machines and tubes and bottles and gadgets that had been industriously prolonging his life yes thats a good girl a button now another well get you settled and have a nice cup of tea i expect youd like that a slice of cake as well cabbage mrs havers drew the word out it was nearly indistinguishable like a faint cry distorted from a great distance barbara made the decision her albums she said mrs flo ive forgotten my mothers albums mrs flo looked up from the scarf which shed managed to untangle from mrs havers hands you can bring them later dear she wont want everything all at once no these are important shes got to have her albums shes collected barbara stopped for a moment knowing in her mind that what she was doing was foolish feeling in her heart that there was no other answer shes planned holidays shes got them done up in albums she works on them every day shell be lost and mrs flo touched her arm my dear do listen what youre feeling is natural but this is for the best you must see that no its bad enough isnt it that i forgot a picture of myself i cant leave her here without those albums im sorry ive taken up your time ive made a mess of everything ive just she wouldnt cry she thought not with her mother needing her and mrs gustafson to be spoken to and arrangements to be made she went to the chest of drawers snapped closed the framed photographs and returned them to the suitcase which she swung off the bed she took a tissue from her pocket using it to wipe her mothers cheeks and her nose okay mum she said lets go home the choir was singing the kyrie as lynley crossed chapel court and approached the chapel itself which fronted by an arcade comprised most of the courts west range although it clearly had been built to be admired from middle court which stood to its east eighteenthcentury calls for college expansion had enclosed the seventeenthcentury chapel into a quadrangle of buildings of which it was the focal point even through the mist and the darkness it could hardly have been otherwise ground lights glowed against the weldon stone ashlar exterior of the building which if it hadnt been designed by wrenwas surely a monument to his love of classical ornamentation the facade of the chapel rose from the middle of the arcade defined by four corinthian pilasters which supported a pediment both broken and penetrated by a clock and a lantern cupola decorative swags looped from the pilasters an oeildeboeuf glittered on each side of the clock at the centre of the building hung an oval entablature and all of it represented the concrete reality of wrens classical ideal balance where at its north and south ends the chapel did not fill in the entirety of the west range of the court the arcade framed the river and the backs beyond it the effect was lovely at night with the river mist rising to swirl round the low wall and lap at the columns in sunlight it would have been magnifi cent like a coincidental accent to this thought a trumpet fanfare played the notes were pure and sweet on the cold night air as lynley pulled open the chapel door at the southeast corner of the buildingunsurprised to fi nd that the middle entry was merely an architectural device unintended for usethe choir answered the fanfare with another kyrie he entered the chapel as a second fanfare began to the height of the arched windows which rose to a plaster dogtooth cornice the walls were panelled in golden oak beneath which matching pews faced the solitary central aisle lined up in these were the members of the college choir their attention fixed on a solitary trumpeter who stood at the foot of the altar completing the fanfare she was quite dwarfed by the gilded baroque reredos framing a painting of jesus calling lazarus from the dead she lowered her instrument saw lynley and grinned at him as the choir burst into the fi nal kyrie a few crashing bars from the organ followed the choir master jotted notes in his music altos rubbish he said sopranos screechowls tenors howling dogs the rest of you a pass the same time tomorrow evening please general moaning greeted his evaluation of their work the choir master ignored this shoved his pencil into his thatch of black hair and said the trumpet was excellent however thank you miranda that will be all ladies and gentlemen as the group disbanded lynley walked down the aisle to join miranda webberly who was cleaning her trumpet and repacking it into its case youve gone off jazz randie he said her head popped up her top knot of curly ginger hair bounced and bobbled i never she answered she was dressed in her usual style lynley noted a baggy sweat suit which she hoped would both elongate and camouflage her short plump body at the same time as its coloura deep heliotrope bluewould darken the shade of her own pale eyes still in the jazz society then absolutely we have a gig on wednesday night at trinity hall will you come wouldnt miss it she grinned good she snapped the trumpet case closed and set it on the edge of a pew dad phoned he said i ought to expect one of his men to come crawling round this evening whyre you alone sergeant havers is handling some personal business shell be along later tomorrow morning i should guess hmmm well dyou want a coffee or something i expect you want to talk the butterys still open or we could go to my room despite the casual sound of the latter invitation mirandas cheeks coloured i mean if you want to talk privately you know lynley smiled your room she struggled into a huge pea jackettossing a ta inspector over her shoulder when he helped her get it onwrapped a scarf round her neck and picked up her trumpet case she said right come on then im over in new court and headed down the aisle instead of crossing chapel court and using the formal passageway between the east and south buildingsthesere called the randolph digs miranda informed him after the architect ugly arent theyshe led him along the arcade and into a doorway at its north end they went up a short flight of stairs down a corridor through a fi re door down another corridor through another fi re door down another flight of stairs all the time miranda talked i dont know yet how i feel about whats happened to elena she said it sounded like a discourse shed been having with herself most of the day i keep thinking i should feel outrage or anger or grief but so far ive not felt anything at all except guilty for not feeling what i ought to feel and sort of disgustingly selfimportant now that daddys involved through you of courseand that puts me in the know how despicable really im a christian arent i shouldnt i mourn her she didnt wait for lynley to reply you see the essential problem is that i cant quite grasp that elenas dead i didnt see her last night i didnt hear her leave this morning thats a fair description of how we lived on a regular basis anyway so everything seems perfectly normal to me perhaps if i had been the one to find her or if shed been killed in her room and our bedder had found her and come screaming in to get mekind of like a fi lm you knowi would have seen and known and been moved somehow its the absence of feeling thats worrying me am i turning to stone dont i even care were you particularly close to her thats just it i should have been closer than i was i should have made a bigger effort ive known her since last year but she wasnt a friend miranda paused at the doorway that led out of the north randolph building and into new court she wrinkled her nose i wasnt a runner she said obscurely and shoved open the door a terrace overlooked the river to their left a cobbled path to their right ran between the randolph building and a lawn an enormous sweet chestnut tree stood in the lawns centre beyond which loomed the horseshoeshaped building that comprised new court three storeys of blazing gothic revival decorated with twocentred cusp windows arched doorways whose doors wore heavy iron studs battlements on the roofline and a steepled tower although it was constructed from the same ashlar stone as the randolph building which it faced it could not have been stylistically more dissimilar its this way miranda said and led him along the path to the southeast corner of the building there winter jasmine was growing enthusiastically up the walls lynley caught its sweet fragrance the instant before miranda opened a door next to which the discreet letter l was carved into a small block of stone they went up two flights of stairs at mirandas quick pace her room was one of two bedsitting rooms that faced each other on a short corridor sharing a gyp room a shower and a toilet miranda paused in the gyp room to fi ll a kettle and put it on to boil itll have to be instant she said with a little grimace but ive a bit of whisky and we can tart it up with that if you like as long as you dont tell mummy that youve taken to drink she rolled her eyes that ive taken to anything unless its a man you can tell her what youd like about that make up something good put me in a black lace negligee itll give her hope she laughed and went to the door of her room shed wisely locked it he noted with approval she wasnt the only daughter of a superintendent of police for nothing i see youve managed to snare yourself deluxe accommodations he said as they entered and indeed by cambridge standards she had for the bedsit comprised two rooms not one a small inner chamber where she slept a larger outer chamber for sitting this latter was capacious enough to accommodate two undersized sofas and a small walnut dining table that acted as substitute for a desk there was a brickedin fireplace in one corner of the room and an oak window seat overlooking trinity passage lane on the seat itself a wire cage stood lynley went to inspect the tiny prisoner who was engaged in running furiously on a squeaking exercise wheel miranda set her trumpet case next to the armchair and dumped her coat nearby she said thats titbit and went to the fi replace to fiddle with an electric fi re lynley looked up from removing his own coat elenas mouse when i heard what happened i fetched him from her room it seemed the right thing to do when this afternoon perhapsa bit after two her room wasnt locked no not yet at least elena never locked up on a set of shelves in an alcove were several bottles of spirits five glasses three cups and saucers miranda fetched two of the cups and one of the bottles and took them to the table that could be important couldnt it she said that she didnt lock her room the little mouse left off running and scampered from the wheel to the side of the cage his whiskers twitched his nose quivered his paws grasping the slender metal bars he raised himself up and sniffed eagerly at lynleys fi ngers it could be he said did you hear anyone in her room this morning later on i imagine perhaps at seven or half past miranda shook her head she looked regretful earplugs she said you wear earplugs to bed have done since she hesitated appearing embarrassed for a moment before she sloughed the feeling off and continued with its the only way i can sleep inspector got used to them i suppose unappealing as the devil but there it is lynley filled in the blanks of mirandas awkward justification admiring her for the plucky effort at bravado the struggle that was the webberly marriage was no particular secret to anyone who knew the superintendent well his daughter would have begun wearing earplugs at home wanting to block out the worst of her parents nighttime quarrels what time did you get up this morning randie eight she said give or take ten minutes she smiled wryly give ten minutes then i had a lecture at nine and when you got up what did you do shower bathe hmm yes had a cup of tea ate some cereal made some toast her door was shut yes everything seemed normal no sign that anyone had been in no sign except the kettle began to whistle in the gyp room she hooked the two cups and a small jug over her fi ngers and went to the door where she paused i dont know that i would have noticed i mean she had more visitors than i did you see she was popular miranda picked at a chip in one of the cups the pitch of the kettles whistle seemed to intensify a degree she looked uncomfortable with men lynley asked let me get the coffee she said she ducked out of the room leaving the door open lynley could hear her movements in the gyp room he could see the closed door across the hall from the porter hed obtained the key to that nowlocked door but he felt no inclination to use it he considered this sensation so at odds with how he believed he ought to feel he was going at the case backwards the rational dictates of his job told him that despite the hour of his arrival he should have spoken to the cambridge police first to the parents next to the finder of the body third that accomplished he should have sifted through the victims belongings for a possible clue to her killers identity all textbook stuff labelled proper procedure as sergeant havers would have undoubtedly pointed out he couldnt have listed reasons why he wasnt adhering to it he merely felt that the nature of the crime itself suggested a personal involvement perhaps more than that a settling of scores and only an understanding of the central fi gures involved could reveal exactly what those personal involvements and those settled scores were miranda returned cups and jug on a pink tin tray milks gone off she announced putting the cups into their saucers sorry well have to make do with the whisky but ive a bit of sugar would you like some he demurred elenas visitors he asked i assume they must have been men she looked as if shed been hoping hed forgotten the question while she was making the coffee he joined her at the table she sloshed some whisky into both of their cups stirred them with the same spoon which she licked and then continued to hold slapping it into her palm as she spoke not all she said she was best mates with the girls in hare and hounds they came by now and then or shed go off with them to a party somewhere she was a great one for parties elena was she liked to dance she said she could feel the vibrations from the music if it was loud enough and the men lynley asked the spoon slapped noisily against her palm she screwed up her face mummy would be happy if i had only a tenth of whatever elena had men liked her inspector something which you find difficult to understand no i could see why they did she was lively and funny and she liked to talk and to listen which is awfully odd when you think she couldnt really do either could she but somehow she always gave the impression that when she was with you she was only and completely interested in you so i could see how a manyou know she flipped the spoon back and forth to complete her sentence creatures of ego that we are men like to believe theyre the centre of things dont they elena was good at letting them think they are particular men gareth randolph for one miranda said he was here to see her lots two or three times every week i could always tell when gareth came to call because the air got heavy hes so intense elena said she could feel his aura the moment he opened the door to our staircase here comes trouble shed say if we were in the gyp room and thirty seconds later there he would be she said she was psychic when it came to gareth miranda laughed frankly i think she could smell his cologne were they a couple they went about together people paired their names did elena like that she said he was just a friend was there someone else special she took a drink of her coffee and added more whisky to it shoving the bottle across to him when she was through i dont know if he was special but she saw adam jenn her fathers graduate student she saw a good bit of him and her dad stopped by lots but i suppose he doesnt count does he because he was only here to keep tabs on her she hadnt done well last yearhave they told you that and he wanted to make sure there was no repeat performance thats how elena put it at least here comes my keeper shed say when she saw him from the window once or twice she hid in my bedsit just to tease him and came out laughing when he started to react because she wasnt in her room when shed said shed be there to meet him i take it she didnt like the plan theyd come up with to keep her at the university she said the best part about it was the mouse tibbit she called him companion of my cell she was like that inspector she could make a joke out of anything miranda seemed to have completed her recital of information for she sat back in her chair indian style with her legs tucked under her on the seat and she drank more coffee but her look at him was a chary one which indicated that something was being withheld was there someone else randie miranda squirmed she examined a small basket of apples and oranges on the table and after that the posters on the wall above it dizzy gillespie louis armstrong wynton marsalis in concert dave brubeck at the piano ella fitzgerald at the mike she hadnt abandoned her love of jazz she glanced at him again poking the handle of the teaspoon into her mop of hair someone else lynley repeated randie if you know something more i dont know anything else absolutely for sure inspector and i cant tell you every little thing can i because something i tell you some little detailmight not even mean anything but if you took it to heart people might get hurt mightnt they dad says thats the biggest danger in policework lynley made a mental note to discourage webberly from waxing philosophical with his daughter in the future thats always possible he agreed but im not about to arrest someone just because you mention his name when she said nothing he leaned across the table and tapped his finger against her coffee cup word of honour randie all right do you know something else what i know about gareth and adam and her father came from elena she said thats why i told you anything else in my head is nothing but gossip or something i maybe saw and didnt understand and that cant be helpful that could make things go wrong were not gossiping randie were trying to get at the truth behind her death the facts not conjectures she didnt immediately respond she stared at the bottle of whisky on the table its label bore a greasy fingerprint stain she said facts arent conclusions dad always says that absolutely agreed she hesitated even looked over her shoulder as if to make sure they were still alone this is about seeing nothing more she said understood all right she straightened her shoulders as if in preparation but she still didnt look as if she wanted to part with the information i think she had a row with gareth on sunday evening only she added in a rush i cant know for sure because i didnt hear them they talked with their hands i just caught a glimpse of them in elenas room before she shut the door and when gareth left he was in quite a temper he banged his way out only it could mean nothing because hes so intense anyway that hed be acting like that even if theyd been discussing the poll tax yes i see and after their argument elena left as well what time was this round twenty to eight i never heard her come back miranda seemed to read heightened interest in his face for she went on hastily i dont think gareth had anything to do with whats happened inspector he has a temper true and hes on a tight string but he wasnt the only one she gnawed at her lip someone else was here noooonot exactly randie her body slumped mr thorsson then he was here she nodded who is he one of elenas supervisors he lectures in english when was this i saw him here twice actually but not on sunday day or night night once probably round the third week of the term then again last thursday could he have been here more often she looked reluctant to answer but she said i suppose yes but i just saw him twice twice is all inspector twice is the fact her voice implied did she tell you why he came to see her miranda shook her head slowly i think she didnt much like him because she called him lenny the lech lennart hes swedish see and thats all i know truly really thats the fact you mean even as he said it lynley felt sure that miranda webberly daughter of her fathercould have produced half a dozen conjectures to go with it lynley went through the gatehouse stopping briefly in the porters lodge before stepping out into trinity lane terence cuff had wisely seen to it that the rooms set aside for visitors to the college were in st stephens court which along with ivy court was across the narrow lane from the rest of the college and unlike the rest of the college it had neither porter nor gatehouse so it wasnt locked at night thereby giving visitors more freedom of movement than the junior members of the college had a plain wrought iron fence separated this part of the college from the street it ran north to south forming a line of demarcation that was interrupted by the west wall of st stephens church this random rubble building was one of the original parish churches in cambridge and its stone quoins buttresses and norman tower seemed strangely at odds with the neat edwardian brick building that partially encircled it lynley pushed open the iron gate a second fence inside marked the boundary of the churchyard there graves lay dimly illuminated by the same ground lights that shone cones of yellow against the walls of the church where moths fluttered weakly with sodden wings in the glow the fog had grown even heavier during the time he had spent with miranda and it transformed sarcophagi gravestones tombs bushes and trees into colourless silhouettes laid against a slowly shifting background of mist along the wrought iron fence that separated st stephens court from the churchyard perhaps a hundred or more bicycles stood their handlebars gleaming slick with the damp passing these lynley made his way to ivy court where the porter had earlier shown him to his room at the top of o staircase it was quiet inside the building itself these rooms the porter had told him were used only by the senior members of the college they comprised studies and conference rooms where supervisions took place gyp rooms and smaller rooms with beds for kipping since most of the senior fellows lived away from the college the building was largely unpopulated at night lynleys room encompassed one of the buildings dutch gables and it looked out into ivy court and st stephens graveyard with brown carpet squares on the fl oor stained yellow walls and faded floral curtains at the window it wasnt a particularly uplifting environment clearly st stephens did not expect visitors to embark upon an extended stay left alone there earlier by the porter hed found himself slowly examining its contents touching a mustysmelling armchair opening a drawer running his fingers along the empty adjustable bookshelves that lined one wall he ran water in the basin he tested the strength of the single steel rod in a cupboard for holding clothes he thought about oxford the room had been different but the feeling was the same that sensation of having the entire world opening up before him revealing its mysteries even as it held out the promise of satisfactions to come the blessing of relative anonymity had filled him with the sense of having been newly born empty shelves blank walls drawers that held nothing here he had thought he would make his mark no one need know of his title and background no one need know of his risible angst the secret lives of ones parents had no place in oxford here he had thought he would be safe from the past he chuckled now to think of how tenaciously he had held on to that fi nal adolescent belief he had actually seen himself moving into a golden future in which he had to do absolutely nothing to deal with what had led up to it how we flee our personal realities he thought his suitcase was still on the desk in the recess made by the gable it took him less than five minutes to unpack after which he sat feeling the rooms chill and his own restless need to be elsewhere he sought distraction by writing out his fi rst days report a job that would usually be completed by sergeant havers but one that he set upon automatically now grateful for a diversion that would keep thoughts of helen at bay if only for an hour or so one call yes sir the porter had said as he passed through the lodge shes phoned lynley thought harrys come home and his mood began to lift accordingly only to plummet to earth when the porter handed him the message superintendent daniel sheehan of the cambridge constabulary would meet with him at half past eight in the morning there was nothing from helen he wrote steadily filling in page after page with the details of his meeting with terence cuff with the impressions hed formed after his conversation with anthony and justine weaver with a description of the ceephone and the possibilities it presented with the facts hed managed to glean from miranda webberly he wrote far more than he needed to write forcing himself to address the murder in a streamofconsciousness fashion which havers would rightfully scorn but which also served to focus his mind on the killing and kept it from wandering to areas that would only intensify his nerveaching frustration at the end however the effort was a failure for after an hour of writing he set down his pen removed his spectacles rubbed his eyes and thought immediately of helen he could sense that he was fast approaching the limit of his capacity for friendship with her shed wanted time hed given it month after month believing that any false move on his part would cause him to lose her forever as much as possible hed tried to refashion himself into the man who had once been her comrade in laughter a casual companion willing to engage in whatever madcap adventure shed cared to propose from hotair ballooning in the loire to spelunking in the burren it didnt particularly matter as long as she was there but he was finding that the pretence of fraternal affection was growing daily more difficult to maintain and the words i love you were no longer a means of defining the nature of the close friendship between them instead they were fast becoming a gauntlet which he repeatedly threw down before her demanding a satisfaction that she did not appear willing to give she continued to see other men she never told him this directly but he knew it intuitively he read it in her eyes when she spoke of a play she had seen a drinks party shed attended a gallery shed visited and while he sought out other women in what amounted to a momentarily successful effort to drive the thought of helen from his mind he could not drive her spirit from his heart any more than he could obliterate the connection that tied her to his soul he had closed his eyes upon more than one lover imagining the body beneath his to be helens hearing helens cries feeling helens arms tasting the miracle of helens mouth and more than once he had cried out with the pleasure of his bodys fleeting moment of release only to be fi lled with desolation in the very next instant it was no longer enough to take and give pleasure he wanted to make love he wanted to own love but not without helen his nerves felt strung his arms and legs ached he pushed away from the desk and went to the basin where he splashed water on his face and examined himself dispassionately in the mirror cambridge would be their battleground he decided whatever was to be won or lost it would happen here back at the desk he flipped through the pages he had written reading his words but assimilating nothing he closed the notebook with a snap and slapped it down the air in the room seemed suddenly close too much hung with the opposing odours of fresh disinfectant and old tobacco smoke it felt oppressive he leaned over the desk top shoved the window up all the way and let the damp night air wash over his cheeks below him the graveyardhalfhidden by the fog cast up a faint fresh scent of pine from its trees the ground there would spring with fallen needles and as he breathed in their fragrance he could almost imagine the spongy feel of them beneath his feet a movement at the fence caught his attention at first he thought the wind was rising to shift the fog away from bushes and trees but as he watched a figure melted out of the shadow of one of the spruces and he saw that the movement had not come from within the graveyard at all but from its perimeter where someone was easing stealthily between the bicycles away from him head lifted to examine the windows of the courts east range woman or man lynley couldnt tell and when he switched off his desk lamp to have a better look the fi gure froze as if preternaturally aware of being watched even at a distance of some twenty yards then lynley heard the sound of a cars engine idling in trinity lane voices called out a laughing good night a horn tooted happily in response with a grinding of gears the car roared off the voices faded as their owners walked away and the shadow below became both substance and movement again whoever it was stealing one of the bicycles didnt appear to be its objective it headed for a doorway on the east range of the court a lanternshaped lamp overhung with the ivy for which the court was named provided scant illumination there and lynley waited for the fi gure to enter the milky penumbra directly in front of the door hoping that whoever it was might toss a quick look over a shoulder and give him a glimpse of face it didnt happen instead the figure hurried soundlessly to the doorway shot out a pale hand to grasp the knob and disappeared into the building but just for a moment as the shadowy form passed beneath the light lynley saw hair rich dark and plentiful a woman suggested an assignation with someone no doubt anxiously waiting behind one of those sightless darkened windows he waited for one of them to brighten with light it did not happen instead less than two minutes after she had disappeared into the building the door opened again and the woman reemerged this time she paused for an instant beneath the light in order to pull the door shut behind her the faint glow outlined the curve of a cheek the shape of a nose and chin but only for a moment then she was gone moving across the court fading back into the darkness by the graveyard she was as silent as the mist cambridge police headquarters faced parkers piece a vast green crisscrossed by intersecting paths joggers ran here their breaths gusting out in fibrous clouds while on the grass two dalmatianstongues flapping happily chased after an orange frisbee thrown by a whipthin bearded man whose bald head shone in the morning sun all of them seemed to be rejoicing in the disappearance of the fog even pedestrians rushing by on the pavement held up their faces to let the sunlight strike them for the first time in days although the temperature was no higher than it had been on the previous morning and a brisk wind made the chill cut close the fact that the sky was blue and the day was bright served to make the cold stimulating instead of insufferable lynley paused outside the dun brickandconcrete structure that housed the main offices of the local police a glassenclosed notice board stood in front of the doors on which were fastened posters about child safety in cars drinking and driving and an organisation called crimestoppers over this last had been taped a handout giving the superfi cial details of elena weavers death and asking for information from anyone who might have seen her yesterday morning or sunday night it was a hastily composed document with a grainy photocopied picture of the dead girl upon it and it had not been generated by the police deastu and a telephone number were printed prominently at the bottom of the page lynley sighed when he saw this the deaf students were launching their own investigation that wouldnt make his job any less complicated a blast of warm air hit him when he opened the doors and entered the lobby where a young man garbed in black leather was arguing with a uniformed receptionist about a traffi c ticket on one of the chairs his companion waited a girl in moccasins and what appeared to be an indian bedspread she kept murmuring come on ron cripes come on with her feet drumming impatiently on the black tile fl oor the constable working reception cast a thankful look in lynleys direction perhaps appreciative of the diversion he broke into the young mans you listen here mate i bloody dont intend to with sit down lad youre getting in a twist over nothing after which he nodded to lynley saying cid scotland yard its that obvious then colour of the skin police pallor we call it but ill have a glance at your id all the same lynley produced his warrant card the constable examined it before pressing the release on the locked door which separated the lobby from the station proper a buzzer sounded he nodded lynley inside first floor he said just follow the signs he resumed his argument with the boy in leather the superintendents office was at the front of the building overlooking parkers piece as lynley approached it the door opened and an angular woman with a geometric haircut took up a position within its frame arms akimbo elbows pointed like spikes she scrutinised him from head to foot obviously reception had phoned ahead inspector lynley she spoke with the same sort of infl ection one uses when naming a social disease the superintendents scheduled for a meeting with chief constable in huntingdon at half past ten i shall ask you to keep that in mind when you thatll do edwina a voice called from the inner offi ce her lips minced their way round a glacial smile she stepped to one side and allowed lynley to pass her of course she said coffee mr sheehan yes as he spoke superintendent daniel sheehan came across the room to meet lynley at the door he offered a large beefy hand a companion in bulk to the rest of him his grip was firm and in spite of the fact that lynley represented a scotland yard invasion into his patch his smile offered fellowship coffee for you inspector thank you black edwina nodded curtly and disappeared her high heels cracked sharp reports in the hall sheehan snorted a chuckle come in before the lions have at you or at least the lioness not all of my troops are taking your visit well thats a reasonable reaction sheehan motioned him not to one of the two plastic chairs which faced his desk but to a blue vinylcovered sofa which along with a pressed wood coffee table apparently constituted the conference area of his office a map of the city centre hung on the wall there each of the colleges was outlined in red while lynley took off his overcoat sheehan went to his desk where in apparent defiance of gravity a stack of folders leaned precariously towards the rubbish container on the floor as the superintendent gathered up a loose collection of papers and fastened them together with a paperclip lynley regarded him caught between curiosity and admiration at finding sheehan so calm in the face of what could easily be interpreted as a declaration of his cids incompetence sheehan certainly didnt appear unfl appable on the surface his ruddy complexion suggested a quick temper his thick fi ngers promised notable fists his barrel chest and massive thighs seemed suitable to a brawler and yet his easy manner contradicted his physique as did his words which were perfectly dispassionate his choice of topic suggested that he and lynley had spoken to each other before establishing some sort of camaraderie it was an oddly nonpolitical approach to what could have been an uneasy situation lynley liked him for choosing it it revealed him to be direct and confident of who and what he was i cant say we didnt bring this on ourselves sheehan said its a problem in forensic that should have been resolved two years back but my cc doesnt like to get involved in departmental squabblings and as a result the chickens if youll pardon the cliché and dont mind wearing feathers have come home to roost he snagged one of the plastic chairs returned to the sofa and dropped his collection of papers onto the table where a manila folder labeled weaver already lay he sat the chair creaked under his weight im not happy as a sod myself about having you here he admitted but i wasnt surprised when the vice chancellor rang me and said the university wanted the yard forensic made a real ballsup of an undergraduate suicide last may the university doesnt want a replay i cant say i blame them what i dont much like is the implication of bias though they seem to think that if a student pops off the local cid are as likely to say good riddance to another gown as they are to investigate i was told you had a leak in the department that caused the university bad press last term sheehan gave a grunt of confi rmation a leak from forensic weve got two prima donnas out there and when one disagrees with the others conclusions they fight it out in the press instead of the lab drakethe senior mancalled the death a suicide pleasance the juniorcalled it murder based on the propensity for a suicide to stand before a mirror to cut his throat this suicide did it while lying on his bed and pleasance wouldnt buy it the trouble started from there sheehan lifted a thigh with another grunt and drove his hand into his trouser pocket he brought out a packet of chewing gum and balanced it on his palm ive been after my cc to separate those twoor fire pleasancefor exactly twentyone months now if the yards involvement in this case can manage to bring that about ill be a happy man he offered the gum sugarless he said and when lynley shook his head dont blame you a bit stuff tastes like rubber he popped a folded piece into his mouth but it manages to give the illusion of food if only i could convince my stomach dieting sheehan smacked his palm against his bulging waistline where his stomach overhung the belt on his trousers its got to go id a heart attack last year ah heres the coffee edwina marched into the room with a cracked wooden tray held in front of her on which plumes of steam rose from two brown mugs she set the coffee on the table looked at her watch and said with a brief meaningful glance in lynleys direction shall i buzz you in time to leave for huntingdon mr sheehan ill manage edwina chief constable expects you at half past ten yes sheehan reached for his coffee and raised it to his secretary in a salute he offered a smile of both thanks and dismissal edwina looked as if she wished to say more but she left the room instead the door lynley saw did not quite catch behind her we dont have much more than the preliminaries for you sheehan said with a lift of his coffee mug towards the papers and the folder on the table we cant get her into autopsy until late this morning lynley put on his spectacles saying what do you know not much so far two blows to the face causing a sphenoidal fracture that was the initial damage then she was strangled with the tie cord of her tracksuits hood all this occurred on an island as i understand it only the killing itself weve got a goodsized blood splatter on the footpath that runs along the riverbank she would have been attacked there first then dragged across the footbridge onto the island when you go out there youll see that itd be no problem the islands only separated from the west bank of the river by a bit of a ditch dragging her off the footpath would have been a matter of fi fteen seconds or less once she was unconscious did she put up a fi ght sheehan blew across the top of his coffee mug and took a gusty slurp he shook his head she was wearing mittens but weve got no hairs or skin caught in the material it looks to us like someone caught her by surprise but forensic are taping her tracksuit to see whats what other evidence a plethora of crap that were sorting through disintegrating newspapers half a dozen empty cigarette packs a wine bottle you name it its there the islands a local hangout has been for years weve probably got two generations of rubbish to sift through lynley opened the folder youve narrowed time of death between half past five and seven he noted and looked up according to the college the porter saw her leaving the grounds at a quarter past six and the body was found not long after seven so youve actually less than an hour to play with nice and narrow sheehan said lynley flipped through to the crime scene photographs who found her young woman called sarah gordon shed gone there to sketch lynley raised his head sharply in the fog my thought as well you couldnt see ten yards i dont know what she was thinking but she had a whole kit of stuff with her couple of easels a case of paints and pastelsso she was obviously setting up for a good long stay which was cut a bit short when she found the body instead of inspiration lynley looked through the pictures the girl lay mostly covered by a mound of sodden leaves she was on her right side her arms in front of her her knees bent and her legs slightly drawn up she might have been sleeping save for the fact that her face was turned towards the earth her hair falling forward to leave her neck bare round this the ligature cut into her skin so deeply in places that it seemed to disappear so deeply in places that it suggested a rare brutal and triumphant sort of strength a surging of adrenaline through a killers muscles lynley studied the pictures there was something vaguely familiar about them and he wondered if the crime were a copy of another she certainly doesnt look like an arbitrary body dump he said sheehan leaned forward to get a look at the picture she wouldnt be would she not at the hour in the morning this wasnt any arbitrary killing this was a lyinginwait quite theres some evidence of that he told the superintendent about elenas alleged call to her fathers house the night before she died so youre looking for someone who knew her movements what her schedule would be that morning and the fact that her stepmother wouldnt go running along the river at a quarter past six if she had the chance not to someone close to the girl i should guess sheehan picked up a picture and then another looking at them with an expression of marked regret on his face i always hate to see a young girl like this die but especially this way he tossed the pictures back well do what we can at our end to help youmatters being what they are in forensic but if the bodys any indication inspector aside from someone who knew the girl well i should say youre looking for a killer whos crawfi lled with hate sergeant havers emerged from the buttery and descended the stairs from the terrace only moments after lynley emerged from the library passage which connected middle court to north court she flipped her cigarette into a bed of asters and sank both hands into the pockets of her coat peasoup green it hung open to reveal navy trousers going baggy at the knees a purple pullover and two scarvesone brown and one pink youre a vision havers lynley said when she joined him is this the rainbow effect you know the sort of thing rather like the greenhouse effect but more immediately apparent she rummaged in her bag for a packet of players she shook one out lit it and refl ectively blew smoke in his face he did his best not to lap up the aroma ten months without smoking and he still felt the urge to rip the cigarette from his sergeants hand and smoke it to the nub i thought i ought to blend in with the environment havers said you dont like it why dont i look academic you do certainly by someones defi nition what could i hope to expect from a bloke who spent his formative years at eton havers asked the sky if id shown up in a top hat striped trousers and cutaway would i have passed muster with you only if you had ginger rogers on your arm havers laughed sod you sentiments returned he watched her flick a bit of ash to the ground did you get your mother settled at hawthorn lodge two girls passed them holding a muted conversation their heads together over a piece of paper lynley saw that it was the same handout which had been posted in front of the police station his eyes went back to havers who kept her own on the two girls until they disappeared round the herbaceous border that marked the entrance to new court havers she waved him off puffing on her cigarette i changed my mind it didnt work out what have you done about her carrying on with mrs gustafson for a bit ill see how it goes she brushed her hand aimlessly over the top of her head ruffl ing her short hair the cold air made it crackle so what dwe have here for the moment he submitted himself to her desire for privacy and gave her what facts he had gleaned from sheehan when he was fi nished telling her what he knew so far she said weapons for beating her they dont know yet nothing was left at the scene and theyre still working on possible trace evidence on the body so weve got the ubiquitous unidentifi ed blunt object havers said and the strangulation the tie from the hood of her jacket the killer knew what she would wear possibly photos he handed her the folder she put her cigarette between her lips opened the folder and squinted through the smoke at the pictures that lay on top of the report have you ever been to brompton oratory havers she looked up the cigarette bobbed as she spoke no why are you getting some of that oldtime religion theres a sculpture there the martyred st cecilia i couldnt quite put my fi nger on what it was about this body when i fi rst saw the pictures but on the way back here it came to me its the sculpture of st cecilia over her shoulder he fingered through the pictures to find the one he wanted its the way her hair sweeps forward the position of her arms even the ligature round her neck st cecilia was strangled havers asked i thought martyrdom was more your basic lionattack in front of a crowd of cheering downthumbing romans in this caseif i recall it correctlyher head was halfsevered and she waited two days to die but the sculpture only shows the cut itself which looks like a ligature jesus no wonder she got into heaven havers dropped her cigarette to the ground and crushed it out so whats your point inspector do we have a killer hot after duplicating all the sculptures in brompton oratory if thats whats going on when he gets to the crucifi xion i hope im off the case is there a crucifi xion sculpture in the oratory by the way i cant remember but all the apostles are there eleven of them martyrs she said refl ectively weve got big trouble unless the killers only looking for females it doesnt matter i doubt anyone would buy the oratory theory he said and guided her in the direction of new court as they walked he listed the points of information he had gathered from terence cuff the weavers and miranda webberly the penford chair blighted love a good dose of jealousy and an evil stepmother havers commented when he was done she looked at her watch all that in only sixteen hours by yourself on the case are you sure you need me inspector no doubt of that you pass for an undergraduate better than i i think its the clothes he opened the door to l staircase for her two flights up he said and took the key from his pocket from the fi rst floor they could hear music playing it grew louder as they climbed the low moan of a saxophone the answering call of a clarinet miranda webberlys jazz in the secondfloor corridor they could hear a few tentative notes blown from a trumpet as miranda played along with the greats its here lynley said and unlocked the door unlike mirandas elena weavers was a single room and it overlooked the buff brick terrace of north court also unlike mirandas it was largely a mess cupboards and drawers gaped open two lights burned books lay strewn across the desk their pages fl uttering in the sudden breeze from the door a green robe formed a heap on the fl oor along with a pair of blue jeans a black camisole and a balledup bit of nylon that seemed to be dirty underwear the air felt close and overheated fusty with the odour of clothes needing to be washed lynley walked to the desk and cracked open a window as havers took off her coat and scarves dumping them on the bed she went to the walledin fireplace in the corner of the room where a row of porcelain unicorns lined the mantel fanning out above them posters hung again depicting unicorns the occasional maiden and an excessive amount of phantasmagorical mist across the room lynley glanced into the clothes cupboard which was largely a jumble of neoncoloured elasticised garments the odd exception of a pair of neat tweed trousers and a floral dress with a delicate lace collar hung away from the rest havers came to his side wordlessly she examined the clothing better bag all this to make a match of any fibres they pull off her tracksuit havers said she would have kept it in here she began removing the clothing from its hangers odd though isnt it what she flicked a thumb towards the dress and the trousers at the end of the rod which part of her was playing dressup inspector the vamp in neon or the angel in lace perhaps both at the desk he saw that a large calendar served as a blotter and he moved the texts and the notebooks to one side to have a look at it a stroke of possible good fortune here havers she was stuffing garments into a plastic sack which shed removed from her shoulder bag what sort a calendar she hasnt removed the old months shes merely folded them back score a point for our side quite he reached for his spectacles in the breast pocket of his jacket the first six months of the calendar represented the latter twothirds of elenas fi rst year at the university lent and easter terms most of her notations were clear lectures were listed by subject from chaucer on every wednesday to spenser the following day supervisions seemed to bear the name of the senior fellow with whom she would be meeting a conclusion lynley reached when he saw the name thorsson blocking out the same period of time every week in easter term other notations patched in more details of the dead girls life deastu appeared with increasing regularity from january through may indicating elenas adherence to at least one of the guidelines set down by the senior tutor her supervisors and terence cuff for her social rehabilitation attended by specific times the titles hare and hounds and search and pellet suggested her membership in two of the universitys other societies and dads sprinkled liberally throughout every month gave evidence of the amount of time elena spent with her father and his wife there was no indication that she saw her mother in london at any time other than on holidays well havers asked as lynley searched through the months she popped the last piece of clothing from the floor into the sack twisted it closed and wrote a few words on a label it looks fairly straightforward he said excepthavers tell me what you make of this when she joined him at the desk he pointed out a symbol that elena used repeatedly throughout the calendar a simple pencilsketch of a fish it first appeared on the eighteenth of january and continued with regularity three or four times each week generally on a weekday only sporadically on a saturday rarely on a sunday havers bent over it she dropped the sack of clothes to the floor looks like the christianity symbol she said at last perhaps shed decided to be born again that would have been a quick recovery from reprobation lynley replied the university wanted her in deastu but no ones mentioned a word about religion perhaps she didnt want anyone to know thats clear enough she didnt want someone to know something im just not sure it had anything to do with discovering the lord havers seemed willing to pursue another tack she was a runner wasnt she maybe its a diet these are the days she had to eat fish good for the blood pressure good for the cholesterol good for thewhat muscle tone or something but she was thin anywayyou can tell that much from the size of her clothesso she wouldnt have wanted anyone to know heading towards anorexia sounds good to me body weight something a girl like herwith everyones fi ngers in her personal piecould control but she would have had to cook it herself in the gyp room lynley said surely randie webberly would have noticed that and mentioned it to me and anyway dont anorexics simply stop eating okay its the symbol of some society then a secret group thats up to no good drugs alcohol stealing government data this is cambridge after all alma mater of the uks most prestigious group of traitors she may have been hoping to follow in their footsteps fish could have been an acronym for their group foolish intellectuals squashing hedonism havers grinned youre a fi ner detective than ever i thought they continued flipping through the calendar the notations were unchanging from month to month tapering off in the summer when only the fish appearedand that a mere three times its final appearance was the day before her murder and the only other marking of any note was a single address written on the wednesday before she died seymour street and the time heres something lynley said and havers jotted it down in her notebook along with hare and hounds search and pellet and a rough copy of the fish ill handle it she said and began to go through the drawers of the desk as he turned to the cupboard that housed the washbasin this contained a cornucopia of possessions and illustrated the manner in which one usually stores belongings when space is at a minimum there was everything from laundry detergent to a popcorn popper but nothing revealed very much about elena look at this havers said as he was closing the cupboard and moving on to one of the drawers built into the wardrobe next to it he looked up to see that she was holding out a slim white case decorated with blue fl owers a prescription label was affixed to its centre birth control pills she said sliding out the thin sheet still encased in its plastic cover hardly something surprising to find in the room of a twentyyearold college girl lynley said but theyre dated last february inspector and not one of them taken looks like there was no man in her life at the present do we eliminate a jealous lover as the killer this was lynley thought certainly support for what both justine weaver and miranda webberly had said last night about gareth randolph elena hadnt been involved with him the pills however also suggested a consistent refusal to get involved with anyone something which might have set the wheels of a killers rage in motion but surely she would have talked about that with someone looking to someone for support or advice if she had been having trouble with a man across the hall the music ended a few last wavering live notes sounded on the trumpet before after a moment of muffl ed activity the squeak of a door replaced the other sounds randie lynley called elenas door swung inward miranda stood there bundled up for the outdoors in her heavy pea jacket and navy sweat suit with a limegreen beret perched rakishly on her head she was wearing hightopped black athletic shoes socks decorated to look like slices of watermelon peeked out from the top of them glancing at her attire havers said meaningfully i rest my case inspector and then to the girl good to see you randie miranda smiled you got here early necessity i couldnt let his lordship muddle through on his own besidesthis with a sardonic look in lynleys directionhe hasnt quite got the flavour of modern university life thank you sergeant lynley said id be lost without you he indicated the calendar will you look at this fi sh randie does it mean anything to you miranda joined him at the desk and inspected the sketches on the calendar she shook her head she hadnt been doing any cooking in the gyp room havers asked obviously testing out her diet theory miranda looked incredulous cooking fish you mean elena cooking fi sh you would have known it right i would have got sick i hate the smell of fi sh then some society that she belonged to havers was going for theory number two sorry i know she was in deastu and hare and hounds and probably one or two other societies as well but im not sure which randie looked through the calendar as they themselves had done chewing absently on the edge of her thumb its too often she said when shed gone back to january no society has this many meetings a person then lynley saw her cheeks flush i wouldnt know really she never said that there was anyone that special i mean special enough for three or four nights a week she never said you cant know for certain you mean lynley said you dont know for a fact but you lived with her randie you knew her far better than you think tell me the sorts of things elena did those are merely facts nothing more ill build upon them miranda hesitated a long moment before saying she went out a lot at night by herself for entire nights no she couldnt do that because after last december they made her check in and out with the porter but she got back to her room late whenever she went outi mean when it was one of those secret goingouts she was never here when i went to bed on those nights secret goingouts mirandas ginger hair bobbed as she nodded she went by herself she always wore perfume she didnt take books i thought there must have been someone she was seeing but she never told you who it was no and i didnt like to pry i dont think she wanted anyone to know that doesnt suggest a fellow undergraduate does it i suppose not what about thorsson her eyes dropped to the calendar she touched the edge of it reflectively what do you know about his relationship with elena theres something to it randie i can see that on your face and he was here thursday night i only know randie hesitated sighed this is what she said its only what she said inspector all right thats understood lynley saw havers flip over a page of her notebook miranda watched the sergeant write she said he was trying to make it with her inspector hed been after her last term she said he was after her again she hated him for it she called him smarmy she said she was going to turn him over to dr cuff for sexual harassment and did she do so i dont know miranda twisted the button on her jacket it was like a little talisman infusing her with strength i dont know that she ever got the chance you see lennart thorsson was in the process of completing a lecture in the english faculty on sidgwick avenue when lynley and havers finally caught him up the popularity of both his material and his manner of presenting it was attested by the size of the hall in which he spoke it held at least one hundred chairs all of them were filled mostly by women ninety percent of them appeared to be hanging upon thorssons every word there was much to hang on all of it delivered in perfect virtually unaccented english the swede paced as he talked he didnt use notes he seemed to take inspiration from intermittently running his right hand through the thick strawberryblond hair which tumbled onto his forehead and round his shoulders in an appealing mess a complement to the drooping moustache that curved round his mouth in a style that befitted the early s so in the royalty plays we examine the issues that shakespeare himself was intent upon examining thorsson was saying monarchy power hierarchy authority dominion and in our examination of these issues we cannot avoid a scrutiny of that which comprised the question of status quo how far is shakespeare writing from a perspective to conserve the status quo how does he do it if he does it and if hes cleverly spinning an illusion in which he merely wears the guise of adherence to these social constrictions of his daywhile all the time espousing an insidious subversion of the social orderhow is he doing that thorsson paused to let the furious notetakers catch up with the fl ow of his thoughts he turned on his heel briskly and paced again and then we go further to begin our examination of the obverse position we ask to what extent is shakespeare openly contesting the existing social hierarchies from what standpoint is he contesting them is he implying an alternative set of valuesa subversive set of valuesand if he is what are they or thorsson pointed a meaningful finger at his audience and leaned towards them his voice more intenseis shakespeare doing something even more complex is he questioning and challenging the foundation of this countryhis countryitselfauthority power and hierarchyin order to imply a refutation of the premise on which his entire society was founded is he projecting different ways of living arguing that if possibility is circumscribed only by existing conditions then man makes no progress and effects no change because is not shakespeares real premisepresent in every playthat all men share equality and does not every king in every play reach that point at which his interests are in alignment with humanity at large and no longer with kingship i think the king is but a man as i am asiam this then is the point we examine equality the king and i are equals we are but men there is no defensible social hierarchy here or anywhere so we agree that it was possible for shakespeare as an imaginative artist to store and dwell upon ideas which would not be talked about for centuries projecting himself into a future he did not know allowing us to see at last that the reason his works are valid today is simply because we have not yet even begun to catch up to his thinking thorsson strode to the podium and picked up a notebook which he closed decisively next week then henry v good morning for a moment no one stirred paper crackled a pencil dropped then with what appeared to be reluctance the audience roused itself with a collective sigh conversation rose as people headed for the exits while thorsson stuffed his notebook and two texts into a haversack as he removed his black academic gown and balled it up to join the textbooks he spoke to a touslehaired young woman still sitting in the front row then after taking a moment to tap one finger against her cheek and laugh at something shed said he came up the aisle towards the door ah havers said sotto voce your basic prince of darkness it was a particularly apt sobriquet thorsson didnt favour black he wallowed in it as if in the attempt to generate a deliberate contrast to his fair skin and hair pullover trousers herringbone jacket overcoat and scarf even his boots were black with pointed toes and high heels if he was intent upon playing the role of youthful indifferent rebellion he couldnt have chosen a more successful costume however when he reached lynley and havers and began with a sharp nod to move past them lynley saw that while thorsson might well have been a rebel he wasnt a youth crows feet shot out from the corners of his eyes and a few grey strands wove through his abundant hair middle thirties lynley decided he and the swede were of an age mr thorsson he offered his warrant card scotland yard cid do you have a few minutes thorsson looked from lynley to havers and back to lynley who made the introductions he said elena weaver i take it yes he slung his haversack over one shoulder and with a sigh roughly drove a hand through his hair we cant talk here have you got a car with you he waited for lynleys nod lets go to the college he turned abruptly and walked out the door flinging his scarf back over his shoulder nice exit that havers said why do i imagine he excels at them they followed thorsson down the hall down the stairs and into the open cloister which had been created by a wellintentioned modern architect who had designed the threesided faculties building to stand upon columns of reinforced concrete round a rectangle of lawn the resulting structure hovered above the ground suggesting impermanence and offering no protection from the wind which at this moment was gusting through the columns ive a supervision next hour thorsson informed them lynley smiled pleasantly i certainly hope were done by then he motioned thorsson in the general direction of his car which hed parked illegally at the northeast entrance to selwyn college they walked to it three abreast on the pavement with thorsson merely nodding indifferently to students who called out to him from passing bicycles it wasnt until they reached the bentley that the shakespearean lecturer addressed them again and then it was only to say this is what the british police are driving fy fan no wonder the countrys going to hell ah but my motor makes up for it havers replied average a tenyearold mini with a fouryearold bentley and you come up with seven years of equality dont you lynley smiled inwardly havers had taken thorssons lecture directly into her caustic little heart you know what i mean she continued a car by any other name rolls down the street thorsson didnt look amused they got into the car lynley headed up grange road to make the circuit that would take them back into the centre of the city at the end of the street as they waited to make the right turn onto the madingley road a lone bicyclist rolled past them heading out of town it took more than a moment for lynley to recognise the rider helens brotherinlaw the absent harry rodger he was pedalling towards his home his coat flapping like great woollen wings round his legs lynley watched him wondering if hed spent the entire night at emmanuel rodgers face seemed pasty save for his nose which was red and matched the colour of his ears he looked perfectly miserable seeing him lynley felt a quick surge of concern only indirectly related to harry rodger it centred itself on helen and a need to get her away from her sisters home and back to london he shoved the thought aside and made himself concentrate on the conversation between havers and lennart thorsson his writing illustrates the artists struggle to work out a utopian vision sergeant a vision that goes beyond a feudal society and deals with all mankind not just a select group of individuals who happen to be born with a silver spoon on which to suck as such the body of his work is prodigiouslyno miraculouslysubversive but most critical analysts dont wish to see it that way it scares them witless to think that a sixteenthcentury writer might have had more social vision than they who of course have no social vision at all shakespeare was a closet marxist then thorsson made a snort of derision simplistic snobbery he responded and hardly what id expect from havers turned in her seat yes thorsson didnt finish his thought there was no need someone of your class hung among them like an echo four words that robbed his liberal literary criticism of virtually all of its meaning they rode the rest of the distance without conversation threading through the lorries and taxis on st johns street to make their way down the narrow gorge of trinity lane lynley parked near the end of trinity passage just outside the north entrance to st stephens college unlocked and pushed open during the day it offered immediate access to new court my rooms are this way thorsson said striding towards the west range of the court which was built on the river he slid back a slat of wood to uncover his name painted in white on a black sign by the door and he entered to the left of the crenellated tower where woodbine grew thickly on the smooth stone walls lynley and havers followed lynley having acknowledged havers knowing look at l staircase directly across the lawn on the east range of the court ahead of them thorsson pounded up the stairs his boots barking in staccato against the bare wood when they caught him up he was unlocking a door upon a room whose windows overlooked the river the blazing autumn of the backs and trinity passage bridge where at this moment a group of tourists were taking pictures thorsson crossed to the windows and dropped his haversack onto a table beneath them two ladderback chairs faced each other there and he draped his overcoat across the back of one of them and went to a large recess in one corner of the room where a single bed stood im done for he said and lay down on his back across the plaid counterpane he winced as if the position were uncomfortable for him sit if you want he gestured to an easy chair and a matching sofa at the foot of the bed both of them covered with material the colour of wet mud his intention was clear the interview that he wished to be conducted on his turf would also be conducted precisely on his terms after nearly thirteen years on the force lynley was used to encountering displays of bravado specious or otherwise he ignored the invitation to sit and took a moment to inspect the collection of volumes in a breakfront bookcase at one side of the room poetry classic fiction literary criticism printed in english french and swedish and several volumes of erotica one of which lay open to a chapter entitled her orgasm lynley smiled wryly he liked the subtle touch at the table sergeant havers was opening her notebook she produced a pencil from her shoulder bag and looked at lynley expectantly on the bed thorsson yawned lynley turned from the bookcase elena weaver saw a lot of you he said thorsson blinked hardly a cause for suspicion inspector i was one of her supervisors but you saw her outside of her supervisions did i youd been to her room more than once i understand speculatively and as obviously as possible lynley ran his eyes the length of the bed did she have her supervisions in here mr thorsson yes but at the table i find that young ladies do far better thinking on their bums than on their backs thorsson chuckled i can see where youre heading inspector let me put your mind at rest i dont seduce school girls even when they invite seduction is that what elena did they come in here and sit with their pretty legs spread and i get the message it happens all the time but i dont take them up on it he yawned again i admit ive had three or four of them once theyve graduated but theyre adults by then and they know the score proper a bit of dirty hard cock for the weekend thats all then off they go warm and tingly with no questions asked and no commitments made we have a good timethey probably have a far better time than i to be frankand thats the end of it lynley wasnt blind to the fact that thorsson hadnt answered his question the other man was continuing cambridge senior fellows who have affairs with school girls fit a profile inspector and it never varies if youre looking for someone likely to stuff elena look for middleaged look for married look for unattractive look for generally miserable and outstandingly stupid someone completely unlike you havers said from the table thorsson ignored her im not a madman im not interested in being ruined and thats whats in store for any djavlar typ who makes a mess of himself with an undergraduatemale or female the scandals enough to make him miserable for years why do i have the impression that scandal wouldnt bother you in the least mr thorsson lynley asked havers added did you actually harass her for sex mr thorsson thorsson turned onto his side he put his eyes on havers and kept them there contempt drew down the corners of his mouth you went to see her thursday night havers said why to keep her from doing what she threatened shed do i dont imagine you much wanted her to give your name over to the master of the college so what did she tell you had she already filed a formal complaint for harassment or were you hoping to stop her from doing that youre a fucking stupid cow thorsson replied lynley felt quick anger shoot blood to his muscles but sergeant havers he saw was not reacting instead she twirled an ashtray slowly beneath her fingers studying its contents her expression was bland where do you live mr thorsson lynley asked off the fulbourn road are you married thank god no english women dont exactly heat my blood are you living with someone no did anyone spend the night with you sunday was anyone with you monday morning thorssons eyes danced away for a fractional instant no he said but like most people he did not lie well elena weaver was on the cross country team lynley went on did you know that i might have known i dont recall she ran in the morning did you know that no she called you lenny the lech did you know that no why did you go to see her thursday night i thought we could sort things out if we talked like two adults i discovered i was wrong so you knew she was intending to turn you in for harassing her is that what she told you thursday night thorsson hooted a laugh he dropped his legs over the side of the bed i see the game now youre too late inspector if youre here to sniff up a motive for her murder that one wont do the bitch had already turned me in hes got motive havers said what happens to one of these university blokes if he gets caught with his hands in some pretty things knickers thorsson was fairly clear on that at the least i imagine he finds himself ostracised at the most dismissed no matter its politics ethically the universitys a conservative environment academics wont tolerate one of their fellows becoming entangled with a junior member of his college especially a student hes seeing for supervisions but why would thorsson even care what they thought when dyou think hed ever fi nd the need to go rubbing elbows with his fellow scholars he may not need to rub social elbows with them havers he may not even want to but hes got to rub academic elbows all the time and if his colleagues cut him off hes ruined his chances for advancement here that would be the case for all the senior fellows but i imagine thorsson has a finer line to walk to move along in his career why a shakespearean scholar whos not even english here at cambridge i dare say hes fought hard to get where he is and might fight even harder to keep himself there true enough no matter thorssons superficial disdain for cambridge i cant think hed want to endanger himself hes young enough to have his eye on an eventual professorship probably a chair but thats lost to him if hes involved with a student havers dumped some sugar into her coffee she munched thoughtfully on a toasted teacake at three other steellegged tables in the airy buttery seven junior members of the college huddled over their own midmorning snacks with sunlight from the wall of windows streaking down their backs the presence of lynley and havers did not appear to interest them he had opportunity as well havers pointed out if we discount his claim that he didnt know elena ran in the morning i think we can inspector look how many times her calendar indicates she met with thorsson are we supposed to believe that she never once mentioned the cross country team to him that she never talked about her running what utter rot lynley grimaced at the bitterness of his own coffee it tasted cookedlike a soup he added sugar and borrowed his sergeants spoon if an investigation was pending hed want to put an end to it wouldnt he havers was continuing because once elena weaver came forward to put the thumbscrews to him what was to stop a dozen other sweet young things from doing the same if a dozen other sweet young things even exist if in fact hes guilty at all elena may have charged him with harassing her sergeant but lets not forget that it remained to be proved and it cant be proved now can it havers pointed a knowing finger at him her upper lip curled are you actually taking the male position in this poor lenny thorssons been falsely accused of dandling some girl because he rejected her when she tried to get him to take off his trousers or at least unzip them im not taking any position at all havers im merely gathering facts and the most cogent one is that elena weaver had already turned him in and as a result an investigation was pending look at it rationally hes got motive spelled out in neon lights above his head he may talk like an idiot but he doesnt strike me as a fool he would have known hed be placed at the top of the list of suspects as soon as we learned about him so if he did kill her i imagine hed have set himself up with an ironclad alibi dont you no i dont she waved her teacake at him one of its raisins dropped with a plop into her coffee she ignored it and continued i think hes clever enough to know wed be having a conversation just like this he knew wed be saying hes a cambridge don hes a far sight off dim hed never kill elena weaver and hand himself over to the rozzers on a platter now would he and look at us will you playing right into his hands she bit into her teacake her jaws worked it furiously lynley had to admit that there was a certain skewed logic to what havers was suggesting still he didnt like the fire with which she suggested it that hot edge of feeling nearly always implied a loss of objectivity the bane of effective policework he had encountered it too often in himself to let it go ignored in his partner he knew the source of her anger but to address it directly would be to give a distinction to thorssons words that was undeserved he sought another tack he would know about the ceephone in her room theres that and according to miranda elena left the room prior to the time justine received the call if hed been in her room beforeand he admits that he hadthen he probably knew how to use the phone as well so he could have made the call to the weavers now youre onto something havers said but unless sheehans forensic team give us trace evidence that we can connect to thorsson unless we can pin down the weapon used to beat the girl before she was strangled and unless we can connect that weapon to thorsson weve got nothing much more than our natural dislike of him and weve plenty of that in spades he shoved his coffee cup to one side what we need is a witness havers to the killing to something to anything he stood lets look up this woman who found the body if nothing else at least well fi nd out what she was planning to paint in the fog havers drained her coffee cup and wiped the greasy crumbs from her hands onto a paper napkin she headed for the door shrugging into her coat with her two scarves dragging along the floor behind her he said nothing else until they were outside on the terrace above north court and even then he chose his words carefully havers as to what thorsson said to you she looked at him blankly what he said sir lynley felt an odd strip of sweat on the back of his neck most of the time he didnt give a thought to the fact that his partner was a woman at the moment however that fact couldnt be avoided in his room havers the he sought a euphemism the bovine reference bo under her thick fringe of hair her brow creased in perplexity oh bovine you mean when he called me a cow ahyes even as he said it lynley wondered what on earth he could possibly come up with to soothe her feelings he neednt have worried she chuckled quietly dont give it a thought inspector when an ass calls me a cow i always consider the source and whats this one christian lady helen asked she held up a piece of the large wooden puzzle that lay on the floor between them carved from mahogany oak fir and birch it was a softly hued map of the united states a gift to the twins on their fourth birthday sent from america by their aunt iris lady helens oldest sister the puzzle reflected lady iris taste more than it said anything about her devotion to her niece and nephew quality and durability helen thats what one looks for she would say stolidly as if in the expectation that christian and perdita would be playing with toys right into their dotage bright colours would have attracted the children more strongly they certainly would have gone further to hold their attention but after a few false starts lady helen had managed to turn putting the puzzle together into a game which christian was playing like a zealot as his sister watched perdita sat snugly against lady helens side her thin legs splayed out in front of her her scuffed shoes pointed northeast and northwest cafilornia christian announced triumphantly after spending a moment studying the shape his aunt held for him he beat his feet on the floor and crowed he was always successful with the oddly shaped states oklahoma texas florida utah no problem there but wyoming colorado and north dakota were blatant invitations to a fi t of temper wonderful and its capital is new york lady helen laughed sacramento silly face sackermenno quite now put it in do you know where it goes after a futile attempt to pound it into the spot left for florida christian slid it across the board to the opposite coast nother auntie leen he said i can do more she selected the smallest piece and held it up wisely christian squinted down at the map he plunged his finger into the empty spot to the east of connecticut here he announced yes but can you name it here here are you stalling darling auntie leen here next to lady helen perdita stirred roseila she whispered roads island christian shrieked with a whoop of triumph he lunged for the state which his aunt still held and the capital lady helen kept the puzzle piece away from him come along you knew it yesterday lantic ocean he bellowed lady helen smiled close enough i suppose christian tugged the piece from her fingers and smashed it into the puzzle face downward when it didnt fit he tried it upside down he pushed his sister away when she leaned forward to help him saying i cn do it perdy and managing to get it right on a third clumsy stickyhanded try nother he demanded before lady helen could accommodate him the front door opened and harry rodger entered the house he glanced into the sitting room his eyes lingering on the baby who kicked and burbled on a heavy quilt next to perdita on the fl oor hullo everyone he said as he took off his overcoat got a kiss for dad squealing christian barrelled across the room he flung himself against his fathers legs perdita didnt move rodger swung his son up kissed him noisily on the cheek and set him back on the fl oor he pretended to paddle him demanding have you been bad chris have you been a bad boy christian shrieked with glee lady helen felt perdita shrink closer beside her and glanced down to see that she was sucking her thumb eyes fixed on her sister fi ngers kneading her palm were doing a puzzle christian told his father auntie leen n me and what about perdita is she helping you no perdita wont play but auntie leen and i play come see christian dragged on his fathers hand urging him into the sitting room lady helen tried to feel neither anger nor aversion as her brotherinlaw joined them he hadnt come home last night he hadnt bothered to phone and those two facts eradicated whatever sympathy she might have felt upon looking at him and seeing that whether the illness was of the body or the spirit he was obviously unwell his eyes looked yellow his face was unshaven his lips were chapped if he wasnt sleeping at home he certainly didnt look as if he were sleeping anywhere else cafilornia christian poked at the puzzle see daddy nevada puta utah harry rodger said automatically and to lady helen hows everything here then lady helen was acutely aware of the presence of the children especially of perdita quivering against her she was also aware of her own need to rail at her brotherinlaw but she said merely fine harry how lovely to see you he responded with a vague smile right ill leave you to it then patting christian on the head he left the room escaping in the direction of the kitchen christian began to wail immediately lady helen felt herself growing hot she said its all right christian let me see about your lunch will you stay here with perdita and little sister for a moment show perdita how to put the puzzle together i want daddy he screamed lady helen sighed how well she had come to understand that fact she turned the puzzle over and dumped it onto the floor saying look chris but he began fl inging pieces into the fireplace they splattered into the ashes under the grate and spewed clouds of debris out onto the carpet his screams grew louder rodger stuck his head back into the room for gods sake helen cant you shut him up lady helen snapped she sprang to her feet stalked across the room and shoved her brotherinlaw back into the kitchen she closed the door upon christians wailing if rodger was surprised by her sudden vehemence he did not react to it he merely went back to the work top where he had been in the process of going through the collection of two days post he held a letter up to the light squinted at it discarded it picked up another whats going on harry she demanded he looked her way briefly before returning to the post what on earth are you talking about im talking about you im talking about my sister shes upstairs by the way you might want to look in on her before you trot back to the college i take it that you are trotting back arent you somehow this visit doesnt quite have the aura of permanence round it ive a lecture at two and after that im attending formal dinner tonight and really helen you are beginning to sound rather drearily like pen lady helen marched to him ripped the stack of letters from his hand and threw them on the work top how dare you she said you egocentric little worm do you think were all of us here for your convenience how astute you are helen penelope spoke from the doorway i wouldnt have thought it she halted her way into the room one hand against the wall and the other folded into the throat of her dressing gown two streaks of damp from her swollen breasts discoloured the pink material turning it fuchsia harrys eyes fell on these before shifting away dont like the sight penelope asked him too real for you harry not quite what you wanted rodger went back to his letters dont start pen she gave a wavering laugh i didnt start this correct me if im wrong but you were the one wasnt that you all those days all those nights talking and urging theyre like a gift pen our gift to the world but if one of them should diethat was you wasnt it and you wont let me forget it will you for the last six months youve been taking your revenge well fine then do it i cant stop you but i can decide not to stay for the abuse penelope laughed again more weakly this time she leaned for support against the refrigerator door one hand climbed to her hair which lay limp and oily against her neck harry how amusing if you want some abuse climb into this body oh but you did that didnt you any number of times were not going to talk about it why because my sisters here and you dont want her to know because the children are playing in the other room because the neighbours might notice if i scream loud enough harry slapped down his letters envelopes slithered across the work top dont put this on me you made up your mind because you gave me no peace i didnt even feel like a woman any longer you wouldnt even touch me if i didnt agree to no harry shouted god damn it pen you could have said no i was just a sow wasnt i fodder for the rut thats not quite accurate sows wallow in the mud not in selfpity stop it lady helen said in the sitting room christian shrieked the thin wail of the baby joined in his cries something hit the wall with a tremendous clatter suggesting the body of the puzzle being hurled in a rage just look at what youre doing to them harry rodger said take a good long look he headed for the door and what are you doing penelope shrilled model father model husband model lecturer model saint running away as usual working up your revenge she hasnt let me have it for the last six months so ill make her pay now when shes weak and ill and i can get her a good one just the moment when i can best let her know what a nothing she is he whirled to face her ive had it with you its time you decided what you want instead of constantly digging into me for what you have before she could answer he was gone a moment later the front door slammed christian howled the baby cried in response fresh growing wet spots seeped through penelopes dressing gown she began to weep i dont want this life lady helen felt an answering rush of pity tears stung her eyes never had she felt so at a loss for something to say that might comfort for the first time she understood her sisters long silences her vigils at the window and her wordless weeping but what she could not understand was the initial act that had brought penelope to this point it constituted a kind of surrender so foreign to her that she found herself recoiling from its signifi cance she went to her sister took her into her arms penelope stiffened no dont touch me im leaking all over its the baby lady helen continued to hold her she tried to frame a question and wondered where to start and what she could ask that would not betray her growing anger the fact that her rage was multidirectional served to make the act of concealing it only that much more diffi cult she felt it first for harry and for the needs of ego that would prompt a man to urge for the breeding of another child as if what was being created were a demonstration of the fathers virility and not an individual with decided needs of its own she felt it also for her sister and for the fact that she had given in to that sense of duty inbred in women from the beginning of time a duty which told them that the possession of a functioning womb necessarily served as a definition of self the initial decision to have childrenone which no doubt had been made with joy and commitment by both penelope and her husbandhad proved her sisters undoing for in leaving behind her career to care for the twins she had over time allowed herself to become a dependent a woman who believed she had to hold onto her man so when he had made the request for another child she had acquiesced she had done her duty after all what better way to keep him than to give him what he wanted that none of this had been necessary that all of it rose from her sisters inability or unwillingness to challenge the constrictive definition of womanhood to which she had decided to adhere served to make her current situation even more untenable for penelope was wise enough at the heart of the matter to know that she was assenting to living a life in which she did not believe and that was undoubtedly a large part of the wretchedness she was now experiencing her husbands parting words had instructed her to make a decision but until she learned to redefi ne herself circumstances and not penelope would do the deciding her sister sobbed against her shoulder lady helen held her and tried to murmur comfort i cant stand it penelope wept im suffocating im nothing i dont have an identity im just a machine youre a mother lady helen thought while in the next room christian continued to scream it was noon when lynley and havers pulled to a stop on the twisting high street of the village of grantchester a collection of houses pubs a church and a vicarage separated from cambridge by the universitys rugby fi elds and a long stretch of farmland lying fallow for the winter behind a hawthorn hedgerow that was beginning to brown the address on the police report had looked decidedly vague sarah gordon the school grantchester but once they reached the village lynley realised that no further information was going to be necessary for between a row of thatched cottages and the red lion pub stood a hazelcoloured brick building with bright red woodwork and numerous skylights set into a pitched tile roof from one of the pillars that stood on either side of the driveway hung a bronzelettered sign that said merely the school not bad digs havers commented shouldering open her door your basic loving renovation of an historical property ive always hated people with the patience for preservation who is she anyway an artist of some sort well find out the rest the space for the original front door now accommodated four panels of glass through which they could see lofty white walls part of a sofa and the blue glass shade of an arching brass floorlamp when they slammed the car doors and started to walk up the drive a dog came to these windows and began to yap wildly the new front door was set towards the rear of the building recessed into part of a low covered passage which connected the house to the garage as they approached it was opened by a slender woman wearing faded jeans a mansized work shirt of ivory wool and a rosecoloured towel like a turban on her head one hand held this in place as with the other she restrained her dog a scruffy mongrel with lopsided earsone at attention and the other at easeand a thatch of khaki hair fl opping into its eyes dont be afraid he never bites she said as the dog tried to lunge away from the hold she had on his collar he just likes visitors and to the dog flame sit a mild command which he blithely ignored his tail wagged frantically lynley produced his warrant card introducing himself and havers he said youre sarah gordon wed like to talk to you about yesterday morning at the request her dark eyes seemed to grow even darker for an instant although it may have been the result of her movement into a shadow cast by the overhanging roof i dont know what more i can add inspector i told the police as much as i could yes i know ive read the report but i fi nd it sometimes helps to hear everything fi rsthand if you dont mind of course please come in she stepped back from the door flame made a leap of happy greeting in lynleys direction planting mittsized paws against his thighs sarah gordon said no flame stop it at once and pulled the dog back she picked him uphe was a frantic squirming tailwagging armfuland carried him into the room they had seen from the street where she put him into a basket to one side of the fireplace saying stay and patting him on the head his eager glance darted from lynley to havers to his mistress when he saw that everyone intended to remain in the room with him he gave one more delighted bark and settled his chin on his paws sarah went to the fireplace where a haphazard stack of wood was burning it crackled and popped as the flames hit pockets of resin and sap she threw on another piece before turning to face them was this actually a school lynley asked her she looked surprised obviously she had expected him to plunge directly into her discovery of elena weavers corpse on the previous morning nonetheless she smiled glanced around and answered the village school yes it was quite a mess when i bought it did you remodel it yourself a room here and there when i could afford it and when i had the time its largely fi nished now except for the back garden thisshe extended her hand to indicate the room in which they stoodwas the last a bit different from what one would expect to see inside a building of this age i suppose but thats why i like it as havers began unwrapping the first of her scarves from her throat lynley glanced around the room was indeed an unexpected pleasure with its extensive display of lithographs and oils their subjects were people children adolescents old men playing cards an elderly woman looking out a window their compositions were figurative and metaphorical at once their colours were pure and bright and true in combination with a bleached oak fl oor and an oatmeal sofa the overall effect of a room filled with this much art should have been much like a museum and just about as friendly but as if with the intention of easing the unwelcoming nature of her environment sarah gordon had draped a red mohair blanket across the back of the sofa and covered the floor with a motley braided rug if this were not enough to declare the room lived in a copy of the guardian was spread out in front of the fireplace a sketch box and easel lay near the door and the airmost unmuseumlike of allbore the unmistakable rich odour of chocolate this seemed to be emanating from a thick green jug on the bar at one end of the room it sat next to a mug a trail of steam rose from both seeing the direction of his gaze sarah gordon said its cocoa an antidepressant i find ive needed rather a lot of it since yesterday may i offer you some he shook his head sergeant havers demurred and went to sit on the sofa where she dropped her scarves shed her coat and wrestled her notebook from her shoulder bag a large orange cat materialising from behind the open front curtains leaped agilely to join her and settled paws working directly on her lap sarah fetched her cup of cocoa and hurried to havers rescue sorry she said scooping the cat under one arm she herself took a place at the other end of the sofa putting her back to the light she buried her free hand in the cats thick fur the otherraising the cocoa to her lipstrembled noticeably she spoke as if with the need to excuse this ive never seen a dead body before no thats not absolutely true ive seen people in coffins but thats after theyve been scoured washed and painted by an undertaker i suppose thats the only way we can bear death isnt it if it looks like a modestly altered state of life but this otherid like to forget that i saw her but she seems to be branded right into my brain she touched the towel wrapped round her head ive taken five showers since yesterday morning ive washed my hair three times why am i doing that lynley sat in an armchair opposite the sofa he didnt bother to try to frame an answer to the question everyones reaction to an exposure to violent death was peculiar to his individual personality hed known young detectives who wouldnt bathe until a case was solved others who wouldnt eat still others who wouldnt sleep and while the vast majority of them became immune to death over time seeing a murder investigation merely as a job to be done the layman never saw it that way the layman took it personally like a deliberate insult no one wanted a sudden reminder of lifes grim and remarkable transiency he said tell me about yesterday morning sarah placed the mug on a side table and buried her other hand in the cats fur it didnt seem so much a gesture of affection as a means of holding onto something for solace or support with typical feline sensitivity the cat apparently knew this for his ears fl attened and he gave a throaty growl which sarah ignored she began to pet him he attempted to launch himself in the direction of the fl oor she said silk be good and tried to hold onto him but he yowled once spit and jumped off her lap sarah looked stricken she watched the cat stroll over to the fi re where completely indifferent to his act of desertion he settled himself on the newspaper and began to wash his face cats havers said in eloquent explanation arent they just exactly like men sarah appeared to evaluate the comment gravely for its merit she sat as if she held the cat in her lap slightly bent forward her hands on her thighs it was a particularly selfprotective position yesterday morning she said if you will lynley said she went through the facts quickly adding very little to what lynley had read in the police report unable to sleep she had risen at a quarter past five she had dressed eaten a bowl of cereal she had read most of the previous days paper she had sorted through and gathered up her equipment she had arrived at fen causeway shortly before seven she had gone onto the island to do some sketches of crusoes bridge she had found the body i stepped on her she said iits awful to think about i realise now that i should have wanted to help her i should have tried to see if she was still alive but i didnt where was she exactly at the side of a small clearing towards the south end of the island you didnt notice her at once she reached for her cocoa and cradled the mug between her hands no id gone there to do some sketching and i was intent upon getting something done id not workedno let me be truthful for once id not produced anything of possible meritin a number of months i felt inadequate and paralysed and id been harbouring a tremendous fear that id lost it altogether it talent inspector creativity passion inspiration what you will over time id grown to believe it was gone so i decided a number of weeks ago to stop procrastinating i was determined to put an end to busying myself with projects round the housebeing afraid of failure reallyand to start working again i chose yesterday as the day she appeared to anticipate lynleys next question for she went on with it was just an arbitrary choice of days actually i felt if i marked the calendar id be making a commitment i thought if i chose the date in advance i could begin again without any further false starts it was important to me lynley looked round the room again more carefully this time studying the collection of lithographs and oils he couldnt help comparing them to the watercolours he had seen in anthony weavers house those had been clever nicely executed safe these were a challenge both in colour and design this is all your work he said a statement not a question for it was obvious that everything had been created by the same gifted hand she used her cocoa mug to point towards one of the walls this is all my work yes none of it recent but all of it mine lynley allowed himself to revel in an instants gratification which rose from the knowledge that he couldnt have been handed a better potential witness artists were trained observers they couldnt create without observation if there had been something to see on the island an object out of kilter a shadow worth noticing sarah gordon would have seen it leaning forward he said tell me what you recall about the island itself sarah looked into her cocoa as if replaying the scene there well it was foggy very wet tree leaves were actually dripping the boat repair sheds were closed the bridge had been repainted i remember noticing that because of the way it caught the light and there was she hesitated her expression thoughtful near the gate it was quite muddy and the mud waschurned up id call it furrowed actually as if a body had been dragged through it heels to the ground i suppose and there was rubbish on the ground by a fallen branch and she looked up i think i saw the remains of a fire as well there by the branch in front of it yes and on the ground what sort of rubbish cigarette packs mostly a few newspapers a large wine bottle a sack yes there was an orange sack from peter dominic i remember that could someone have spent some time waiting for the girl he ignored the question saying anything else the lights from the peterhouse lantern cupola i could see them from the island anything that you heard nothing out of the ordinary birds a dog i think somewhere in the fen it all seemed perfectly normal to me except that the fog was heavy but youll have been told that you heard no sound from the river like a boat someone rowing away no im sorry her shoulders sagged a bit i wish i could give you something more i feel monumentally egocentric when i was on the island i was thinking only of my drawing im still thinking mostly of my drawing in fact what an ugly little item in my personal makeup unusual to go sketching in the fog havers noted she had been writing rapidly but now she looked up addressing their prime interest in coming to speak to the woman what sort of artist goes sketching in the fog sarah didnt disagree it was more than unusual it was a little bit mad and anything i might have managed to create wouldnt exactly be like the rest of my work would it there was truth in this in addition to the use of bright crisp suninspired colours sarah gordons images all were clearly defined from a group of pakistani children sitting on the worn front steps of a paintpeeling tenement to a nude woman reclining beneath a yellow umbrella not one of them featured the gauzy absence of definition or the lack of hue that drawing in the morning fog suggested not one of them additionally depicted a landscape were you attempting a change in style lynley asked from the potato eaters to sunflowers sarah got to her feet and went to the bar where she poured herself more cocoa flame and silk looked up from their respective positions alert to the possibility of a treat she went to the dog squatted next to him ran her fi ngers across his head his tail thumped appreciatively and he settled his chin back onto his paws she sat on the floor next to his basket crosslegged facing lynley and havers she said i was willing to try just about anything i dont know if you can understand what it feels like to believe you may have lost the ability and the will to create yesas if she expected disagreementthe will because it is an act of will its more than being called upon by some convenient artistic muse its making a decision to offer up a bit of ones essence to the judgement of others as an artist id told myself that i didnt care how my work was evaluated id told myself that the creative actand not how it was received or what anyone did with the finished productwas absolutely paramount but somewhere along the line i stopped believing in that and when one stops believing that the act itself is superior to anyones analysis of it then one becomes immobilised thats what happened to me shades of ruskin and whistler as i recall their story lynley said for some reason she flinched at the allusion ah yes the critic and his victim but at least whistler had his day in court didnt he he did have that much her eyes went from one piece of art to another slowly as if with the need to convince herself that she indeed had been their creator id lost it the passion and without that what you have is only mass the objects themselves paint canvas clay wax stone only passion gives them life otherwise theyre inert oh you may draw or paint or sculpt something anyway people do it all the time but what you draw or paint or sculpt without passion is an exercise in competence and nothing more its not an expression of self and thats what i wanted backthe willingness to be vulnerable the power to feel the ability to risk if it meant a change in technique an alteration in style a shift in media i was more than willing to try it i was willing to try anything did it work she bent over the dog and rubbed her cheek against the top of his head somewhere in the house the telephone began to ring an answering machine switched on a moment later the low tones of a mans voice floated to them leaving a message that was indistinguishable from where they sat sarah seemed indifferent both to the identity of her caller and to the fact of the call itself she said i hadnt the chance to find out i made several preliminary sketches in one location on the island when they didnt work outthey were dreadful to be honesti went to another spot and stumbled on the body what do you remember of that just that i stepped backwards onto something i thought it was a branch i kicked it aside and saw it was an arm you hadnt noticed the body havers clarifi ed she was covered by leaves my attention was on the bridge i cant say i even watched where i was walking in what direction did you kick her arm lynley asked towards her away from her towards her you didnt touch her other than that god no but i should have done shouldnt i she may have been alive i should have touched her i should have checked but i didnt instead i was sick and then i ran in what direction back the way you came no across coe fen in the fog lynley asked not back the way youd come at the opening of her shirt sarahs chest and neck began to redden id just stumbled upon a girls body inspector i cant say i was feeling very logical at the time i ran across the bridge and through coe fen theres a path that comes out next to the department of engineering thats where id left my car you drove from there to the police station i just kept running down lensfi eld road across parkers piece it isnt very far but you could have driven i could have done yes she offered no defence she looked at her painting of the pakistani children flame stirred beneath her hand and gave a gusty sigh roused she said i wasnt thinking clearly id been in a welter of nerves already because id gone to the island in order to draw to draw you see to do something id been unable to do for months that was everything to me so when i found the body i simply didnt think i should have seen if the girl was still alive i should have tried to help her i should have kept to the paved path i should have driven my car to the police station i know all that im fi lled with shoulds i have no excuse for behaving as i did except that i panicked and believe me i feel wretched enough about that at the department of engineering were there lights on she looked back at him although her eyes didnt focus she seemed to be trying to conjure up a picture of the events in her mind lights i think so but i cant be certain did you see anyone on the island no and not on the fen there was too much fog i passed some bicyclists when i got to lensfield road and there was traffi c of course but thats all i remember how did you come to choose the island why didnt you do your sketching here in grantchester especially once you saw the fog in the morning the red flush on her skin deepened in hue as if aware of this she raised her hand to the neck of her shirt and played with the material in her fingers until she had buttoned it i dont know how to explain it to you except to say that id chosen the day id planned in advance on the island and to do anything less than what i planned seemed like admitting defeat and running away i didnt want to do that i just couldnt face it it sounds pathetic rigid and obsessive but thats the way it was she got to her feet come with me she said theres really only one way that you might understand completely leaving her cocoa and her animals behind she led them to the rear of the house where she pushed open a door that was only partially closed and admitted them into her studio it was a large bright room whose ceiling comprised four rectangular skylights lynley paused before entering letting his eyes wander over everything seeing how the room acted as mute corroboration to all that sarah gordon had told them the walls were hung with enormous charcoal sketchesa human torso a disembodied arm two interlocking nudes a mans face in threequarter profileall the sort of preliminary studies an artist does before setting out upon a new work but instead of acting as rough ideas for a finished product that was also on display beneath them leaned a score of incomplete canvases project after project begun and discarded a large worktable held a mass of artistic paraphernalia coffee tins fi lled with clean dry brushes like camelhair fl owers bottles of turps linseed oil and damar varnish a box of unused dry pastels more than a dozen handlabelled tubes of paint it should have been a chaotic mess with daubs of paint on the table and smudgy fi ngerprints on the bottles and tins and squeezepoints on the tubes instead everything was arranged as neatly and precisely as if it were on display in a castle museum exhibit devoted to a fanciful dayinthelifeof presentation the air held no odour of paint or turpentine no sketches piled here and there on the floor to make the suggestion of rapid artistic inspiration and equally rapid artistic rejection no finished paintings stood waiting for the varnish that would complete them it was apparent that someone cleaned the room regularly for the bleached oak floor shone as if it were under glass and nowhere was there the slightest sign of dust or dirt just signs of disuse and they were everywhere only a single easel holding a canvas stood covered with a paintsplodged cloth beneath one of the skylights and even it looked as if it hadnt been touched in ages this was once the centre of my world sarah gordon said with simple resignation can you understand inspector i wanted it to be the centre again sergeant havers lynley saw had wandered to one side of the room where above a work top had been built a series of storage shelves these held cartons of carousels for photographic slides dogeared sketch pads fresh containers of pastels a large roll of canvas and a variety of toolsfrom a set of palette knives to a pair of stretching pliers the work top itself was covered by a large sheet of plate glass with a roughened surface to which sergeant havers touched her fi ngertips tentatively a question on her face grinding colours sarah gordon told her thats what its for i used to grind my own colours youre a purist then lynley said she smiled with much the same resignation as he had heard in her voice when i fi rst began to paintthis was years agoi wanted to own each part of the finished piece i wanted to be each painting i even milled the wood to make the stretcher bars for my canvases thats how pure i was going to be you lost that purity success taints everything in the long run and you had success lynley went to the wall where her large charcoal sketches were hanging one on top of the other he began to browse through them an arm a hand the line of jaw a face he was reminded of the queens collection of da vincis studies she was very talented after a fashion yes i had success but that meant less to me than peace of mind and ultimately peace of mind was what i was seeking yesterday morning finding elena weaver put an end to that sergeant havers remarked as lynley was looking through her sketches sarah had gone to stand near the covered easel she had raised a hand to adjust its linen shroudperhaps with the hope of keeping them from seeing how far the quality of her work had disintegratedbut she stopped and said without looking in their direction elena weaver her voice sounded oddly uncertain the dead girl lynley said elena weaver did you know her she turned to them her lips worked without making any sound after a moment she whispered oh no miss gordon her father anthony weaver i know her father she felt for the tall stool at one side of the easel and sat upon it she said oh my god my poor tony and as if answering a question which no one had spoken she gestured round the room he was one of my students until early last spring when he began all the politicking for the penford chair he was one of my students students i offered classes locally for a number of years i dont any longer but tonydr weaver took most of them he was a private student of mine as well so i knew him for a time we were close her eyes filled she blinked the tears away quickly and did you know his daughter after a fashion i met her several times early last michaelmas termwhen he brought her with him to act as a model for a lifedrawing class but you didnt recognise her yesterday how could i i didnt even see her face she lowered her head raised a hand quickly and brushed it over her eyes this is going to destroy him she was everything to him have you talked to him yet is he but of course youve talked to him what am i asking she raised her head is tony all right no one takes well the death of a child but elena was more than a child to him he used to say that she was his hope of redemption she looked round the room her expression fi lling with selfcontempt and here ive beenpoor little sarahwondering if i can begin to draw again wondering if ill ever create another piece of art wondering while all the while tonyhow could i possibly be any more selfi sh youre not to blame for trying to get your career back on track it was he thought the most rational of desires he reflected on the work he had seen hanging in her sitting room it was crisp and clean one somehow expected that of a lithograph but to achieve such purity of line and detail in oil seemed remarkable each imagea child playing with a dog a weary chestnut seller warming himself over his metaldrum brazier a bicyclist pumping along in the rainspoke of assurance in every stroke of the brush what would it be like lynley wondered to believe one had lost the ability to produce work so palpably excellent and how could a desire to recapture that ability ever be construed as an act of selfi shness it seemed odd to him that she would even consider it so and as she led them back to the front of the house lynley became aware of a vague disquiet in his evaluation of her the same sort of disquiet he had felt when confronted with anthony weavers reaction to his daughters death there was something about her something in her manner and her words that gave him pause he couldnt put his fi nger on what it was about her that nagged at his subconscious yet he knew intuitively that something was there like a reaction that was too much planned in advance a moment later she gave him the answer as sarah gordon opened the front door for them flame leaped out of his basket began to bark and came tearing along the passage intent upon a gambol in the outdoors sarah leaned forward grabbed onto his collar as she did so the towel fell from her head and damp curling hair the rich colour of coffee streamed round her shoulders lynley stared at the image of her caught in the doorway it was the hair and the profi le but mostly the hair she was the woman he had seen last night in ivy court sarah headed for the lavatory the moment after she closed and locked the front door with a gasp of urgency she hurried through the sitting room through the kitchen beyond it and barely made it to the toilet she vomited her stomach seemed to twist as previously sweet cocoa hot and sour now burned in her throat it shot up towards her nose when she attempted to breathe she coughed gagged and continued to vomit cold sweat broke out on her forehead the floor seemed to dip the walls to sway she squeezed her eyes shut behind her she heard a soft whimper of sympathy a nudge on her leg followed it then a head rested on one of her extended arms and warm breath wafted against her cheek its all right flame she said im all right dont worry have you brought silk with you sarah chuckled weakly at the thought of the cats developing a sudden change in personality cats were so like people compassion and empathy were not exactly in their line but dogs were different blindly she reached for the mongrel and turned her face towards him she heard his tail thump against the wall he licked her nose she was struck by the thought that it didnt matter to flame who she was what shed done what shed managed to create or whether she made a single lasting contribution to life at all it didnt matter to flame if she never put brush to canvas again and there was comfort in that she wanted to feel it she tried to believe that there was nothing more in her life which she had to do the last spasm passed her stomach settled uneasily she got to her feet and went to the basin where she rinsed her mouth raised her head and caught sight of her reflection in the mirror she raised a hand to her face traced the lines on her forehead the incipient creases from her nose to her mouth the matrix of small scarlike wrinkles just above her lower jaw only thirtynine she looked at least fi fty worse she felt sixty she turned from the sight in the kitchen she ran the water against her wrists until it felt cold then she drank from the tap splashed her face again and dried it on a yellow tea towel she thought about brushing her teeth or trying to get some sleep but it seemed like too much trouble to climb the stairs to her room and far too much trouble to smear toothpaste onto a brush and run it energetically round her mouth instead she went back to the sitting room where the fi re still burned and silk still basked in uninterested contentment before it flame followed returning to his basket from which he watched her throw more wood on the fi re through his bushy fur she could see that hed scrunched up his face in what she always thought of as his worried expression turning his eyes into shapes like roughly modifi ed diamonds im all right she told him really its true he didnt look convincedafter all he knew the truth since hed witnessed most of it and shed told him the restbut he made four revolutions in his basket dug around in his blanket and sank into its folds his eyelids began to droop at once good she said have a bit of a kip she was grateful that at least one of them could to distract herself from the idea of sleep and from everything that conspired to keep her from sleeping she went to the window it seemed that with every foot away from the fire the temperature in the room dropped another ten degrees and while she knew that this couldnt possibly be the case her arms went round herself anyway she looked outside the car was still there sleek silver it winked in the sun for the second time she wondered if they had really been the police when shed first opened the front door to them shed thought theyd come with a request to see her work that hadnt happened in ages and never without an appointment but it seemed the only reasonable explanation for the appearance of two strangers whod arrived in a bentley theyd been mismatched as a couple the man tall handsome in a refined sort of way astonishingly welldressed and possessing an unmistakably public school voice the woman short quite plain looking more thrown together than sarah herself was with an accent that bore the distinct infl ections of the working class still even for a few minutes after they had identifi ed themselves sarah continued to think of them as man and wife it was easier to talk to them that way but no matter her story they hadnt believed her she could see it in their faces and who could blame them why would anyone run across coe fen in the fog instead of dashing back the way shed come why would someone who had just found a body tear by her own car and sprint to the police station instead of simply driving there it didnt make sense she knew that very well and so did they which went far to explain why the bentley was still parked in front of her house the police officers themselves were not in sight theyd be questioning her neighbours verifying her story dont think of it sarah she forced herself away from the window and went back to the studio on a table near the door her answering machine stood blinking to announce a message on the tape she stared at it for a moment before she remembered having heard the phone ringing while she was talking to the police she pressed the button to play sarah darling ive got to see you i know i have no right to ask youve not forgiven me i dont deserve forgiveness ill never deserve it but i need to see you i need to talk to you youre the only one who knows me completely who understands who has the compassion and tenderness and he began to weep i was parked in front of your house most of sunday evening i could see you through the window and imonday i came by but i didnt have the courage to come to the door and nowsarah please elenas been murdered please see me please phone me at the college leave a message ill do anything please see me i beg you i need you sarah numbly she listened as the unit switched itself off feel something she told herself but nothing stirred in her heart she pressed the back of her hand to her mouth and bit on it hard and then a second time and a third and a fourth until she tasted the vague salinity of her blood rather than the chalk and lotion of her skin she forced a memory forward something anything it didnt matter what it merely had to suffice as a smokescreen to keep her mind occupied with thoughts she could bear to face douglas hampson her foster brother seventeen years old wanting him to notice her wanting him to talk to her wanting him that musty shed at the bottom of his parents garden in kings lynn where even the smell from the sea couldnt supplant the odours of compost mulch and manure but they hadnt cared had they she desperate for an indication of someones approval and affection he eager to do it because he was seventeen and randy and if he returned from one more school holiday without having had a good roger to talk about with his mates hed never live it down theyd chosen a day when the sun beat down on the streets and the pavements and most especially on the old tin roof of that garden shed hed kissed her with his tongue and as she wondered if this was what people called making lovebecause she was only twelve and although she should have known at least something about what men and women actually did with those parts of their bodies that were so different from each others she didnt at allhe grappled first with her shorts then with her knickers and all the time he breathed like a dog whos had a good run it was over quickly he was hard and hot and she wasnt ready so there was nothing in it for her but blood suffocation and searing pain and douglas stifling a groan when he came he stood up immediately afterwards cleaning himself on her shorts and tossing them back to her he zipped his jeans and said this place smells like a toilet ive got to get out of here and out he went he didnt answer her letters he responded with silence when she phoned the school and wept out a tedious declaration of her love of course she hadnt loved him at all but she had to believe that she did for nothing else excused that mindless invasion of her body which she had allowed without protest on that summer afternoon in her studio sarah moved away from the answering machine for a smokescreen memory she couldnt have chosen better than to conjure douglas hampson up out of the pit he wanted her now fortyfour years old twenty years married an insurance adjuster well on his way into midlife crisis he wanted her now come on sarah he would say when they met for lunch as they often did i cant just sit here and look at you and pretend i dont want you come on lets do it were friends shed respond youre my brother doug bugger the brother business you didnt think about that once and she would smile at him fondly because she was fond of him nowand not try to explain what that once had cost her it was not enoughthe memory of douglas in spite of herself she moved across the studio to the covered easel and gazed at the portrait shed begun all those months ago to act as companion piece to the other shed intended it as a christmas present for him she hadnt yet known there would be no christmas he was leaning forward as she so often had seen him one elbow on his knee his spectacles dangling from his fingers his face was lit with the zeal which always came upon him when he talked about art his head cocked to one side himself caught in the act of arguing a fine point of composition he looked boyish and happy a man living fully for the fi rst time in his life he wore no threepiece suit but a paintsplattered work shirt with half the collar turned up and a rip in the cuff and as often as not when she stood close in front of him to study the way the light hit his hair hed reach out and pull her to him and laugh at her protest which wasnt much of a protest and hold her in his arms his mouth on her neck and his hands on her breasts and the painting forgotten in the shedding of clothes and the way he looked at her beautifying her body every moment of the act his eyes upon hers and his voice that whisper oh my god my dear love sarah steeled herself against the force of the memory and made herself evaluate the painting as a simple piece of art she thought about finishing it dwelling on the idea of a possible exhibition and of finding a way to put paint to canvas and making it mean something beyond a neophytes obedient exercise in technique she could do it after all she was a painter she reached towards the easel her hands were shaking she drew them back fists clenched into balls even if she filled her mind with a dozen other thoughts her body still betrayed her at the end of everything it would neither avoid nor deny she looked back at the answering machine heard his voice and his plea but her hands still trembled her legs felt hollow and her mind had to accept what her body was telling her there are things far worse than finding a dead body lynley was just tucking into his shepherds pie when sergeant havers came into the pub the temperature had begun to fall outside and the wind to rise and havers had reacted to the weather accordingly wrapping one of her scarves three times round her head and pulling up the other to cover her mouth and nose she looked like a bandit from iceland she paused in the doorway eyes sweeping over the considerableand boisterous lunchtime crowd seated beneath the collection of antique scythes hoes and pitchforks which decorated the pub walls she nodded in lynleys direction when she saw him and went to the bar where she divested herself of her outer garments ordered her meal and lit a cigarette tonic water in one hand and a bag of vinegar crisps in the other she wove her way through the tables and joined him in the corner her cigarette dangled between her lips growing ash she dumped her coat and scarves next to his on the bench and slumped into a chair facing him she shot a look of irritation at the stereo speaker directly above them which was currently offering killing me softly by roberta flack at a disturbing volume havers was no lover of musical trips down memory lane over the din created by music conversation and clattering crockery lynley said its better than guns and roses only just havers replied using her teeth for a start she tore open her crisps and spent the next few moments munching while her cigarettes smoke wafted into lynleys face he looked at it meaningfully sergeant she scowled i wish youd take it up again wed get on better if you did and i thought we were marching blissfully arminarm towards retirement marching yes i dont know about bliss she moved the ashtray to one side it began offering its smoke to a bluehaired woman with six noticeable hairs growing out of her chin from the table she was sharing with a threelegged wheezing corgi and a gentleman in only marginally better condition she scathed havers with a glare over the top of her gin and bitters havers muttered in defeat took a final hit of the cigarette and crushed it out so lynley said she picked a piece of tobacco off her tongue she checks out completely with two of her neighbours the woman next doorshe grabbed her notebook from her shoulder bag and flipped it opena mrs stamfordmrs hugo stamford she insisted and spelled it out just in case id fluffed my olevels she saw her loading up the boot of her car sometime round seven yesterday morning in a real hurry mrs stamford said preoccupied as well because when she went out for the morning milk she called a hello but sarah didnt hear her thenshe turned the notebook to read it sidewaysa bloke called norman davies who lives across the road he saw her fly by in her car round seven as well he remembers because he was walking his collie and the dog was doing its business on the pavement instead of in the street our norman was all in a flutter about that he didnt want sarah to think hed just blithely allow mr jeffriesthats the dogto foul the footpath he nattered on for a bit about her being in the car in the first place not good for her he wanted me to know she needs to get back to walking she was always a walker whats happened to the gel whats she doing in the car he didnt much like your motor by the way gave it a bit of a sneer and said whoever drove it is sending the country straight to arabdominated oil hell never mind the north sea quite a talker im lucky i got away before teatime lynley nodded but didnt reply whats up she asked him havers im not sure he said nothing more as a teenaged girl dressed like one of richard cricks milkmaids delivered the sergeants meal to the table it was cod peas and chips which havers doused thoroughly with vinegar while she eyed the waitress and said shouldnt you be in school im old for my looks the girl replied she wore a large garnet stud through her right nostril havers snorted right she dug into her fish the girl disappeared with a fl ounce of her petticoats havers said in reference to his last comment i dont like the sound of that inspector ive got the feeling youre keyed in to sarah gordon she looked up from her food as if in the expectation of reply when he said nothing she went on with i expect its because of that st cecilia business once you found out shes an artist you decided that she arranged the body unconsciously no its not that then what im sure i saw her last night at st stephens college and i cant account for it havers lowered her fork she sipped some tonic water and scraped a paper napkin across her mouth now thats an interesting bit where was she lynley told her about the woman who had emerged from the shadows of the graveyard while he watched from his window i couldnt get a clear look at her he admitted but the hairs the same sos the profile id swear to it what would she have been doing there youre nowhere near elena weavers room are you no ivy courts used by the senior fellows its mostly studies where professors do their work and hold supervisions so what would she my guess is that anthony weavers rooms are there havers and if thats the caseand ill check it out after lunchi should imagine that she went to see him havers forked up a generous portion of chips and peas chewed on them thoughtfully before replying are we doing some serious quantum leaping here inspector going from a to z with twentyfour letters unaccounted for who else would she have gone to see how about practically anyone in the college better yet how about the possibility that it wasnt sarah gordon just someone with dark hair it could have been lennart thorsson if he didnt get in the light the colours not right but hes got hair enough for two women but this was clearly someone who didnt want to be seen even if it was thorsson why would he have been hiding why would she for that matter havers returned to her fish she took a bite chewed and pointed her fork in his direction okay im easy lets play it your way lets say anthony weavers study is there lets say sarah gordon went to see him she said hed been her student so we know she knew him she was calling him tony so lets say she knew him well she admitted as much what have we got then sarah gordon going to offer her former studenta friendsome words of comfort upon the death of his daughter she lowered her fork rested it on the edge of her plate and offered the counterpoint to her own argument except that she didnt know his daughter was dead she didnt know the body shed found was elena weavers until we told her this morning and even if she did know who it was and lied to us about it for some reason if she wanted to offer weaver condolences why didnt she go to his house havers speared up a soaking chip all right lets change the story perhaps sarah gordon and anthonytony weaver have been boffing each other on an ongoing basis you know the sort of thing mutual passion for art leading to mutual passion for each other monday night was one of their previously arranged assignations theres your reason for her stealth she didnt know it was elena weaver shed found and she was showing up for a bit of the regular go all things considered weaver wouldnt have had the presence of mind to phone her up and cancel their session so she got to his roomsif they are his roomsonly to find he wasnt there if they had an assignation wouldnt she have waited for at least a few minutes more importantly wouldnt she have a key to his rooms to let herself in how do you know she doesnt have a key because she was in and out in less than five minutes sergeant id say two minutes at the very most does that suggest unlocking a door and having a bit of a wait for your lover and why on earth would they meet in his rooms in the first place on his own admission he has a graduate student working there beyond that hes been shortlisted for a prestigious chair in history which i dont imagine hed care to jeopardise by having at a woman whos not his wife right there in the college selection committees tend to be peculiar about that sort of thing if a love affairs at the heart of this why wouldnt weaver just go to see her in grantchester what are we saying here inspector lynley pushed his plate to one side how often does it happen that the finder of the body turns out to be the killer just trying to cover his tracks about as often as the killer turns out to be a member of the immediate family havers forked up more fi sh piled two chips on top of it she regarded him shrewdly perhaps you might tell me exactly where youre heading because her neighbours have just got through clearing her no matter what you say and im getting that westerbrae feeling of discomfort with where youre leading us if you know what i mean he did havers had ample reason to question his ability to remain objective he sought to justify his leery feelings about the artist sarah gordon finds the body she appears at weavers rooms that night i dont like the coincidence what coincidence why does it even have to be coincidence she didnt recognise the body she went to see weaver for other reasons maybe she wanted to woo him back to art thats a big deal to her maybe she wanted it to be a big deal to him but she was trying not to be seen according to your appraisal inspector on a foggy night when she might only have been trying to stay warm havers crumpled up her crisp bag and rolled it in her palm she looked concerned and at the same time intent upon not showing the extent of that concern i think youve made a hasty decision here she said carefully im wondering why you know i had a fair good look at sarah gordon myself today shes dark shes thin shes attractive she reminded me of someone i wonder if she reminded you of someone as well havers inspector listen to me look at the facts we know elena started running at a quarter past six her stepmother told you that the porter confirmed it from her own report now verified by her neighbourssarah left her own house just round seven and the police report has her popping into the station to report finding the body at twenty past so please take a look at what youre suggesting all right first that for some reason although she left st stephens at a quarter past six it took elena weaver fortyfive minutes to run from her college to fen causewaywhat is it less than a mile second that when she got there for reasons unknown sarah gordon beat her in the face with something which she managed to get rid of then strangled her then covered her body with leaves then got sick and then dashed to the police station to divert suspicion all in just over fifteen minutes and we havent even addressed the question of why why would she kill her what on earth was her motive youre always lecturing me on motive means and opportunity inspector so tell me how sarah gordon fi ts in lynley couldnt do so nor could he argue that any part of what they knew had occurred was a wildly improbable coincidence illustrating undeniable culpability for everything sarah gordon told them about her reasons for going to the island in the first place had the ring of veracity and that she was committed to her art seemed easily understandable when one considered the quality of her work this being the case he forced himself to evaluate sergeant havers pointed questions he wanted to argue that sarah gordons resemblance to helen clyde was purely superficial a combination of dark hair dark eyes fair skin a slender frame but he couldnt lie about the fact that he was drawn to her because of other similaritiesa straightforward manner of speaking a willingness to examine the self a commitment to personal growth the ability to be alone and yet beneath it all something frightened and vulnerable he didnt want to believe that his diffi culties with helen would once again result in a form of professional myopia in which he forged obdurately ahead not to pin guilt upon a man with whom helen was sleeping this time but to concentrate on a suspect to whom he was drawn for reasons having nothing to do with the case all the time ignoring signposts leading him elsewhere yet he had to admit that sergeant havers points about the time frame in which the crime was carried out obviated sarah gordons guilt immediately he sighed rubbing his eyes he wondered if he had actually seen her at all the previous night he had been thinking of helen only moments before he walked to the window why not transport her through the means of imagination from bulstrode gardens to ivy court havers rustled through her shoulder bag to bring out a packet of players which she fl ipped onto the table between them instead of lighting up however she looked at him thorssons the stronger candidate she said and when he started to speak she cut him off with hear me out sir youre saying his motives too obvious fine so apply a variation of that objection to sarah gordon her admitted presence at the crime scene is too obvious but if were going to go with one of themif only for the momentmy moneys on the man he wanted her she refused him she turned him in so whys your money on the woman it isnt not entirely its just her coincidental connection to weaver that makes me uneasy fine be uneasy meanwhile i vote we pursue thorsson until weve a reason not to i say we check out his neighbours to see if anyone saw him skipping out in the morning or returning for that matter we see if the autopsy gives us anything else we see what that address on seymour street is all about it was solid policework havers expertise he said agreed that easily why you handle that half of it and you ill see if the rooms at st stephens are weavers inspector he took a cigarette from the pack handed it to her and struck a match its called compromise sergeant have a smoke he said when lynley pushed open the wrought iron gate at the south entrance to ivy court he saw that a wedding party was posing for photographs in the old graveyard of st stephens church it was a curious group with the bride done up in whiteface and wearing what appeared to be part of a privet hedge on her head her chief attendant swathed in a bloodred burnoose and the best man looking like a chimney sweep only the groom wore conventional morning dress but he was alleviating any concern this might have caused by drinking champagne from a riding boot which hed apparently removed from the foot of one of the guests the wind whipped everyones clothing about but the play of colourswhite red black and greyagainst the slick lichenous green of the old slate gravestones had its own distinct charm this the photographer himself seemed to see for he kept calling out hold it nick hold it flora right yes perfect as he snapped away with his camera flora lynley thought with a smile no wonder she was wearing a bush on her head he dodged past a heap of fallen bicycles and walked across the court to the doorway through which he had seen the woman disappear on the previous night nearly hidden by a tangle of goldheart ivy a sign still fresh with having been recently handlettered hung on the wall beneath an overhead light it contained three names lynley felt that quick brief rush of triumph which comes with having ones intuition affirmed by fact anthony weavers was the fi rst name listed only one of the other two he recognised a jenn would be weavers graduate student it was adam jenn in fact whom lynley found in weavers study when he climbed the stairs to the fi rst floor the door stood ajar revealing an unlit triangular entry off of which opened a narrow gyp room a larger bedroom and the study itself lynley heard voices coming from within the studylow questions from a man soft responses from a womanso he took the opportunity to have a quick look at the two other rooms to his immediate right the gyp room was wellequipped with a stove a refrigerator and a wall of glassfronted cupboards in which sat enough cooking utensils and crockery to set up housekeeping aside from the refrigerator and the stove everything in the room appeared to be new from the gleaming microwave to the cups saucers and plates the walls were recently painted and the air smelled fresh like baby powder a scent which he tracked to its source a solid rectangle of room deodoriser hanging on a hook behind the door he was intrigued by the perfection of the gyp so at odds with what he envisaged anthony weavers professional environment would be considering the state of his study at home curious to see if some stamp of the mans individuality evidenced itself elsewhere he flipped on the lightswitch of the bedroom across the entry and stood in the doorway surveying it above wainscoting painted the colour of forest mushrooms rose walls which were papered in cream with thin brown stripes framed pencil sketches hung from thesea pheasant shoot a fox hunt a deer chased by hounds all signed with the single name weaverwhile from the white ceiling a pentagonal brass fi xture shed light on a single bed next to which stood a tripod table holding a brass reading lamp and a matching diptych frame lynley crossed the room and picked this up elena weaver smiled from one side justine from the other the first a candid snapshot of the daughter joyfully romping with an irish setter puppy the second an earnest studio portrait of the wife her long hair carefully curled back from her face and her smile closelipped as if she wished to hide her teeth lynley replaced it and looked around reflectively the hand that had outfitted the kitchen with its chromium appliances and ivory china had apparently seen to the decoration of the bedroom as well on impulse he pulled back part of the brown and green counterpane on the bed to fi nd only a bare mattress and unslipped pillow beneath it the revelation was not the least surprising he left the room as he did so the study door swung open and he found himself facetoface with the two young people whose murmured conversation he had heard a few moments earlier the young man his broad shoulders emphasised by an academic gown reached out for the girl when he caught sight of lynley and he pulled her back against him protectively help you with something his words were polite enough but the frigid tone conveyed an entirely different message as did the young mans features which quickly altered from the relaxed repose that accompanies friendly conversation to the sharpness that signals suspicion lynley glanced at the girl who was clutching a notebook to her chest she wore a knitted cap from which bright blonde hair spilled it was drawn low on her forehead hiding her eyebrows but heightening the colour of her eyes which were violet and at the moment very frightened their responses were normal admirable in the circumstances an undergraduate in the college had been brutally murdered strangers would be neither welcomed nor tolerated he produced his warrant card and introduced himself adam jenn he said the young man nodded he said to the girl ill see you next week joyce but youve got to get on with the reading before you do the next essay youve got the list youve got a brain dont be so lazy okay he smiled as if to mitigate the negativity of the fi nal comment but the smile seemed rote merely a quick curving of the lips that did nothing to alter the wariness in his hazel eyes joyce said thank you adam in that breathy sort of voice which always manages to sound as if its extending an illicit invitation she smiled her goodbye and a moment later they heard her clattering noisily down the wooden stairs it wasnt until the groundfl oor staircase door opened and shut upon her departure that adam jenn invited lynley into weavers study dr weavers not here he said if youre wanting him that is lynley didnt respond at once rather he strolled to one of the windows which like the sole window in his own room in the building was set into one of the ornate dutch gables overlooking ivy court unlike his room however no desk stood in the recess instead two comfortably battered armchairs faced each other at an angle there separated by a chipped piecrust table on which lay a copy of a book entitled edward iii the cult of chivalry anthony weaver was its author hes brilliant adam jenns assertion had the distinct ring of defence no one in the country comes close to touching him in medieval history lynley put on his spectacles opened the volume and leafed through a few of the densely worded pages arbitrarily his eyes fell on the words but it was in the abysmal treatment of women as chattels subjugated to the political whims of their fathers and brothers that the age developed its reputation for a diplomatic manoeuvring far superseding any transitoryor spuriousdemotic concerns it may have actively promulgated having not read university writing in years lynley smiled in amusement hed forgotten that tendency of the academician to voice his pronouncements with such egregious pomposity he read the books dedication for my darling elena and tapped the cover closed he removed his spectacles youre dr weavers graduate student he said yes adam jenn shifted his weight from one foot to the other beneath his black academic gown he wore a white shirt and freshly laundered jeans that had been carefully pressed with creases down the front he drove his fi sts into the rear pockets of these and waited without speaking standing next to an oval table across which were spread three open texts and half a dozen handwritten essays how do you come to be studying under dr weaver lynley removed his overcoat and placed it over the back of one of the old armchairs decent luck for once in my life adam said it was a curious nonanswer lynley raised an eyebrow adam read this as lynley intended and continued id read two of his books as an undergraduate id heard him lecture when he was shortlisted for the penford chair at the beginning of easter term last year i came to ask him if hed direct my research to have the penford chair as advisor he gazed round the room as if its jumble of contents would provide him with an adequate explanation of the importance of weavers place in his life he settled with you cant go higher then this is all a bit of a risk on your end isnt it hooking yourself up with dr weaver so soon what if he doesnt get the appointment its worth the risk as far as im concerned once he gets the chair hell be fl ooded with requests to direct graduates studies so i got to him fi rst you seem relatively sure of your man id always gathered these appointments are largely political a change in the academic climate and a candidates fi nished thats true enough candidates walk a tightrope alienate the search committee offend some mucketymuck and theyre done for but committeed be fools not to award it to him as i said hes the best medievalist in the country and theyre not going to fi nd anyone to argue with that i take it hes unlikely to alienate or offend adam jenn laughed boyishly dr weaver was his reply i see when should the announcement take place thats the odd thing adam shook a heavy lock of sandy hair off his forehead it should have been announced last july but the committee went on and on about extending the deadline and they started checking everyone out like they were looking for red skeletons in somebodys closet stupid they are perhaps merely cautious ive been given to understand that the chairs a fairly coveted advancement it represents historical research at cambridge its the place they put the best two thin lines of crimson ran along adams cheekbone no doubt he pictured himself in the chair in the distant future when weaver retired lynley moved to the table glancing down at the essays that were spread across it you share these rooms with dr weaver ive been told i put in a few hours most days yes i run my supervisions here as well and thats been going on for how long since the beginning of term lynley nodded its an attractive environment far nicer than what i remember from my days at university adam looked round the study at the general mess of essays books furniture and equipment obviously attractive wouldnt have been the first word to spring to his lips had he been asked to evaluate the room then he seemed to combine lynleys comment with his initial sight of him a few moments earlier his head turned towards the door oh you mean the gyp and the bedroom dr weavers wife fi xed them up for him last spring in anticipation of the chair an elevated professor needs a proper set of rooms adam grinned ruefully that sort of thing but she didnt manage to get her way in here dr weaver wouldnt let her he added this last as if to explain the difference between the study and its companion rooms and concluded with a mildly sardonic you know how it is in a brotherhoodofmen fashion in which the connotation was clear women need to have their fancies tolerated men are the ones with the sainted toleration that justine weavers hand had not seen to the study was apparent to lynley and while it did not actually resemble the disordered sanctum at the rear of weavers house the similarities to it could not be ignored here was the same mild chaos the same profusion of books the same air of habitation which the adams road room possessed one form of academic work or another seemed to be in progress everywhere a large pine desk served as the heart for labour holding everything from a word processor to a stack of black binders the oval table in the rooms centre had the function of conference area and the gable recess acted as a retreat for reading and study for in addition to the table which displayed weavers own book a small case beneath the window within an arms length of both the chairs held additional volumes even the fireplace with its cinnamon tiles served a purpose beyond providing heat from an electric fire for its mantel functioned as a clearing house for the post and more than a dozen envelopes lined up across it all bearing anthony weavers name a solitary greeting card stood like a bookend at the far side of the serried collection of letters and lynley picked it up a humorous birthday card with the word daddy written above the greeting and the roundlettered signature elena beneath it lynley replaced it among the envelopes and turned to adam jenn who still stood by the table one hand in his pocket and the other curved round the shoulder rail of one of the chairs did you know her adam pulled out the chair lynley joined him at the table moving aside two essays and a cup of cold tea in which a thin unappetising film was fl oating adams face was grave i knew her were you here in the study when she phoned her father sunday night his eyes went to the ceephone which sat on a small oak desk next to the fi replace she didnt phone here or if she did it was after i left what time was this round half past seven he looked at his watch as if for verification i had to meet three blokes at the university centre at eight and i stopped by my digs fi rst your digs near little st marys so it must have been somewhere round half past seven it might have been a bit later perhaps a quarter to eight was dr weaver still here when you left dr weaver he wasnt here at all sunday evening hed been in for a while in the early afternoon but then he went home for dinner and didnt come back i see lynley reflected on this piece of information wondering why weaver had lied about his whereabouts on the night before his daughters death adam appeared to realise that for some reason this detail was important in the investigation for he went on earnestly he could have come in later though its out of line for me to claim that he didnt come back in the evening actually i might have missed him hes been working on a paper for about two months nowthe role of monasteries in medieval economicsand he might have wanted to go over a bit of the research again most of the documents are in latin theyre hard to read it takes forever to sort everything out i imagine thats what he was doing here sunday evening he does that all the time hes always concerned about getting the details right hed want to have them perfect so if something was on his mind he probably came back on the spur of the moment i wouldnt have known and he wouldnt have told me outside of shakespeare lynley couldnt recall having heard anyone protest quite so much then he usually didnt tell you if hed be coming back well now let me think the young man drew his eyebrows together but lynley saw the answer in the manner in which he pressed his hands nervously against his thighs he said you think a great deal of dr weaver dont you enough to protect him blindly remained unspoken but there was no doubt that adam jenn recognised the implied accusation behind lynleys question hes a great man hes honest he has more natural integrity than any half a dozen other senior fellows at st stephens college or anywhere else adam pointed at the envelopes lining the mantelpiece all of those have come in since yesterday afternoon when the word went out about what happened to what happened people love him people care you cant be a bastard and have people care about you so much did elena care for her father adams gaze flicked to the birthday card she did everyone does he involves himself with people hes always here when someone has a problem people can talk to dr weaver hes straight with them sincere and elena he worried about her he took time with her he encouraged her he went over her essays and helped her with her studies and talked to her about what she was going to do with her life it was important to him that she be a success i can see what youre thinking adam said a successful daughter implies a successful father but hes not like that he didnt just take time with her he took time with everyone he helped me get my housing he lined up my undergraduate supervisions ive applied for a research fellowship and hes helping me with that and when ive a question with my work hes always here ready ive never got the feeling that im taking up his time dyou know how valuable a quality that is in a person the streets round here arent exactly paved with it it wasnt the panegyric to weaver which lynley found interesting that adam jenn should so admire the man who was directing his graduate studies was reasonable but what underlay adam jenns avowals was something far more telling hed managed to deflect every question about elena hed even managed to avoid using her name outside faint laughter from the wedding party floated up from the graveyard someone shouted give us a kiss and someone else dont you wish and the splintering sound of breaking glass suggested a champagne bottles abrupt demise lynley said obviously youre quite close to dr weaver i am like a son adams face took on more colour but he looked pleased like a brother to elena adam ran his thumb rapidly back and forth along the edge of the table he reached up and rubbed his fingers along his jaw lynley said or perhaps not really like a brother she was an attractive girl after all you would have seen a great deal of each other here in the study at the weavers house as well and no doubt in the combination room from time to time or at formal dinner and in her own room adam said i never went inside just to get her thats all i understand you took her out to foreign films at the arts we went to dinner occasionally we spent a day in the country i see its not what youre thinking i didnt do it because i wantedi mean i couldnt have oh hell did dr weaver ask you to take elena out if you have to know yes he thought we were suited and were you no the vehemence driving the word seemed to cause it to reverberate in the room for an instant as if with the need to disguise the strength of his reply in some way adam said look i was like a hired escort to her there was nothing more to it than that did elena want a hired escort adam gathered up the essays that lay on the table ive too much work here the supervisions my own studies ive no time in my life for women at the moment they add complications when one least expects it and i cant afford the distraction ive hours of research every day ive essays to read ive meetings to attend all of which must have been diffi cult to explain to dr weaver adam sighed he crossed his ankle on his knee and picked at the lace of his gym shoe he invited me to his house the second weekend of term he wanted me to meet her what could i say hed taken me on as a graduate hed been so willing to help me how could i not give him help in return in what way were you helping him there was this bloke he preferred she didnt see i was supposed to run interference between them a bloke from queens gareth randolph thats him shed met him through the deaf students union last year dr weaver wasnt comfortable with them going about together i imagine he hoped she mightyou know learn to prefer you he dropped his leg to the fl oor she didnt really fancy this bloke gareth anyway she told me as much i mean they were mates and she liked him but it was no big deal all the same she knew what her father was worrying about what was that that shed end up withi mean marry someone deaf lynley fi nished which after all wouldnt be that unusual a circumstance since she was deaf herself adam pushed himself off his chair he walked to the window and stared into the courtyard its complicated he said quietly to the glass i dont know how to explain him to you and even if i could it wouldnt make any difference whatever id say would just make him look bad and it wouldnt have anything to do with what happened to her even if it did dr weaver cant afford to look bad can he not with the penford chair hanging in the balance thats not it then it really cant hurt anyone if you talk to me adam gave a rough laugh thats easy to say you just want to find a killer and get back to london it doesnt make any difference to you whose lives get destroyed in the process the police as eumenides it was an accusation hed heard before and while he acknowledged its partial accuracyfor there had to be a disinterested hand of justice or society crumbledthe convenience of the allegation afforded him a moments sour amusement pushed right to the edge of truths abyss people always clung tenaciously to the same form of denial im protecting someone else by withholding the truth protecting someone from harm from pain from reality from suspicion it was all a variation of an identical theme in which denial wore the guise of selfrighteous nobility he said this isnt a singular death taking place in a void adam it touches everyone she knew no one stays protected lives have already been destroyed thats what murder does and if you dont know that its time you learned the young man swallowed even across the room lynley could hear him do so she took it all as a joke he said fi nally she took everything as a joke in this case what that her father was worried shed marry gareth randolph that he didnt want her to hang round the other deaf students so much but most of all that hei think it was that he loved her so much and that he wanted her to love him as much in return she took it as a joke thats the way she was what was their relationship like lynley asked even though he knew how unlikely it was that adam jenn would say anything to betray his mentor adam looked down at his fingernails and began to worry the cuticles by pushing his thumb against them he couldnt do enough for her he wanted to be involved in her life but it always seemed he shoved his hands back into his pockets i dont know how to explain lynley recalled weavers description of his daughter he recalled justine weavers reaction to the description not genuine it was like he felt he had to keep pouring on the love and devotion like he had to keep showing her how much she meant to him so that maybe shed come to believe it someday he would have wanted to take special pains with her because she couldnt hear i should think she was in a new environment hed have wanted her to succeed for herself for him i know what youre getting at youre heading back towards the chair but its more than that it went beyond her studies it went beyond her being deaf i think he believed he had to prove himself to her for some reason but he was so intent on doing that that he never even saw her not really not entirely the description moulded perfectly to weavers agonising on the previous night it was so often the circumstance that grew from divorce a parent partnered in an unremittingly bleak marriage feels caught between the needs of a child and the needs of self if he stays in the marriage solely to meet the needs of the child he reaps the benefi ts of societys approval but his self erodes yet if he leaves the marriage solely to meet the needs of self the child is damaged what is required is a masterful balancing act between these disparate needs a balancing act in which a marriage can end former partners can establish more productive lives and the children can escape without irreparable harm in the process it was lynley thought the utopian ideal utterly improbable because feelings were involved whenever a marriage came to an end even when people were acting in the only manner possible to preserve their peace of mind it was in the very need for peace of mind that guilt lay its most virulent seeds most peopleand he admitted he was one of theminvariably gave power to social condemnation allowing their behaviour to be guided by guilt living their lives dominated by a judaeochristian tradition which taught them that they had no right to happiness or to anything else save a life in which considerations of self were secondary to complete devotion to others the fact that men and women did indeed lead lives of quiet desperation as a result generally went ignored for as long as they led their lives for others they achieved the approval of everyone else whoin equally quiet desperationwas engaged in doing the very same thing the situation was worse for anthony weaver to achieve peace of mindwhich society told him was not his due in the fi rst placehe had ended a marriage only to fi nd that the guilt attendant to divorce was exacerbated by the fact that in escaping unhappiness he had not merely left behind a small child who loved and depended upon him he had left behind a handicapped child as well and what kind of society would ever forgive him that he stood to lose no matter what hed done had he stayed in his marriage and devoted his life to his daughter he could have felt selfrighteous and nobly miserable in opting at a try for peace of mind he had reaped the harvest of guilt whose seeds were planted within what heand societyconsidered a base and selfi sh need upon close examination guilt was the prime mover behind so many kinds of devotion lynley wondered if it underlay weavers devotion to his daughter in his own mind weaver had sinned against his wife elena and society itself fifteen years of guilt had grown out of his sin proving himself to elena smoothing the way for her capturing her love had apparently been the only expiation he saw for himself lynley felt a profound pity at the thought of the other mans struggle to gain acceptance as what he already was his daughters father he wondered if weaver had ever garnered the courage and taken the time to ask elena if such extremes of behaviour and such torment of spirit were actually necessary to obtain her forgiveness i dont think he ever really knew her adam said lynley wondered if weaver really knew himself he got to his feet what time did you leave here last night after dr weaver phoned you a bit after nine you locked the door of course the same on sunday night do you always lock it yes adam nodded his head towards the pine desk and its collection of equipment word processor two printers fl oppy disks and files that lots worth a fortune the study doors double bolted and the other doors the gyp and bedroom dont have locks but the main entry door does did you ever use the ceephone in here to contact elena in her room or at dr weavers home occasionally yes did you know elena ran in the morning with mrs weaver adam pulled a face dr weaver wouldnt let her run alone she didnt care for having mrs weaver tag along but the dog went as well so it made the situation bearable she loved the dog and she loved to run yes lynley said thoughtfully most people do he nodded his goodbye and left the room two girls were sitting on the staircase outside the door their knees drawn up their heads together over an open textbook they didnt look up as he passed them but their conversation ceased abruptly only to resume once he reached the lower landing he heard adam jenns voice call katherine keelie im ready for you now and went out into the chill autumn afternoon he looked across ivy court at the graveyard thinking about his meeting with adam jenn wondering what it must have been like to be caught between the father and the daughter wondering most of all what that violent no had meant when he asked the young man if he and elena had been suited to each other and still he knew nothing more about sarah gordons visit to ivy court than he had known before he glanced at his pocket watch it was just after two havers would be a while with the cambridge police he had sufficient time to make the run to crusoes island if nothing else that would give him at least a modicum of information he went to change his clothes anthony weaver stared at the discreet nameplate on the deskp l beck funeral directorand felt overcome by a surge of simpleminded gratitude this main business office of the mortuary was as unfunereal as good taste would allow it to be and while its warm autumn colours and comfortable furniture did not alter the reality which had brought him here at least it did not underscore the finality of his daughters death with sombre decorations canned organ music and lugubrious employees dressed in black next to him glyn sat with her hands balled into her lap both feet flat on the floor her head and shoulders rigid she did not look at him upon her continued insistence throughout the morning hed taken her to the police station where in spite of what he had tried to tell her she had fully expected to find elenas body and be able to see it when told that the body had been taken to autopsy she had demanded to be allowed to observe the procedure and when with a horrified look of supplication in anthonys direction the female police constable working reception had gently said with apologies that it simply wasnt possible that it couldnt be allowed that at any rate the autopsy was performed in another location not here at the station and even if that werent the case family members im her mother glyn cried shes mine i want to see her the cambridge police were not an unsympathetic lot they took her quickly to a conference room where a concerned young secretary tried to ply her with mineral water which glyn refused a second secretary brought in a cup of tea a traffic warden offered aspirin and while anxious calls were put out for the police psychologist and the public relations officer glyn continued to insist that she see elena her voice was tight and shrill her features were taut when she didnt get what she wanted she began to shout witness to all of this anthony felt only his own growing shame it was directed at her for causing a humiliating public scene it was directed at himself for being ashamed of her so when she finally turned on him and fl ew in his direction and accused him of being too selfcentred to be capable of identifying his own daughters body so how did they even know it was elena weaver whose body they had if they didnt let her mother make the identifi cation her mother who gave her birth her mother who loved her her mother who raised her alone do you hear me alone you bastards he had nothing to do with anything after she was five years old because he had what he wanted he had his precious freedom all right so let me see her let me see her i am wood he had thought nothing she says can touch me although this stoic determination to remain inviolate sufficed to keep him from striking out in turn it was not enough to prevent his unrestrained mind from shooting back through time sifting through memories in an attempt to recalllet alone understandwhat forces had ever brought him together with this woman in the first place it should have been something more than sex a mutual interest perhaps a shared experience a similarity of background a goal an ideal had any of those been present between them they might have stood a fi ghting chance of survival but instead it had been a drinks party in an elegant house off the trumpington road where some thirty postgraduates who had worked for his election had been invited to the victory celebration of the new local mp at loose ends for the evening anthony had gone with a friend glyn westhompson had done the same their shared indifference towards the esoteric machinations of cambridge politics supplied the initial illusion of mutuality far too much champagne provided the physical allure when hed suggested that they take their own bottle out onto the terrace to watch the moonlight silver the trees in the garden his intention had been a bit of casual kissing a chance to fondle the ample breasts which he could see through the sheer material of her blouse and an opportunity in privacy to slip his hand between her thighs but the terrace was dark the night was quite warm and glyns reaction was not what hed thought it might be her response to his kiss took him by surprise her eager mouth hungrily sucked his tongue one hand unbuttoned her blouse and unhooked her bra while the other insinuated itself into his trousers she moaned her arousal she straddled his leg and rotated her hips he had no conscious thoughts he had only the need to be inside her to feel the warmth and the soft wet suction of her body to feel his own release they didnt speak they used the terraces stone balustrade as a fulcrum he lifted her to it she spread her legs he plunged and plunged panting with the effort to bring himself to climax before anyone should walk out onto the terrace and catch them in the act while she bit his neck and gasped and tore at his hair it was the only time in his life that he actually thought of the word fucking when he took a woman and when it was over he couldnt remember her name fiveperhaps sevengraduate students came out of the house before he and glyn had separated someone said whoops and someone else ill have a bit of that myself and all of them chuckled and went on into the garden more than anything else it was the thought of their derision that made him put his arms round glyn kiss her and murmur huskily lets get out of here all right because somehow leaving with her elevated the act making them more than two sweating bodies intent upon mating without intellect or soul shed gone with him to the cramped house on hope street which he shared with three friends she spent the night and then another rolling around with him on the thin mattress that served as his bed eating a quick meal when the mood was upon her smoking french cigarettes drinking english gin and padding again and again to his bedroom leading him to lie on that mattress on the floor shed moved in slowly over two weeks timefi rst leaving behind an article of clothing then a book then stopping by with a lamp they never spoke of love they never fell in love they merely fell into marriage which after all was the highest form of public validation he could possibly give to a mindless act of sex with a woman he didnt know the office door opened a manpresumably pl beckentered like the offi ce itself his clothing reflected a careful avoidance of that which might underscore death he wore a natty blue blazer over soft grey trousers a pembroke tie formed a perfect knot at his throat dr weaver he said and then with a crisp turn on his heel to glyn and mrs weaver somehow hed done his homework it was an artful way to avoid linking their names rather than offer factitious condolences over the death of a girl he did not know he said the police said youd be coming id like to get you through this as quickly as possible may i offer you something coffee or tea nothing for me anthony said glyn was silent mr beck did not wait for her to reply he sat down and said its my understanding that the police still have the body so it may be some days before they release her to us theyve told you that havent they no just that theyre doing the autopsy i see thoughtfully he steepled his hands and leaned his elbows on the top of the desk it generally takes a few days to run all the tests they do organ studies tissue studies toxicology reports in a sudden death the procedure moves fairly rapidly especially if thewith a quick concerned glance in glyns directionif the deceased has been under a doctors care but in a case like this we understand anthony said a murder glyn said she moved her eyes off the wall and fixed them on mr beck although her body didnt alter a degree in the chair you mean a murder say it dont slither round the truth she isnt the deceased shes the victim its a murder im not used to that yet but if i hear it enough no doubt itll pop up quite naturally in my speech my daughter the victim my daughters death the murder mr beck looked at anthony perhaps with the hope that he would say something in answer to the implied invective perhaps with the expectation of anthonys offering some word of comfort or support to his former wife when anthony said nothing mr beck continued quickly youll need to let me know where and when the services are to be held and where shes to be interred weve a lovely chapel here if youd like to use that for the service and of course i know this is difficult for you bothbut you need to decide if you want a public viewing a public at the thought of his daughter being put on display for the curious anthony felt the hair bristle on the backs of his hands thats not possible she isnt i want it glyns nails anthony saw were going completely white with the pressure she was exerting against her palms you dont want that you havent seen what she looks like please dont tell me what i want i said ill see her ill do so i want everyone to see her mr beck intervened with we can do some repairs with facial putty and makeup no one will be able to see the full extent of glyn snapped forward like a selfpreserving reflex mr beck flinched you arent listening to me i want the damage seen i want the world to know anthony wanted to ask and what will you gain but he knew the answer shed given elena over to his care and she wanted the world to see how hed botched the job for fi fteen years shed kept their daughter in one of the roughest areas of london and elena had emerged from the experience with one chipped tooth to mark the only difficulty shed ever faced a brawl over the affections of an acnescarred fi fth former whod spent a lunch hour with her instead of his steady girlfriend and neither glyn nor elena had ever considered that uncapped tooth even a minute lapse in glyns ability to protect her daughter instead it was for both of them elenas badge of honour her declaration of equality for the three girls whom she had fought could hear but they were no match for the splintered crate of new potatoes and the two metal milk baskets which elena had commandeered for defensive weapons from a nearby greengrocers when shed come under attack fifteen years in london one chipped tooth to show for it fifteen months in cambridge one barbarous death anthony wouldnt fight her he said have you a brochure we might look at something we can use in order to decide mr beck seemed only too willing to cooperate he said of course and hastily slid open a drawer of his desk from this he took a threering binder covered in maroon plastic with the words beck and sons funeral directors printed in gold letters across the front he passed this across to them anthony opened it plastic covers encased eightbyten colour photographs he began to flip through them looking without seeing reading without assimilating he recognised woods mahogany and oak he recognised terms naturally resistant to corrosion rubber gasket crepe lining asphalt coating vacuum plate faintly he heard mr beck murmuring about the relative merits of copper or sixteengauge steel over oak about lift and tilt mattresses about the placement of a hinge he heard him say these uniseal caskets are quite the best the locking mechanism in addition to the gasket seals the top while the continuous weld on the bottom seals that as well so youve maximum protection to resist the entry of he hesitated delicately the indecision was written plainly on his face worms beetles moisture mildew how best to say itthe elements the words in the binder slid out of focus anthony heard glyn say have you coffi ns here only a few people generally make a choice from the brochures and under the circumstances please dont feel you must id like to see them mr becks eyes flitted to anthony he seemed to be waiting for a protest of some sort when none was forthcoming he said certainly this way and led them out of the offi ce anthony followed his former wife and the funeral director he wanted to insist that they make the decision within the safety of mr becks office where photographs would allow both of them to hold the final reality at bay for just a while longer but he knew that to call for distance between them and the fact of elenas burial would be interpreted as further evidence of inadequacy and hadnt elenas death already served to illustrate his uselessness as a father once again underscoring the contention which glyn had asserted for years that his sole contribution to their daughters upbringing had been a single blind gamete that knew how to swim here they are mr beck pushed open a set of heavy oak doors ill leave you alone glyn said that wont be necessary but surely youll want to discuss no she moved past him into the showroom there were no decorations or extraneous furnishings just a few coffins lined up along the pearlcoloured walls their lids gaping open upon velvet satin and crepe their bodies standing on waisthigh translucent pedestals anthony forced himself to follow glyn from one to the next each had a discreet price tag each bore the same declaration about the extent of protection guaranteed by the manufacturer each had a ruched lining a matching pillow and a coverlet folded over the coffi n lid each had its own name neapolitan blue windsor poplar autumn oak venetian bronze each had an individually highlighted feature a shell design a set of barley sugar end posts or delicate embroidery on the interior of the lid forcing himself to move along the display anthony tried not to visualise what elena would look like when she fi nally lay in one of these coffins with her light hair spread out like silk threads on the pillow glyn halted in front of a simple grey coffi n with a plain satin lining she tapped her fi ngers against it as if this gesture bade him to do so mr beck hurried to join them his lips were pursed tightly he was pulling at his chin what is this glyn asked a small sign on the lid said nonprotective exterior its price tag read pressed wood mr beck made a nervous adjustment to his pembroke tie and rapidly continued this is pressed wood beneath a flannel covering a satin interior which is quite nice of course but the exterior has no protection at all save for the flannel itself and to be frank if i may considering our weather i wouldnt be at all comfortable recommending this particular coffin to you we keep it for cases where there are diffi cultieswell diffi culties with finances i cant think youd want your daughter he let the drifting quality of his voice complete the thought anthony began to say of course but glyn interrupted with this coffin will do for a moment anthony did nothing more than stare at his former wife then he found the will to say you cant think ill allow her to be buried in this she said quite distinctly i dont care what you intend to allow ive not enough money for ill pay she looked at him for the fi rst time since theyd arrived with your wifes money i think not this has nothing to do with justine mr beck took a step away from them he straightened out the small price sign on a coffin lid he said ill leave you to talk theres no need glyn opened her large black handbag and began shoving articles this way and that a set of keys clanked a compact snapped open a ballpoint pen slipped out onto the floor youll take a cheque wont you itll have to be drawn on my bank in london if thats a problem you can phone for some sort of guarantee ive been doing business with them for years so glyn i wont have it she swung to face him her hip hit the coffin jarring it on its pedestal the lid fell shut with a hollow thud you wont have what she asked you have no rights here were talking about my daughter mr beck began to edge towards the door stay where you are angry colour patched glyns cheeks you walked out on your daughter anthony lets not forget that you wanted your career lets not forget that you wanted to chase skirts lets not forget that you got what you wanted all of it every bit you have no more rights here chequebook in hand she stooped to the floor for the pen she began to write using the pressed wood coffin lid as support her hand was shaking anthony reached for the chequebook saying glyn please for gods sake no she said ill pay for this i dont want your money you cant buy me off im not trying to buy you off i just want elena dont say her name dont you say it mr beck said let me leave you and without acknowledging glyns immediate no he hurried from the room glyn continued to write she clutched the pen like a weapon in her hand he said two hundred pounds didnt he dont do this anthony said dont make this another battle between us shell wear that blue dress mum got her last birthday we cant bury her like a pauper i wont let you do it i cant glyn ripped the cheque from the book she said whered that man get off to heres his money lets go she headed for the door anthony reached for her arm she jerked away you bastard she hissed bastard who brought her up who spent years trying to give her some language who helped her with her schoolwork and dried her tears and washed her clothes and sat up with her at night when she was puling and sick not you you bastard and not your ice queen wife this is my daughter anthony my daughter mine and ill bury her exactly as i see fit because unlike you im not hot after some big poncey job so i dont have to give a damn what anyone thinks he examined her with sudden curious dispassion realising that he saw no evidence of grief he saw no mothers devotion to her child and nothing that illustrated the magnitude of loss this has nothing to do with burying elena he said in slow but complete understanding youre still dealing with me im not sure you even care much that shes dead how dare you she whispered have you even cried glyn do you feel any grief do you feel anything at all beyond the need to use her murder for a bit more revenge and how can anyone be surprised by that after all thats how you used most of her life he didnt see the blow coming she slammed her right hand across his face knocking his spectacles to the fl oor you filthy piece of she raised her arm to strike again he caught her wrist youve waited years to do that im only sorry you didnt have the audience youd have liked he pushed her away she fell against the grey coffi n but she was not spent she spit out the words dont talk to me of grief dont you everevertalk to me of grief she turned away from him flinging her arms over the coffin lid as if she would embrace it she began to weep i have nothing shes gone i cant have her back i cant find her anywhere and i cant i can never the fingers of one hand curled pulling at the flannel that covered the coffi n but you can you still can anthony and i want you to die even through his outrage he felt the sudden stirring of a horrified compassion after the years of their enmity after these moments in the funeral home he wouldnt have believed it possible that he should feel anything for her save outright loathing but in those words you can he saw the extent and the nature of his former wifes grief she was fortysix years old she could never have another child no matter that the thought of bringing another child into the world to take elenas place was beyond unthinkable that hed lost his reason for living the moment hed looked on his daughters corpse hed spend the rest of his life in a ceaseless involvement in academic affairs so that he would never again have a free moment in which he might have to remember the ruin of her face and the mark of the ligature round her neck but that was no more than a point of indifference he could still have another child whatever the wilderness of his current grief he still had that choice but glyn did not her sorrow was doubled by the incontrovertible fact of her age he took a step towards her placing his hand on her shuddering back glyn im dont you touch me she rolled away from him lost her footing and fell to one knee the fl imsy flannel covering on the coffi n tore the wood was thin and vulnerable beneath it heart pounding in both his chest and his ears lynley staggered to a halt within sight of fen causeway he dug in his pocket for his watch he flipped it open panting and checked the time seven minutes he shook his head bent nearly double with his hands on his knees wheezing like an undiagnosed case of emphysema less than a miles run and he felt completely done for sixteen years of cigarette smoking had taken its toll ten months of abstinence was not enough to redeem him he stumbled onto the worn wooden planks that bridged the stream between robinson crusoes island and sheeps green he leaned against the metal rail threw his head back and gulped in air like a man saved from drowning sweat beaded his face and dampened his jersey what a wonderful experience it was to run with a grunt he turned to rest his elbows against the rail letting his head hang while he caught his breath seven minutes he thought and not quite a mile she would have run the same course in not much more than fi ve there could be no doubt about it she ran daily with her stepmother she was a longdistance runner she ran with the cambridge cross country team if her calendar was any indication of reality shed been running with the university hare and hounds as far back as last january and probably before depending on the distance she had planned to go that morning her pacing might have been different but he couldnt imagine her taking any longer than ten minutes to run to the island no matter the course she had intended to follow that being the case unless she stopped off somewhere along the route she would have reached the site of her murder no later than sixtwentyfi ve respiration finally slowing he raised his head even without the fog which had shrouded most of the region on the previous day he had to admit that this was an exceptional spot for a murder crack willows alders and beeches none of them yet leaflesscreated an impenetrable screen which shielded the island not only from the causeway bridge which arched above its south end on the way into the town but also from the public footpath that ran along the streamsheehans bit of a ditchnot ten feet away anyone wishing to carry off a crime reaped the benefi t of virtual privacy here and although the occasional pedestrian crossed over the larger bridge from coe fen to the island and from there to the footpath although bicycle riders pedalled across sheeps green or along the river in the nighttime darkness of half past six on a cold november morning the killer could have been fairly certain that no witness would come upon the beating and strangulation of elena weaver at half past six in the morning no one would even be in the area except her stepmother and her presence had been eliminated with a simple call placed on the ceephone a call made by someone who presumed on a personal knowledge of justine to assume that given the opportunity she wouldnt run by herself the next morning of course she had run anyway but it was the killers luck that she had chosen a different route if indeed it had been luck at all lynley pushed himself off the railing and walked across the footbridge onto the island a tall wooden gate leading to the north end stood open and lynley entered to see a workshed with punts piled to one side of it and three old bicycles leaning against its green doors inside bundled in heavy pullovers against the cold three men were examining a hole in a punt fluorescent lights along the ceiling yellowed their skin the scent of marine varnish made a weight of the air it wafted from a crowded workbench where two gallon cans stood open with paintbrushes resting across their tops it spread from two other punts freshly refurbished that rested on sawhorses waiting to dry bloomin idiots they are one of the men was saying lookit this bash will you its carelessness that is they none of them have a stitch of respect one of the other men looked up lynley saw that he was youngno more than twenty his face was spotty his hair was long and his earlobe sported a glittering zircon stud he said help you mate the other two ceased working they were middleaged and tiredlooking one gave lynley a onceover look that took in his makeshift running clothes of brown tweed blue wool and white leather the other went to the far end of the shed where he fi red up an electric sander and began to savage the side of a canoe having seen the offi cial crimescene notice still marking off the south end of the island lynley wondered why sheehan had done nothing about this section he discovered soon enough when the younger man said no one shuts us out just cause some slags in the shit leave off derek the older man said its a killing theyre dealing with not some lady in distress derek tossed his head derisively he pulled a cigarette from his blue jeans and lit one with a kitchen match which he threw to the fl oor casually oblivious of the proximity of several cans of paint identifying himself lynley asked if any of them had known the dead girl just that she was from the university they told him they had no more information than what the police had given them upon their arrival at the workshop yesterday morning they knew only that a college girls body had been found on the south end of the island with her face mashed up and some string round her neck had the police conducted a search of this northern area lynley wanted to know poked their faces everywhere they did derek replied cut right through the gate before we even got here ned was right cheesed off about that all day he shouted through the noise that screeched from the sander at the end of the building werent you mate if he heard him ned gave no sign he was fully intent upon the canoe you noticed nothing out of the ordinary lynley said derek blew cigarette smoke from his mouth and sucked it up with his nostrils he grinned apparently pleased with the effect you mean aside from about two dozen coppers crawling round through the bushes trying to pin what they can on blokes like us hows that lynley asked its the regular story some college tart got bagged the coppers are looking to nab a local because if the university nits dont like the nature of the collar all hells gon to break loose just ask bill here how it works bill didnt appear to be willing to hold forth on this particular topic he busied himself at the workbench where he picked up a hacksaw and went after a narrow piece of wood being held steady by an old red vice derek said his boy works on the local rag he does was following a story bout some bloke who supposably offed himself last spring uni didnt like the way the story was developing and bang on the button they tried to quash it straight away thats the way it runs round here mister derek stabbed a dirty thumb in the direction of the centre of town uni like the locals to toe the uni line isnt that sort of thing dead and gone lynley asked i mean the townandgown strife bill finally spoke depends on who you ask derek added yeah its dead and gone all right when youre talking with the toffs down river they dont see trouble till it smacks them in the face but its a bit different isnt it when youre rubbing your elbows with the likes of us lynley gave thought to dereks words as he walked back to the south end of the island and ducked under the established police line how often had he heard variations on that theme espoused religiously over the last few years weve no class system any longer its dead and gone it was always stated with wellmeaning sincerity by someone whose career whose background or whose money effectively blinded him to the reality of life while all the time those without brilliant careers those without family trees whose roots plunged deeply into british soil those without access to ready money or even the hope of saving a few pounds from their weekly pay those were the people who recognised the insidious social strata of a society that claimed no strata existed at the very same moment as it labelled a man from the sound of his voice the university would probably be the fi rst to deny the existence of barriers between gown and town and why would they not for those who are the primary architects of ramparts rarely if ever feel constricted by their presence still he had difficulty attributing elena weavers death to the resurrection of a social dispute had a local been involved in the killing his instincts told him that the very same local would have been involved with elena but no local had known her from what he had been able to ascertain and following any pathway that led towards townandgown promised he felt certain to be a search for nothing he walked along the trail of boards which the cambridge police had laid down from the islands wrought iron gate to the site of the murder everything that constituted potential evidence had been swept up and carted away by the crimescene team only a roughly shaped fire ring remained halfburied in front of a fallen branch he went to this and sat whatever difficulties existed within the political arena of cambridge constabularys forensic department the crimescene team had done their job well the ashes from the fi re ring had been sifted through it looked as if some of them had even been removed next to the branch he saw the impression of a bottle in the damp earth and he remembered the list of items which sarah gordon had said she had seen he wondered about this picturing a killer clever enough to use an unopened wine bottle to dump the wine in the river afterwards to wash the bottle inside and out to tamp it into the earth so that it looked like part of the general rubbish in the area smeared with mud it would appear to have been there for weeks moisture inside would be attributed to the damp filled with wine it suited the stilllimited description of the weapon which had been used to beat the girl but if that was the case how on earth were they to trace a bottle of wine in a city where students kept supplies of drink in their very own rooms he shoved himself off the branch and walked to the clearing where the body had been hidden nothing was left to indicate that yesterday morning a pile of leaves had camouflaged a killing bladder campion english ivy nettles and wild strawberries remained untrampled despite the fact that every leaf on every plant had been scrutinised and evaluated by people trained to ferret out the truth he moved to the river and gazed across the wide expanse of marshy land that constituted coe fen along whose far edge the beige rise of the buildings of peterhouse lay he studied them admitting the fact that he could see them clearly admitting that at this distance their lightsespecially the light from one buildings lantern cupolawould probably glow visibly through all but the most impenetrable fog he admitted also that he was checking out sarah gordons story he admitted also that he could not have said why he began to turn from the river and caught on the air the unmistakable sour smell of human vomit just a solitary whiff of it like the breath of an illness that was passing by he tracked this to its source on the bank a coagulating pool of greenish brown slop it was lumpy and foul with the tracks and the peckmarks of birds sinking into it as he bent to examine it he could hear sergeant havers laconic comment her neighbours cleared her inspector her story checks out but you can always ask her what she had for brekkie and cart this in to forensic for a checkout as well perhaps he thought that was the problem he was having with sarah gordon everything about her story checked out completely there wasnt a hole anywhere why do you want a hole havers would have asked your job isnt to want holes your job is to find them and when you cant fi nd them you just move on he decided to do so following the trail of boards back the way he had come leaving the island he walked up the rise in the path that led up to the causeway bridge where a gate gave way to the pavement and the street directly across from it was a similar gate and he went to see what lay beyond it a morning jogger he realised coming along the river from the direction of st stephens would have three options upon reaching fen causeway a turn to the left and she would run past the department of engineering in the direction of parkers piece and the cambridge police station a turn to the right and she would head towards newnham road and if she persisted far enough to barton beyond it or he now saw she could proceed straight ahead crossing the street ducking through this second gate and continuing south along the river whoever killed her he realised must have not only known her route but also known her options whoever killed her he realised had known in advance that the only certain chance of catching her was at crusoes island he was feeling the cold beginning to seep through his clothes and he headed back the way he had come maintaining a slower pace this time one designed merely to keep himself warm as he made the final turn from senate house passage where senate house itself and the outer walls of gonville and caius college were acting like a refrigerated wind tunnel he saw sergeant havers emerging from the gatehouse of st stephens looking dwarfed by its turrets and its heraldic carving of yales supporting the founders coat of arms she gave his appearance a pokerfaced scrutiny going undercover inspector he joined her dont i blend in with the environment youre a regular bit of camoufl age your sincerity overwhelms me he explained what he had been doing ignoring the cocked and leery eyebrow which she raised at his references to sarah gordons corroborative vomit and finishing with id say elena ran the course in about five minutes havers but if she was intent on having a fairly long workout then she may have paced herself so ten at the extreme havers nodded she squinted down the lane in the direction of kings college saying if the porter really saw her leave round sixfi fteen and i think we can depend upon that then she got to the island far in advance of sarah gordon wouldnt you say unless she stopped off somewhere en route where adam jenn said his digs are by little st marys thats less than a block from part of elenas run are you saying she stopped off for a morning cuppa perhaps perhaps not but if adam was looking for her yesterday morning he wouldnt have had much trouble finding her would he they crossed over to ivy court wound their way through the ubiquitous rows of bicycles and headed towards o staircase i need a shower lynley said as long as i dont have to scrub your back when he returned from the shower he found her at his desk perusing the notes he had written on the previous night shed made herself at home scattering her belongings across the room one scarf on the bed another draped across the armchair her coat on the floor her shoulder bag gaped upon the desk top spilling out pencils chequebook a plastic comb with missing teeth and an orange lapel button printed with the message chicken little was right somewhere in this wing of the building shed managed to find a stocked gyp room for shed made a pot of tea some of which she was pouring into a goldrimmed cup i see youve brought out the best china he said towelling off his hair she tapped her finger against it the sound snapped sharply rather than sang plastic she said can your lips endure the insult theyll soldier through good she poured a cup for him there was milk as well but there were white globs floating in it so i left its future to science she dropped in two sugar cubes stirred the brew with one of her pencils and handed him the cup and would you please put on a shirt inspector youve got lovely pectorals but i tend to go lightheaded at the sight of a mans chest he obliged her by completing the dressing which hed begun in the icy bathroom down the corridor he took his tea to the armchair where he saw to his shoes what do you have he asked her she pushed his notebook to one side and swivelled the desk chair so that she was facing him she rested her right ankle on her left knee which gave him his first glimpse of her socks they were red weve got fibres she said on both armpits of her track jacket cotton polyester and rayon they could have come from something in her cupboard right yes theyre checking for a match so were wide open there no not exactly he saw she was holding back a satisfied smile the fibres were black ah yes my guess is that he dragged her by the armpits onto the island and left the fi bres that way he swam by that hook of potential culpability what about the weapon have they made any headway with what was used to beat her they keep coming up with the same description its smooth its heavy and it left no trace deposit on the body the only change in what we knew before is that theyve moved off calling it your standard blunt object theyve deleted the adjectives but theyre looking like the dickens for some others sheehan was talking about bringing in help to have a go with the body because apparently his two pathologists have a history of being incapable of coming to a clear conclusionnot to mention an agreementon anything he indicated there might be trouble with forensic lynley said he thought about the weapon pondered the location and said wood seems possible doesnt it havers as usual she was with him an oar you mean a paddle that would be my guess then wed have trace evidence a splinter a speck of varnish something left behind but theyve absolutely nothing not a sprat thats hell right were nowhere with trace evidence if were hoping to build a case out of that but theres good news otherwise lovely news in fact she brought forth several folded sheets of paper from her shoulder bag sheehan fielded the autopsy results while i was there we may not have trace but weve got ourselves a motive youve been saying that ever since we met lennart thorsson but this is better than being turned in for sexual harassment sir this is the real thing turn him in for this and hes had it for good turn him in for what she handed him the report elena weaver was pregnant which naturally brings up the question of those unused birth control pills doesnt it havers continued lynley fetched his spectacles from his jacket pocket returned to the chair and read the report shed been eight weeks pregnant it was now the fourteenth of november eight weeks took them back to sometime during the third week of september before cambridge was in session but he wondered was it also before elena herself had come to the city havers was saying and once i told him about them sheehan waxed anachronistically eloquent on the subject for a good ten minutes lynley roused himself what the pregnancy sir what about it she dropped her shoulders in disgust havent you been listening i was wondering about the time line was she in london when she became pregnant was she in cambridge he dismissed the questions momentarily what was sheehans point it sounded like a bit of victoriana but as sheehan put it in this environment we ought to be concentrating on archaic with a capital a and his conjecture has a nice feel to it sir she used a pencil to tap out each point against her knee sheehan suggested that elena had something going with a senior member of the college she came up pregnant she wanted marriage he wanted his career he knew hed be ruined for advancement if the word got out that hed made a student pregnant and she threatened to let the word out thinking that would bend him to her will but it didnt go as she planned he killed her instead youre still hanging on to lennart thorsson then it fits inspector and that address on seymour street that shed written on her calendar i checked it out and a health clinic according to the staff doctor who was only too happy to help the police with their enquiries elena was there on wednesday afternoon for a pregnancy test and we know thorsson went to see her thursday night he was done for inspector but it was worse than that why the birth control pills in her room the date on them was last february but they hadnt been taken sir i think elena was trying to get herself pregnant havers took a sip of tea your basic entrapment lynley frowned at the report removed his spectacles and polished them on the tail of havers scarf i dont see how that follows she merely might have stopped taking them because there was no reason to do sono man in her life when one came along she was unprepared rubbish havers said most women know in advance if theyre going to sleep with a man they generally know the moment they meet him but they dont know do they if theyre going to be raped all right given but youve got to see thorssons in line for that as well certainly but hes not alone havers and perhaps not even at the head of the queue a sharp double knock sounded on the door when lynley called out in acknowledgement the st stephens day porter popped his head inside the room message he said holding out a folded slip of paper thought it best to bring it over thank you lynley got to his feet the porter curled back his arm not for you inspector he said its for the sergeant havers took it from him with a nod of thanks the porter withdrew lynley watched his sergeant read her face fell she crumpled the paper crossing back to the desk he said easily i think weve done all we can for today havers he took out his watch its aftergood lord look at the time its after half past three already perhaps you ought to think about she dropped her head he watched her fumble with her shoulder bag he didnt have the heart to continue the pretence they werent bankers after all they didnt work businessmens hours its not working she said she fl ung the bit of paper into the rubbish basket i wish someone would tell me why the hell nothing ever seems to work out go home he said see to her ill handle things here theres too much for you to do its not fair it may not be fair but its also an order go home barbara you can be there by fi ve come back in the morning ill check out thorsson fi rst theres no need for that hes not going anywhere ill check him out anyway she took up her shoulder bag and picked her coat off the floor when she turned to him he saw that her nose and cheeks had become quite red he said barbara the right thing is sometimes the most obvious thing you know that dont you thats the hell of it she replied my husband isnt home inspector he and glyn have gone to make the funeral arrangements i think you can give me the information i need justine weaver looked beyond him to the drive where the fading afternoon light was winking along the right wing of his car brows drawn together she appeared to be trying to decide what to do about him she crossed her arms and pressed her fingers into the sleeves of her gabardine blazer it might have been a gesture to keep herself warm save for the fact that she didnt move away from the door to get out of the wind i dont see how ive told you everything i know about sunday night and monday morning but not i dare say everything you know about elena her eyes moved off the car to him hers he saw were morning glory blue and their colour needed no heightening through an appropriate choice of clothes although her presence at home at this hour suggested that she hadnt gone to work that day she was dressed with nearly as much formality as she had been on the previous night in a taupe blazer a blouse buttoned to the throat and printed with the soft impression of small leaves and slim wool trousers shed swept her long hair off her face with a single comb she said i think you ought to speak with anthony inspector lynley smiled indeed in the street the double tin ringing of a bicycle bell was met by the answering honk of a horn closer by three hawfinches swept in an arc from the roof to the ground their distinctive calltziklike a repetitive singleword conversation they hopped on the drive and pecked at the gravel and as one unit shot into the air again justine followed their flight to a cypress on the edge of the lawn then she said come in and stepped back from the door she took his overcoat from him smoothed it round the newel post at the bottom of the stairs and led him into the sitting room where they had met on the previous night unlike the previous night however she made no offer of refreshment instead she went to the glass tea table along the wall and made a small adjustment to its arrangement of silk tulips that done she turned to face him hands clasped loosely in front of her in that setting dressed and posed as she was she looked like a mannequin lynley wondered what it took to fracture her control he said when did elena arrive in cambridge for michaelmas term this year the term began the first week of october im aware of that i was wondering if she came here in advance perhaps to stay with you and her father it would take a few days to settle into the college i should think her father would want to help her her right hand slowly climbed her left arm stopping just above the elbow where her thumbnail dug in and began to trace a circular pattern she must have arrived sometime towards the middle of september because we had a gathering for some of the history faculty on the thirteenth and she was here for the party i remember that shall i check the calendar do you need the exact date when she came to us she stayed here with you and your husband when she first came to town as much as elena could be said to stay anywhere she was on the go in and out most of the time she liked to be active all night her hand climbed to her shoulder then rested beneath the collar of her blouse like a cradle for her neck thats a curious question what is it youre asking elena was eight weeks pregnant when she died a quick tremor passed across her face like a frisson that was emotional rather than physical before he could assess it she had dropped her eyes her hand however remained at her throat you knew lynley said she looked up no but im not surprised because of someone she was seeing someone you knew about her gaze went from him to the sitting room doorway as if she expected to see elenas lover standing there mrs weaver lynley said right now were looking directly at a possible motive for your stepdaughters murder if you know something id appreciate your telling me about it this should come from anthony not from me why because i was her stepmother she returned her gaze to him it was remarkably cool do you understand i dont have the sort of rights you seem to think i have rights to speak ill of this particular dead if you will you didnt like elena thats obvious enough but all things considered youre hardly in a unique situation no doubt youre one of millions of women who dont much care for the children theyve been saddled with through a second marriage children who generally arent murdered inspector the stepmothers secret hope transformed into reality he saw the answer in her instinctive shrinking away from him as he asked the question quietly he said its no crime mrs weaver and youre not the first person to have your blackest wish granted beyond your wildest dreams she left the tea table abruptly and walked to the sofa where she sat not leaning back against it not sinking into it but perched on the edge with her hands in her lap and her back like a rod she said please sit down inspector lynley when he did so taking a place in the leather armchair that faced the sofa she continued all right i knew that elena wasshe seemed to be searching for an appropriate euphemismsexual sexually active and when she nodded pressing her lips together as if with the intention of smoothing out the salmon lipstick she wore lynley said did she tell you it was obvious i could smell it on her when she had sex she didnt always bother with washing herself afterwards and its a rather distinctive odour isnt it you didnt counsel her your husband didnt speak to her about her hygiene justines expression was mildly if only distantly amused i think anthony preferred to remain oblivious of what his nose was telling him and you i tried to talk to her several times at fi rst i thought that she might not be aware of how she ought to be taking care of herself i also thought it might be wise to find out if she was taking precautions against pregnancy frankly id never got the impression that she and glyn engaged in many motherdaughter conversations she didnt want to talk to you i take it on the contrary she did talk in fact she was rather entertained by what i had to say she informed me that shed been on the pill since she was fourteen years old when she began fuckingher word inspector not minethe father of one of her school friends whether thats true or not i have no idea as to her personal hygiene elena knew all about how to take care of herself she went unwashed deliberately she wanted people to know she was having sex particularly i think she wanted her father to know what gave you that impression there were times when shed come by quite late and we were still up and shed hang on her father and hug him and press her cheek against his and rub up against him and all the time she was reeking like justines fi ngers felt for her wedding band was she trying to arouse him i thought so at first who wouldnt have thought so with her carrying on like that but then i began to think that she merely was trying to rub his face in normal it was a curious expression an act of defi ance no not at all an act of compliance she must have seen the next query on his face for she went on with im being normal daddy see how normal i am im partying and drinking and having regular sex isnt this what you wanted didnt you want a normal child lynley saw how her words reaffi rmed the picture which terence cuff had painted obliquely on the previous night about anthony weavers relationship with his daughter i know he didnt want her to sign lynley said but as for the rest inspector he didnt want her to be deaf nor did glyn for that matter elena knew this how could she help knowing theyd spent her entire life trying to shape her into a normal woman the very thing she could never hope to be because she was deaf yes for the first time justines posture altered she leaned forward fractionally to make her point deafisntnormal inspector she waited for a moment before going on looking as if she were gauging his reaction and he did feel the reaction course swiftly through him it was an aversion of the sort he always felt when someone made a comment that was xenophobic homophobic or racist you see she said you want to make her normal as well you even want to call her normal and condemn me for daring to suggest that being deaf is different i can see it on your face deaf is as normal as anything else which is exactly what anthony wanted to think so you cant really judge him can you for wanting to describe his daughter in the very same way as youve just done there was sheer cool insight behind the words lynley wondered how much time and reflection had gone into justine weavers being able to make such a detached evaluation but elena could judge him and she did just that adam jenn told me he saw her occasionally at your husbands request justine returned to her original upright position anthony had hopes that elena might attach herself to adam could he be the one who made her pregnant then i dont think so adam only met her this past september at the faculty party i mentioned earlier but if she became pregnant shortly thereafter justine dismissed this by quickly raising her hand from her lap to stop his words shed been having sex frequently since the previous december long before she knew adam once again she seemed to anticipate his next question youre wondering how i could know that so defi nitely it was nearly a year ago after all shed come in to show us the gown shed bought for the christmas ball she undressed to try it on and she hadnt washed she hadnt washed who took her to the ball gareth randolph the deaf boy lynley reflected upon the fact that gareth randolphs name was becoming like a constant undercurrent omnipresent beneath the flow of information he evaluated the manner in which elena weaver might have used him as an instrument of revenge if she was acting out of a need to rub her fathers face in his own desire that she be a normal functioning woman what better way to throw that desire back at him than to become pregnant shed be giving him what he ostensibly wanteda normal daughter with normal needs and normal emotions whose body functioned in a perfectly normal way at the same time shed be getting what she wantedretaliation by choosing as the father of her child a deaf man it was at heart a perfect circle of vengeance he only wondered if elena had been that devious or if her stepmother was using the fact of the pregnancy to paint a portrait of the girl that would serve her own ends he said since january elena had marked her calendar periodically with the small drawing of a fish does that mean anything to you a fi sh a pencil drawing similar to the symbol used for christianity it appears several times each week its on the calendar the night before she died a fi sh yes as ive said a fi sh i cant think of what it might mean a society she belonged to a person she was meeting you make her life sound like a spy novel inspector it appears to be something clandestine wouldnt you agree why why not just write out whatever the fi sh stood for perhaps it was too long perhaps it was easier to draw the fish it cant mean much why would she worry about someone else seeing something she was putting on her personal calendar it was probably shorthand a device she used to remind herself of something a supervision perhaps or an assignation considering how elena was telegraphing her sexual activity inspector i hardly think shed be disguising an assignation when it came to her own calendar perhaps she had to perhaps she only wanted her father to know what she was doing but not with whom and hed have seen her calendar hed have been in her room so she might not have wanted him to see the name lynley waited for her to respond when she did not do so he said elena had birth control pills in her desk but she hadnt taken them since february can you explain that only in the most obvious way im afraid she wanted to get pregnant but that doesnt surprise me it was after all the normal thing to do love a man have his baby you and your husband have no children mrs weaver the quick change in subject tagged logically onto her own statement seemed to take her momentarily aback her lips parted briefl y her gaze went to the wedding photograph on the tea table she appeared to straighten her spine even further but it may have been the result of the breath she took before she replied quite evenly we have no children he waited to see if she would say more relying upon the fact that his own silence had so often in the past proved more effective than the most pointed question in pressuring someone into disclosure moments ticked by outside the sitting room window a sudden gust of wind tossed a spray of field maple leaves against the glass they looked like a billowing saffron cloud justine said will there be anything else and smoothed her hand along the perfect knifeedged crease in her trousers it was a gesture which eloquently declared her the victor if only for an instant in the brief battle of their wills he admitted defeat standing and saying not at the moment she walked with him to the front door and handed him his overcoat her expression he saw was no different from what it had been when she first admitted him into the house he wanted to marvel at the degree to which she had herself under control but instead he found himself wondering whether it was a matter of mastering any revealing emotions or a matter of havingor experiencingthose emotions in the first place he told himself it was to assess this latter possibility rather than to meet the challenge of cracking the composure of someone who seemed so invulnerable that he asked his fi nal question an artist from grantchester found elenas body yesterday morning he said sarah gordon do you know her quickly she bent to pick up the stem of a leaf which lay barely discernible on the parquet floor she rubbed her finger along the spot where she had found it back and forth three or four times as if the minuscule stem had somehow damaged the wood when she had seen to it to her satisfaction she stood again no she said she met his eyes directly i dont know sarah gordon it was a bravura performance he nodded opened the door and walked out onto the drive round the corner of the house an irish setter bounded gracefully towards them a dirty tennis ball in his mouth he vaulted past the bentley and hurtled onto the lawn making a joyful racecourse of its perimeter before he leaped over a white wrought iron table and dashed across the drive to land in a happy heap at lynleys feet he loosened his jaws and deposited the ball on the drive tail wagging hopefully and silky coat rippling like soft reeds in the wind lynley picked up the ball and flung it beyond the cypress tree with a yelp of delight the dog hurtled after it once again he raced round the edge of the lawn once more he leaped over the wrought iron table once more he landed in a heap at lynleys feet again his eyes said again again she always came to play with him in the late afternoon justine said hes waiting for her he doesnt know that shes gone adam said the dog ran with you and elena in the morning lynley said did you take him yesterday when you went alone i didnt want the trouble hed have wanted to head in the direction of the river i wasnt going that way and i didnt want him to fi ght me lynley rubbed his knuckles on the top of the setters head when he stopped the dog used his nose to flip the hand back into appropriate petting position once again lynley smiled whats his name she called him townee justine didnt allow herself to react until she reached the kitchen and even then she wasnt aware she was reacting until she saw that her handgrasping the water glasswas clenched solidly round it as if shed been suddenly afflicted by a stroke she turned on the tap let the water flow held the glass beneath it she felt as if every argument and discussion every moment of pleading every second of emptiness over the last few years had somehow been both concentrated and compressed into a single statement you and your husband have no children and she herself had given the detective the opening to make that observation love a man have his baby but not here not now not in this house not with this man with the water still running she brought the glass to her lips and forced herself to drink she filled the glass a second time forced the water down again she filled it a third time and drank again only then did she turn off the tap raise her eyes from the sink and look out the kitchen window into the rear garden where two grey wagtails bobbed up and down on the edge of the birdbath while a plump woodpigeon watched them from the sloping tile roof of the garden shed for a while she had harboured the secret hope that she might arouse him to such an extent that he simply lost himselflost his controlin the desire to have her shed even taken to reading books in which she was alternately advised to be playful to keep him offguard to become his fantasy whore to sensitise her own body to stimulation so that she might more readily understand his to become aware of erogenous zones to demand expect require an orgasm to vary positions locations times and circumstances to be aloof to be warm to be honest to be submissive all of the reading and all of the advice left her nothing more than bewildered it did not change her nor did it alter the fact that nothingno amount of sighing moaning coaxing or stimulatingkept anthony from rising from her at the crucial moment fumbling in the drawer tearing open the package and sheathing himself with a millimetres despicable latex protection her punishment for having threatened in the heat of a wretchedly futile argument to stop taking the pills without his knowledge he had one child he would not have another he could not betray elena again he had walked out on her and he would not make the implied rejection worse by having another child that elena might see as a replacement for herself or a competitor for her fathers love nor would he run the risk of her thinking that he was seeking to satisfy his own needs of ego by producing a child who could hear they had talked about it all before they married he had been forthright from the first letting her know that children between them were out of the question considering his age and his responsibilities to elena at the time twentyfive years old and just three years into a career at which she was determined to be a success the idea of having a child had been remote her attention had been fixed upon the world of publishing and upon her rise to significance within it but if the passage of ten years had brought her a fi ne degree of professional successthirtyfive years old and publishing director of a highly respected pressit also brought her one step closer to the immutable fact of her own mortality and to the need to leave behind something that was her own creation and not the product of someone else each month ticked its way through another cycle each egg washed away in a rush of blood each gasp of completion her husband experienced marked another wasting of the possibility of life but elena had been pregnant justine wanted to howl she wanted to weep she wanted to pull her lovely wedding china from the cupboard and hurl every piece of it against the wall she wanted to overturn furniture and smash picture frames and drive her fist through the windows but instead she lowered her eyes to the glass which she held and she placed it with careful decided precision into the unblemished porcelain sink she thought of the times she had observed anthony watching his daughter how that blaze of blind love had burned its way across his face and all the while confronted with this she had still managed a disciplined restraint holding her tongue rather than speaking the truth and running the risk of his concluding that she did not share his love for elena elena the wild and contradictory currents of life that ran through herthe restless fierce energy the probing mind the exuberant humour the deep black anger and always beneath everything that impassioned need for unequivocal acceptance at continual war with her desire for revenge she had managed to achieve it justine wondered with what sort of anticipation elena had looked forward to the moment when she would tell her father about her pregnancy exacting a payment beyond his every expectation for the wellintentioned but nonetheless revealing crime of wanting her to be like everyone else how elena must have triumphed in the potential embarrassment to her father and how she herself ought to be feeling some small degree of triumph at the idea of being in possession of a fact that would forever dispel anthonys illusions about his daughter she was after all so decidedly glad that elena was dead justine turned from the sink and walked into the dining room and from there to the sitting room the house was still with only the sound of the wind outside rushing through the creaking branches of an old liquidambar she felt suddenly chilled and pressed her palm to her forehead and then to her cheeks wondering if she was coming down with something and then she sat on the sofa hands folded in her lap and regarded the neat symmetrical pile of artificial coals in the fi replace well be giving her a home he had said when hed learned that elena would be coming up to cambridge well be filling her with love nothing justine is more important than that for the first time since receiving anthonys distraught telephone call at work the previous day justine thought about how elenas death might actually affect her marriage for how many times had anthony spoken of the importance of providing a stable home for elena outside the college and how often had he alluded to the longevity of their tenyear marriage as a shining example of the kind of devotion loyalty and regenerative love which every couple sought and few couples found describing it as an island of tranquillity to which his daughter could retreat and gain sustenance to face the challenges and battles of her life were both gemini he had said were the twins justine you and i the two of us against the world shell see that shell know it itll give her support elena would bask and grow in the radiance of their marital love she would come to her womanhood better for the experience of having been exposed to a marriage that was solid and happy and loving and complete that had been the plan anthonys dream and clinging to it in the face of all odds had allowed them both to continue to live in the middle of a lie justine looked from the fireplace to her wedding photograph they were sittinghad it been some sort of benchwith anthony behind her his hair longer then but his moustache still conservatively trimmed and his spectacles the same wirerimmed frames they were both of them gazing intently at the camera halfsmiling as if a show of too much happiness might belie the seriousness of their undertaking it is after all a sober business to embark upon establishing the perfect marriage but their bodies werent touching in the picture his arm wasnt embracing her his hands didnt reach forward to cover her own it was as if the photographer who had posed them had somehow seen a truth that they themselves had been unaware of it was as if the photograph itself would not lie for the first time justine saw what the possibilities were if she did not take action no matter how little to her liking that action was townee was still playing in the front garden when she left the house rather than take the time to shut him up at the rear of the house or in the garage she called to him opened the car door and let him leap inside unbothered by the fact that he left a muddy paw print on the passenger seat there wasnt time to consider a minor inconvenience like soiled upholstery the car started with the purr of a welltuned engine she reversed down the drive and turned east into adams road heading towards the city like all men he was most likely a creature of habit so hed be fi nishing his day near midsummer common the last of the sunlight fanned out behind the clouds casting apricot beacons into the sky and throwing the fretedged shadows of trees like lace silhouettes across the road in the passenger seat townee barked his approval at the sight of hedgerows and cars dashing by he shifted his weight from right to left front paw he whined with excitement clearly he thought they were engaged in a game and it was a game of sorts she supposed but although all the players had taken their positions the rules were nonexistent and only the most skilful opportunist among them would be able to shape the horrors of the last thirty hours into a victory that would outlast grief the college boathouses lined the north side of the river cam they faced south looking across the river and onto the expanse of midsummer common where in the quickfalling darkness a young girl was grooming one of two horses her yellow hair streaming out from beneath a cowboy hat and great streaks of mud on the sides of her boots the horse tossed his head flicked his tail and fought against her efforts but the girl controlled him the open land made the wind seem both stronger and colder as justine got out of the car snapping the lead onto townees collar three pieces of orange paper soared like rising birds into her face she brushed them away one fell against the bonnet of her peugeot she saw elenas picture it was a handout from deastu calling for information she grabbed it before it could blow away and stuffed it into the pocket of her coat she headed towards the river at this time of day none of the rowing teams were out on the water they generally used the morning for their practices but the individual boathouses were themselves still open a row of elegant facades fronting nothing more than capacious sheds inside these some oarsmen and women were ending their day in the way they had begun it with talk about the season that would come with the end of lent term everything now was focussed upon preparation for that time of competition selfconfidence and hopes had not yet been dashed by the sight of an unexpected eight flying by as if air and not water were the element against which they matched their strength justine and townee followed the slow curve of the river the dog straining at the lead and eager to make the acquaintance of four mallards who swam away from the bank at his approach he bounded and barked and justine wrapped his lead round her hand and gave it a quick tug behave she told him this isnt a run but of course he would think they were meant to run here it was water after all it was what he was used to ahead of them a lone rower was bringing in a scull moving against the wind and the current at a furious clip justine could imagine that she heard him breathing for even at this distance and in the failing light she could see the sheen of sweat on his face and she could well envision the heaving of chest that must accompany it she walked to the edge of the river he didnt look up at once as he brought the craft in rather he remained bent over the oars his head resting on his hands his hair thinning at the top and curly elsewherewas damp and clung to his skull like a newborns ringlets justine wondered how long he had been rowing and whether the activity had done anything at all to assuage whatever emotion he might have felt when first he heard about elenas death and he had heard about it justine knew that from watching him although he rowed daily he wouldnt have still been here in the dusk the wind and the stinging cold had he not needed to find a physical manner in which he could purge himself of his feelings at townees whimper to be off and running the man looked up for a moment he said nothing nor did justine the only sound between them was the scuffling of the dogs nails on the path the warning honk of ducks who felt the other animals proximity and the blare of rock and roll music coming from one of the boathouses u justine thought a song she recognised but could not have named he got out of the scull and stood on the bank next to her and she realised irrelevantly that shed forgotten how short he was perhaps two inches shorter than her own five feet nine he said with a futile gesture at the scull i didnt know what else to do you might have gone home he gave a virtually soundless laugh it was a reply not of humour but affirmation he touched his fingers to townees head he looks good healthy she took good care of him justine reached into her pocket and pulled out the handout which had fl own against her she gave it to him have you seen this he read it he ran his fingers over the black print and then across the picture of elena ive seen it he said thats how i found out no one phoned i didnt know i saw it in the senior combination room when i went in for coffee about ten oclock this morning and then he looked across the river to midsummer common where the girl was leading her horse in the direction of fort st george i didnt know what to do were you home sunday night victor he didnt look at her as he shook his head was she with you for a time and then she went back to st stephens i stayed in my rooms he finally looked her way how did you know about us did she tell you last september the drinks party you made love to elena during the party victor oh god in the bathroom upstairs she followed me up she came in she he rubbed his hand along his jawline he looked as if he hadnt shaved that day for the stubble was thick like a bruise on his skin did you take off all your clothes christ justine did you no we stood against the wall i lifted her up she wanted it that way i see all right i wanted it as well against the wall just like that did she tell you she was pregnant yes she told me and and what what did you plan to do about it hed been looking at the river but now he turned back to her i planned to marry her he said it wasnt the answer she had come prepared to hear although the more she thought about it the less it surprised her it did leave however a slight problem unresolved victor she said where was your wife sunday night what was rowena doing while you were having elena lynley was relieved to fi nd gareth randolph in the offices of deastu cambridge universitys odd acronym for the deaf students union he had tried his room at queens college first only to be directed to fenners the central gymnasium for university sports where the boxing team worked out for two hours each day there however in the smaller of the two gyms where he was assailed by the eyeprickling smells of sweat damp leather athletic tape chalk and unwashed workout clothes lynley had questioned a lorrysized heavyweight who had pointed his sideofbeef fist in the direction of the exit and said that the bantapparently a reference to gareths bantamweightwas sitting by the phones at deastu hoping for a call about the bird who got killed she was his woman the heavyweight said hes taking it hard and he drove his fi sts like battering rams into the punching bag which hung from the ceiling putting his shoulders into each blow with such force that it seemed as if the floor shook beneath him lynley wondered if gareth randolph was as powerful a fighter in his own weight class he considered this question on the way to deastu anthony weaver had made allegations about the boy that he could not avoid coupling with havers report from the cambridge police whatever elena had been beaten with it had left no trace deastu was housed in the basement of the peterhouse library not far from the university graduate centre just at the bottom of little st marys lane little more than two blocks from queens college where gareth randolph lived its offices were tucked at the end of a lowceilinged corridor illuminated by bright round globes of light they had two means of access one through the lubbock room on the ground floor of the library and the other directly from the street at the rear of the building not fifty yards away from the mill lane footbridge across which elena weaver had to have run on the morning of her death the main office door of opaque glass bore the words deaf students of cambridge university and beneath that the less formal deastu was superimposed over two hands crossed fingers extended palms outward lynley had given lengthy thought to how he was going to communicate with gareth randolph he had played round with the idea of calling superintendent sheehan to see if he had an interpreter associated with the cambridge police hed never spoken with anyone deaf before and from what he had gathered over the last twentyfour hours gareth randolph did not have elena weavers facility for reading lips nor did he have her spoken language once inside the office however he saw that things would take care of themselves for talking to a woman who sat behind a desk piled with pamphlets papers and books was a knobbyankled bespectacled girl with her hair in plaits and a pencil stuck behind her ear as she chatted and laughed she was signing simultaneously she also turned in his direction at the sound of the door opening here lynley thought would be his interpreter gareth randolph the woman behind the desk said in answer to lynleys question and after an inspection of his warrant card hes just in the conference room bernadette will you and then to lynley i assume you dont sign inspector i dont bernadette adjusted the pencil more fi rmly behind her ear grinned sheepishly at this momentary display of selfimportance and said right come along with me inspector well see whats what she led him back the way he had come and then down a short corridor whose ceiling was lined with pipes painted white she said gareths been here most of the day hes not doing very well because of the murder he had a thing for elena everyone knew it did you know elena yourself just to see her the otherswith a jutting out of her elbows to encompass the area and presumably the membership of deastu they sometimes like to have an interpreter go with them to their lectures just to make sure they dont miss anything important thats my function by the way interpreting i make extra money to see me through the term that way i get to hear some pretty decent lectures as well i did a special stephen hawking lecture last week what a job that was trying to sign astrophysical whatevers it was like a foreign language i can well imagine the lecture hall was so quiet youd have thought god was putting in an appearance and after it was over everyone stood and applauded and she rubbed the side of her nose with her index finger hes rather special i quite felt like crying lynley smiled liking her but you never interpreted for elena weaver she didnt use an interpreter i dont think she liked to she wanted people to think she could hear not so much that bernadette said i think she was proud that she could read lips its difficult to do especially if someones born deaf my mum and dadtheyre both deaf you seethey never learned to read much beyond three quid please and ta but elena was amazing how involved was she with the deaf students union bernadette wrinkled her nose thoughtfully i couldnt really say garethll be able to tell you though hes in here she led him into a conference room that was roughly the size of an academic classroom it contained little more than a large rectangular table covered by green linen at this a young man was sitting bent over a notebook lank hair the colour of old wet straw fell across his wide brow and into his eyes as he wrote he paused to chew at the fingernails of his left hand bernadette said wait a sec and from the door she flashed the lights off and on gareth randolph looked up he got slowly to his feet and as he did so he gathered up from the table a large pile of used tissues crushing them into a wad in his fist he was a tall boy lynley saw with a pallid complexion against which the scattered pits of old acne scars stood out in crimson he wore typical student garb blue jeans and a sweatshirt onto which had been stencilled the words whats your sign superimposed over two hands making a gesture which lynley couldnt interpret the boy said nothing at all until bernadette spoke and even then since his eyes were on lynley he made a rough gesture so that bernadette had to repeat her fi rst remark this is inspector lynley from new scotland yard she said a second time her hands fluttered like quick pale birds just below her face hes come to talk to you about elena weaver the boys eyes went back to lynley he looked him over from head to toe he replied hands chopping the air and bernadette interpreted simultaneously not in here fine lynley said wherever he likes bernadettes hands flew over lynleys words but as they did she continued with speak to gareth directly inspector call him you not him else its quite dehumanising gareth read and smiled his gestures in response to bernadettes were fluid she laughed what did he say he said ta bernie well make you a deaf woman yet gareth led them out of the conference room and back down the hall to an unventilated office made overly warm by a wheezing radiator inside there was not much space for more than a desk metal bookshelves on the walls three plastic chairs and a separate birch veneer table on which stood a ceephone identical to those that lynley had seen elsewhere lynley realised with his first question that he would be at a disadvantage in this sort of interview since gareth watched bernadettes hands in order to read lynleys words there would not be an opportunity to catch a revealing if fleeting expression quickly veiled in his eyes should a question take him unaware additionally there would be nothing to read in his voice in his tone in what he stressed or what he deliberately left unaccentuated gareth had the advantage of the silence that defi ned his world lynley wondered how and if he would use it ive been hearing a great deal about your relationship with elena weaver lynley said dr cuff from st stephens apparently brought you together for her own good gareth replied the hands again sharp and staccato in the air to help her maybe save her through deastu elena wasnt deaf that was the problem she could have been but she wasnt they wouldnt allow it lynley frowned what do you mean everyones said gareth scowled and grabbed a piece of paper with a green felttip pen he scrawled out two words deaf and deaf he drew three heavy lines under the upper case d and shoved the paper across the desk bernadette spoke as lynley looked at the two words her hands included gareth in the conversation what he means inspector is that elena was deaf with a lower case d she was disabled everyone else round here gareth especiallyis deaf with an upper case d d for different lynley asked thinking how this assessment went legions to support justine weavers words to him that day gareths hands took over different yes how could we not be different we live without sound but its more than that being deaf is a culture being deaf is a handicap elena was deaf lynley pointed to the first of the two words but you wanted her to be deaf like you wouldnt you want a friend to run instead of crawl im not sure i follow the analogy gareth shoved his chair backwards it screeched against the linoleum fl oor he went to the bookshelf and pulled down two large leatherbound albums he dropped them onto the desk lynley saw that across each was imprinted the acronym deastu with the year beneath it this is deaf gareth resumed his seat lynley opened one of the albums at random it appeared to be a record of the activities in which the deaf students had engaged during the previous year each term had its own identifying page on which michaelmas lent or easter had been written in fi ne calligraphy the record consisted of both written documents and photographs it encompassed everything from deastus american football team whose plays were called by students on the sidelines who beat an enormous drum to signal the team via vibrationcode to dances held with the aid of powerful speakers which conveyed the rhythm of the music in much the same way to picnics and meetings in which dozens of hands moved at once and dozens of faces lit with animation bernadette said over lynleys shoulder thats called windmilling inspector what when everyone signs at once like that all their hands are going like windmills lynley continued through the book he saw three rowing teams whose strokes were orchestrated by coxswains utilising small red fl ags a tenmember percussion group who used the movement of an oversized metronome to keep their pulsating rhythm together grinning men and women in camouflage setting out with banners that read deastu search and pellet a group of flamenco dancers another of gymnasts and in every photograph participants in an activity were surrounded and supported by people whose hands spoke the language of commonality lynley returned the album its quite a group he said its not a group its a life gareth replaced the albums deaf is a culture did elena want to be deaf she didnt know what deaf was until she came to deastu she was taught to think that deaf meant disabled thats not the impression ive been getting lynley said from what i understand her parents did everything possible to allow her to fit into a hearing world they taught her to read lips they taught her to speak it seems to me that the last thing they thought was that deaf meant disabled especially in her case gareths nostrils flared he said fug at sht fug t and began to sign with hands that pounded through his words there is no fitting into a hearing world theres only bringing the hearing world to us make them see us as people as good as they are but her father wanted her to play at hearing read lips like a pretty girl talk like a pretty girl that cant be a crime it is after all a hearing world that we live in a hearing world you live in the rest of us without sound get on fine we dont want your hearing but you cant believe that can you because you think youre special instead of just different again it was only a slight variation on the theme justine weaver had introduced the deaf werent normal but then for gods sake neither were the hearing most of the time gareth was continuing we are her people deastu here we can support we can understand but he didnt want that he didnt want her to know us her father he wanted to make believe she could hear how did she feel about that how would you feel if people wanted you to play at being something you werent lynley repeated his earlier question did she want to be deaf she didnt know i understand that she didnt know what it meant at first that she had no way of understanding the culture but once she did know did she want to be deaf she would have wanted it eventually it was a telling response the uninformed once informed had not become an adherent to the cause so she involved herself with deastu solely because dr cuff insisted because it was the only way to avoid being sent down at first that was why but then she came to meetings to dances she was getting to know people was she getting to know you gareth yanked open the centre drawer of the desk he took out a pack of gum and unwrapped a stick bernadette began to reach forward to get his attention but lynley stopped her saying hell look up in a moment gareth let the moment drag on but lynley felt it was probably harder for the boy to keep his eyes fixed upon and his fingers working over the silver wrapper of the juicy fruit than it was for himself to wait him out when at last he looked up lynley said elena weaver was eight weeks pregnant bernadette cleared her throat she said my goodness then sorry and her hands conveyed the information gareths eyes went to lynley and then beyond him to the closed door of the offi ce he chewed his gum with what looked like deliberate slowness its scent was liquid sugar in the air when he replied his hands moved as slowly as his jaws i didnt know that you werent her lover he shook his head according to her stepmother shed been seeing someone regularly since december of last year her calendar indicates that with a symbol a fish that wasnt you you would have first been introduced to her round then wouldnt you i saw her i knew her it was what dr cuff wanted but i wasnt her lover a bloke at fenners called her your woman gareth took a second stick of gum unwrapped it rolled it into a tube popped it into his mouth did you love her again his eyes dropped lynley thought of the wad of tissues in the conference room he looked once again at the boys pallid face he said you dont mourn someone you dont love gareth even though the boys attention was not on bernadettes hands bernadette said he wanted to marry her inspector i know that because he told me once and he perhaps sensing the conversation gareth looked up his hands fl ashed quickly i was telling him the truth bernadette said i said you wanted to marry her he knows you loved her gareth its completely obvious past loved gareths fists were on his chest more like a punch than a sign it was over when did it end she didnt fancy me thats not really an answer she fancied someone else who i dont know i dont care i thought we were together and we werent that was it when did she make this clear to you recently gareth he looked sullen dont remember sunday night is that why you were arguing with her oh dear bernadette murmured although she cooperatively continued to sign i didnt know she was pregnant she didnt tell me that but as to the other the man she loved she told you about that that was sunday night wasnt it bernadette said oh inspector you cant really think that gareth had anything to do gareth lunged across the desk and grabbed bernadettes hands then he jerked out a few signs whats he saying he doesnt want me to defend him he says theres nothing for me to defend youre an engineering undergraduate arent you lynley asked gareth nodded he said and the engineering labs by fen causeway isnt it did you know elena weaver ran that way in the morning did you ever see her run did you ever go with her you want to think i killed her because she wouldnt have me was his reply you think i was jealous youve got it figured that i killed her because she was giving some other bloke what she wouldnt give me its a fairly solid motive isnt it bernadette gave a tiny mewl of protest gareth said maybe the bloke who got her pregnant killed her maybe he didnt fancy her as much as she fancied him but you dont know who he was gareth shook his head lynley had the distinct impression he was lying and yet he couldnt at the moment come up with a reason why gareth randolph would lie about the identity of the man who made elena pregnant especially if he truly believed that man might be her killer unless he intended to take care of dealing with the man himself in his own time on his own terms and with a blue in boxing hed have the odds on his side if it came to taking another by surprise even as lynley dwelt on this thought he realised there was yet another possible reason why gareth might choose not to cooperate with the police if he was savouring elenas death at the same time as he mourned it what better way to prolong his enjoyment than to lengthen the time it would take to bring the criminal to justice how often had a jilted lover believed that a crime of violence perpetrated by someone else was exactly what the loved one deserved lynley rose to his feet and nodded to the boy he said thank you for your time and turned to the door on the back of it he saw what he hadnt had the opportunity to notice when he had entered the room it was hung with a calendar on which the entire year was visible at one glance so it was not avoidance that had made gareth randolph shift his eyes to the door when lynley had told him of elena weavers pregnancy hed forgotten about the bells theyd rung at oxford as well when he was an undergraduate but somehow the years had taken that memory from him now as he stepped out of the peterhouse library and began the walk back to st stephens college the resonant calling of the faithful to evensong formed an auditory backdroplike antiphonal chantingfrom college chapels across the city it was he thought one of lifes most joyous sounds this ringing of bells and he found himself regretting the fact that the span of time in which he had given himself over to learning how to understand the criminal mind had allowed him to forget the sheer pleasure of church bells ringing into an autumn wind he let sound itself become his most conscious perception as he strolled past the old overgrown graveyard of little st marys church and made the turn onto trumpington where the jingle of bicycle bells and the metallic clicking of their unoiled gears joined the rumble of evening traffi c go on jack a young man shouted to a retreating bike rider from the doorway of a grocers shop as lynley passed well catch you up at the anchor all right right a vague call in return caught on the wind three girls walked by engaged in a heated discussion about that sod robert they were followed by an older woman high heels snapping against the pavement pushing a crying baby in a pram and then lurched by a blackgarbed figure of uncertain sex from the folds of whose voluminous coat and trailing scarves came the plaintive notes of swing low sweet chariot played on harmonica through it all lynley heard bernadette giving voice to gareths angry words we dont want your hearing but you cant believe that can you because you think youre special instead of just bloody different he wondered if this had marked the crucial difference between gareth randolph and elena weaver we dont want your hearing for because of her parents wellintentioned if perhaps arguably misguided efforts on her behalf elena had been taught to know every moment of her life that something was missing she had been given something to want so how could gareth ever have hoped to win her over to a lifestyle and a culture that she had been taught from birth to reject and overcome he wondered what it had been like for the two of them gareth dedicated to his people seeking to make elena one of them and elena merely following the dictates laid down by the master of her college had she feigned interest in deastu had she feigned enthusiasm and if she did neither if she felt contempt what kind of effect would this have had on the young man who had been given the unwanted assignment of steering her into a society so foreign to that which she had always known lynley wondered what kind of blameif anyought to be assessed upon the weavers for the efforts they had made with their daughter for in spite of the manner in which they had apparently tried to create an inaccurate fantasy out of the reality of their daughters life hadnt they in fact given elena what gareth himself had never known hadnt they given her her own form of hearing and if that was the case if elena did move with a relative degree of comfort in a world in which gareth felt himself an alien how could he come to terms with the fact that he had fallen in love with someone who shared neither his culture nor his dreams lynley paused in front of the multispired gatehouse of kings college where lights shone brightly from the porters lodge he stared unseeing at the collection of bicycles leaning this way and that a young man was scrawling some sort of notice on a blackboard beneath the gate while a chatting group of blackgowned academics hurried across the lawn towards the chapel with that selfimportant stride that appeared to be inherent to senior members of all the colleges who were blessed with the privilege of setting foot to grass he listened to the continuing echo of the bells with great st marys just across kings parade calling out in a ceaseless sonorous petition for prayer each note cast itself into the emptiness of market hill just beyond the church each building there caught the sound and flung it back into the night he listened he thought he knew he was intellectually capable of getting to the root of elena weavers death but as the evening continued to swell with sound he wondered if he was unprejudicially capable of getting to the root of elenas life he was bringing to the job at hand the preconceptions of a member of the hearing world he wasnt sure how to shed themor even if he needed to do soin order to get at the truth behind her killing but he did know that only through coming to an understanding of elenas own vision of herself could he also understand the relationships she shared with other people andall previous thoughts on crusoes island asidefor the moment at least it seemed that these relationships had to be the key to what had happened to her at the far end of the north range of front court an amber rhombus of light melted out onto the lawn as the south door to kings college chapel slowly opened the faint sound of organ music drifted on the wind lynley shivered turned up the collar of his overcoat and decided to join the college for evensong perhaps a hundred people had gathered in the chapel where the chóir was just fi ling down the aisle passing beneath the magnifi cent florentine screen atop of which angels held brass trumpets aloft they were led by cross and incensebearers the latter filling the icy chapel air with the heady sweet scent of smoky perfume and they along with the congregation were dwarfed by the breathtaking interior of the chapel itself whose fanvaulted ceiling soared above them in an intricate display of tracery periodically bossed by the beaufort portcullis and the tudor rose it formed a beauty that was at once both austere and exalted like the arcing flight of a jubilant bird but one who does his sailing against a winter sky lynley took a place at the rear of the chancel from which he could meditate at a distance upon adoration of the magi the rubens canvas that served as the chapels reredos softly lit above the main altar in it one of the magi leaned forward hand outstretched to touch the child while the mother herself presented the baby as if with the serene confi dence that he wouldnt be harmed and yet even then she must have known what lay ahead she must have had a premonition of the loss she would face a lone sopranoa small boy so tiny that his surplice hung just inches from the fl oorsang out the first seven pure notes of a kyrie eleison and lynley lifted his eyes to the stained glass window above the painting through it moonlight shimmered in a muted corona giving only one colour to the window itself a deep blue faintly touched on its outer edge by white and although he knew and could see that the crucifixion was what the window depicted the only section which the moon brought to life was a single facesoldier apostle believer or apostatehis mouth a black howl of some emotion eternally unnamed life and death the chapel said alpha and omega with lynley finding himself caught between the two and trying somehow to make sense of both as the choir filed out at the end of the service and the congregation rose to follow lynley saw that terence cuff had been among the worshippers he had been sitting on the far side of the choir and now he stood with his attention given to the rubens his hands resting in the pockets of an overcoat that was just a shade or two darker than the grey of his hair seeing his partial profile lynley was struck once again by the mans selfpossession his features did not display the slightest trace of anxiety nor did they reveal any reaction to the pressures of his job when cuff turned from the altar he exhibited no surprise to find lynley watching him he merely nodded a greeting left his pew and joined the other man next to the chancel screen he looked round the chapel before he spoke i always come back to kings he said at least twice a month like a prodigal son i never really feel like a sinner in the hands of an angry god here a minor transgressor perhaps but not a real miscreant for what kind of god could honestly stay angry when one asks his forgiveness in such architectural splendour have you a need to ask forgiveness cuff chuckled ive found its always unwise to admit ones misdeeds in the presence of a policeman inspector they left the chapel together cuff stopping at the brass collection tray near the door to drop in a pound coin which clanked heavily against an assortment of ten and fi ftypence pieces then they went out into the evening this meets my occasional need to get away from st stephens cuff said as they strolled round the west end of the chapel towards senate house passage and trinity lane my academic roots are here at kings you were a senior fellow here hmm yes now it serves as part refuge and part home i suppose cuff pointed towards the chapel spires that rose like sculptured shadows against the night sky this is how churches ought to look inspector no one since the gothic architects has known quite so well how to set fire to emotion with simple stone youd think the very material itself would quash the possibility that one might actually feel something at the sight of the finished building but it doesnt lynley took his lead from the other mans first thought what sort of refuge does the master of a college need cuff smiled in the weak light he looked much younger than he had appeared in his library on the previous day from political machinations the battle of personalities the jockeying for position everything attending the selection of the penford professor everything in attendance on a community filled with scholars who have reputations to maintain youve a distinguished enough group set on doing the maintaining yes st stephens is lucky in that is lennart thorsson among them cuff paused turning to lynley the wind was ruffling his hair and it blew at the charcoal scarf he wore slung round his neck he cocked his head appreciatively you led into that well they continued their walk past the back of the old law school their footsteps echoed in the narrow lane at the entrance to trinity hall a girl and boy were engaged in an intent discussion the girl leaning against the ashlar wall with her head thrown back and tears glittering on her face while the boy spoke urgently in an angry voice one hand flat against the wall by her head and the other on her shoulder you dont understand she was saying you never try to understand i dont even think you want to understand any longer you only want cant you ever leave it beth you act like im rolling in your knickers every night as lynley and cuff passed the girl turned away her hand to her face cuff said quietly it always comes down to that sort of giveandtake doesnt it im fi ftyfive years old and i still wonder why i should think its based on the injunctions women grow up hearing lynley said protect yourself from men they only want one thing and once they get it from you theyll be fast on their way dont give an inch dont trust them dont trust anyone in fact is that the sort of thing youd tell a daughter of yours i dont know lynley said i dont have a daughter i like to think id tell her to know her own heart but then ive always been a romantic when it comes to relationships thats an odd predisposition in your line of work it is isnt it a car approached slowly its indicator signalling for garret hostel lane and lynley took the opportunity to glance at cuff as the light from the headlamps struck his face he said sex is a dangerous weapon in an environment like this dangerous for anyone wielding it why didnt you tell me about elena weavers charges against lennart thorsson it seemed unnecessary unnecessary the girls dead there didnt seem to be a point to bringing up something unproved that would only serve to damage the reputation of one of the senior fellows its been diffi cult enough for thorsson to climb as far as he has at cambridge because hes a swede a university isnt immune to xenophobia inspector i dare say a british shakespearean wouldnt have had to jump the academic hurdles thorssons had to jump in the last ten years to prove himself worthy and that despite the fact that he did his graduate work here in the fi rst place nonetheless in a murder investigation dr cuff hear me out please i dont much like thorsson personally ive always had the feeling hes at heart a womaniser and ive never had time for men of that sort but hes a soundif admittedly quixoticshakespearean with a solid future ahead of him to drag his name through the muck in a situation that cant be proved at this point seemedstill seemsa fruitless endeavour cuff shoved both hands back into his overcoat pockets and stopped walking when they came to the gatehouse of st stephens two undergraduates hurried by calling out a hello to him which he acknowledged with a nod of his head he continued to speak his voice low his face in shadow his back turned to the gatehouse itself it goes beyond that theres dr weaver to consider if i bring this matter out into the open with a full investigation do you think for a moment that thorsson isnt going to drag elenas name through the muck in order to defend himself with his entire career on the line what kind of tale will he tell about her alleged attempt to seduce him about the clothes she wore when she came to her supervisions about the way she sat about what she said and how she said it about everything she did to get him into bed and with elena not there to argue her case how will her father feel inspector hes already lost her shall we set about destroying his memory of her as well what purpose does that serve it might be wiser to ask what purpose it serves to keep everything quiet i imagine youd like the penford professor to be a senior fellow here at st stephens cuff locked eyes with his your connotation is ugly so is murder dr cuff and you cant really argue that a scandal involving elena weaver wouldnt cause the search committee for the penford chair to think about turning its eyes in another direction that after all is the easiest course of action theyre not looking for the easiest theyre looking for the best basing their decision upon certainly not basing it upon the behaviour of the applicants children no matter how outrageous that behaviour may be lynley drew his conclusion from cuffs use of the adjective so you dont really believe thorsson harassed her you believe she cooked up this tale because he wouldnt have her when she wanted him im not saying that im merely saying theres nothing to investigate its his word against hers and she has no word to give us had you spoken to thorsson about the charges prior to her death of course id spoken to him he denied every one of her accusations what were they exactly that hed tried to talk her into sex that hed made physical overturestouching her breasts and thighs and buttocksthat hed engaged her in discussions about his sex life and a woman hed once been engaged to and the difficulties shed had with the enormous size of his erection lynley lifted an eyebrow fairly imaginative material for a young girl to have cooked up wouldnt you say not in this day and age but it makes no difference because every bit of it was impossible to prove unless more than one girl was willing to come forward with an accusation against thorsson there was virtually nothing that i could do save speak to the man and warn him off which i did and you didnt see the harassment accusation as a motive for murder if there are other girls who might have come forward once the word went out that elena had turned him in thorsson would have been in deeper water then if there are other girls inspector but thorssons been a part of the english facultyand a senior fellow at st stephensfor ten years now without the slightest breath of scandal associated with him why this all at once and why with this one girl whod already shown herself to be troubled enough to require special regulations just to see that she wasnt sent down a girl who ended up murdered dr cuff not by thorsson you seem certain enough of that i am she was pregnant eight weeks and she knew it she seems to have found out the day before thorsson made a visit to her room how do you account for that cuffs shoulders dropped fractionally he rubbed his temples god he said i didnt know about the pregnancy inspector would you have told me about the harassment charges had you known or would you have continued to protect him im protecting all three of them elena her father thorsson but would you agree that weve just strengthened his motive to kill her if hes the father of the child but you dont believe he is cuff dropped his hand perhaps i simply dont want to believe it perhaps i want to see ethics and morals where they no longer exist i dont know they walked beneath the gatehouse where the porters lodge stood watch over the comings and goings of the members of the college they stopped there briefly the night porter was on duty and from a room behind the counter that marked his work space a television was showing scenes from an american cop programme with lots of fi erce gunfi re and bodies falling in slow motion accompanied by fast licks played on an electric guitar then a long slow shot of the heros face emerging from the haze surveying the carnage mourning its necessity in the life he led as a noble seeker of justice and a fadeout until next week when more corpses would pile up in the name of justice and entertainment again youve a message cuff said from the pigeonholes where he had gone to collect his own he handed it over a small piece of paper which lynley unfolded and read its from my sergeant he looked up lennart thorssons nearest neighbour saw him outside his house just before seven oclock yesterday morning thats hardly a crime he was probably setting off to work a bit early no dr cuff he pulled up to the house in his car as the neighbour was opening her bedroom curtains he was coming home from somewhere rosalyn simpson climbed the fi nal fl ight of stairs to her room at queens college and not for the first time cursed the choice she had made when her name had been drawn second in the rooms pool last term her cursing had nothing to do with the climb itself although she knew that anyone with good sense would have chosen something on the ground floor or something nearer the loo instead she had chosen the lshaped chamber up under the eaves with its sloping walls suitable for the dramatic display of her indian tapestries its creaking oak floor periodically marred by gaps in the wood and its extra little roomhardly more than a large cupboardin which a wash basin stood and into which she and her father had wrestled her bed it had the added features of half a dozen nooks and crannies where she had placed everything from plants to books a large storage garret tucked under the eaves into which she sometimes crawled when she wished to disappear from the worldwhich was generally once a dayand a trap door in the ceiling leading to a passage that gave her access to melinda powells room this last feature had seemed the most blessed originally a rather victorian way in which she and melinda could be close to each other without everyone knowing the exact nature of their relationship which at the time was something that rosalyn had wished to keep to herself so the passage had been the main reason why shed chosen the room it placated melinda while it preserved her own peace of mind but now she wasnt so sure about the decision or about melinda or even about their love she felt burdened by weights first was the haversack on her back and the little package of goodies for you dear that her mother had pressed upon her before she left with tears in her eyes and lips quivering she had said we had such dreams for you ros in a fashion that indicated the full extent to which rosalyns newsgrowing out of a mindless birthday promise to melindahad hurt her its just a phase her father had said more than once during the gruelling thirtytwo hours that theyd spent together and he said it again as rosalyn left but this time to her mother the dreams are still there dammit this is just a phase rosalyn didnt try to disabuse them of the notion she more than wished it was a phase herself so she didnt try to tell them that if it was a peculiar bohemian stage she was going through shed been living it actively since she was fifteen years old she didnt even consider telling them that it had taken all her energy and courage to bring the subject up in the fi rst place arguing against the likelihood of its fading from significance was more than she was willing to take on rosalyn shifted the haversack felt her mothers package dig into her left shoulder blade and tried to slough off the heavier more loathsome weight of her guilt it seemed to slip and slide round her neck and shoulders like an enormous octopus with tentacles that grew from every part of her life her church said it was wrong her upbringing said it was wrong as children she and her friends had whispered and giggled and shuddered just to think of it her own expectations had always called for a man a marriage and a family and still she continued to live in defi ance most of the time she dealt with her life by simply moving forward one day at a time fi lling her time with distractions keeping her attention focussed upon lectures supervisions and practicals while never giving thought to what the future held for someone like herself or if she thought of the future at all she tried to think of it in the global terms of her childhood when her only dream had been to go to india to teach and do good and live solely for others it was a dream however that had lost its definitive clarity on the afternoon fi ve years ago when her fifth form biology mistress had invited her to tea and along with the cake and scones and clotted cream and strawberry jam had offered seduction rich dark and mysterious for a while on the bed in that cottage near the thames rosalyn had felt the contradictory powers of terror and ecstasy driving the blood through her veins but as the other woman murmured and kissed and explored and caressed soon enough fear gave way to arousal which prepared her body for its most acute delight she hovered on the cutting edge of pain and pleasure and when pleasure finally took her she was unprepared for the power of its accompanying joy no man had ever been an intimate part of her life since that moment and no man had ever been as devoted as loving and concerned as was melinda so it had seemed like such a reasonable request really that she should tell her parents coming forward with pride instead of dissembling through paralysis and fear lesbian melinda had said enunciating each syllable with especial care lesbian lesbian it doesnt mean leper entwined in bed one night with melindas arms round her and melindas slender splendid knowing fingers making her body ache with increasing desire she had made the promise and shed just spent the last thirtytwo hours at home in oxford living through the consequences she was exhausted at the top floor she paused in front of her door groping in the pocket of her jeans for the key it was time for formal dinnershed missed the earlier mealand although she gave a moments thought to donning her academic gown and joining the others for what was left of the meal she dismissed the idea she didnt feel like seeing or talking to anyone for that reason primarily when she opened the door her spirits drooped further melinda was coming across the room she looked rested and lovely and her thick sienna hair had been recently washed for it lay round her face in a wavy mass of natural curls rosalyn noted immediately that melinda wasnt dressed in her usual garb of midcalf skirt boots pullover and scarf instead she wore white wool trousers cowlnecked sweater and a long gauzy coat that reached just above her ankles she looked as if she had dressed for celebration indeed she looked disturbingly bridal youre back she said coming to rosalyns side and grasping her hand as she brushed a kiss across her cheek how did it go did mum have apoplexy was dad rushed to hospital clutching weakly at his chest did they shriek out dyke or just settle for pervert come on tell me how did it go rosalyn slipped the haversack from her shoulders and dropped it to the floor she found that her head was throbbing and she couldnt remember exactly when it had begun to do so it went she said thats it no tantrums no how could you do this to your family no bitter accusations no asking what you think granny and the aunts are going to say rosalyn tried to block from her mind the memory of her mothers face and the look of confusion that had pinched her features she wanted to forget the sadness in her fathers eyes but more than that she longed to dismiss the guilt that accompanied her realisation of how her parents both were struggling to dismiss their own feelings in the matter in the process making her feel only so much worse i should think it was quite a scene between you melinda was saying with a knowing smile lots of weeping lots of hair pulling lots of gnashing of teeth the requisite blame not to mention the predictions of hellfi re and damnation the typical middleclass thing poor darling did they abuse you melinda rosalyn knew had told her own family when she was seventeen in a matteroffact takeitorleaveit announcement so typical of her made during christmas dinner sometime between the crackers and the pudding rosalyn had heard the story often enough oh by the way im gay if anyones particularly interested they hadnt been but that was the sort of family melinda had so she couldnt imagine what it was like to be the only child of parents who dreamed among other things of a soninlaw and grandchildren and the fragile line of a family continuing into the future for just a bit longer did your mum push every guilt button there is she probably did and i hope you expected it i did tell you how to answer when she trotted out the what about us line didnt i and if you used it properly then she must have i really dont want to talk about it mel rosalyn said she knelt on the fl oor unzipped the haversack and began unpacking it her mothers goodies from home she set to one side they really must have gone after you then i told you to let me go with you why didnt you let me i could have held my own with both of your parents she squatted next to rosalyn she smelled fresh and clean they didntros they didnt get physical with you did they god your dad didnt hit you of course not look i just dont want to talk about it thats it all right its nothing more than that melinda rested back on her heels she shoved a thick mass of hair behind one ear she said youre sorry you did it arent you i can tell im not you are it had to be done but you were hoping you could avoid it forever you were hoping theyd just eventually think youd become an old maid werent you you didnt want to take a stand you didnt want to come out that isnt true or maybe youve been hoping to take the cure wake up some morning and whoopee youre straight shove melinda out of bed and make room for some bloke mum and dad wouldnt ever know anything then rosalyn looked up she could see the bright shining in melindas eyes and the high gloss of colour in her cheeks it always amazed her that someone so clever and beautiful could also be someone so unsure and afraid she said im not planning on leaving you mel youd like a man wouldnt you melinda said if you could have one if you could go straight youd like it youd prefer it wouldnt you wouldnt you rosalyn asked she felt terribly weary melinda laughed the sound was high and giddy men have only one use and we dont even need them for that any longer just fi nd a donor and inseminate yourself at home in the loo theyre doing it you know i read about it somewhere in a few more centuries well be generating sperm in laboratories and men as we know them will be completely extinct rosalyn knew it was wiser to say nothing when melinda felt the spectre of abandonment hovering round her too closely but she was tired she was disheartened she had just endured a marathon session of guilt with her parents largely to please her lover and she was feeling as most people feel when they have been manipulated into acting in a fashion they might otherwise eschew resentful so she replied against her better judgement i dont hate men melinda i never have if you do thats your problem but its not one of mine oh theyre peachy men are theyre real bricks the lot of them melinda got to her feet and went to rosalyns desk from it she took a bright orange piece of paper waved it and said these are all over the university today i saved one for you this is what men are all about ros take a look if you like them so much what is it just look rosalyn pushed herself to her feet and rubbing her shoulders where the haversack had dug into them she took the piece of paper from melinda it was a handout she saw and then she saw the name in large black letters underneath a grainy photograph elena weaver and then another word murdered a cold chill zigzagged the length of her spine she said melinda what is this whats been going on round here while you and mum and dad were nattering in oxford numbly rosalyn carried the paper to her old rocking chair she stared at the picture at the face so familiar to her at the grin the chipped tooth the long flow of hair elena weaver her chief competitor she ran like a god shes in hare and hounds rosalyn said melinda i know her ive been to her room ive knew her you mean melinda snatched the paper back crumpled it and tossed it into the rubbish basket dont throw it away let me see it what happened she was out running by the river early yesterday morning someone got her near the island near thecrusoes island rosalyn felt her hearts beating grow heavy and fast mel thats a sudden memory unbidden tugged at the fabric of her consciousness like a shadow becoming substance like the fragment of a tune she said slowly waiting to feel more certain melinda i need to phone the police no matter the fashion she had hoped to use the information about elena weaver colour drained from melindas face comprehension took its place the island thats where youve been running this term isnt it right along the river just like this girl rosalyn promise me you wont run there again swear to it ros please rosalyn was scooping her shoulder bag from the floor she said come on melinda seemed suddenly to assimilate the intention behind rosalyns decision to speak to the police she said no ros if you saw somethingif you know somethinglisten to me you cant do this ros if someone fi nds outif someone knows you saw something please we need to think what might happen we need to think this through because if you saw someone that means someone probably saw you as well rosalyn was at the door she was zipping her jacket melinda cried out again rosalyn please lets think this through theres nothing to think about rosalyn said she opened the door you can stay here if you want to i wont be long but where are you going what are you doing rosalyn melinda ran after her frantically having been to lennart thorssons rooms at st stephens and finding them unoccupied lynley drove out to the mans house off the fulbourn road it wasnt in an area that seemed at all suited to thorssons bad boy marxist image for the trim brick building with its neat tile roof was in a relatively new housing estate sitting on a street called ashwood court there were perhaps two dozen houses of similar design dotting an area that had once been farmland each had its own patch of front lawn its walledoff rear garden and its spindly tree recently planted in the probable hope of creating a neighbourhood that lived up to the street names its developer had chosen maple close oak lane paulownia court somehow lynley had expected to find thorssons residence in a setting more in line with the political philosophy which he espousedperhaps one of the terrace houses not far from the railway station or a dimly lit flat above a shop in the city but he hadnt expected to find his address in the midst of a middleclass neighbourhood whose streets and driveways held metros and fiestas and whose pavements were taken up by tricycles and toys thorssons house at the west end of the culdesac was identical to his neighbours and it sat at an angle to the other house so that anyone looking out a front windowfrom either upstairs or downstairswould have an unobstructed view of thorssons movements for someone watching for more than a few moments it would have been difficult to mistake a departure for an arrival thus it would have been impossible to conclude that thorssons hurried homecoming at seven in the morning had been anything else the lights werent on in any part of thorssons house that could be seen from the street but lynley tried the front door anyway ringing the bell several times it reverberated hollowly behind the closed door as if the house held neither furniture nor carpeting to absorb the sound he stepped back looked at the upper windows for signs of life there were none he returned to his car and sat for a moment thinking about lennart thorsson observing the neighbourhood and refl ecting upon the nature of the man himself he thought of all the young minds listening to thorsson expound about his version of shakespeare utilising literature more than four hundred years old to promote a political bent that was appearing more and more to be only a convenient guise to hide the basic mundanity of the man beneath and how dazzling it all was to take a piece of literature as familiar as ones childhood prayers to pick and choose lines to pick and choose scenes and upon them to hang an interpretation thatunder close scrutinywas potentially more myopic than all the other interpretations it sought to refute yet thorssons presentation of his material was undeniably beguiling lynley had seen that much in the brief time he had stood at the back of the lecture hall in the english faculty the mans commitment to his theory was palpable his intelligence irrefutable and his manner just dissident enough to encourage a camaraderie that might otherwise not exist with the undergraduates for what young person could really resist the temptation of rubbing elbows with a rebel if this were the case how unlikely was the possibility that elena weaver might have sought out thorsson found herself rejected and cooked up a charge of harassment against him as a bit of revenge or how unlikely was the alternative possibility that thorsson had intentionally involved himself with elena weaver only to discover that she was no easy tumble but rather a woman with entrapment on her mind lynley stared at the house waiting for answers and knowing that ultimately everything in the case narrowed down to one fact elena weaver was deaf narrowed down to one object the ceephone thorsson had been to her room he knew about the ceephone all that remained was for him to place the call that had kept justine weaver from meeting elena in the morning if in fact thorsson knew that elena ran with her stepmother if in fact he knew how to use the phone in the first place if in fact someone else already with access to a ceephone hadnt placed the call if in fact there had been a call at all lynley started the bentley wound slowly through the streets of the housing estate and began to evaluate the almost instant antipathy that had developed between sergeant havers and lennart thorsson havers instincts were generally sound when it came to hypocrisy in her fellow men and she was anything but xenophobic she hadnt needed to see thorssons home in suburbia to recognise the extent of his affectation her play upon shakespeare earlier in the day indicated that and lynley knew her well enough to realise that having ascertained that thorsson had been missing from his home in the early hours of the previous day she would be hot to give him the caution and pin him to the wall of one of sheehans interrogation rooms upon her return to cambridge in the morning and thats what would happenthats what solid policework dictated at this pointunless he came up with something else in spite of the manner in which their store of facts pointed ineluctably towards thorsson lynley felt discomfited by the very neatness with which everything was falling into place he knew from experience that murder was often an obviously cutanddried affair in which the likeliest suspect was indeed the perpetrator of the crime but he also knew that some deaths grew from darker places in the soul and from motives far more convoluted than were suggested by the initial evidence and as the facts and the faces from this particular case drifted in and out of his field of consciousness he began to weigh the other possibilities all of them darker than that which was defined by the mere need to dispose of a girl because she was pregnant gareth randolph knowing that elena had a lover yet loving her all the time himself gareth randolph with a ceephone in his office at deastu justine weaver recounting elenas sexual behaviour justine weaver with a ceephone but without her own children adam jenn seeing elena regularly at her fathers request his own future tied in to weavers promotion adam jenn with a ceephone in anthony weavers study in ivy court and everything peculiar about that study most particularly sarah gordons brief visit to it monday night he made the turn west and began the drive back into cambridge recognising the fact that no matter the days revelations to the contrary his mind kept returning to sarah gordon she didnt sit well with him you know why havers would have argued you know why she keeps forcing her way into your thoughts you know who she reminds you of he couldnt deny it nor could he avoid admitting that at the end of the day when he was most exhausted he was also most likely to lose the discipline that kept his mind focussed while he was at work at the end of the day he was most susceptible to anything and anyone that reminded him of helen this had been the case for nearly a year now and sarah gordon was slender she was dark she was sensitive she was intelligent she was passionate still he told himself those qualities which she shared with helen were not the only reasons why he returned to her at a moment when both motive and opportunity were affixing themselves squarely to lennart thorsson there were other reasons not to eliminate sarah gordon perhaps they were not as pressing as those which cast blame in thorssons direction but they still existed nagging at the mind youre talking yourself into it havers would have said youre building a case out of dust motes and lint but he wasnt so sure he didnt like coincidences in the midst of a murder investigation andhavers protests to the contraryhe couldnt avoid seeing sarah gordons presence at the murder scene followed by her presence at ivy court that night as coincidental more than that he couldnt get away from the fact that she knew weaver he had been her studenther private student she had called him tony okay so they were boffing each other havers would have continued so they were doing it five nights a week so they were doing it in every position known to mankind and in some they invented so what inspector he wants the penford chair havers ah she would have crowed let me get this straight anthony weaver stopped boffing sarah gordonwhom of course we dont know whether he was boffing in the first placebecause he was afraid that if anyone found out he wouldnt get the chair so sarah gordon killed his daughter not weaver himself who probably deserves to be put out of his misery if hes such a gormless twit but his daughter great when did she do it how did she carry it off she wasnt even on the island until seven in the morning and the girl was dead by then dead inspector cold out kaput dead so why are you thinking about sarah gordon tell me please because this is making me nervous weve walked the path before you and i he couldnt come up with an answer that havers would find acceptable she would argue that any exploration of sarah gordon at this point was in fact or fantasy a pursuit of helen she would not accept his essential curiosity about the woman nor would she allow for his uneasiness with coincidence but havers wasnt with him at the moment to argue against a course of action he wanted to know more about sarah gordon and he knew where to find someone with access to the facts in bulstrode gardens how convenient inspector havers would have hooted but he made the right turn into hills road and dismissed his sergeants spectral presence he arrived at the house at half past eight lights were on in the sitting room fi ltering through the curtains in lacy strands which fell upon the semicircle of the drive and glanced off the silver metal of a childs pantechnicon which lay on its side with one wheel missing lynley picked it up and rang the front bell unlike the previous evening there was no shouting of childrens voices only a few moments of quiet in which he listened to the traffic passing on the madingley road and smelled the acrid odour of leaves being burnt somewhere in the neighbourhood close by then the deadbolt was drawn and the door was opened tommy it was curious he thought for how many years had she greeted him in this identical fashion just saying his name and nothing more why had he never before stopped to realise how much it had come to mean to himsuch simplistic idiocy this all was reallyjust to hear the cadence of her voice as she said it he handed her the toy along with a missing wheel he noticed that the lorrys bonnet bore a considerable dent as if it had been smashed with a rock or a hammer this was in the drive she took it from him christian hes not making a great deal of progress in the takingcareofpossessions department im afraid she stepped back from the door come in he took off his overcoat without invitation this time hanging it on a rattan rack just to the left of the front door he turned to her she wore a teal pullover with an ashcoloured blouse beneath it and the sweater was smeared in three separate places with what appeared to be spaghetti sauce she saw his glance take in the stains christian again hes also not making progress in the table manners area she smiled wearily at least he doesnt offer false compliments to the cook and god knows that ive never been much in the kitchen he said youre exhausted helen he felt his hand go up as if of its own volition and for a moment the backs of his fingers brushed against her cheek her skin was cool and smooth like the untroubled surface of fresh sweet water her dark eyes were on his a pulse beat rapidly in the vein on her neck he said helen and felt the quick current of perennial longing that always accompanied the simple mindless act of saying her name she moved away from him walked into the sitting room saying theyre in bed now so the worst is over have you eaten tommy he found that he still had his hand lifted as if to touch her and he dropped it to his side feeling ever the lovesick fool he said no dinner got past me somehow shall i make you something she glanced down at her pullover other than spaghetti of course although i dont recall your ever throwing food at the cook not lately at least weve some chicken salad theres a bit of ham left some tinned salmon if you like nothing im not hungry she stood near the fireplace where a pile of childrens toys leaned against the wall a wooden puzzle of the united states was balanced on the top someone it appeared had bitten off the southern end of florida he looked from the puzzle to her saw the lines of weariness beneath her eyes he wanted to say come with me helen be with me stay with me instead he said merely i need to talk to pen lady helens eyes widened pen its important is she awake i think so yes butshe glanced warily towards the doorway and the stairs beyond iti dont know tommy its been a bad day the children a row with harry hes not home no again she picked up the small florida and examined the damage then chucked the puzzle piece back with the others its a mess theyre a mess i dont know how to help her i cant think what to tell her shes had a baby she doesnt want she has a life she cant bear she has children who need her and a husband whos set on punishing her for punishing him and my life is so easy so smooth compared to hers what can i say that isnt base and blind and entirely useless just that you love her love isnt enough it isnt you know that its the only thing there is when you cut to the bone its the only real thing youre being simplistic i dont think so if love were simple in and of itself we wouldnt be in this mess would we we wouldnt bother to want to entrust our lives and our dreams into the safekeeping of another human being we wouldnt bother with vulnerability we wouldnt expose weakness we wouldnt risk emotion and god knows wed never make a leap of blind faith wed never surrender wed cling to control because if we lose control helen if we lose it for an instant god knows what the void beyond it is like when pen and harry married frustration seared through him this isnt about them you know that damn well they stared at each other the width of the room separated them it might have been a chasm still he spoke to her across it even though he felt the uselessness of saying words that he knew had no power to effect any action yet saying them anyway always needing to say them casting aside caution dignity and pride i love you he said and it feels like dying although her eyes looked bright with tears her body was tense he knew she wouldnt cry stop being afraid he said please just that she made no reply but she didnt look away from him nor did she try to leave the room he took hope from that why he said wont you tell me that much were fine where we are as we are her voice was low why cant that be enough for you because it cant helen this isnt about friendship we arent chums we arent mates we were once we were but we cant go back to that at least i cant do it and god knows ive tried i love you i want you she swallowed a single tear slid from her eye but she brushed it away quickly he felt torn at the sight of her i always believed it should be jubilation but whatever it is it shouldnt be this im sorry she said no more than i he looked away from her on the overmantel behind her stood a photograph of her sister and her family husband wife two children lifes purpose defined he said i still need to see pen she nodded let me get her as she left the room he walked to the window the curtains were drawn there was nothing to see he stared at the rapidly blurring floral pattern on the chintz walk away from it he told himself fi ercely make the cut make it surgical make it permanent walk away but he couldnt do it it was he knew the great irony of love that it came out of nowhere that it had no logic that it could always be denied and ignored but that one ultimately paid the price for fleeing it in coin that came from the spirit from the soul hed been witness to the cycle of love and denial in other lives before generally in womanisers and in men hot after the pursuit of their careers hearts were never touched in their cases so pain was never felt and why should it be otherwise the womaniser sought only the conquest of the moment the career man sought only the glories from his job neither was affected by love or sorrow either walked off without a backward glance his misfortuneif it could be called that lay in not being of that ilk instead of sexual conquest or professional success he knew only the desire for connection for helen he heard them on the stairwayquiet voices slow footstepsand turned back to the sitting room door he had known from helens words that her sister was not well but still he was jarred by the sight of her his face he knew was well enough controlled when she walked into the room but his eyes apparently betrayed him for penelope smiled wanly as if in recognition of an unspoken fact and ran ringless fingers through her limp dull hair you arent exactly catching me at my best she said thank you for seeing me again the wan smile she shuffl ed across the room lady helen at her side she eased herself into a wicker rocker and drew her dusky pink dressing gown closed at the throat may we offer you something she said a whisky brandy he shook his head lady helen went to the end of the sofa the nearest spot to the rocking chair and sat on the edge of it leaning forward her eyes on her sister her hands extended as if to give her support lynley took the wingback chair opposite pen he tried to gather his thoughts without considering the changes that had come over her and what they meant and how they had to be striking every chord of her younger sisters fear deep circles beneath her eyes complexion mottled and spotty an angry sore at the corner of her mouth unwashed hair unwashed body helen tells me youre in cambridge on a case she said he told her the essentials of the murder itself as he spoke she rocked the chair creaked companionably he ended with but its sarah gordon who intrigues me i thought you might be able to tell me something about her have you heard of her pen she nodded her fingers played with the cord of her dressing gown oh yes for any number of years there was quite a splash in the local newspaper when she first moved to grantchester when was this some six years ago youre sure about that yes it wasagain the lifeless smile and a shrugbefore the children and i was working at the fitzwilliam then picture restoring the museum had a large reception for her and a showing of her work harry and i went we met her if you can call it met it was more like being presented to the queen although that feeling came mostly from the museum directors sarah gordon herself as i recall was rather unassuming friendly quite approachable not the sort of woman id gone expecting to meet considering all id heard and read about her shes that important an artist generally speaking yes each piece she creates is a bit of social commentary which usually results in a fair amount of press at the time i met her shed just been named mbe obe one of the two i cant recall shed done a portrait of the queen that had been wellreceived by the criticssome of them were actually calling it the conscience of the nation or some such critical nonsense shed had several successful showings at the royal academy she was being touted as the new darling of art interesting lynley said because shes not what one might call a modern artist is she one would think that the darling of the art world would have to be forging into some kind of new territory but ive seen her work and she doesnt seem to be doing that painting soup tins you mean pen smiled or shooting herself in the foot making a fi lm of the event and calling it performance art at the extreme i suppose whats more important than coming up with the fad of the moment is having a style that catches the emotional fancy of collectors and critics tommy like jurgen gorgs venice carnival pieces or peter maxs early fantasy canvases or salvador dalís surrealistic art if an artist has a personal style then he is forging ahead if that style gains international approbation then his career is made hers is i should say so yes her style is distinct its crisp very clear according to whatever pr machine it was that orchestrated her bow to the art world years ago she even grinds her own pigments like some sort of modern botticellior at least she did at one timeso her colours in oil are wonderful as well she talked about being a purist in the past thats always been part of her persona as has the isolation grantchester not london the world comes to her she doesnt go to the world you never worked with her canvases while you were at the museum what need would i have her works recent tommy it doesnt need to be restored but youve seen them youre familiar with them yes of course why lady helen said is her art at the root of this tommy he gave his attention to the spotted brown rug that partially covered the fl oor i dont know she said she hadnt done anything artistically in months she said she was afraid that shed lost the passion to create the morning of the murder was the day shed designated to start paintingor sketching or somethingagain it seemed like a superstition of hers paint on this day paint at this spot or give it up forever is that possible pen that someone would give over creatingwould actually lose it somehowand find the struggle to come back so enormous that it would end up tied in to exterior influences such as where one paints and what one paints and exactly at what time one paints penelope stirred in her chair you cant be that naive of course its possible people have gone mad over the belief that theyve lost the power to create people have killed themselves over it lynley raised his head he saw that lady helen was watching him both of them had leaped to the same conclusion with penelopes final words or kill someone else lady helen said someone who got in the way of creativity lynley asked camille and rodin penelope said they certainly killed each other didnt they at least metaphorically but how could this university girl have got in the way of sarah gordons creativity lady helen asked did they even know each other he thought of ivy court her use of the name tony he dwelt on every conjecture he and havers had developed to explain sarah gordons presence there on the previous night perhaps it wasnt the girl who got in her way he said perhaps it was her father yet even as he spoke he could list the arguments against that conclusion the call to justine weaver the knowledge of elenas running the entire question of time the weapon that had been used to beat her the disposal of that weapon the relevant issues were motive means and opportunity he couldnt argue that sarah gordon had any of them i mentioned whistler and ruskin while i was talking to her he said pensively she reacted to that so perhaps her failure to create over the last year grew out of some critics hatchetjob of her work thats a possibility if shed had negative criticism penelope said but she hasnt nothing major that i know of so what stops the flow of creativity pen what impedes passion fear she said he looked at lady helen she dropped her eyes from his fear of what he asked failure rejection offering something of the self to someoneto the worldand having it stomped to bits that would do it i should guess but that didnt happen to her not to sarah gordon but that doesnt necessarily mean that she isnt afraid it might happen in the future lots of people are felled by their own success penelope looked towards the door as in the other room the refrigerators motor coughed and whirred she got to her feet the rocker creaked a final time with her movement id not thought about art for at least this last year she brushed her hair back off her face and smiled at lynley how odd it was quite nice to talk about it youve got a lot to say once yes i did have once she headed towards the stairway and waved him back when he began to rise im going to check on the baby good night tommy good night lady helen said nothing until her sisters footsteps sounded along the upper corridor until a door opened and shut then she turned to lynley that was good for her you must have known it would be thank you tommy no pure selfishness i wanted information i thought pen could provide it thats all of it helen well not quite i wanted to see you there doesnt seem to be an end to that she got to her feet he did likewise they headed for the front door he reached for his overcoat but turned to her impulsively before he took it from the stand he said miranda webberlys playing jazz tomorrow night at trinity hall will you come when she glanced towards the stairs he went on with a few hours helen pen can deal with them alone or we can collar harry at emmanuel or bring in one of sheehans constables thats probably the best bet for christian anyway so will you come randie plays a mean trumpet according to her father shes become a female dizzy gillespie lady helen smiled all right tommy yes ill come he felt his heart lift despite the probability that she was accommodating him only as a means of showing her gratitude for having taken pen away from her malaise for a few minutes good he said half past seven then id suggest we have dinner as well but i wont push my luck he took his overcoat from the rack and slung it over his shoulder the cold wouldnt bother him a moment of hope seemed enough protection against anything she knew what he was feeling as she always did its just a concert tommy he didnt avoid her meaning i know that besides we couldnt possibly make it to gretna green and back in time for christians breakfast could we but even if we could doing the dread deed in front of the local blacksmith would never be my idea of a way to get married so youre relatively safe for an evening at least her smile widened thats an enormous comfort he touched her cheek god knows i want you to be comfortable helen he waited for her to move tried to make her do so through allowing himself if only for a moment to feel the sheer telling force of his own desire her head tilted slightly pressing her cheek against his hand he said you wont fail this time not with me i wont let you i love you she said at the bottom of it all barbara lovey have you gone to bed because the lights are out and i dont want to disturb you if youre asleep you need your sleep its your beauty sleep i know but if youre still up i thought we might talk about christmas its early of course but still one wants to be prepared with gift ideas and decisions about which invitations to accept and which to decline barbara havers closed her eyes briefl y as if by that activity she could shut out the sound of her mothers voice standing in the darkness at her bedroom window she looked down on the back garden where a cat was slinking along the top of the fence that separated their property from that of mrs gustafson its attention was speared onto the snarl of weeds that grew in place of what once had been a narrow strip of lawn he was hunting a rodent the garden was probably swarming with them barbara saluted him silently have at them she thought near her face the curtains gave off the odours of old cigarette smoke and heavy dust once a crisp starched white cotton sprigged with clusters of forgetmenots they hung limp and grey and against this background of grime the cheerful blue fl owers had long since given up the effort of contrast now they looked largely like smudges of charcoal set against an everdarkening bleak fi eld of ash lovey barbara heard her mother tottering along the upstairs passage her mules alternately shuffling and slapping against the bare fl oor she knew she ought to call out to her but instead she prayed that before she reached the bedroom her mothers fleeting attention would make the jump to something else perhaps to her brothers bedroom which although it long since had been cleared of his belongings often still proved enough of a lure that mrs havers would wander into it talking to her son as if he were still alive five minutes barbara thought just five minutes of peace shed been home for some hours arriving to find mrs gustafson sitting erect on a kitchen chair at the foot of the stairs and her mother above in her bedroom crumpled on the edge of the bed mrs gustafson was curiously armed with the hose of the vacuum cleaner her mother was bewildered and frightened a shrivelled figure in the darkness who had lost the simple knowledge of how to operate her bedroom lights we had ourselves a bit of a scuffl e shes been wanting your father mrs gustafson had said when barbara came in the door her grey wig had been pulled slightly askew so that on the left its curls hung down too far below her ear she started looking through the house calling out for her jimmy then she wanted the street barbaras eyes fell to the hose of the vacuum now i dint hit her barbie mrs gustafson said you know i wouldnt hit your mum her fi ngers first curled round the hose then caressed its worn covering snake she said confidentially she does behave when she sees it luv i just wave it a bit thats all i have to do for a moment barbara felt as if her blood had congealed rendering her immobile and incapable of speech she felt wedged solidly between two conflicting needs words and actions were called for some sort of castigation of the elderly woman for her blind stupidity for resorting to terrorising instead of tending but far more important placation was required for if mrs gustafson drew the line on what she was willing to endure they were lost so in the end despising herself creating a new more capacious reservoir in her conscience to hold the guilt she settled upon saying its hard when she gets confused i know but if you frighten her dont you think she gets worse and all the time she hated herself for the tone of reason she employed and the underlying plea for understanding and cooperation this is your mother barbara she told herself this isnt an animal were talking about but it made no difference she was talking about caretaking she had long ago abjured the quality of life she does for a bit mrs gustafson said which is why i phoned you luv because i thought shed lost what few beans she has left but shes fine now isnt she not a peep out of her you should have stayed in cambridge but you phoned for me to come home yes i did didnt i a bit of a panic that was when she wanted her jimmy and she wouldnt drink her tea or eat the nice egg sandwich id made but shes fine now go on up have a look she may even have dropped off for a bit of a kip the way babies do you know just cry themselves to sleep which went a great distance to let barbara know what the last few hours prior to her arrival had been like in the house except that this wasnt a baby crying itself to physical exhaustion this was an adult whose exhaustion was one of the mind she had found her mother hunched over on the bed with her head on her knees and her face directed towards the chest of drawers next to the window when barbara crossed the room to her she saw that her mothers spectacles had slipped off her nose and lay on the floor leaving her vague blue eyes looking even more detached than they normally did mum she said she hesitated about switching on the light on the bedside table afraid it might frighten her mother in some further fashion she touched the older womans head her hair felt very dry but it was soft like wispy bits of cotton wool it would be nice to get her a perm barbara thought shed like that mum would if she didnt forget where she was in the middle of the treatment and try to flee the hairdressers when she saw her head covered by lumpy coloured rods the purpose of which she no longer understood mrs havers stirred just a small movement of her shoulders as if she were trying to rid herself of an unwanted burden she said doris and i played this afternoon she wanted a tea party and i wanted jacks we tiffed over it but then we had both doris was her mothers older sister shed died as a teenager during the blitz shed not had the courtesy of adding to the family history by being eliminated by a german bomb however instead it was an inglorious but nonetheless appropriate finish to a life that had been characterised by unfailing rapacity shed choked to death on a piece of black market pork which shed whipped off her brothers plate at sunday dinner when he left the table to make an adjustment to the wireless out of which like a saviour winston churchill was due to speak barbara had heard the story often enough as a child chew everything forty times her mother would say else youll end up stiff like your auntie doris ive prep to do for school but i dont like prep her mother went on i played instead mummy wont like that shell ask and i dont know what to say barbara bent over her mum she said its barbara im home im going to turn on the light it wont scare you will it but the blackout we must be very careful have you drawn the curtains its all right mum she switched on the lamp and sat on the bed at her mothers side she put her hand on her shoulder and squeezed lightly okay mum that better mrs havers eyes went from the window to barbara she squinted barbara reached for her spectacles polished away a grease spot on one of the lenses by rubbing it against her own trouser leg and slipped them back on her mothers nose she has a snake mrs havers said barbie i dont like snakes and shes brought one with her she brings it out and she holds it and she tells me what it wants me to do she says snakes crawl up you she says they crawl inside but its so big and if it gets inside me ill barbara put her arm round her mother she crouched to duplicate her mothers position they were facetoface heads resting on knees theres no snake mum its the vacuum cleaner shes trying to frighten you but she wouldnt do that if youd just manage to do what she says she wouldnt even bother can you try to behave mrs havers face clouded vacuum cleaner oh no barbie it was a snake but where could mrs gustafson have got a snake i dont know lovey but she has it ive seen it she holds it and waves it shes holding it now mum downstairs its the vacuum cleaner would you like to go down and have a look at it with me no barbara felt her mothers back go rigid her voice began to rise because i dont like snakes barbie i dont want them crawling up me i dont want them inside i dont okay mum okay she saw that she couldnt pit her mothers frail coping skills in psychological warfare against mrs gustafson its just the vacuum mum isnt mrs gustafson silly to try to scare you with it was not going to work to maintain the fragile peace in the house their peace was too volatile especially when it rested on her mothers failing ability to stay firmly grounded in the here and now she wanted to say mrs gustafsons as afraid as you are mum thats why she resorts to frightening you when you get a bit wild but she knew her mother would not understand so she said nothing she merely drew her mother close to her and thought with longing and loss of that studio in chalk farm where she had stood beneath the false acacia and allowed herself a moment to dream of hope and independence lovey are you still up barbara turned from the window moonlight made the room a place of silver and shadow it fell in a band across her bed and pooled round the odd ballandclaw legs on the chest of drawers the fulllength mirror that hung on the door of the builtin clothes cupboardlook at these jimmy her mother had said what a nice touch we wont need wardrobes hererefl ected the light in a shaft of white against the opposite wall shed hung a cork board there when shed turned thirteen years old it was supposed to hold all the souvenirs of her adolescence programmes from the theatre invitations to parties mementoes from school dances a dried flower or two it held nothing at all for the first three years and then shed come to realise it never would unless she pinned to it something more than unrealistic dreams so shed clipped newspaper articles first human interest stories about babies and animals then intriguing pieces about small acts of violence and finally sensational columns on murder not the thing for young ladies her mother had sniffed no indeed not the thing for young ladies barbie lovey her door was halfclosed and barbara heard her mothers fingernails scratching against it if she was absolutely quiet she knew there was a slight chance that her mother would go away but it seemed an unnecessary cruelty after what shed been through that day so she said im awake mum ive not gone to bed the door swung inward light from the passage behind her acted as accent to mrs havers gaunt frame especially her legs human spindles with bulbous knees and ankles that were emphasised by the fact that her housecoat was rucked up and her nightdress too short she toddled into the room i did a bad today barbie didnt i she said mrs gustafson was to spend the night with me here i remember you said that this morning didnt you you were going to cambridge so i must have done a bad if youre home barbara welcomed the moment of rare lucidity she said you got confused her mother stopped a few feet away from her shed managed a bath on her ownwith just two quick supervisory visitsbut she hadnt done as well with the postablutionary rites for shed doused herself with so much cologne that it seemed to surround her like a psychic aura is it near christmas lovey mrs havers asked its november mum the second week of november its not too far from christmas her mother smiled obviously relieved i thought it was near it gets cold round christmas doesnt it and its been like that these past few days so i thought it must be christmastime with the fairy lights on oxford street and those lovely displays in fortnum and mason and seeing father christmas talking to the children i thought it was near and you were right barbara said she was feeling enormously weary her eyelids seemed pricked by thousands of pins but at least the burden of further dealings with her mother seemed lifted for a moment she said ready for bed mum tomorrow her mother said she nodded as if satisfied with her decision well do it tomorrow lovey do what speak to father christmas somewhere you must tell him what you want im a bit old for father christmas and at any rate ive got to go back to cambridge in the morning inspector lynleys still there i cant leave him on his own but you remember that dont you im on a case in cambridge you remember that mum and weve all the invitations to sort through and the gifts to decide upon well be busy tomorrow and busy busy busy as bees until after the new year the respite had been brief indeed barbara took her mother by her bony shoulders and began to guide her gently from the room she chattered on daddys the hardest to buy for isnt he mums no problem shes got such a sweet tooth that i always know if i can just find chocolatesyou know the kind she lovesill be all right but dads a trick dorrie whatre you going to get dad i dont know mum barbara said i just dont know they managed the passage to her mothers bedroom where the duckshaped light she loved was burning on the bedside table her mother continued her christmas conversation but barbara tuned it out feeling a tumour of depression begin its slow growth in her chest she fought it off by telling herself that there was a purpose behind it all she was being tested this was her golgotha she tried to convince herself that if nothing else the day had taught her that she couldnt leave her mother for the night with mrs gustafson and having that knowledge now under circumstances when she had been close enough to get back home quickly was so much better than than what she wondered than if she had been called home from an exotic holiday she would never take in a place she would never see with a man she would never know in whose arms she would never lie she shoved the thought aside she needed to get back to work she had to have a focal point for her thoughts that was anywhere else but in this house in acton perhaps her mother was saying as barbara pulled the covers up and tucked them under the mattress hoping the gesture would seem like concern for her warmth rather than a desire to keep her anchored to the bed perhaps we should take a holiday at christmas and not worry about a thing what dyou think of that its a grand idea why dont you work on it tomorrow mrs gustafson can help you sort through your brochures mrs havers face clouded barbara removed her spectacles and laid them on the table by the bed mrs gustafson her mother said barbie whos she lynley saw sergeant havers old mini trundling its way down trinity lane at sevenforty the next morning he had just left his room in ivy court and was walking to his car which hed parked in a small space on trinity passage when the familiar rusteaten sardinetinonwheels that served as havers transportation made the turn at the far end of gonville and caius college sending out a noxious cloud of exhaust fumes into the cold air as havers changed gear round the curve seeing him she tooted the horn once he lifted a hand in acknowledgement and waited for her to pull to a stop when she did so he opened the passenger door without word or ceremony and folded his lengthy frame into the confines of the cramped front seat its upholstery was shiny with age and wear a broken spring bulged against the material the minis heater was roaring with ineffectual enthusiasm against the morning cold creating a palpable pool of warmth that rose from the floor to the level of his kneecaps from his waist up however the air was ice tinctured with the odour of the cigarette smoke which had long ago altered the vinyl ceiling from beige to grey havers he saw was doing her best to contribute to the vinyls continuing metamorphosis as he banged the car door shut she stubbed one cigarette out in the ashtray and immediately lit another breakfast he asked mildly nicotine on toast she inhaled with pleasure and brushed some fallen ash off the left leg of her worsted trousers so whats up he didnt answer at once rather he cracked the window a few inches to let in a bit of fresh air and turned back to observe her frankly earnest gaze her expression was resolutely cheerful her manner of dress appropriately haphazard every necessary sign was there painting the picture of allsrightwiththeworld but her hands gripped the steering wheel far too tightly and a tension round her mouth belied her casual tone what happened at home he asked her she drew in on her cigarette again and gave its glowing tip her attention nothing much mum had a spell mrs gustafson panicked it was no big deal havers look inspector you could reassign me and ask nkata to come up and assist id understand i know its rotten with me coming and going and heading back to london so early in the evening webberly wont like it much if you sack me on this but if i make an appointment and go at it with him privately he ought to understand i can cope sergeant i dont need nkata but youve got to have someone you cant do it all alone this flaming job requires assistance and youve every right to ask for it barbara this isnt about the job she stared out into the street at the gatehouse of st stephens college the porter came out to help a middleaged woman in a heavy coat and scarf who had climbed off a bicycle and was attempting to manoeuvre it into position among dozens of other bikes against the wall she gave the handlebars over to him and watched chatting with great animation as he shoved the bike among the others and locked it up they went inside the gatehouse together lynley said barbara havers stirred im dealing with it sir at least im trying to lets just get going shall we he sighed reached for the seat belt and brought it over his shoulder head for the fulbourn road he said i want to drop in on lennart thorsson she nodded reversed the car into trinity passage and turned them in the direction from which shed come only moments before all round them the city was coming to life the occasional earlyrising student pedalled off to begin a day of study as bedders arrived to see to the rooms on trinity street two sweepers unloaded brooms and dustpans from a yellow trolley while three workmen climbed a scaffolding nearby the merchants in market hill were setting up their stalls for the days business laying out fruit and vegetables setting up bolts of bright material folding tshirts blue jeans and indian dresses gathering autumn flowers into dazzling bouquets buses and taxis vied for position on sidney street and as lynley and havers headed out of town they passed the morning commuters coming in from ramsey town and cherry hinton no doubt ready to take their places behind desks in the libraries in the gardens and before the kitchen stoves of the universitys twentyeight colleges havers didnt speak until they were rumbling their waywith an extensive emission of exhaust and accompanying sputters and belches from the enginepast parkers piece across whose extensive green the police station squatted like an impassive guardian its double row of windows reflecting the cloudless sky turned it to a draughtboard of blue and grey you got my message then havers said about thorsson you didnt see him last night he was nowhere to be found does he know were on our way no she crushed her cigarette out did not light another what do you think essentially that hes too good to be true because weve got black fibres on the body because weve caught him with motive and opportunity he does seem to have both and once we have an idea of what was used to bludgeon her we may find he had the means as well he reminded her of the wine bottle which sarah gordon had said was left at the scene and told her of the impression of that same bottle which he had seen in the damp earth on the island he offered his theory of how the bottle might have been used and left behind among the rest of the rubbish but still you dont like thorsson as our killer i can see it on your face it seems too clean a case havers ive got to admit im not comfortable with that why because murder in generaland this one in particularis a dirty business she slowed for a traffic light and watched as a backgnarled woman wearing a long black coat slowly negotiated her way across the street her eyes were on her feet she pulled a collapsible luggage trolley behind her nothing was in it when the light changed havers spoke again i think thorssons dirty as a dog inspector it surprises me that you cant see it as well or is seducing school girls not dirty to another man as long as the girls dont complain he was unruffled by the indirect challenge to argue these arent school girls havers we can call them that for want of a better word but thats not what they are all right young women then in subordinate positions does that make it right no of course not but weve no direct proof of seduction yet she was pregnant for gods sake someone seduced her or she seduced someone or they seduced each other oras you said yourself yesterdayshe was raped perhaps but im having second thoughts about that why havers tone was belligerent a suggestion that lynleys response implied impossibility or are you of the typical male opinion that she would have lain back and enjoyed the experience he glanced in her direction i think you know better than that then whats your point she reported thorsson for sexual harassment if she was willing to do that and face the possibility of a potentially embarrassing investigation into her own behaviour i cant see that shed let a rape go unmentioned what if it was date rape inspector some bloke she was seeing but didnt expect or want to get involved with then youve just put thorsson out of the picture havent you you do think hes innocent her fist hit the steering wheel youre looking for a way to exonerate him arent you youre trying to pin this on someone else who she flashed a knowing look at him a second after she asked the question oh no you cant be thinking im not thinking anything im looking for the truth she swung the car to the left in the direction of cherry hinton passing a common that was rich with yellowleaved horse chestnuts wearing a new winters growth of moss on their trunks beneath them two women pushed prams side by side their heads tilted together their eager conversation sending out rapid puffs of steam in the air it was just after eight when they drove into thorssons housing estate in the narrow drive of his house on ashwood court a fully restored tr was sitting its bulbous green wings gleaming in the morning light they pulled up behind it so close that the front of the mini nosed into its boot like a careful insult nice bit that havers said as she looked it over just the sort of thing one expects ones local marxist to drive lynley got out and went to inspect the car aside from the windscreen it was beaded with moisture he pressed his hand to the smooth surface of the bonnet he could feel the remnants of the engines warmth another morning arrival he said does that make him innocent it certainly makes him something they went to the door where lynley rang the bell as his sergeant dug through her shoulder bag and brought forth her notebook when there was no immediate answer and no apparent movement in the house he rang the bell a second time a distant shout drifted down to them a mans voice calling out the words a moment more than one moment passed as they stood waiting on the sliver of concrete that served as the front step watching two sets of neighbours hurry off to work and a third usher two children into an escort that idled in the drive then behind the five opaque shafts of glass in the door a shadow moved as someone approached the deadbolt turned thorsson stood in the entry he wore a black velour dressing gown which he was in the process of belting his hair was damp it hung loose round his shoulders he had nothing on his feet mr thorsson lynley said by way of greeting thorsson sighed looked from lynley to havers christ he said wonderful weve got snuten again roughly he ran a hand back through his hair it fell onto his forehead in a boyish tangle what is it with you two what do you want he didnt wait for an answer instead he turned from the door and walked down a short corridor towards the rear of the house where a door opened into what appeared to be the kitchen they followed and found him pouring himself a mug of coffee from an impressivelooking coffee maker that sat on the work top he began to drink making a great deal of noise first blowing then slurping his moustache quickly became beaded with the liquid id offer you some but i require the whole pot to wake up in the morning that said he added more to his cup lynley and havers took places at a glass and chrome table sitting in front of french doors these led into a small rear garden where flagstones formed a terrace which held a set of outdoor furniture one of the pieces was a wide chaise longue a rumpled blanket lay across it limp with the damp lynley looked thoughtfully from the chaise to thorsson the other man glanced out the kitchen window in the direction of the furniture then he looked back to lynley his face a perfect blank we seem to have taken you from your morning bath lynley said thorsson swallowed some coffee he was wearing a flat gold chain round his neck it glittered like snakeskin against his chest elena weaver was pregnant lynley said thorsson leaned against the work top holding his coffee mug balanced against his arm he looked uninterested overcome with ennui and to think i had no opportunity to join her in celebrating the future blessed event was a celebration in order i wouldnt know would i i thought you might why you were with her thursday night i wasnt with her inspector i went to see her theres a difference perhaps too subtle for you to grasp but a difference all the same of course but shed got the results of the pregnancy test on wednesday did she ask to see you or did you take it upon yourself to see her i went to see her she didnt know i was coming ah thorssons fingers tightened their grip on the mug i see of course i was the anxious fathertobe waiting to hear the results did the rabbit live precious or should we start stockpiling disposable nappies is that how you have it no not exactly havers flipped over a page in her notebook she said youd want to know about the test results i imagine if you were the father all things considered what things considered the harassment charges a pregnancy is rather convincing evidence wouldnt you say thorsson barked a laugh what am i supposed to have done dear sergeant rape her tear off her knickers ply her with drugs and have at her afterwards perhaps havers said but seduction seems so much more in your line no doubt you could fill volumes with your knowledge of that subject lynley said have you ever had a problem with a female student before what do you mean problem what kind of problem an elena weaver kind of problem have you ever been charged with harassment before of course not never ask at the college if you dont believe me ive spoken to dr cuff he confi rms what you say but his words not good enough for you it seems youd prefer to believe the stories cooked up by a little deaf tart who would have spread her legsor opened her mouthfor any idiot willing to give her a try a little deaf tart mr thorsson lynley said curious choice of words are you suggesting that elena had a reputation for promiscuity thorsson went back to his coffee poured another mugful took his time about drinking it things get around he settled on saying the college is small theres always gossip so if she was ahavers made a production of squinting down at her notesa little deaf tart why not poke her yourself along with all the other blokes what more reasonable conclusion for you to reach than to assume shedwhat was it again the deliberately concentrated look at her notes ah yes here it isspread her legs or open her mouth for you after all she should have been willing a man like you could no doubt offer her a real cut above her usual bit of spare thorssons face washed scarlet it did battle with the elegant redgold of his hair but he said only and with perfect ease i am sorry sergeant i cant oblige you no matter how much youd like the encounter i prefer women who weigh under ten stone havers smiled with neither pleasure nor amusement but rather with the knowledge of having trapped her quarry like elena weaver djävla skit give it up lynley said where were you monday morning mr thorsson at the english faculty i mean early monday morning between six and half past in bed here where else would i be i thought you might tell us one of your neighbours saw you arriving home just before seven then one of my neighbours is mistaken who was it anyway that cow next door someone who saw you drive up get out of the car and go into your house all of it done in a bit of a hurry can you elucidate on that im sure you agree that your triumph would be a difficult car to mistake not in this instance i was here inspector and this morning this i was here the cars engine was still warm when we arrived and that makes me a killer is that how you read it i dont read it in any particular fashion i just want to know where you were here i told you i cant help what a neighbour saw but it wasnt me i see lynley looked across the table at havers he felt wearied by and bored with the necessity for endless sparring with the swede he felt the need for truth and it appeared there would only be one way to get it he said sergeant if you will havers was only too delighted to do the honours with great ceremony she fl ipped her notebook open to the inside of the cover where she kept a copy of the official caution lynley had heard her give it hundreds of times so he was well aware that she knew the words by heart her use of the notebook added drama to the occasion and given his own growing antipathy for lennart thorsson he didnt deny her the pleasure of milking the moment for personal satisfaction now lynley said when havers had fi nished where were you sunday night mr thorsson where were you in the early hours of monday morning i demand a solicitor lynley gestured towards the phone which hung on the wall please he said weve plenty of time i cant get one at this hour of the morning and you know it fine we can wait thorsson shook his head in an eloquentif clearly apocryphaldisplay of disgust all right he said i was heading to st stephens early monday morning one of the undergraduates wanted to meet with me id forgotten her paper and was in a rush to come back and get it and get to the meeting on time is that what youre so determined to know her paper i see and this morning nothing this morning then how do you explain the condition of the triumph aside from being warm its covered with damp where was it parked last night here and you want us to believe that you went out this morning wiped off only the windscreen for purposes unknown and returned to the house to have a bath i dont much care what either of you and that perhaps you idled the engine for a bit to get the car warmed up although you arent apparently going anywhere at the moment ive already said youve already said a great deal mr thorsson and none of it meshes with anything else if you think i murdered that fucking little cunt lynley got to his feet id like to have a look at your clothes thorsson shoved his coffee mug the length of the work top it crashed into the sink you need a warrant for that you damn well know it if youre an innocent man you have nothing to fear do you mr thorsson just produce the undergraduate you met with on monday morning and hand over everything black that you own weve found black fibres on the body by the way but as theyre a mixture of polyester rayon and cotton we should be able to eliminate one or two of your garments right off the top that ought to cover it that covers skit if you want black fi bres give a thought to trying the academic gowns oh but you wont go sniffing in that direction will you because everyone in the fucking university owns one an interesting point is the bedroom this way lynley headed back in the direction of the front door in a sitting room at the front of the house he found the stairway and began to climb thorsson followed him with havers quickly at his heels you bastard you cant this is your bedroom lynley said at the doorway closest to the top of the stairs he walked into the room and opened the clothes cupboard built into one of the walls lets see what we have sergeant a sack havers tossed him a plastic rubbish sack as he began his examination of the clothes ill have your job for this lynley looked up where were you monday morning mr thorsson where were you this morning an innocent man has nothing to fear sergeant havers added if hes innocent in the first place if he lives an honest life if he has nothing to hide every vein on thorssons neck swelled his pulse was throbbing like a drumbeat in his temple his fingers jerked at the belt of his dressing gown take it all he said you have my bloody permission take every rotten piece but dont forget this he ripped the dressing gown from his body he wore nothing underneath it he put his hands on his hips i have nothing to hide from you lot he said i didnt know whether to laugh applaud or make an arrest on the spot for indecent exposure havers said that bloke takes everything right over the top hes in a class all his own lynley agreed i wonder if thats what the university environment does encourages the senior fellows to disrobe before police officers i dont think so havers they had stopped at a bakery in cherry hinton where they picked up two fresh currant buns and two tepid coffees these they drank from styrofoam cups on their way back into the town lynley cooperatively operating the gear shift to leave his sergeant with at least one free hand still it was a telling sort of thing to do wasnt it sir i dont know about you but i think he actually was looking for the opportunity toi mean i think he was all hot to displaywell you know lynley crumpled the flimsy paper in which his currant bun had been wrapped he deposited it in the ashtray among what appeared to be at least two dozen cigarette butts he was eager enough to make a show of his equipment theres no doubt of that havers you provoked him to it her head whipped in his direction me sir i didnt do a thing and you know it you did im afraid youve indicated from the first that you arent about to be dazzled by either his position at the university or any of his accomplishments dubious though they probably are so he felt compelled to give you an adequate idea of the size of the pleasure he was going to withhold as your punishment what a berk in a word lynley took a sip of his coffee and changed down into second gear as havers rounded a corner and stepped on the clutch but he did something more havers and if youll pardon the expression thats the beauty of it all what besides provide me with the best mornings entertainment ive had in years he verified the story elena told terence cuff how what lynley changed to third and then fourth before replying according to what elena told dr cuff thorssons approach to her had included among other things references to the diffi culties hed had when he was engaged to be married what sort of diffi culties sexual ones centring round the size of his erection too much man for the poor woman to handle that sort of thing exactly havers eyes lit and how would elena have known about his size unless hed actually told her himself he was probably hoping to get her interested in having a look perhaps he even gave her one to get her juices fl owing indeed and taken as a whole its not the sort of veiled invitation to intercourse that a twentyyearold girl would cook up on her own is it especially when it so exactly matches the truth if the story were invention shed have been more likely to come up with something far more blatant on thorssons part and hes capable of blatancy as weve just seen so he was lying about the harassment situation andhavers smiled with undisguised pleasureif he was lying about that why not about everything else as well hes definitely back in the running sergeant id say hes about to win the race by a length well see but sir drive on sergeant they headed back into town where after a minor snarl of traffic created by a collision between two taxis at the top of station road they drove to police headquarters and unloaded the sack of clothing which theyd taken from thorssons house the uniformed receptionist buzzed them through the interior lobby doors with a nod at lynleys identifi cation they took the lift up to the superintendents offi ce they found sheehan standing next to his secretarys vacant desk the telephone receiver pressed to his ear his conversation consisted mostly of grunts and damns and blast it alls he finally said impatiently youve had him jumping through hoops with that girls body for two days now and were getting nowhere drakeif you dont agree with his conclusions call in a specialist from the met and have done with iti dont care what the cc thinks at this point ill handle him just do itlisten to me this isnt an enquiry into your competence as department head but if you cant in conscience sign off on pleasances report and if he wont change it theres nothing else to be donei dont have the power to give him the sackthats the way it is man just phone the met when he rang off he didnt appear pleased to see the representatives from new scotland yard standing in the doorway as further testimony to the outside help which the circumstances of elena weavers murder had forced him and his police force to endure trouble lynley asked sheehan picked up a batch of folders from his secretarys desk and riffled through a stack of papers in her in tray what a woman he said with a nod at her empty chair she called in ill this morning she has a real sixth sense about when things are going to heat up does edwina and things are heating up sheehan grabbed three papers from the tray stuck them with the folders under his arm and lumbered into his offi ce lynley and havers followed ive got my cc at huntingdon breathing down my neck about devising a strategy for what he calls renewed community relationsa fancy title for coming up with a way to keep the nobs at the university happy so that you lot dont start making regular appearances here in the future ive got the funeral home and the parents asking after the weaver girls body every quarter hour and nowwith a look at the plastic sack dangling from havers fi ngers i expect youve brought me something else to play with clothes for forensic havers said wed like to make a match with the fibres on the body if you can give us something positive we might have what we need to make an arrest its looking possible sheehan nodded grimly i hate to give those two bickering old biddies something else to fight over but well have a go theyve been sniping over the weapon since yesterday maybe thisll take their minds off that for a bit theyve still reached no conclusion lynley asked pleasance has done drake doesnt agree he wont sign the report and hes been dragging his heels about calling in the met for another opinion since yesterday afternoon professional pride if you catch my drift not to mention competence hes afraid at this point that pleasance is in the right and since hes made such an issue about getting rid of the bloke he stands to lose a lot more than just face if anyone confirms pleasances conclusions sheehan threw the folders and the papers down on his desk where they mingled with a stack of pages from a computer printout he rooted through his top drawer and brought out a roll of mints he offered them round sank into his chair and loosened his tie outside in edwinas office the phone began to ring he ignored it love and death he said mix up pride with either of them and youre done for arent you is it the mets involvement thats bothering drake or the involvement of any outsider the double ringing of the telephone continued in the outer office sheehan continued to let it go unanswered its the met he said drakes got himself in a dither over the implication that hes got to be rescued by his london betters the fact that youre here has our cid boys in a rumble drake doesnt want the same to happen in forensic where he already has trouble enough keeping pleasance in line but drake wouldnt object if someone elsesomeone uninvolved with the yard had a look at the body especially if that someone worked directly with the two of themdrake and pleasancegave them the information verbally and allowed them to create the report sheehans features sharpened with interest what do you have in mind inspector an expert witness thats not on we dont have the funding to pay an outsider you wont have to pay footsteps rang against the floor in the outer office a breathless voice answered the phone lynley said well have the information we need without the mets presence telegraphing to everyone that drakes competence is being questioned and what happens when the time comes for someone to testify in court inspector neither drake nor pleasance can get in the box and give evidence that isnt his either one can if he assists and if his conclusions are the same as the experts thoughtfully sheehan played the roll of mints back and forth on the top of his desk can it be arranged discreetly so that no one aside from drake and pleasance knows the expert witness was here in the first place when sheehan nodded lynley said just hand me the phone a womans voice called out to sheehan from the outer office a diffi dent superintendent and nothing more sheehan got to his feet joined the uniformed constable who had answered his phone as they spoke together havers turned to lynley youre thinking of st james she said will he be able to come up faster than someone from the met i dare say lynley replied without the attendant paperwork and without the politics just pray hes not scheduled to give testimony anywhere within the next few days he looked up as sheehan plunged back into the office making for the metal stand upon which his overcoat was hanging he grabbed this snatched up the plastic sack which sat next to havers chair and flung it to the constable who had followed him to the door see the forensic boys get this he said and then to lynley and havers lets go lynley knew without asking what the set expression on sheehans face meant hed seen it too many times to wonder what had provoked it hed even felt his own features take on the manifestation of that grim anger that always attended the revelation of a crime so he was prepared for the inevitable announcement that sheehan made as they got to their feet weve got another body two panda cars lights flashing and sirens howling led the caravan of vehicles on a fl ight out of cambridge tearing down lensfield road soaring over the fen causeway and up along the backs to make the turn west towards madingley they left in their wake groups of staring students bicycle riders veering out of the way blackgowned fellows setting off to lectures and two tourist buses disgorging japanese visitors at the autumndecked avenue which led to new court at trinity college havers mini was sandwiched between the second panda car and sheehans own vehicle onto which he had slapped a temporary warning light behind him charged the scenesofcrime van and behind that an ambulance in the futile hope that the word body didnt necessarily mean death they powered across the flyover that bridged the m and swung through the collection of cottages that comprised the tiny village of madingley beyond it they shot along a narrow lane it was a farming area an abrupt change from town to country just minutes away from cambridge hedgerows characterised ithawthorn briar and holly marking the boundaries of fields newly planted with winter wheat they rounded a curve beyond which a tractor stood half on and half off the verge its enormous wheels crusted with mud atop it sat a man in a bulky jacket with its collar turned up round his ears and his shoulders hunched against the wind and the cold he waved them to a halt and hopped to the ground a border collie that had been lying motionless at the rear wheel of the tractor got to its feet upon the mans sharp command and came to his side over here the man said after introducing himself as bob jenkins and pointing out his home about a quarter mile away set back from the road and surrounded by barn outbuildings and fields shasta found her hearing his name the dog pricked up his ears gave one extremely disciplined wag of the tail and followed his master about twenty feet beyond the tractor where a body lay in a tangle of weeds and bracken along the base of the hedge never seen anything like it jenkins said i di know what the ruddy worlds comin to he pulled at his nose which was scarlet from the cold and squinted against the northeast wind it held the fog at bayas it had done on the previous daybut it brought along with it the frigid temperatures of the grey north sea a hedgerow offered little protection against it damn was sheehans only remark as he squatted by the body lynley and havers joined him it was a girl tall and slender with a fall of hair the colour of beechwood she was wearing a green sweatshirt white shorts athletic shoes and rather grimy socks the left one of which had become rucked round her ankle she lay on her back with her chin tilted up her mouth open her eyes glazed and her torso was a mass of crimson broken by the dark tattooing of unburnt particles of gunpowder a single glance was enough to tell all of them that the only possible use the ambulance might serve would be to convey the corpse to autopsy you havent touched her lynley asked bob jenkins the man looked horrified by the very thought didnt touch nothing he said shasta here snuffed her but he backed up quick enough didnt he when he caught the smell of the powder not one for guns is shasta you heard no shots this morning jenkins shook his head i was working over the engine of the tractor early on i had it going off and on playing with the carburettor and making a bit of a row if someone took her down then he jerked his head at the body but didnt look at it i wouldnt have heard what about the dog jenkins hand automatically went for the dogs head which was inches away from his own left thigh shasta blinked panted briefl y and accepted the caress with another single wag of his tail he did set to with a bit of barking jenkins said i had the radio going over the engine noise and had to shout him down do you remember what time this was at first he shook his head but then he lifted a gloved hand quicklyone fi nger skyward as if an idea had suddenly struck him it was somewhere near half six youre sure they were reading the news and i wanted to hear if the pms going to do something about this poll tax business his eyes shifted to the body and quickly away girl could of been hit then all right but i have to tell that shasta might of just been barking to bark he does that some around them the uniformed police were rolling out the crime scene tape and blocking off the lane as the scenesofcrime team began unloading the van the police photographer approached with his camera held before him like a shield he looked a bit green under the eyes and round the mouth he waited some feet away for the signal from sheehan who was peering at the bloodsoaked front of the dead girls sweatshirt a shotgun he said and then looking up he shouted to the scenesofcrime team keep an eye out for the wad you lot he rested on his thick haunches and shook his head thiss going to be worse than looking for dust in the desert why havers asked sheehan cocked his head at her in surprise lynley said shes a city dweller superintendent and then to havers its pheasant season sheehan went on with anyone wanting to have a bash at the pheasants is going to own a shotgun sergeant the killings begin next week its the time of year when every idiot with an itchy finger and a need to feel like some real blood sports just the way to get him back to his roots will be out blasting away at anything that moves well be seeing wounds every which way by the end of the month but not like this no this was no accident he fumbled in his trouser pocket and brought out a wallet from which he extracted a credit card two runners he said pensively both of them women both of them tall both fair both longhaired youre not thinking were looking at a serial killing havers sounded a mixture of doubt and disappointment that the cambridge superintendent might have reached such a conclusion sheehan used the edge of his credit card to clean off a patch of dirt and leaves that clung to the front of the girls bloodsoaked sweatshirt over the left breast the words queens college cambridge were stencilled round the college coat of arms you mean someone with a nasty little bent for bringing down fairhaired college runners sheehan asked no i dont think so serial killers dont vary their routines this much the killings their signature you know what i mean i beat in another head with a brick you coppers are you any closer to fi nding me yet he cleaned off the credit card wiped his fingers on a rustcoloured handkerchief and pushed himself to his feet shoot her graham he said over his shoulder and the photographer came forward to do so at that the scenesofcrime team began to move as did the uniformed constables beginning the slow process of examining every inch of the surrounding ground bob jenkins said got to get in that fi eld if youve a mind to let me and tilted his chin to direct their attention to where he had been heading in the first place when his dog had come upon the body perhaps three yards away from the dead girl a break in the hedge revealed a gate giving access to the nearest field lynley eyed it for a moment as the crime scene people began their work in a few minutes he said to the farmer and added to sheehan theyll need to look for prints all along the verge superintendent footprints tyre prints from a car or a bike right sheehan said and went to speak with his team lynley and havers walked to the gate it was only wide enough to accommodate the tractor and hemmed in on both sides by a heavy growth of hawthorn they climbed carefully over the ground beyond was soft trodden and rutted as it gave way to the fi eld itself but its consistency was crumbly and fragile so although the imprints of feet were everywhere nowhere did they leave an impression that was anything more than merely another indentation in the already choppy ground nothing decent havers said as she scouted round the area but if it was a lyinginwait then the waiting had to be done right here lynley concluded he worked his eyes slowly over the ground from one side of the gate to the other when he saw what he was looking foran indentation in the ground that didnt fit with the resthe said havers she joined him he pointed out the smooth circular impression in the earth the barely discernible narrow extended impression behind it the sharp deeper fissure that comprised its conclusion as a unit the impressions angled acutely perhaps two and a half feet beyond the gate itself and less than a foot from the hawthorn hedge knee leg toe lynley said the killer knelt here hidden by the hedge on one knee resting the gun on the second bar of the gate waiting but how could anyone have known that shed be running this way the same way someone knew where to find elena weaver justine weaver scraped a knife along the burnt edge of the toast watching the resulting black ash speckle the clean surface of the kitchen sink like a fine deposit of powder she tried to find a place inside her where compassion and understanding still resided a place like a well from which she could drink deeply and somehow replenish what the events of the past eight monthsand the last two days had desiccated but if a wellspring of empathy had ever existed at her core it had long since dried up leaving in its place the barren ground of resentment and despair and nothing fl owed from this theyve lost their daughter she told herself they share a mutual grief but those facts did not eliminate the wretchedness she had felt since monday night a replay of an earlier pain like the same melody in a different key theyd come home together in silence yesterday anthony and his former wife theyd been to see the police theyd gone on to the funeral home theyd chosen a coffin and made the arrangements none of which they shared with her it was only when she brought out the plates of thin sandwiches and cake only when she had poured the tea only when she had passed them each the lemon and the milk and the sugar that either of them spoke in anything other than weary monosyllables and then it was glyn who fi nally addressed her choosing the moment and wielding the weapon a superficially simple declaration that was skilfully honed by time and circumstance as she spoke she kept her eyes on the sandwich plate which justine was offering her and which she made no move to accept id prefer you to stay away from my daughters funeral justine they were in the sitting room gathered round the low coffee table the artifi cial fi re was lit its flames lapping the false coals with a quiet hiss the curtains were drawn an electric clock whirred softly it was such a sensible civilised place to be at first justine said nothing she looked at her husband waiting for him to voice a protest of some sort but he was giving his attention to his teacup and saucer a muscle pulled at the corner of his mouth he knew this was coming she thought and she said anthony you had no real tie to elena glyn went on her voice was even so extremely reasonable so id prefer you not to be there i hope you understand ten years as her stepmother justine said please glyn said as her fathers second wife justine set the plate down she studied the neat array of sandwiches nothing how shed assembled them to form a pattern egg salad crab fresh ham cream cheese crusts neatly removed every edge of the bread cut as if it were a perfect plane glyn went on well take her to london for the service so you wont have to do without anthony for longer than a few hours and then afterwards you can get directly back to the business of your lives justine merely stared trying and failing to summon a response glyn continued as if following a course shed determined in advance we never knew for certain why elena was born deaf has anthony told you that i suppose we could have had studies donesome sort of genetic thing you know what i meanbut we didnt bother anthony leaned forward put his teacup on the coffee table he kept his fingers on its saucer as if in the expectation that it would slide to the fl oor justine said i dont see that the reality is that you might produce a deaf baby as well justine if theres something wrong with anthonys genes i thought i ought to mention the possibility are you equipped emotionally i meanto deal with a handicapped child have you considered how a deaf child might put a spanner in the works of your career justine looked at her husband he didnt meet her eyes one of his hands formed a loose fist on his thigh she said is this really necessary glyn i should think youd find it helpful glyn reached for her teacup for a moment she seemed to examine the rose on the china and she turned the cup to the right to the left as if with the intention of admiring its design thats that then isnt it everythings been said she replaced the cup and stood i wont be wanting any dinner she left them alone justine turned to her husband waited for him to speak and watched him sit motionless he seemed to be disappearing into himself bones blood and flesh disintegrating into the ashes and dust from which all men were formed he has such small hands she thought and for the first time she considered the wide gold wedding band round his finger and the reason she had wanted him to have itthe largest the widest the brightest in the shop the most capable of heralding the fact of their marriage is this what you want she fi nally asked him his eyelids looked caked their skin stretched and sore what that i stay away from the funeral is this what you want anthony it has to be that way try to understand understand what that shes not responsible for who she is right now she has no control over what she says and does it goes too deep with her justine youve got to understand and stay away from the funeral she saw the movement of resignationa simple lifting and lowering of his fi ngersand knew the response he would make before he made it i hurt her i left her i owe her this much i owe both of them this much my god ive already talked to terence cuff about a memorial service friday at st stephens church youll be part of that all of elenas friends will be there and thats it thats all thats your judgement of everything of our marriage of our life of my relationship with elena this isnt about you you cant take it to heart you didnt even argue with her you could have protested he fi nally looked at her its the way it has to be she said nothing more she merely felt the hard core of her resentment take on added weight still she held her tongue be sweet justine she could hear her mother say over her need to rail like a shrew against her husband be a nice girl she put the sixth piece of toast into the rack and the rack itself along with boiled eggs and sausage onto a white wicker tray nice girls muster up compassion she thought sweet girls forgive and forgive and forgive dont think of the self go beyond the self find a need greater than your own and fill it thats the christian way to live but she couldnt do it into the scales upon which she weighed her behaviour she put the useless hours that shed given over to trying to forge a bond with elena the mornings on which shed run at her side the evenings shed spent helping her write her essays the endless sunday afternoons shed waited for father and daughter to return from a jaunt which anthony had declared essential to his recapturing of elenas love and trust she carried the tray into the glassedin morning room where her husband and his former wife were sitting at the wicker table they had been picking at grapefruit wedges and corn flakes for nearly half an hour and now she supposed they would do the same with the eggs the sausage and the toast she knew she ought to say you need to eat both of you and another justine might have managed the seven words and made them sound sincere instead she said nothing she sat in her accustomed place with her back to the drive across the table from her husband she poured him coffee he raised his head he looked ten years older than he had two days ago glyn said all this food i cant eat its such a waste really and she didnt lift her eyes from watching justine tap off the top of her boiled egg did you run this morning she asked and when justine didnt reply i imagine youll want to start that up again soon its important for a woman to keep working at her figure not a stretchmark anywhere on you is there justine stared down at the spoonful of tender white that shed scooped from her egg every admonition from her past rose up to confront her but they formed an insubstantial barrier that the previous night made easy to surmount she said elena was pregnant and then she looked up eight weeks pregnant anthonys face she saw went from drained to stricken glyns face offered a curiously satisfi ed smile that scotland yard man was here yesterday afternoon justine said he told me pregnant anthony repeated the word in a deadened voice thats what the autopsy showed but whohow anthony fumbled with a teaspoon it slipped from his fingers and clattered on the fl oor how glyn gave a tittering laugh oh id think it was how babies usually get made she nodded at justine what a moment of triumph for you my dear anthony turned his head the movement seemed sluggish as if he were pulling against a great weight whats that supposed to mean you think she doesnt savour this moment just ask her if she already knew ask her if the information surprised her at all in fact you might ask her how she encouraged your daughter to have a man whenever she felt itchy glyn leaned forward because elena told me all about it justine about those hearttoheart chats about how she was supposed to take care of herself anthony said justine you encouraged her you knew of course she knew that isnt true justine said dont think for a moment that she didnt want elena to get pregnant anthony she was willing to settle for anything to drive you away from her because if she did that shed get what she wanted you alone with no more distractions no justine said she hated elena she wanted her dead i wouldnt be surprised if she killed her herself and for a momentjust the fraction of an instantjustine saw the doubt on his face she recognised the working of knowledge shed been alone in the house when the ceephone call came shed gone out running alone in the morning she hadnt taken the dog she could have beaten and strangled his daughter she said my god anthony you knew he replied that she had a lover yes but thats all and i spoke to her yes about cleaning about hygiene about taking care that she didnt who was it anthony god damn you who was it she knows glyn said you can see that she knows how long anthony asked how long had this been going on did they do it here justine in the house while you were home did you let them did you watch did you listen at the door justine pushed herself away from the table she got to her feet her head felt empty i want answers justine anthonys voice rose who did this to my daughter justine fought to find the words she did it to herself oh yes glyn said her eyes bright and knowing lets have at the truth youre a viper anthony stood i want the facts justine then take yourself off to trinity lane to fi nd them trinity he turned from her to the wall of windows beyond which his citroën stood on the drive no he was out of the room without another word leaving the house without a coat the sleeves of his striped shirt snapping in the wind he got into the car glyn reached for an egg it didnt quite play out as you planned it she said adam jenn stared at the neat lines of his handwriting and tried to make sense out of his notes the peasants revolt the council of regency a new query was the composition of the council of regency rather than the imposition of new poll taxes largely instrumental in the circumstances that led to the revolt of he read a few phrases about john ball and wat tyler about the statute of labourers and about the king richard ii wellintentioned but ineffectual had lacked the skills and the backbone necessary for a man to be a leader he had tried to please everyone but had succeeded only in destroying himself he was historical proof of the contention that success requires more than merely a coincidental birthright political acumen is the key to arriving unscathed at a personal and professional goal adam himself had been living his academic life according to that precept hed made his choice of advisor carefully spending hours of his time scoping out the candidates for the penford chair he finally made his move in anthony weavers direction only when he felt relatively assured that the st stephens medievalist would be the selection of the university search committee to have the holder of the penford chair as his advisor would virtually guarantee him the benefits he found essential to labelling himself an eventual successthe initial position of academic supervisor to undergraduates the consequent attainment of a research fellowship the future movement to lecturer and finally a professorship before his fortyfifth birthday all of it seemed within the bounds of reasonable expectation when anthony weaver had taken him on as a graduate advisee so cooperating with weavers request that he take the professors daughter under his wing in order to make her second year at the university a smoother and more pleasant experience than her fi rst had appeared to be yet another fortuitous opportunity for him to demonstrateif only to himselfthat he possessed the requisite amount of political perspicacity to flourish in this environment what he had not counted on when fi rst told about the professors handicapped daughter and first envisaging dr weavers gratitude for the time he expended on smoothing the troubled waters of his daughters life was elena herself he had been expecting to be introduced to a stoopshouldered concavechested pastyskinned fading wildflower of a girl someone who sat miserably on the edge of a threadbare ottoman with her legs tucked back and clinging to its sides shed be wearing an old dress printed with rosebuds shed be wearing ankle socks and scruffylooking brogues and for dr weavers sake hed do his duty with an appealing blend of gravity and graciousness hed even carry a small notebook in the pocket of his jacket to make sure that they could communicate in writing at all times hed held on to this fictional elena all the way into the sitting room of anthony weavers house even going so far as to scan the guests who were there for the history facultys michaelmas drinks party hed had to give up the idea of the threadbare ottoman quickly enough when he saw the nature of the houses furnishingshe doubted that anything threadbare or frayed would be allowed to remain for longer than five minutes in this elegant environment of leather and glassbut he did maintain his mental image of the cringing retiring handicapped girl alone in a corner and afraid of everyone and then she came swinging towards him wearing a clingy black dress and dangling onyx earrings her hair catching her movement and subtly duplicating the sway of her hips she smiled and said what he took for hi youre adam arent you because her pronunciation wasnt clear he noted the fact that she smelled like ripe fruit that she didnt wear a bra that her legs were bare and that every man in the room followed her movement with his eyes no matter the conversation in which he was engaged she had a way of making a man feel special hed learned that soon enough astutely he realised that this feeling of being the sole interest in elenas life came from the fact that she had to look directly at people in order to read their lips whenever they spoke to her and for a time he convinced himself that that was the entirety of his attraction to her but even on the first evening of their acquaintance he found his eyes continually dropping to the nubs of her nipplesthey were erect they pressed against the material of her dress they asked to be sucked and moulded and licked and he found his hands sore with the need to slide round her waist cup her buttocks and pull her against him hed done none of that ever not once in the dozen or more times theyd been together hed not even kissed her and the single time shed reached out impulsively and ran her fi ngers the length of his inner thigh he had automatically knocked her hand away she laughed at him amused and unoffended and he wanted to strike her every bit as much as he wanted to fuck her he felt the desire like a blaze of fire burning right behind his eyes needing both at once the violence of abuse and the sexual act itself the sound of her pain and the satisfying knowledge of her unwilling submission it was always that way whenever he saw too much of a woman he felt caught within a raging argument of desire and disgust and perennially playing in the back of his mind was the memory of his father beating his mother and the sound of their frantic coupling afterwards knowing elena seeing elena dutifully squiring her here and there had all been part of the political process of academic advancement and scholastic success but like any act of egocentric machination what posed as selfless cooperation was not without its attendant price he had seen as much in dr weavers face whenever the professor asked him about time spent with elena just as he had seen it on the very first night when weavers eyes followed his daughter round the room shining with satisfaction when she paused to talk to adam and not to someone else it wasnt long before adam had realised that the price for success in a milieu in which anthony weaver played a major role was likely to be bound up intimately in how things developed in elenas life shes a wonderful girl weaver would say she has a lot to offer a man adam wondered what twists and turns and rough roads lay in his future now that weavers daughter was dead for while hed chosen dr weaver as his advisor strictly for the potential benefits that might accrue from such a choice he had come to know that dr weaver had accepted him with his own set of benefi ts in mind he harboured them in secret no doubt calling them his dream but adam knew exactly what they were the study door opened as he was staring at his references to the fourteenthcentury riots in kent and essex he looked up then pushed back his chair in some confusion as anthony weaver came into the room he hadnt expected to see him for at least another several days so he hadnt done much about straightening up the litter of teacups and plates and essays across the table and on the fl oor even had he done so the appearance of his advisor directly upon the heels of his having been thinking about him caused the heat to seep up adams neck and spread across his cheeks dr weaver he said i wasnt expecting his voice drifted off weaver was wearing neither jacket nor overcoat and his dark hair was curled and chaotic from the wind he carried neither briefcase nor textbooks whyever he had come it was not to work she was pregnant he said adams throat went dry he thought about taking a sip of the tea which hed poured but forgotten about an hour previously but although he slowly got to his feet he couldnt manage any other movement let alone getting his arm to reach out towards the cup weaver shut the door and remained standing next to it i dont blame you for it adam obviously you were in love with each other dr weaver i simply wished youd used some precautions its not the best way to start a life together is it adam couldnt formulate an answer it seemed that his entire future depended upon the next few minutes and how he handled them he danced between the truth and a lie wondering which would better serve his interests when justine told me i left the house in a rage i felt like some eighteenthcentury father storming out to demand satisfaction but i know how these things happen between people i just want you to tell me if youd talked about marriage before i mean before you made love to her adam wanted to say that theyd talked about it often in the late of night typing back and forth furiously on the ceephone making plans sharing dreams and committing themselves to a life together but from the roots of such a lie had to grow a convincing performance of grief over the next few months and while he regretted elenas death he did not actually mourn her passing so he knew that a show of abject sorrow would prove itself more than he could manage she was special anthony weaver was saying her babyyour baby adamwould have been special as well she was fragile and working hard to find herself its true but you were helping her grow remember that hold onto that you were tremendously good for her i would have been proud to see you together as man and wife he found he couldnt do it dr weaver i wasnt the one he dropped his eyes to the table he concentrated on the open texts his notes the essays what i mean is i never made love with elena sir he felt more colour burn its way into his flesh i never even kissed her i hardly ever touched her im not angry adam dont misunderstand you dont have to deny you were lovers im not denying im just telling you the truth the facts we werent lovers it wasnt me but she saw only you adam hesitated to bring forth the single piece of information which he knew anthony weaver was avoiding perhaps deliberately perhaps unconsciously he knew that giving it voice would also mean giving voice to the professors worst fears yet there seemed to be no other way to convince the man of the truth about his own relationship with elena and he was an historian after all historians are supposed to be seekers of truth he could demand no less of himself he said no sir youve forgotten i wasnt the only one elena saw there was gareth randolph weavers eyes seemed to unfocus behind his spectacles adam hurried on she saw him several times a week didnt she sir as part of the deal shed struck with dr cuff he didnt want to put anything more into words he could see the grey curtain of knowledge and misery pass across weavers features that deaf weavers words stopped his eyes sharpened once again did you reject her adam is that why she looked elsewhere wasnt she good enough for you did she put you off because she was deaf no not at all i just didnt then why he wanted to say because i was afraid i thought she would suck the marrow from my bones i wanted to have her and have her and have her but not marry her god not marry her and live on the black edge of my own destruction for the rest of my life instead he said it just didnt happen between us what the sort of connection one looks for because she was deaf that wasnt an issue sir how can you say that how can you even expect me to believe it of course it was an issue it was an issue for everyone it was an issue for her how could it not be adam knew this was dangerous ground he wanted to retreat from the confrontation but weaver was waiting for his answer and his stony expression told adam how important it was that he answer correctly she was just deaf sir nothing else just deaf whats that supposed to mean that there was nothing else wrong with her even being deaf wasnt something wrong its just a word people use to indicate somethings missing like blind like mute like paralysed i suppose and if shed been those thingsblind mute paralysedwould you still be saying that it wasnt an issue but she wasnt those things would you still be saying it wasnt an issue i dont know i cant say i can only say that elenas being deaf wasnt an issue not for me youre lying sir you saw her as a freak i didnt you were embarrassed by her voice and pronunciation by the fact that she couldnt ever tell how loud she was speaking so that when you were out in public together people would hear that odd voice theyd turn theyd be curious and youd feel embarrassed with all those eyes on you and ashamed of her of yourself of being embarrassed in the first place not the great liberal that you once thought you were always wishing that she were normal because if she wereif she just could hearthen you really wouldnt feel as if you owed her something more than you were able to give adam felt his body going cold but he didnt respond he wanted to pretend that he hadnt heard or at the very least to keep his face from revealing the extent to which he comprehended the underlying meaning of what the professor had said he saw that he failed to do so on both scores for weavers own face seemed to crumble in on itself and he said oh god he walked to the mantel where adam had continued to place the gathering collection of envelopes and messages with what appeared to be a tremendous effort he swept them up and carried them to his desk and sat down he began to open them slowly ponderously his movements weighted by twenty years of denial and guilt adam cautiously lowered himself into his chair he went back to his notes but he saw this time even less than he had managed to see before he knew that he owed dr weaver some sort of reassurance a reaching out in fellowship and love but nothing in his twentysix years of limited experience provided him with the words to tell the other man that there was no sin in feeling what he felt the only sin was in running away from it he heard the professor quake with a convulsive sound he turned in his chair weaver he saw had been opening the envelopes and although the contents of at least three of them lay on his lap and another was crumpled into his fist he was looking at nothing he had removed his spectacles and covered his eyes with his hand he was weeping melinda powell was about to wheel her bicycle from queens lane into old court when a panda car pulled up less than half a block away a uniformed policeman got out of it as did the president of queens college along with the senior tutor the three of them stood talking in the cold arms folded across their chests breath clouding the air faces grave and grim the policeman nodded at something the president was saying to the senior tutor and as they moved apart from one another preparatory to the policemans taking his leave a noisy mini rumbled into the lane from silver street and parked behind them two people emerged a tall blond man wearing a cashmere overcoat and a squat square woman swathed in scarves and wool they joined the others the blond man producing some sort of identification and the president of the college following up by offering his hand there was a great deal of earnest conversation a gesture from the president towards the side entrance to the college and what appeared to be some sort of direction given by the blond to the uniformed policeman he nodded and came trotting back to where melinda stood with her mittened hands curved round the handlebars of her bike feeling the cold from the metal seeping through the knit wool like strips of damp he said sorry miss as he scooted past her and stepped through the gateway into the college melinda followed him shed been gone most of the morning struggling with an essay she was rewriting for the fourth time in an effort to make her points clear prior to showing it to her supervisor who would with his usual bent for academic sadism no doubt tear it to shreds it was nearly noon and although it was typical to see the occasional member of college strolling through old court at this time of day when melinda emerged from the turreted passage that led to queens lane she found numerous small clumps of students having hushed conversations on the path between the two rectangles of lawn while a larger group gathered at the staircase door to the left of the north turret it was through this door that the policeman disappeared after he stopped for a moment to answer a question melinda faltered when she saw this her bicycle felt heavy as if a rusting chain made it difficult to push and she lifted her eyes to the top fl oor of the building where she tried to see through the windows of that misshapen room tucked under the eaves whats going on she asked a boy who was passing he wore a sky blue anorak and matching knit cap with the words ski bulgaria blazed onto it in red some runner he said got bagged this morning who another bird from hare and hounds they said melinda felt dizzy she heard him ask you all right but she didnt respond instead with every sense numbed she pushed her bicycle towards the door of rosalyn simpsons staircase she promised melinda whispered to herself and just for a moment the overwhelming nature of rosalyns betrayal was even more devastating than was her death she hadnt extracted the promise from her in bed when resolutions weaken in the face of desire nor had she engaged in a tearfi lled confrontation in which she used rosalyns past vulnerabilities as tools of successful manipulation instead she had opted for discussiontrying to remain calm and to avoid falling into the panic and hysteria which she knew would drive rosalyn away eventually if she didnt learn to get it under controland she urged her lover to consider the dangers of continuing to run while a killer was at large she expected a fight especially since she knew how much rosalyn regretted the earlier impulsive promise that had led her to oxford on monday morning but instead of an argument or even a refusal to discuss the issue rosalyn agreed she wouldnt run again until the killer was found or if she ran she would not run alone they had parted at midnight still a couple melinda thought still in lovealthough they hadnt made love as she had hoped they might in what shed imagined all tuesday would be a celebration of rosalyns coming forward and admitting her sexual preference to the world it hadnt worked out that way rosalyn had pleaded exhaustion speaking of an essay she had to work on and expressing a need to be alone in order to come to terms with elena weavers death all an excuse melinda realised now all part of the beginning of the end between them and didnt it always happen that way the initial rapture of love the encounters the hopes the growing intimacy a prayer for shared dreams joyful communication and ultimately disappointment she had thought that rosalyn was going to be different but it was obvious now she was a liar and a cheat like all the rest bitch she thought bitch you promised and you lied what else did you lie about who else did you sleep with did you sleep with elena she leaned her bicycle against the wall indifferent to the fact that the college rules explicitly required that she take it elsewhere and elbowed her way into the crowd she saw that one of the porters stood just inside the entry barring the doorway to the curious and looking one part grim and one part angry and several other parts disgusted over the murmur of voices she heard him say shotgun blasted her direct in the face and her anger dissolved as fast as it had come upon her melted by the power of those seven simple words shotgun blasted her direct in the face melinda found that she was biting down on her woolcovered fingers instead of the porter standing in the doorway in old court what she saw was rosalyn her face and body shattered disintegrating before her blowing away in a roar of gunpowder shot and blood and then directly afterwards in rosalyns place grew the dreadful knowledge of who had to have done this and why and how her own life hung in the balance she searched the faces of the students round her looking for the face that would be looking for hers it wasnt there but that didnt mean it wasnt nearby looking from a window waiting to see her reaction to the death hed be resting a bit from the labours of the morning but his every intention would be to see the job through to the end she felt her muscles coiling as her body reacted to her minds demand for fl ight at the same time she was acutely aware of the need for an ostensible show of calm for if she turned and ran in full view of everyoneespecially in full view of the watcher who was simply waiting for her to make her moveshe was lost for a certainty where to go she wondered god god where to go the crowd of students in which she stood began to part as a mans voice said step to one side please and then havers make that call to london will you and the blond man she had seen in queens lane shouldered his way through the whispering group in front of the door as his companion headed in the general direction of the junior combination room porter says it was a shotgun someone called out as the blond mounted the single step that gave entry to the building in reaction the man favoured the porter with a critical glance but he said nothing as he passed him and began climbing the stairs blew her guts out i heard a spottyfaced young man said no it was her face someone replied raped fi rst tied up both her tits cut off and melindas body sprang into action she spun from the sound of the speculative voices and shoved her way blindly out of the crowd if she was fast enough if she didnt pause to consider where she was going and how she was going to get there if she scrambled to her room and grabbed a rucksack and some clothes and the money her mother had sent her for her birthday she dashed across the front of the building to the stairway on the right side of the southern turret she pushed open the door and fl ew up the stairs scarcely breathing scarcely thinking she sought only escape someone called her name when she hit the second landing but she ignored the voice and continued to dash upward there was her grandmothers house in west sussex she thought a greatuncle lived in colchester her brother in kent but none of them seemed safe enough far enough away none of them seemed capable of offering her the sort of protection she would need from a killer who seemed to know movements in advance of their being made who seemed to know thoughts and plans in advance of their being given voice he was in fact a killer who even now might be waiting at the top floor she paused outside her door recognising the potential danger that lay within her bowels were loosening and tears were eating at the back of her eyes she listened at the smudged white panels of the door but the recessed shape of them did nothing more than act as amplifiers for her own torn breathing she wanted to run she needed to hide but she had to have that cache of money to do either jesus she whispered oh god oh god she would reach for the doorknob she would fling the door open if the killer was there she would scream like a banshee she filled her lungs with enough air to do the job right and thrust her shoulder against the door it fl ew open it crashed back against the wall it left her with an unimpeded view of the room rosalyns body was lying on her bed melinda began to scream glyn weaver positioned herself just to the left of the window in her daughters bedroom and flicked the sheer material away from the glass so that she could have an unimpaired glimpse of the front lawn the irish setter was gambolling there yelping joyfully in expectation of a run he was circling frantically round justine who had changed into a tracksuit and running shoes and who was bending and stretching through a series of warmups shed taken the dogs lead outside with her and townee scooped it up from the lawn on one of his passes by her he carried it like a banner he cavorted and pranced elena had sent her a dozen pictures of the dog as a furry baby curled into her lap asleep a longlegged pup rooting for his gifts beneath the christmas tree in her fathers house a sleek adolescent leaping over a drystone wall on the back of each she had written townees agesix weeks two days four months eight days ten months todaylike an indulgent mother glyn wondered if she would have done the same for the baby shed carried or if elena would have opted for abortion a baby after all was different from a dog and no matter her reasons for getting herself pregnantand glyn knew her daughter well enough to realise that elenas pregnancy had probably been a calculated actelena was not so much the fool as to believe her life would be unchanged as a result of bringing a child into it children always altered ones existence in unaccountable ways and their unwavering devotion could hardly be relied upon as could a dogs they took and took and rarely gave and only the most selfless sort of adult could continually enjoy the sensation of being drained of every resource and bled of every dream and for what reward just the nebulous hope that this lovely creaturethis complete individual over whom one had absolutely no controlwould somehow not make the same mistakes repeat the same patterns or know the same pain that the parents had lived through and inflicted on each other outside justine was tying back her hair at the nape of her neck glyn took note of the fact that to do so she used a scarf that matched both the colour of her tracksuit and the colour of her shoes idly she wondered if justine ever left the house in anything less than a complete ensemble and she chuckled at the sight of her even if one wished to criticise the fact that justine chose to go exercising just two days after her stepdaughters murder one certainly couldnt condemn her for her choice of colour it was thoughtfully appropriate such a hypocrite glyn thought her lower lip curling she turned from the sight of her justine had left the house without a word sleek and cool and utterly patrician but no longer as controlled as she liked to be their confrontation this morning in the breakfast room had taken care of that with the real woman smoked out from beneath the guise of dutiful hostess and professors perfect wife so now she would run to tone up that lovely seductive body to work up a fragrant rosescented sweat but it was more than that she had to run now and she had to hide because the fact beneath the fiction that was justine weaver had finally been revealed in the breakfast room in that fleeting moment when her normally guileless butterwouldntmelt features became rigid with the culpability that lay beneath them the truth was out she had hated elena and now that she was off for her run glyn was ready to search out the evidence which would prove that justines facade of wellbridled feelings skilfully hid the desperation of a killer outside the house she heard the dog barking a happy sound of excitement that rapidly faded towards adams road they were off the two of them whatever time she had until justines return glyn was determined to use every moment she bustled to the master bedroom with its sleek danish furniture and shapely brass lamps she went to the long low chest and began opening drawers georgina higginshart the weaselfaced constable squinted at his notebook the cover of which bore a stain that looked suspiciously like pizza sauce a member of hare and hounds working on an mphil in renaissance literature newcastle girl he snapped the notebook closed president of the college and the senior tutor had no trouble identifying the body inspector theyve both known her since she came up to cambridge three years back the constable stood posted outside the closed door of the girls bedsitting room he was positioned like a guard legs spread and arms folded across his chest and his expressionflickering indecisively between smug judgement and outright derision indicated the degree to which he considered the inadequacies of new scotland yard cid responsible for this latest cambridge killing lynley said only do you have the key constable and took it from the mans palm when he handed it over georgina he saw had been a devotee of woody allen and most of the bedsits limited wall space was given over to posters celebrating his films bookshelves took up the rest of the space and on them sat an eclectic display of the girls possessions everything from a collection of ancient raggedy ann dolls to a seriously extensive selection of wine she had lined up what few books she owned onto the mantel of the brickedin fi replace they were held in place on either end by a dispiritedlooking miniature palm with the constable outside and the door closed upon him lynley sat on the edge of the single bed a pink duvet covered it with a large bouquet of yellow paeonies embroidered into its centre his fingers traced the pattern of flowers and leaves as his mind traced the pattern of the two killings the outline comprised the most obvious details a second runner from hare and hounds a second girl a second victim who was tall and lithe and longhaired and engagedin the darknessin an early mornings workout those were the superficial similarities but if the killings were connected there had to be others and there were of course the most immediately apparent was the fact that georgina higginshart like elena weaver had a relationship with the english faculty although she was a postgraduate lynley could not overlook the fact that in her fourth year at the university she would have known many of the professors most of the lecturers and everyone associated with her own field of renaissance literature those writingsboth european and britishof the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth centuries he knew what havers was going to make of this information when she learned of it and he couldnt deny the connection it suggested but he also couldnt ignore the fact that georgina higginshart was a member of queens college nor could he deny the additional connection that queens college implied he got to his feet and went to the desk which was tucked into an alcove whose walls were hung with a collection of framed stills from sleeper bananas and take the money and run he was reading the opening paragraph of an essay on the winters tale when the door opened and sergeant havers came into the room she joined him at the desk well georgina higginshart he said renaissance literature he could sense her smile as she matched the period of time with its most signifi cant author i knew it i knew it we need to get back to his house and have a go at fi nding that shotgun inspector i say we get some of sheehans blokes to tear the place apart you can hardly think that a man of thorssons intelligence would blast a young girl into oblivion and then simply replace the gun among his belongings he knows hes under suspicion sergeant he isnt a fool he doesnt need to be a fool she said he just needs to be desperate beyond that as sheehan pointed out were standing on the threshold of the pheasant season shotguns abound i wouldnt be surprised to learn that the university itself has an outdoor society devoted to hunting if theres a student handbook on the mantel you can check on that yourself she didnt move you cant mean to suggest that these killings arent related i dont mean to suggest that i think they are but not necessarily in the most obvious fashion then how what other connection is there but the most obvious ones which by the way weve been handed on a platter okay i know youre going to argue that she was a runner so theres another connection for us to play with and i know she had the same general appearance as the weaver girl but frankly inspector trying to build a case on those two facts seems a lot shakier than building a case on thorsson she seemed to sense his inclination to dispute the position she was taking she went on more insistently we know there was some truth in what elena weaver claimed about thorsson he as much as demonstrated that this morning so if he was harassing her why not this girl as well theres another connection havers beyond thorsson beyond running what gareth randolph hes a member of queens she didnt look either pleased with or intrigued by this piece of information she said right quite and his motive inspector lynley fingered through the items on georginas desk he catalogued them mentally and considered his sergeants question trying to develop a hypothetical response that would fi t both murders perhaps were looking at a primary rejection thats begun seeping into the rest of his life elena weaver brushed him off so he killed her and then finding that single killing not enough to wipe the rejection out of his memory hes bent on killing her again and again wherever he finds her havers made no effort to hide her incredulity she ran a restless hand back through her hair and grabbed onto a fi stful which she tugged at impatiently i cant even begin to swallow that sir the means are too different the weaver girl may have been killed in a wellplanned attack but attack is the watchword there was real rage behind what happened to her a need to hurt as well as to kill this other she waved her hand over the top of the desk as if an indication of its scattering of books and papers would stand as symbol for the death of the second girli think this other was the need to eliminate do it fast do it simple but just do it why georgina was in hare and hounds she probably knew elena and if thats the case it stands to reason that she probably also knew what elena intended to do about thorsson and perhaps georgina higginshart was just the corroboration elena needed to make that sexual harassment charge stick perhaps thorsson knew it if he went to argue with elena about it on thursday night she might well have told him that she wasnt the only one going to the authorities and if that was the case it wasnt going to be her word against his any longer it was going to be his against theirs those arent very sweet odds are they inspector and that wouldnt have looked good to anyone lynley had to admit that havers hypothesis was grounded more solidly in reality than was his and yet unless they could come up with a viable piece of hard evidence they were stymied she seemed to realise this weve got the black fibres she persisted if his clothes make a match were on our way do you really think thorsson would have handed his things over this morningno matter his frame of mindhad he had even the slightest concern that forensic could match them to the fibres from elena weavers body lynley closed an open text on the desk he knows hes clear on that havers we need something else the primary weapon used on elena did you get st james on the phone hell be up sometime round noon tomorrow he was in the middle of messing about with some sort of a polymorphic whathaveyou mumbling about isoenzymes and getting generally blearyeyed from having looked through his microscopes for more than a week hell be glad of the diversion thats what he said no actually he said tell tommy he owes me but thats pretty much par for the course with you two isnt it quite lynley was looking at georginas engagement diary she was less active than elena weaver had been but like elena she had kept a record of her appointments seminars and supervisions were listed by subject and by name of supervisor hare and hounds had its places as well but it took only a moment for him to ascertain that lennart thorssons name appeared nowhere nor was there anything that resembled the small fi sh that elena had regularly sketched upon her calendar lynley riffled through all the pages of the book to find something that suggested the sort of intrigue implied by that fish but it was completely straightforward if georgina higginshart had secrets she hadnt hidden them here they had little enough to go on he realised mostly a series of unprovable conjectures until simon allcourtst james arrived in cambridge and unless he gave them something else to work with they would have to rely on the evidence at hand with a heaviness of heart and a growing sense that the inevitable was fast approaching between them rosalyn simpson watched as melinda continued stuffing a mishmash of belongings into two rucksacks she grabbed knee socks underwear stockings three night gowns from one drawer a silk scarf two belts four tshirts from another her passport a worn michelin guide to france from a third then she went on to the wardrobe where she removed two pairs of blue jeans a pair of sandals and a quilted skirt her face was blotched from crying and all the time she packed she snuffled occasionally she withheld a fractured sob melinda rosalyn tried to sound soothing youre not being rational i thought it was you this had been her most frequent response for the last hour an hour which had begun with her terrorised screaming moved quickly on to wildly distraught weeping and concluded with blind determination to leave cambridge at once with rosalyn in tow there had been no way to talk to her reasonably and even if there had been rosalyn felt as if she lacked the energy to do it she had spent a miserable night thrashing round in her bed while guilt spread like a prickly rash on the flesh of her conscience and the last thing she wanted now was a scene of reproach recrimination and reassurance with melinda but she was wise enough not to mention any of that at the moment rather she told melinda only part of the truth she hadnt slept well the previous night upon returning from a mornings practical shed come to melindas room with nowhere else to go to get a bit of rest when the porter had barred her from climbing her own staircase shed fallen asleep and hadnt awakened until the door crashed against the wall and melinda herself had begun screaming unaccountably she hadnt known that a runner had been shot that morning the porter had said nothing telling her only that the staircase would be closed for a while and no word had yet gone out among the members of college about the murder so no one was in front of the building at the time to pass on gossip or information but if it was someone from her staircase who had been shot she knew it had to be georgina higginshart the only other member of hare and hounds who lived in that part of the building i thought it was you melinda sobbed you promised you wouldnt run alone but i thought you ran anyway to spite me because you were angry that id insisted you tell your parents about us so i thought it was you rosalyn realised that she did feel some anger it was a bubbling bit of real resentment that promised to boil over into outright dislike she tried to ignore it saying why would i want to spite you like that i didnt run alone i didnt run at all hes after you ros hes after us both he wanted you but he got her instead but hes not done with us and weve got to get away shed taken a tin of money from its hiding place in a shoe carton shed rustled up her rucksacks from the back of one of the wardrobe shelves shed swept her copious supply of cosmetics into a plastic case and now she was rolling the blue jeans into cylindrical shapes preparatory to ramming them into the canvas sack with everything else when she was in this state there was no real talking to her but rosalyn still felt the need to try melinda this just doesnt make sense i told you last night not to talk to anyone about it didnt i but you wouldnt listen youve always got to do your precious little duty and now look where its got us where here needing to clear off and having nowhere to go but if youd thought a bit firstif youd just thought for onceand now hes waiting ros hes just biding his time he knows where to find us you as good as invited him to blow us both to bits well its not going to happen im not going to wait round to have him come for me and neither are you she took another two pullovers from a drawer were nearly the same size you wont need to go to your room for clothes rosalyn walked to the window one lone senior member of the college strolled across the lawn below the crowd of the curious had long since dispersed as had all obvious signs of the police making it difficult to believe that another runner had been murdered that morning making it impossible to believe that this second killing was tied in any way to the conversation shed had with gareth randolph last night she and melindaglowering protesting and arguing against it every step of the way had walked the few blocks to deastu and found him in his cubicle of an offi ce with no one there to interpret for them theyd used the screen of a word processor to communicate hed looked awful rosalyn recalled his eyes were rheumy his skin was unshaven and pinched on his skull he looked devastated by illness he looked exhausted and torn but he didnt look like a killer somehow she thought she would have sensed it if gareth had presented any danger to her certainly there would have been an air of tension surrounding him he would have shown signs of panic as she told him what she knew about the previous mornings murder but instead he evidenced only anger and grief and faced with that she had known for a certainty that he had been in love with elena weaver quite without warning she had felt an irrational twist of jealousy to have someoneall right a man she admitted itlove her so much that he would dream about her think about her and hope for a life together looking at gareth randolph watching his hands move over the keyboard as he typed his questions and responded to hers she felt overcome by the sudden knowledge that she wanted a conventional future like everyone else this unexpected desire brought an attendant rush of guilt it swarmed busily round the issue of betrayal yet feeling the tricks and twinges of her conscience she was roused to anger for how could there be the slightest degree of treachery in yearning for the simplest prospect that life offered everyone theyd returned to her room melindas mood had been black shed not wanted rosalyn to talk to anyone about robinson crusoes island in the first place and even the compromise of talking to gareth randolph and not to the police had been insufficient to quell her displeasure rosalyn knew that only seduction would suffi ce to woo melinda back to good humour once again and she understood how the scene would evolve between them with herself in the role of sexual supplicant and melinda grudgingly giving reply her solicitous advances would eventually melt melindas indifference while melindas languid and largely uninterested responses would keep her in her place it would be the delicate dance of expiation and punishment in which theyd engaged so many times she knew how each movement would play out against the next all of them acting as a means of proving her love in some way but while the success of the seduction generally provided a few moments gratification the entire procedure had seemed monumentally tiresome last night so shed pleaded exhaustion an essay the need to rest and to think and when melinda had left hercasting a reproachful glance over her shoulder just before she closed the doorrosalyn had experienced the most exquisite relief that hadnt done much to allow her to sleep however the satisfaction of being alone did nothing to stop her from writhing in her bed and trying to wipe from her mind all the elements of her life that seemed to be caving in on her you made the choice she told herself you are what you are no one and nothing can change that for you but how she wanted to why dont you think about us melinda was saying you never do ros i do all the time but you never do why this goes beyond us melinda stopped packing holding a rolled pair of socks in her hand how can you say that i asked you not to talk to anyone you said you had to talk anyway now someone else is dead another runner a runner from your staircase he followed her ros he thought it was you thats absurd he has no reason to hurt me you must have told him something without even being aware of its importance but he knew what it meant he wanted to kill you and since i was there as well he wants to kill me well hes not getting the chance if you arent willing to think of us i am were clearing out until theyve nabbed him she zipped the rucksack and plopped it on the bed she went to the wardrobe for her coat scarf and gloves well take the train into london fi rst we can stay near earls court until i get the money to no rosalyn gareth randolphs not a killer he loved elena you could see that on his face he wouldnt have hurt her thats a pile of rubbish people kill each other all the time over love then they kill once again to cover up their tracks which is exactly what hes doing no matter what you think you saw on the island melinda glanced round the room as if to make sure shed forgotten nothing she said lets get going come on rosalyn didnt move i did it for you last night melinda i went to deastu not the police and now georginas dead because you went to deastu because you talked in the first place if youd kept your mouth shut nothing would have happened to anyone dont you see that im responsible for this both of us are melindas mouth drew into a hairs width line im responsible i tried to take care of you i wanted to protect you i tried to stop you from putting both of us at risk and now im responsible for georginas death well thats rich isnt it dont you see how it is i let you stop me i should have done what i knew was right in the first place i should always do that but i keep getting sidetracked whats that supposed to mean that it always comes down to a question of love with you if i really love you ill take the room under the eaves if i really love you well have sex when you want if i really love you ill tell my parents the truth about us and thats what all this is really about isnt it that you told your parents and they didnt approve they didnt fall all over themselves wishing you well they played it for guilt instead of compassion if i really love you ill always do what you want if i really love you ill have no mind of my own if i really love you ill live like a what finish it say it live like a what nothing forget it go on say it melinda sounded giddy live like a dyke a dyke a dyke because thats what you are and you just cant face it so you turn it around and shove it on me you think a mans going to be the answer to your problems you think a man can make you into something you arent youd better get wise ros youd better face the truth the problems yourself she shouldered her rucksack and threw the other to the floor at rosalyns feet choose she said i dont want to choose oh come on dont give me that melinda waited for a moment somewhere on the staircase a door opened quirky music swelled and a wavering whimsical voice claimed to be uncoupled melinda laughed sardonically how appropriate she said rosalyn reached towards her but she didnt pick up the rucksack melinda were born the way were born its a toss of the dice and no one can change it but dont you see i dont know that ive never even had a chance to fi nd out melinda nodded her face quickly becoming both shuttered and cool great so fi nd out just dont come snivelling back when you discover whats what she grabbed her shoulder bag and pulled on her gloves im out of here then lock up when you leave give your key to the porter all this just because i want to see the police rosalyn asked all this just because you dont want to see yourself my moneys on the pullover sergeant havers said she picked up the squat stainless steel teapot and poured grimacing at the pale colour of the brew with a what is this stuff anyway to the waitress who was passing their table herbal blend the girl said blackly havers stirred in a teaspoon of sugar grass cuttings more likely she took a tentative sip and scowled grass cuttings undoubtedly dont they have the regular bit pg tips something to wear the enamel off your teeth good and proper lynley poured his own cup this is better for you sergeant it has no caffeine it also has no flavour or dont we care about that just one of the drawbacks to the healthy life havers muttered and pulled out her cigarettes no smoking miss the waitress said as she brought their sweets to the table an arrangement of carobchip biscuits and sugarfree fruit tarts oh hell and damnation havers said they were in the bliss tea room in market hill a small establishment squeezed in between a stationery shop and what appeared to be a gathering place for the local skin heads heavy mettle had been scrawled by an obviously untutored hand in red greasepaint across the latter shops window and the earassaulting screech of electric guitars periodically blasted out the front door in apparent answer to the window decoration the stationers had countered with waitless cowardice across their own glass a joke that no doubt went unappreciated by the owners and patrons of the neighbouring business the bliss tea roomwith its plain pine tables and woven grass matshad been unoccupied by customers when lynley and havers entered and the combination of the music from next door and the health food on the menu was evidence enough that the little restaurant wasnt long for this world theyd made their phone call to cambridges forensic department from a call box on silver street rather than from the junior combination room where havers had started to direct him upon leaving georgina higginsharts bedsit he had stopped her saying i saw a call box on the street if weve got a match on the fibres id rather the news wasnt overheard and put into the universitys gossip mill before weve had a chance to decide what to do with it so they had left the college and headed towards trumpington where an old chipped call box stood near the corner with three of its front glass panels missing and a fourth taken up by a sticker featuring a drawing of a foetus in a rubbish bin and abortion is murder printed in crimson letters that dissolved into a garish pool of blood beneath them lynley had made the call because he knew it was the next logical step in the case but he wasnt surprised by the information which the cambridge forensic team relayed no match he said to havers as they returned to queens college where theyd left the car they havent finished with everything yet but so far nothing what remained to be tested were a coat a pullover a tshirt and two pairs of trousers sergeant havers was giving her attention to these she dipped her carobchip biscuit into her tea and took a bite before she spoke again resuming her theme it makes perfect sense the morning was cold hed have been wearing a pullover i think weve got him lynley had chosen the apple tart he took a bite it wasnt halfbad he said i cant agree not for the fibres were looking for sergeant rayon polyester and cotton make too light a blend for a pullover especially one worn in november to cut the mornings chill okay ill buy that so he wore something over it an overcoat a jacket he took that off before he killed her then he put it back on to hide the blood which he got all over himself when he beat in her face and then had it cleaned and ready in anticipation of our coming for it this morning sergeant because there were no stains on it and if he anticipated our coming to pick it up why would he just leave it with the rest of his clothes why wouldnt he get rid of it because he doesnt quite know how an investigation works i dont like it havers it doesnt feel right it leaves too much unaccounted for like what like what was sarah gordon doing at the crime scene that morning and prowling round ivy court that night like why did justine weaver run without the dog monday morning like whats the connection between elena weavers presence and performance in cambridge and her fathers attaining the penford chair havers took a second biscuit broke it in half and i thought you had your heart newly set on gareth randolph what happened to him then have you scratched him off the roster and if you doif you put sarah gordon or justine weaver or anyone besides thorsson by the way in his placewhats the story behind the second killing lynley set his fork down pushed the apple tart to one side i wish i knew the tea rooms door opened they both looked up a girl stood hesitantly just inside she was clearskinned with a mass of auburn hair swirling round her face like cirrus clouds at the last part of sunset youre she peered about as if to make sure that she was addressing the proper people youre the police arent you assured of this she came to their table my names catherine meadows may i speak with you she removed her navy beret her matching scarf and her gloves she kept on her coat she sat on the edge of a straightbacked chair not at their table but at the one next to them when the waitress approached the girl looked confused for a moment before glancing at the menu and ordering a single cup of mint tea and a toasted whole wheat cake ive been trying to find you since half past nine she said the porter at st stephens couldnt tell me where you were its only luck that i saw you come in here at all i was over at barclays ah lynley said catherine smiled fleetingly and worried the ends of her hair she kept her shoulder bag on her lap and her knees pressed together she said nothing else until the tea and the teacake were placed before her its lenny she said her eyes on the fl oor lynley saw havers slide her notebook onto the table top and soundlessly open it he said lenny thorsson ah yes i saw you waiting for him after the shakespeare lecture on tuesday i didnt know who you were then but he told me later that youd talked to him about elena weaver he said there was nothing for us to worry about at the time because she reached for the cup as if about to drink but then apparently changed her mind that doesnt matter does it you just need to know that he didnt have anything at all to do with elena and he certainly didnt kill her he couldnt have he was with me when exactly was he with you she looked at them earnestly her grey eyes growing dark she couldnt have been more than eighteen years old its so personal he could get in such trouble if you were to tell anyone you see im the only undergraduate lennys ever she rolled the corner of her paper napkin into a little tube and said with calm determination im the only one hes ever allowed himself to get close to and its been a struggle for him his morals his conscience what would be right for us what would be ethical because hes my supervisor youre lovers i take it you need to know that we went absolute weeks without doing a thing we fought it every time we were together right from the first we both felt the attraction it was like electricity lenny was so open and honest about it thats the way hes always fought it off in the past because hes attracted to women he does admit that and in the past hes simply talked it out hes let women know and theyve worked past ittheyve worked through ittogether and we tried that the two of us we really did try but in this case it was bigger than both of us is that what lenny said havers asked her face was a study of bland dispassionate interest catherine seemed to hear something in her tone however she said a bit archly it was my decision to make love with him lenny didnt push me i was ready and we talked about it for days he wanted me to know him completely inside and out before i made the decision he wanted me to understand to understand lynley asked him his life what it had been like for him when hed once been engaged he wanted me to see him as he truly is so that i could accept him all of him every bit so that i wouldnt ever be like his fi ancée she turned in her chair and faced them squarely she rejected him sexually she did that to him for all of four years because he wasoh it doesnt matter but you need to understand that he couldnt bear it to happen again he was nearly destroyed by the rejection and sorrow the fi rst time its taken him forever to get over the pain and to learn to trust a woman again did he ask you to speak to us lynley asked she cocked her pretty head to one side you dont believe me do you you think im making this up not at all im just wondering if and when he asked you to speak to us he didnt ask me to speak to you he wouldnt do that its just that he told me this morning that youd been to see him and taken some of his clothes and actually thought her voice wavered momentarily and she reached for the tea drinking this time she kept the cup balanced on her small white palm lenny had nothing to do with elena hes in love with me sergeant havers gave a delicate cough catherine looked at her sharply i can see what youre thinking that im just some simpleminded tart to him but thats not how it is were going to be married quite we are when ive graduated lynley said what time did mr thorsson leave you six fortyfi ve was this from your room at st stephens i dont live in college i share a house with three other girls off mill road towards ramsey town and not lynley thought towards crusoes island are you certain of the time i dont have a doubt havers tapped her pencil against a page of her notebook why there was a fair degree of pride in catherines answer because id looked at the clock when he first woke me up and i looked once again when we finished i wanted to see how long he lasted this time seventy minutes he finished at a real marathon performer havers nodded you must have felt like chopped meat havers lynley said quietly the girl got to her feet lenny said you wouldnt believe me he said you especially this with a finger pointed at haverswanted to make him pay pay for what i asked him youll see he said youll see when you talk to her she put on her beret and her scarf she squeezed her gloves into balls well i see i do hes a wonderful man hes tender hes loving and brilliant and hes been hurt so badly in his life because he cares too much he cared for elena weaver and she took it the wrong way and then when he wouldnt sleep with her she went to dr cuff with this despicable storyif you cant see the truth was he with you last night havers asked the girl drew up hesitated what did he spend the night with you again ino he had a lecture he was working on and a paper hes been writing her voice steadied grew stronger hes working on a study of shakespeares tragedies its a thesis about the tragic heroes victims of their time hes arguing conquered not by their own tragic flaws but by the prevailing social conditions its radical brilliant he was working on it last night and where havers asked for a moment the girl faltered again she gave no response where havers asked he was at home he told you he was home all night her hand closed more tightly round her crumpled gloves yes he wouldnt have left sometime perhaps to see someone to see someone who who would he want to see i was at a meeting i got home quite late he hadnt been by he hadnt phoned when i phoned he didnt answer but i merely assumedi was the only one hed be seeing the only one so her eyes dropped she fumbled with putting on her gloves i was the only one she swung to the door turned back once as if to say something to them turned away the door remained opened behind her when she left the wind whipped in quickly it was cold and damp havers took up her teacup and lifted it in a salute to the girls departure quite a chap our lenny hes not the killer lynley said no hes not at least not elenas penelope answered the door when lynley rang the bell in bulstrode gardens at half past seven that evening she was carrying the baby against her shoulder and although she was still garbed only in a dressing gown and slippers her hair had been washed and it fell round her shoulders in fine soft waves there was a scent of fresh powder in the air surrounding her she said tommy hello and led him into the sitting room where several large volumes were open on the sofa competing for space with a childsized colt a cowboy hat and a mound of clean laundry that seemed to consist mostly of pyjamas and nappies you got me interested in whistler and ruskin last evening penelope said in reference to the volumes which he saw were all art books the dispute between them is part of art history now but i hadnt thought about it in years what a fighter whistler was no matter what one thinks of his workand it was controversial enough at the timejust consider the peacock room in the leyland houseone simply cant help admiring him she went to the sofa and made a nest of the laundry into which she placed the baby who gurgled happily and kicked her feet in the air she unearthed one book from beneath the stack and said this actually has part of the trial transcript in it imagine taking on the most influential art critic of your time and suing him for libel i cant think of anyone whod have the gumption to do that to a critic today listen to his assessment of ruskin she picked up the book and ran her finger down the page here it is it is not only when criticism is inimical that i object to it but when it is incompetent i hold that none but an artist can be a competent critic she laughed lightly and brushed her hair back from her cheeks it was a gesture peculiarly like one of helens imagine saying that about john ruskin what an upstart whistler was was he speaking the truth i think what he said is true of all criticism tommy in the case of painting an artist bases his evaluation of a piece upon knowledge thats grown from both his education and his experience an art critic or any critic for that matter works from an historical frame of referencewhats been done beforeand from theoryhow it ought to be done now thats all well and good theory technique and being grounded in the basics but really it takes an artist to truly understand another artist and his work lynley joined her at the sofa where one of the books was open to nocturne in black and gold the falling rocket im not that familiar with his work he said other than the painting of his mother she grimaced to be remembered for such a dreary piece instead of for these but then thats not really fair of me is it his mother was a fine study in composition and colour or actually the lack of primary colour and lightbut the river pictures are splendid look at them they have a certain glory dont they what a challenge to paint the darkness to see substance in shadows or in fog lynley asked penelope looked up from the book fog sarah gordon lynley explained she was getting ready to paint in the fog when she found elena weavers body monday morning thats been part of a stumbling block for me when it comes to evaluating her role in what happened would you say that painting the fog is the same as painting the darkness id say its not much different butlike whistlerit would mean a new style yes but a change in style isnt uncommon among artists is it one merely has to consider picasso the blue period cubism he was always stretching as a challenge she pulled out another volume it was open to nocturne in blue and silver whistlers nighttime depiction of the river thames and battersea bridge challenge growth boredom a need for change a momentary idea that bursts into a longterm commitment artists alter their style for all sorts of reasons and whistler i think he saw art where other people saw nothing but thats the nature of the artist in the first place isnt it to see art where other people see nothing it was he realised with some surprise such a logical conclusion to draw from the facts one he himself should have been capable of drawing penelope was leafing through a few more pages a car drew up on the drive outside a door opened and closed she raised her head what happened to whistler lynley asked i cant recall if he won his case against ruskin her eyes were on the curtains which were closed they shifted in the direction of the front door as footsteps approached it crunching abrasively against the rough shards of gravel on the drive she said he won and he lost the jury awarded him a farthing for contemptuous damages but he had to pay the court costs and ended up going bankrupt and then he went off to venice for a bit painted nothing and tried to destroy himself with a vicious sort of wild life then he went back to london and continued to try to destroy himself there he didnt succeed he didnt she smiled instead he fell in love with a woman who also fell in love with him and that tends to obviate past injustices doesnt it one can hardly concentrate on destroying the self when the other becomes so much more important the front door opened there was a rustle of sound as of a coat being removed and hung upon the rack this was followed by a few more footsteps then harry rodger stopped short at the sitting room door he said tommy hullo id no idea you were in town but he remained where he was looking illatease in a rumpled suit and a stained red tie he clutched a worn athletic bag which was unzipped with the cuff of a white shirt protruding from it youre looking lively he said to his wife he ventured a few steps into the room dropped his eyes to the sofa regarded the books ah i see tommy was asking about whistler and ruskin last night was he rodger cast a cool look in lynleys direction yes she went eagerly on you know harry id forgotten how interesting the situation between them quite slowly penelope raised one hand as if to see to the state of her hair tiny lines etched their way from the corners of her mouth she said to lynley let me get helen for you she was reading to the twins she cant have heard you come in when she left them rodger went to stand before the sofa he played the tips of his fi ngers against the babys forehead like a restless benediction i think we should name you canvas he said running his index finger along the infants smooth cheek mummy would like that wouldnt she he looked at lynley his mouth curving with a sardonic smile lynley said people generally have interests outside the sphere of their families harry secondary interests with their families coming fi rst lifes not that convenient people dont always fit into the most accommodating mould pens a wife rodgers voice was smooth but it had a rocks smoothness hard and determined shes a mother as well she made that decision more than four years ago she chose to be the caregiver the backbone of the family not someone who leaves her baby in a pile of laundry while she leafs through her art books and dwells on the past it was a condemnation that lynley found particularly unfair considering the circumstances of penelopes renewed interest in art he said actually i set her off on this yesterday fine i understand but its over for her tommy that part of her life on whose determination i know what youre thinking youre wrong we both decided what was more important but she wont accept it now she doesnt want to adjust why does she have to the decisions not written in concrete is it why cant she have both her career her family there arent any winners in a situation like that everyone suffers instead of just pen rodgers face became chiselled in reaction to the affront his voice however remained perfectly reasonable ive seen this sort of thing among my colleagues tommy even if you havent wives go their own way and the family dissolves and even if that werent the caseeven if pen could juggle the roles of wife mother homemaker and art conservationist without driving us all mad which she cant by the way which is why she quit her job at the fitzwilliam when the twins were twoshe has everything she needs right here a husband a fair income a decent home three healthy children thats not always enough rodger laughed sharply you sound just like her shes lost her self she says shes just an extension of everyone else what absolute rubbish what shes lost is things what her parents provided her what we used to have when both of us worked things he dropped his athletic bag next to the sofa wearily rubbed the back of his neck ive spoken to her doctor give her time he says its that postpartum business shell be back to herself in a few more weeks well as far as im concerned it had better happen soon im just about at the end of my patience with her he nodded at the baby watch her for me will you ive got to get something to eat that said he left the room disappearing through the door that led into the kitchen the baby gurgled once again and clutched at the air she made a sound like uh puh and grinned with happy toothless pleasure at the ceiling lynley sat down next to her laundry nest and took hold of one of her hands it wasnt much larger than the pad of his thumb her nails teased his skinodd to think that hed never once considered the fact that babies have nailsand he felt a rush of tenderness towards her unprepared to feel anything more than bemusement when left alone with her he pulled over one of penelopes art books although the words were out of focus because he didnt want to bothercouldnt really botherwith his spectacles he plunged himself wholeheartedly into distraction with an account of james mcneill whistlers earliest days in paris and the typically stuffy academic revelation of his relationship with his fi rst mistress who was both introduced and dismissed from whistlers life within the confines of a single gerund phrase he began by assuming a life style he deemed appropriate to a bohemian and by going so far as to attract a young millinernicknamed la tigresse with the joyful hyperbolic propensity of the periodto live with and pose for him for a period of time lynley read on but there was nothing more of the milliner to the academic who had written the volume she merited one sentence in an account of whistlers life no matter what she may have been to him no matter the way in which she may have infl uenced or inspired his work lynley reflected on the veiled implication behind that simple group of words nonentity they declared someone he painted and took to his bed she was consigned to history as whistlers mistress if shed ever had a self it was long forgotten he got up restlessly walked across the room to the fireplace with its display of photographs lined up on the mantel they depicted penelope with harry penelope with the children penelope with her parents penelope with her sisters but there was not a single picture of penelope alone tommy he turned to see that helen had come into the room she stood near the door dressed in brown wool and ivory silk with a trim camel jacket slung over her arm penelope was just behind her he wanted to say to them both i think i understand now in this moment i think i finally understand but instead feeling the depth and breadth of his own inadequacy defined and conditioned by the fact that he was male he said harrys getting himself something to eat thanks for your help pen her acknowledgement of this was tentative and brief a movement of her lips that might have passed for a smile a quick bob of the head then she walked to the sofa and began closing her books she stacked them on the floor and picked up the baby shes due to be fed penelope said i cant think why she hasnt begun to fuss she wandered from the room they heard her climbing the stairs they didnt say anything until they were in the car driving the short distance to trinity hall where the jazz concert was scheduled to be performed in the junior combination room and then it was lady helen who broke the silence between them she actually came to life tommy i cant tell you what a relief its been yes i know i could see the difference all day she was involved in something beyond the scope of that house its what she needs she knows it they both do they must have you talked to her about it how can i leave them she asks me theyre my children helen what kind of mother am i if i want to leave them lynley glanced at her her face was averted you cant solve this problem for her you know i dont see how i can leave her if i dont the determination behind her words plunged his spirits he said youre planning to stay on here arent you ill phone daphne tomorrow she can put off her visit for another week god knows shed be happy enough to do so she has a family of her own without a thought he said helen damn it all i wish you would and then he stopped himself he felt her turn in her seat knew she was watching him he said nothing more youve been good for pen she said i think youve made her face something she didnt want to see he took no pleasure from the information im glad im good for someone he parked the bentley in a narrow space on garret hostel lane a few yards away from the gentle rise of the footbridge that crossed the river cam they walked back towards the porters lodge of the college just down the street from the entrance to st stephens the air was cold it seemed hung with moisture a heavy cover of clouds obscured the night sky their footsteps echoed against the pavement a brisk sound like the sharp tattoo of drums lynley glanced at lady helen she was walking near enough at his side that her shoulder brushed his and the warmth of her arm the fresh crisp scent of her body acted in concert as a call to action which he tried to ignore he told himself that there was more to life than the immediate gratification of his own desires and he tried to believe this even as he felt himself grow lost in the simple contemplation of contrast offered by the dark fall of her hair as it swung forward to touch the pearl of her skin he said as if there had been no break in their conversation but am i good for you helen thats the real question isnt it and although he managed to keep his voice light his heart still beat rapidly at the back of his throat i wonder that i put the sum of what i am into a balance and weigh it against what i ought to be and i ask myself if im really enough when she turned her head the amber light shafting down from a window above them surrounded her like an aureole why would you ever think youre not enough he pondered the question tracing his thoughts and his feelings right back to their source he found that both of them grew from her decision to remain with her sisters family in cambridge he wanted her back in london available to him if he was good enough for her shed return at his request if she valued his love shed bow to his wishes he wanted her to do so he wanted an overt manifestation of the love she claimed to feel for him and he wanted to be the one to decide exactly what that manifestation would be but he couldnt tell her this so he settled on saying i think im struggling with a defi nition of love she smiled and slipped her hand through his arm you and everyone else tommy darling they rounded the corner into trinity lane and entered the college grounds where a blackboard sign had been decorated with the words jazz up your life tooonite in coloured chalk and construction paper arrows affi xed to the pavement led the way through the main college court to the junior combination room in the northeast corner of the grounds similar to st stephens college the building that housed trinity halls jcr was modern little more than alternating panels of wood and glass in addition to the combination room it contained the college bar where a considerable crowd was gathered at small round tables engaged in boisterous conversation that seemed to be revolving round the goodhumoured harassment of two men who were playing darts with rather more intensity than usually accompanied the game the apparent reason for their avid concentration seemed to be age one player was a youth of no more than twenty the other an older man with a closecropped grey beard go for it petersen someone shouted when the younger man took position for his turn junior fellows kick arse show him the young man made an elaborate display of loosening up his muscles and assuming the correct stance before he flung the dart and missed the shot entirely jeers roared through the room in response he turned around pointed to his backside meaningfully and hefted a pint of beer to his mouth the crowd hooted and laughed lynley guided lady helen through the jostling group to the bar and from there they made their way towards the jcr beers in hand the jcr was built on several different levels accommodating a line of immovable sofas and a number of uninteresting chairs with lazy slung backs at one end of the room the floor rose to what was being used as a small staging area where the jazz group was getting ready to perform there were only six of them so they didnt need room for anything more than the space required to set up a keyboard and drums three straightback chairs for the saxophone the trumpet and the clarinet players and a roughly defined triangular area for the double bass electrical extension cords from the keyboard seemed to snake everywhere and when she turned and saw lynley and lady helen miranda webberly tripped over one in her haste to say hello regaining her footing with a grin she dashed over to greet them you came she said this is absolutely grand inspector will you promise to tell dad im a musical genius im after another trip to new orleans but hes only likely to cooperate if he thinks ive a future playing the changes on bourbon street ill tell him you play like an angel no like chet baker please she greeted lady helen and went on confidentially jimmyhes our drummerwanted to cancel tonights gig hes at queens you know and he thought with that second girl getting shot this morning she looked over her shoulder to where the drummer was moodily tapping his sticks in a light spitting rhythm against the cymbals we shouldnt be out entertaining he says its not right is it it doesnt feel right but he cant come up with an alternative for us paulhe plays double basswanted to bash local heads in some arbury pub but all in all it seemed best that we just go ahead and play i dont know what itll sound like though no one seems very much in the mood she glanced anxiously round the room as if in the need for some sort of contradiction to reassure her a respectable crowd had begun to gather apparently drawn by the rapid scales and chords which the keyboard player was using to warm up lynley took the opportunity before the concert began to say randie did you know elena weaver was pregnant miranda shifted on her feet rubbing the right sole of her hightopped black gym shoe against her left ankle rather she said hows that i mean i suspected she never told me theyd trodden this ground together before you mean you didnt know it for a fact i didnt know it for a fact but you suspected why miranda sucked at the inside of her lower lip it was the cocoa puffs in the gyp room inspector they were hers the same carton itd been there for weeks im not sure i understand her breakfast lady helen said miranda nodded shed left off eating in the morning and three timesperhaps fourid gone to the loo and shed been in there being sick once i found her at it and the other times miranda twisted a button on her navy cardigan she wore a navy tshirt beneath it its just that i could smell it she belonged on the force lynley thought she was a natural observer she didnt miss a trick she said in a rush i would have said something to you monday night only i didnt know for sure and other than being sick those mornings she didnt act any different what do you mean i mean she wasnt acting like she had anything in particular to worry about so i thought perhaps i might have been wrong perhaps she wasnt worried an outofwedlock pregnancy isnt the sort of disaster it might have been thirty years ago maybe not in your family miranda smiled but i cant exactly see my dad greeting that kind of news like it was an announcement of the second coming and i never got the impression her dad was any different randie come on lets do it the saxophone player called from across the room right she said she gave lynley and lady helen a lighthearted salute im taking a ride during the second number listen for it taking a ride lady helen said as randie scampered back to join the rest of the jazz combo what on earth does she mean tommy it must be jazzspeak lynley said im afraid wed need louis armstrong here to translate the concert began with a roll of drums and the keyboard player calling out pound the valves down randie one and two and three and randie the saxophonist and the clarinet player lifted their instruments lynley glanced down at the sheet of paper that served as programme for the concert and read the name of the number circadian dysrhythmia it featured the keyboard player who huddled over his instrument with effort and concentration carried the lively melody for the first few minutes before tossing it over to the clarinet player who surged to his feet and took it from there the drummer provided a steady tiptapping on the cymbals in the background as he did so his narrowed eyes flitted round the room to take in the crowd by the middle of the number more listeners had joined the group in the jcr wandering in from the bar with drinks in hand and coming in directly from the college grounds where the music no doubt drifted into the surrounding buildings heads bobbed in the sort of secondnature response that is generally the listeners reaction to good jazz while handsrapped against the arms of chairs the tops of thighs and the sides of beer glasses by the end of the number the audience was won and when the song endedwith no prior warning or winding down of the musicians enthusiasm but just upon a single note that was cut off into silencethe moment of stunned surprise that followed was broken by long and enthusiastic applause the band didnt acknowledge this approbation with anything more than a nod from the keyboard player before the applause died down the saxophone was twirling through the familiar sultry melody of take five after one complete turn through the number he began to improvise the double bass player kept up with him through the repetition of three notes and the drummer maintained the beat but otherwise the saxophone was on his own and he gave it his hearteyes closed his body swayed back his instrument lifted it was the sort of music one felt in the solar plexus hollow and haunting as he completed his improvisation the saxophone player nodded at randie who stood and began hers on the last note of his again the double bass played the same three notes again the drums maintained the same steady beat but the sound of the trumpet changed the mood of the piece it became pure and uplifting a joyous celebration of brassy sound like the saxophone player miranda performed with her eyes closed and she tapped her right foot in time with the drummer but unlike the saxophonist when her solo was completed and the improvisation thrown to the clarinet she grinned with unrestrained pleasure at the applause that greeted the ride she had taken their third number just a child changed the mood once again it featured the clarinet playeran overweight redhead whose face shone with perspirationand it provided a dusky sound that spoke of rainy evenings and fusty nightclubs a fog of cigarette smoke and glasses of gin it invited slow dancing lazy kissing and sleep the crowd loved it as they did the fourth a piece called black nightgown which featured the clarinet and saxophone it also ended the fi rst set there was a general cry of protest when the keyboard player announced were breaking for fifteen but since it was an opportunity to replenish drinks most of the audience began to shuffle towards the bar lynley joined them the two darts players were still at it he saw their concentration and dedication having gone unimpaired by the performance in the next room the younger man had apparently hit his stride for the score on the blackboard showed that he had drawn nearly even with his bearded competitor last toss this the younger player announced displaying the dart with the fl are of a magician about to make an elephant disappear over the shoulder and ill have a bullseye and a win who wants money on it oh too right somebody laughed just throw the dart petersen someone else called put an end to your misery petersen clucked in mock dismay oh you of intolerably little faith he said he turned his back to the dart board threw over his shoulder and looked as surprised as everyone else when the dart flew like a magnet drawn to metal and lodged in the bullseye the crowd sent up a satisfied roar petersen jumped on top of one of the tables im taking all comers he shouted step up try your luck senior members only collins here just got bashed and im looking for fresh blood he squinted through the cigarette smoke and the bodies you dr troughton i see you hulking in the corner step up and defend the scr lynley followed the direction of the boys gaze to a table at the far end of the room where another senior member of the college sat in conversation with two younger men drop the history drivel petersen went on save it for supervisions come on have a go troughton the man looked up he waved off the call the crowd urged him on he ignored them blast it troughtsie come on be a man petersen laughed someone else called lets do it trout and suddenly lynley heard nothing more just the name itself and all its variations troughton troughtsie trout it was the eternal predeliction of students for giving their instructors some sort of affectionate appellation hed done it himself first at eton then at oxford and now for the first time he wondered if elena weaver had done the same what is it tommy lady helen asked when she came at his beckoning from the doorway to the jcr a premature ending to the concert for us at least come with me she followed him back to the bar where the crush of people was beginning to thin as the jazz audience wandered once again in the direction of the music the man called troughton was still sitting at the corner table but one of his companions had left and the other was getting ready to do the same donning a green anorak and a black and white scarf troughton himself stood and cupped his hand round his ear to hear something that the younger man was saying and after a moment of further conversation he too put on a jacket and started across the room to the door as he approached lynley eyed the older man taking his measure as the potential lover of a twentyyearold girl although troughton had a youthful pixielike face he was otherwise perfectly nondescript an ordinary man no more than five feet eight inches tall whose toastcoloured hair looked soft and was curly but was also decidedly thinning on the top he appeared to be somewhere in his late forties and aside from the width of his shoulders and the depth of his chestboth of which suggested that he was a rowerlynley had to admit that he didnt look at all the type of man to have attracted and seduced someone like elena weaver as the other man began to pass by them on his way to the door lynley said dr troughton troughton paused looked surprised to have a stranger addressing him by name yes thomas lynley he said and introduced lady helen he reached into his pocket and produced his police identifi cation may we go somewhere to talk troughton didnt appear the least bewildered by the request instead he looked both resigned and relieved yes this way he said and led them out into the night he took them to his rooms in the building that comprised the north range of the college garden two courtyards away from the jcr on the second floor situated in the southwest corner they overlooked the river cam on one side and the garden on the other they consisted of a small bedroom and a study the former furnished only with an unmade single bed and the latter crowded with ancient overstuffed furniture and a vast and undisciplined number of books these lent to the room the sort of mouldy mustiness associated with paper too long exposed to air that is heavy with damp troughton picked up a sheaf of essays from one of the chairs and put it on his desk he said may i offer you a brandy and when lynley and lady helen accepted he went to a glassfronted cabinet to one side of the fi replace where he took out three plain balloon glasses and carefully held each one up to the light before pouring he didnt say anything until he had taken a seat in one of the heavy overstuffed chairs youve come about elena weaver havent you he spoke quietly calmly i suppose ive been expecting you since yesterday afternoon did justine give you my name no elena herself did after a fashion shed been making a curious mark on her calendar ever since last january lynley said a small line drawing of a fi sh yes i see troughton gave his attention to his balloon glass his eyes fi lled and he pressed his fingers to them before he raised his head of course she didnt call me that he said unnecessarily she called me victor but it was her shorthand method of noting when youd meet i should guess and no doubt a way to keep the knowledge from her father should he ever happen to glance at her calendar on a visit to her room because i imagine you know her father quite well troughton nodded he took a swallow of his brandy setting the balloon glass on the low table that separated his chair from lady helens he patted the breast pocket of his grey tweed jacket and brought out a cigarette case it was made of pewter dented in one corner it bore some sort of crest upon its cover he offered it round and then lit up the match flickering in his fingers like an uneasy beacon he had large hands lynley noted stronglooking with smooth oval nails they were his best feature troughton kept his eyes on his cigarette as he said the hardest part these last three days has been the pretence of it all coming to the college seeing to my supervisions taking my meals with the others having a glass of sherry before dinner last night with the master and making small talk while all the time i wanted to throw my head back and howl when his voice wavered slightly on the last word lady helen leaned forward in her chair as if she would offer him sympathy but she stopped herself when lynley lifted his hand in quick admonition troughton steadied himself by drawing in on his cigarette and placing it into a pottery ashtray on the table next to him where its smoke rose in a snaking plume then he went on but what right have i to any one of the externals of grief i have duties after all i have responsibilities a wife three children im supposed to think of them i ought to be engaged in picking up the pieces and going on and being thankful that my marriage and my career didnt come crashing down round me because ive spent the last eleven months screwing a deaf girl twentyseven years my junior in fact inside my ugly little soul where no one would ever know the feeling is even there i ought to be secretly thankful elenas out of the way because therell be no mess now no scandal no titters and whispers behind my back its completely over and im to go on thats what men my age do isnt it when theyve puffed themselves up with a successful seduction that over time grows just a little bit tedious and it was supposed to grow tedious wasnt it inspector i was supposed to start finding her a sexual millstone living evidence of an egoboosting peccadillo that promised to come back to haunt me if i didnt take care of her in one way or another it wasnt like that for you i love her i cant even say loved because if i put it in the past tense im going to have to face the fact that shes gone and i cant stand the thought of it she was pregnant did you know that troughton closed his eyes the weak overhead light which shone down from a coneshaped shade cast shadows from his eyelashes onto his skin it glittered beneath the lashes on the crescent of tears which he appeared to be willing himself not to shed he pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket when he could he said i knew i should think that offered the possibility of serious difficulties for you dr troughton no matter how you felt about the girl the scandal you mean the loss of lifelong friendships the damage to my career none of that mattered oh i knew i was likely to be ostracised by virtually everyone if i walked out on my family for a twentyyearold girl but the more i thought about it the more i came to realise that i simply didnt care the sorts of things that matter to my colleagues inspectorprestigious appointments the building of a political base a stellar academic reputation invitations to speak at conferences and to chair committees requests to serve the college the university even the nationthose things ceased mattering to me a long time ago when i reached the conclusion that connection to another person is the only item of real value in life and i felt id found that connection with elena i wasnt about to give her up i would have done anything to keep her elena the saying of her name seemed a necessity to troughton a subtle form of release that he had not allowed himselfthat the circumstances of their relationship had not allowed himsince her death but still he didnt cry as if he believed that to give in to sorrow was to lose control over the few aspects of his life that remained unshattered by the girls murder as if she knew this lady helen went to the cabinet by the fireplace and found the bottle of brandy she poured a bit more into troughtons glass her own face lynley saw was grave and composed when did you see elena last lynley asked the other man sunday night here but she didnt spend the night did she the porter saw her leaving st stephens to go running in the morning she left meit must have been just before one before the gates close here and you did you go home as well i stayed i do that most weeknights and have done for some two years now i see your home isnt in the city then its in trumpington troughton appeared to read the expression on lynleys face adding yes i know inspector trumpingtons hardly such a distance from the college to warrant having to spend the night here especially having to spend most weeknights over a twoyear period obviously my reasons for dossing here had to do with a distance of a very different sort initially that is before elena troughtons cigarette had burnt itself to nothing in the ashtray by his chair he lit another and took more of the brandy he appeared to have himself once more under control when did she tell you she was pregnant wednesday night not long after shed got the results of the test but prior to that shed told you there was a possibility shed told you she suspected she hadnt said anything to me about pregnancy before wednesday i had no suspicion did you know she wasnt taking precautions it wasnt something i felt we had to discuss out of the corner of his eye lynley saw lady helen stir turning to face troughton saying but surely dr troughton a man of your education wouldnt have left the sole responsibility of contraception to the woman with whom you intended to sleep you would have discussed it with her before you took her to bed i didnt see the need the need lady helen said the two words slowly lynley thought of the unused birth control pills which sergeant havers had found in elena weavers desk drawer he recalled februarys date upon them and the conjectures he and havers had developed regarding that date he asked dr troughton did you assume she was using a contraceptive of some sort did she tell you she was as entrapment you mean no she never said a word about contraception one way or another and she didnt need to inspector it wouldnt have made any difference to me if she had he picked up his brandy glass and turned it on his palm it seemed a largely meditative gesture lynley watched the play of uncertainty on his face he felt irritated at the delicacy with which the circumstances suggested he probe for the truth he said i have the distinct impression that were caught between talking at cross purposes and engaging in outright prevarication perhaps youd care to tell me what youre holding back in the silence the distant sound of the jazz concert beat rhythmically against the windows in the room the high wild notes of the trumpet improvising as randie took another ride with the band and then the drummer soloed and then the melody resumed when it did so victor troughton raised his head as if the music beckoned him to do so he said i was going to marry elena frankly i welcomed the opportunity to do so but her baby wasnt mine wasnt she didnt know that she thought i was the father and i let her believe it but i wasnt im afraid you sound certain of that i am inspector troughton offered a smile of infinite sadness i had a vasectomy nearly three years ago elena didnt know and i didnt tell her ive never told anyone just outside the building in which victor troughton had his study and bedroom a terrace overlooked the river cam it rose from the garden partially hidden by a brick wall and it held several planters of verduous shrubs and a few benches on whichduring fine weathermembers of the college could take the sun and listen to the laughter of those who tried their luck punting down the river towards the bridge of sighs it was to this terrace that lynley directed lady helen although he recognised his need to lay before her each singular realisation that the circumstances of the evening had forced upon him he said nothing at the moment instead he tried to give defi nition to what those realisations were causing him to feel the wind of the previous two days had subsided considerably all that remained of it was an occasional brief weak gust of cold that puffed across the backs as if the night were sighing but even those brief gusts would eventually dissipate and the heaviness of the chill air suggested that fog would replace them tomorrow it was just after ten the jazz concert had ended moments before they left victor troughton and the voices of students calling to one another still rose and fell in the college grounds as the crowd dispersed no one came in their direction however and considering both the hour and the temperature lynley knew it was unlikely that anyone would join or disturb them on the secluded river terrace they chose a bench at the south end of the terrace where a wall that separated the fellows garden from the rest of the grounds also afforded them protection from what remained of the wind lynley sat pulling lady helen down next to him drawing her into the curve of his arm he pressed his lips to the side of her head in what was more a need of physical contact than an expression of affection and in response her body seemed to yield to his creating a gentle constant pressure against him she didnt speak but he had little doubt as to where her thoughts lay victor troughton had seemed to recognise an opportunity to speak for the first time about what had been his most closely guarded secret and like most people whove lived a lie when the opportunity presented itself to reveal reality he was more than willing to do so but as he began to tell his story lynley had seen lady helens initial sympathy towards troughtonso characteristic of her reallytransform slowly her posture changed drawing her fractionally away from the man her eyes grew cloudy and despite the fact that he was in the midst of an interview crucial to a murder investigation lynley found himself watching lady helen as much as he was listening to troughtons story he wanted to excuse himself to herto excuse all menfor the sins against women which troughton was listing without an apparent twinge of conscience the historian had lit a third cigarette from the smouldering butt of his second he had taken more brandy and as he spoke he kept his eyes fixed on the liquor in the glass and on the small swimming oval of yellowgold that was the reflection in the brandy of the light that hung above him he never spoke in anything other than a low frank voice i wanted a life thats really the only excuse i have and i know it isnt much of one i was willing to stay in my marriage for my childrens sake i was willing to be a hypocrite and keep up the pretence of happiness but i wasnt willing to live like a priest i did that for two years dead for two years i wanted a life again when did you meet elena lynley asked him troughton waved the question off he seemed determined to tell the story in his own way in his own time he said the vasectomy had nothing to do with elena id merely made a decision about my lifestyle these are the days of sexual profligacy after all so i decided to make myself available to women but i didnt want to run the risk of an unwanted pregnancyor the risk of some scheming females entrapmentso i had myself fixed up and i went on the prowl he lifted his glass and smiled sardonically it was i must admit a rather rude awakening i was just short of fortyfive years old in fairly good condition in a somewhat admirable and egomassaging career as a relatively wellknown and wellrespected academic i had expectations of scores of women being more than willing to accept my attentions just for the sheer intellectual thrill of knowing theyd been to bed with a cambridge don i take it you found that wasnt the case not among the women i was pursuing troughton looked long at lady helen as if he were evaluating the opposing forces at battle within him the wisdom of saying nothing more versus the overwhelming need to say it all at last he gave in to need turning back to lynley i wanted a young woman inspector i wanted to feel young resilient flesh i wanted to kiss breasts that were full and firm i wanted unveined legs and feet without callosity and hands like silk and what about your wife lady helen asked her voice was quiet her legs were crossed her hands were folded and relaxed in her lap but lynley knew her well enough to imagine how her heart had begun to pound angrilyas any womans wouldwhen troughton calmly and rationally offered his list of sexual requirements not a mind not a soul just a body that was young troughton was not reluctant to answer her three children he replied three boys each time rowena let herself go a little more first it was her clothes and her hair then her skin then her body what you mean to say is that a middleaged woman who has borne three children no longer excited you i admit to the worst of it troughton replied i felt an aversion when i looked at what was left of her stomach i was mildly disgusted over the size of her hips and i hated the drooping sacks that her breasts had become and the loose flesh hanging beneath her arms but most of all i hated the fact that she didnt intend to do a thing about herself and that she was perfectly happy when i began to leave her alone he got up and walked across the room to the window that overlooked the college garden he pulled back the curtain and studied the outdoors sipping his brandy so i made my plans i had the vasectomy to protect myself from any unexpected diffi culties and i began to go my own way the only problem was that i found i really didnt have the rightwhat do they call it the right moves the technique he chuckled derisively id actually thought it would be easy id be joining the sexual revolution two decades too late but id be joining it nonetheless a middleaged pioneer what a nasty surprise it all was for me and then elena weaver came along lynley asked troughton stayed by the window backdropped by the black glass of night ive known her father for years so id met her before on one visit or another when she was up from london but it wasnt until he brought her to my house last autumn to choose a puppy that i really thought of her as anything other than anthonys little deaf girl and even then it was just admiration on my part she was lively goodhumoured a mass of energy and enthusiasm she got on well in life in spite of being deaf and i found thatalong with everything else about herimmensely attractive but anthonys a colleague and even if a score of young women hadnt already given me sufficient evidence of my undesirability i wouldnt have had the nerve to approach a colleagues daughter she approached you troughton made a gesture that encompassed the room she dropped by here several times during michaelmas term last year shed tell me about how the dog was doing and chat in that oddvoiced way of hers shed drink tea pinch a few cigarettes when she thought i wasnt looking i enjoyed her visits i began to look forward to them but nothing happened between us until christmas and then troughton returned to his chair he crushed out his cigarette but did not light another he said she came to show me the gown shed bought for one of the christmas balls she said ill try it on for you shall i and she turned her back and began to undress right here in the room of course im not entirely a fool i realised later that shed done it deliberately but at the time i was horrified not only at her behaviour but at what i feltno what i knew in an instant that i wanted to doin the face of her behaviour she was down to her underthings when i said for gods sake what do you think youre doing girl but i was across the room and her head was turned so she couldnt read my lips she just kept undressing i went to her made her face me and repeated the question she looked me straight in the eye and said im doing what you want me to do vittor and that was that we made love in the very chair youre sitting in inspector i was so desperate to have her that i didnt even bother to lock the door he drank the rest of his brandy set the balloon glass on the table elena knew what i was after ive no doubt shed known the moment her father brought her to my house to see those dogs if she was nothing else she was brilliant at reading people or at least she was brilliant at reading me she always knew what i wanted and when i wanted it and just exactly how so youd found that resilient fl esh youd been seeking lady helen said cool condemnation comprised the undercurrent of the statement troughton didnt avoid admitting the worst i found it yes but not the way i thought i didnt count on falling in love i thought it would just be sex between us good vigorous sex anytime we felt the urge we were after all serving each others needs in what way she was accommodating my need to savour her youth and perhaps recapture a bit of my own i was accommodating her need to hurt her father he poured himself more brandy and added to the other glasses as well he looked from lynley to lady helen as if gauging on their faces a response to his final statement he went on with as i said inspector im not a complete fool perhaps youre judging yourself too harshly troughton placed the bottle on the table next to his chair and drank deeply of the brandy saying not at all look at the facts im fortyseven years old and on the downhill plunge she was twenty surrounded by hundreds of young men with their entire lives ahead of them why on earth would she decide to set her sights on me unless she knew it was the perfect way to strike out at her father and it was perfect after all to choose one of his colleaguesindeed to choose one of his friends to choose a man who was even older than her father to choose a man who was married to choose a man with children i couldnt actually delude myself with the idea that elena wanted me because she found me more attractive than any other man she knew and i never did so i knew from the fi rst what she had in mind the scandal we were speaking of earlier anthony always had too much of himself tied into elenas performance here in cambridge he involved himself in every aspect of her life how she acted and dressed how she took notes in her lectures how she comported herself in her supervisions these were weighty matters to him i think he believed that he would be judgedas a man a parent an academic evendependent upon her success or failure here was the penford chair tied into all this in his mind i should think so in reality no but if he thought judgement of himself was going to be connected to elenas performance and behaviour then he would want to see to it that she performed and behaved as the daughter of a respected professor should elena knew that she could sense that attitude in everything her father did and she resented him for it so you can imagine the vast andto elena amusing possibilities for his humiliation and her revenge when it became known that his daughter was having it off on a regular basis with one of his close colleagues didnt you mind being used in this way i was living every fantasy id ever entertained about making love to a woman and having a woman make love to me we met at least three times a week from christmas on and i loved every moment of it i didnt care about her motives in the least as long as she kept coming round to see me and taking off her clothes you met here then generally i managed to get to london several times during the summer break to see her as well and on a few weekend afternoons and evenings at her fathers house during term when he was home only once during a party she found that particularly exciting he shrugged although his cheeks had begun to flush i found it rather exciting as well i suppose it was the sheer terror of thinking we might be caught going at it but you werent never justine knewshed found out somehow she may well have guessed or elena may have told herbut she never actually caught us in the act she never told her husband she wouldnt have wanted to bear that sort of witness against elena inspector as far as anthony was concerned it would have been a case of kill the messenger and justine knew that better than anyone so she held her tongue i imagine she was waiting for anthony to find things out on his own which he never did which he never did troughton shifted his position in his chair crossing one leg over the other and pulling out his cigarette case once again he merely played it from hand to hand however he didnt open it of course he would have been told eventually by you no i imagine elena would have wanted that pleasure lynley found it hard to believe that troughton had no conscience in the matter of elena he had obviously felt no need to guide her he had seen no necessity for urging her to deal with her resentment towards her father in another way but dr troughton what i dont understand is why i went along with the game troughton set the cigarette case next to the balloon glass he studied the picture they made side by side because i loved her at first it was her bodythe incredible sensation of holding and touching that beautiful body but then it was her elena she was wild and ungovernable laughing and alive and i wanted that in my life i didnt care about the cost even if it meant posing as the father of her child even that inspector once she told me she was pregnant i nearly convinced myself that the vasectomy had gone wrong all those years ago and that the child was really mine have you any idea who the father was no but ive spent hours since last wednesday wondering about it where have your thoughts led you to the same conclusion again and again if she slept with me to have revenge on her father whomever else she slept with it was for the same reason it didnt have anything to do with love yet you were willing to take up a life with her in spite of knowing all this pathetic isnt it i wanted passion again i wanted to feel alive i told myself that i would be good for her i thought that with me she would be able to let go of her grievances against anthony eventually i believed id be enough for her id be able to heal her it was an adolescent little fantasy that i clung to till the end lady helen placed her balloon glass on the table next to troughtons she kept her fi ngers carefully on its rim she said and what about your wife i hadnt told her about elena yet thats not what i meant i know he said you meant what about the fact that rowena bore my children and did my laundry and cooked my meals and cleaned my house what about those seventeen years of loyalty and devotion what about my commitment to her not to mention my responsibilities to the university to my students to my colleagues what about my ethics and my morals and my values and my conscience thats what you meant isnt it i suppose it is he looked away from them eyes focussed on nothing some kinds of marriages wear at a person until the only thing left is a body thats simply going through the motions i wonder if thats your wifes conclusion as well rowena wants out of this marriage as much as i do she just doesnt know it yet now in the darkness on the terrace lynley felt burdened not only by troughtons assessment of his marriage but also by the mixture of revulsion and indifference he had expressed towards his wife more than anything he wished helen had not been with him to hear the story of his attachment to elena weaver and his maddeningly levelheaded rationale for that attachment for as the historian had calmly outlined his reasons for turning away from his wife and seeking the company and the love of a woman young enough to be his daughter lynley believed he had fi nally come to understand at least part of what lay at the root of helens refusal to marry him the understanding had been an uneasiness churning within himasking to be noticed since the start of the evening in bulstrode gardens it had demanded some sort of spoken release in the musty confines of victor troughtons study what we ask of them he thought what we expect what we demand but never what we will give in return never what they want and never a moments thorough consideration of the burdens which our desires and requirements place upon them he looked up at the vast grey darkness of the cloudheavy sky a distant light winked in it what are you seeing lady helen asked him a shooting star i think close your eyes helen quickly make a wish he did so himself she laughed at him quietly youre wishing on a plane tommy its heading for heathrow he opened his eyes saw that she was right ive no viable future in astronomy im afraid i dont believe that you used to point out all the constellations to me in cornwall dont you remember it was all show helen darling i was trying to impress you were you well i was suitably impressed he turned to look at her he reached for her hand in spite of the cold she wasnt wearing gloves and he pressed her cool fi ngers against his cheek he kissed her palm i sat there and listened and realised that he may as well have been me he said because it all boils down to what men want helen and what we want is women but not as individuals not as living breathing vulnerable human beings with a set of desires and dreams of their own we want themyouas extensions of ourselves and im among the worst her hand moved in his but she didnt withdraw it rather her fingers entwined with his and as i listened to him helen i thought of all the ways ive wanted you as my lover as my wife as the mother of my children in my bed in my car in my home entertaining my friends listening to me talk about my work sitting next to me quietly when i dont feel like speaking waiting up for me when im out on a case opening your heart to me making yourself mine and those are the operative words i kept hearing i me my mine he looked across the backs to the smudgy forms of english oaks and common alders that were little more than shadows against a charcoal sky when he turned back to her her expression was grave but her eyes were still on him they were dark and kind theres no sin in that tommy youre right he replied theres only self in it what i want when i want it and youre meant to cooperate because youre a woman thats how ive been isnt it no better than your brotherinlaw no better than troughton no she said youre not like them ive not seen you that way ive wanted you helen and the hell of it is that i want you right now as much as i ever have i sat there and listened to troughton and had my own eyes opened in a thousand different ways about what goes wrong between men and women and it all comes down to the same damned fact with absolutely no change in it i love you i want you if you had me once could you let it all go could you let me go his answering laugh was mordant and painful he looked away i wish it were as simple as taking you to bed but you know it isnt you know i but could you tommy could you let me go he turned back to her slowly recognising something in her voice an urgency a plea an inherent call for a degree of understanding hed never been able to establish with her it seemed to him as he studied her faceand saw the thin line of worry between her brows that the attainment of every dream hed ever harboured depended upon his ability to know what she meant he looked at her hand still held in his own so fragile he could feel the bones of her fi ngers so smooth that he could easily conceive of its tender passage against his skin how do i answer that he said at last i feel youve placed my whole future on the line i dont mean to do that but youve done it havent you i suppose i have in a way he released her hand and walked to the low brick wall that edged the river terrace below the cam glinted in the darkness greenblack ink drifting lazily towards the ouse it was an inexorable progressthis movement of waterslow and sure and as unstoppable as time my longings are the same as every other mans he said i want a home a wife i want children a son i want to know at the end that my life hasnt been for nothing and the only way i can know that for a certainty is to leave something behind and to have someone to leave it to all i can say right now is that i finally understand what kind of burden that places on a woman helen i understand that no matter how the load is shifted between partners or divided or shared the womans burden will always be greater i do know that but i cant lie to you about the reality that remains i still want those things you can have them with anyone i want them with you you dont need them with me need he tried to read the expression on her face but she was just a pale blur in the darkness beneath the tree that threw a cavernous shadow over the terrace bench he pondered the oddity of the word she had chosen reflecting on her decision to remain with her sister in cambridge he considered the canvas of the fourteen years he had known lady helen and finally the realisation struck him he sank onto the concrete ledge that comprised the top of the brick river wall he regarded her evenly faintly he heard the clickclacking of a bicycle passing across garret hostel bridge the grinding clang of a lorry shifting gears as it made its way down the distant queens road but neither sound did more than stir against his consciousness as he studied lady helen he wondered how he could have come to love her so much and all the time know her so very little she had been before him for more than a decade never attempting to disguise who and what she was yet for all that time he had failed to see her in the light of reality imbuing her instead with a set of qualities which he wished her to possess while all along her every relationship had been acting as a cogent illustration of what she saw as her role her way of getting on he couldnt believe he had been such a fool he spoke more to the night than to her its all because i can function by myself you wont marry me because i dont need you helen not the way you want me to youve decided i dont need you to stand on my own or to get on in life or even to be whole and its the truth you know i dont need you that way so you see she said he heard the finality in her three quiet words and felt his own quick anger in response to them i see i do i see that im not one of your projects i see that i dont need you to save me my life is more or less in order now and i want to share it with you as your equal your partner not as some emotional mendicant but as a man whos willing to grow at your side thats the beginning and end of it not what youre used to not even what youve had in mind for yourself but its the best i can do its the best i can offer that and my love and god knows that i love you love isnt enough god damn it helen when are you going to see its the only thing there is in answer to his angry words a light snapped on in the building behind them a curtain flicked back and a disembodied face appeared at one window lynley pushed himself off the concrete ledge and rejoined lady helen beneath the tree what youre thinking he said to her quietly now for he could see how she had begun to withdraw from him is that if i need you enough ill never think of leaving you youll always be safe thats how it is isnt it she averted her head gently he caught her chin with his fingers and turned her back towards him helen isnt it youre not being fair youre in love with me helen dont please every bit as much as im in love with you you want me as much you long for me as much but im not like all the rest of the men youve involved yourself with i dont need you in a way that makes it safe for you to love me i dont depend upon you i stand on my own if you take up life with me you jump into the void you risk it all without a single guarantee he felt her tremble slightly he saw her throat work he felt his heart open helen he drew her into his arms he took strength from knowing each gentle curve of her from feeling the rise and fall of her chest from the feathering touch of her hair against his face from the slender hand that caught at his jacket darling helen he whispered and ran his hand along the length of her hair when she looked up he kissed her her arms slipped round him her lips softened and opened beneath his she smelled of perfume and troughtons cigarette smoke she tasted of brandy do you understand she whispered in reply he drew her mouth back to his giving himself over to nothing more than the separate sensations attendant to kissing her the soft warmth of her lips and her tongue the faint sound of her breathing the heady pleasure of her breasts desire built in him slowly obliterating everything but the knowledge that he had to have her now tonight he wasnt prepared to wait another hour he would take her to bed and to hell with the consequences he wanted to taste her to touch her to know her completely he wanted to take every lovely part of her body and to make her body his he wanted to lower himself between her upraised thighs and hear her gasp and cry out when he sank inside her and i wanted to feel young resilient flesh i wanted to kiss breasts that were full and firm i wanted unveined legs and feet without callosity and iwantediwantediwanted he released her good christ he whispered he felt her hand touch his cheek her skin was so cool his own he knew was probably burning he stood he felt shaken he said i ought to get you back to pens what is it she asked he shook his head blindly it was after all so easy to construct lofty intellectual selfdenigrating comparisons between himself and victor troughton especially when he felt relatively sure that her response would be a loving and generous reassurance that he was not like other men it was far more difficult to look at the matter when his own behaviourhis desires and his intentionsdelineated the truth he felt as if hed spent the last few hours earnestly gathering the seeds of understanding all of which hed just flung mindlessly into the wind they started walking back across the lawn towards the porters lodge and trinity lane beyond it she was silent beside him although her question still hung in the air waiting for an answer he knew she deserved one still he didnt reply until theyd reached his car and hed unlocked the door and opened it for her and then he stopped her just before she got inside he touched her shoulder he fumbled for words i was standing in judgement of troughton he said i was naming the sin and deciding the punishment isnt that what police are meant to do not when theyre guilty of the same crime helen she frowned the same wanting not giving not even thinking just wanting and blindly taking what they want and not caring a damn about anything else she touched her hand to his for a moment she looked to the rise of the footbridge and the backs beyond it where the first ghost puffs of fog were beginning to curl like misty fi ngers round the trunks of the trees then her eyes moved back to his you werent alone in the wanting she said you never have been tommy not before this and certainly not tonight it was an absolution that filled his heart with a sense of completion that hed never had with her before stay in cambridge he said come home when youre ready thank you she whisperedto him to the night the fog lay heavily on the city the next morning a grey blanket of mist that rose like a gas from the surrounding fens and billowed into the air in amorphous clouds that shrouded trees buildings roadways and open land changing everything from common and recognisable substance into mere shape cars lorries buses and taxis inched their way along the damp pavements of the city streets bicyclists slowly swayed through the gloom pedestrians huddled into heavy coats and dodged the constant spattering of the drops of condensation that fell from roofl ines window ledges and trees the two days of wind and sunshine might never have existed fog had returned like a pestilence in the night this was cambridge weather with a vengeance makes me feel like a case for the tubercular ward havers said encased in her peasoup coat with its hood pulled up and a pink knit cap on her head for additional protection she beat her hands against her upper arms and stamped her feet as they walked to lynleys car the heavy mist was creating a beadwork of damp on her clothing across her brow her sandy fringe was beginning to curl as if exposed to steam no wonder philby and burgess went over to the soviets while they were here she continued darkly they were probably looking for a better climate indeed lynley said moscow in the winter thats certainly my idea of heaven on earth he glanced at his sergeant as he spoke shed arrived nearly half an hour late and hed been in the process of gathering his things to start without her when shed clumped down the corridor to his room in ivy court and rapped on his door sorry shed said bleeding fog this morning the m was a glorifi ed car park but despite the deliberately casual tone of her voice he noted the fact that her face was drawn with weariness and she sauntered about the room restlessly as she waited for him to don his coat and his scarf rough night he asked her she settled the strap of her bag high on her shoulder in what seemed to be a metaphorical gathering of personal resources before she replied just a bit of the old insomnia ill survive it and your mother her as well i see he draped his scarf round his neck and shrugged into his overcoat at the mirror he ran a brush through his hair but it was just an excuse to observe havers in refl ection rather than doing so directly she was staring down at his open briefcase on the desk she didnt appear to be taking note of anything in it he stood at the mirror giving her time saying nothing wondering if she would speak he felt a mixture of guilt and shame faced with the diversity of their positions not for the first time he was forced to acknowledge that the differences between them were not confined to birth class and money for her struggles took their definition from a range of circumstances that far exceeded the family into which she had been born and the manner in which she pronounced her words these circumstances rose from simple illfortune dominoes of bad luck that had tumbled one upon the other so quickly in the last ten months that she had not been able to stop their progress that she could stop them now with a simple phone call was the single fact he wished her to acknowledge yet he had to admit that that very phone call so easy for him to recommend represented to her a sloughing off of responsibility coveted salvation rather than obvious solution and he could not deny that in similar circumstances he would not have found himself as equally tied to the idea of fi lial obligation when he reached the point that only narcissism could possibly explain why he was still admiring his own reflection he set down his brush and turned to her she heard his movement and looked up from her study of the briefcase look sorry i was late she said in a rush i know youre covering for me in all this sir i know you cant do it indefi nitely thats not the point barbara we cover for each other when things get rough personally thats understood she reached out for the back of an armchair not so much for support it seemed but for something to do with her hands because she watched her fingers pick at a frayed cord of its upholstery she said the funny thing is she was right as rain this morning last night was a real horror but this morning she was fi ne i keep thinking that must mean something i keep telling myself its a sign if youre looking for signs you can fi nd them in anything they dont tend to change reality however but if theres a chance shes taken a turn for the better what about last night and what about you what sort of turns are you taking here barbara she was working an entire section of the cording loose twisting it round and round her fingers how can i move her from her home when she doesnt understand whats even going on how can i do that to her shes my mother inspector its not a punishment then why does it feel like one worse why do i feel like a criminal whos getting away scot free while she takes the rap because you want to do it in your heart i expect and what greater source of guilt could there be than the guilt that arises from fi nally trying to decide if what you want to dowhich seems momentarily and superfi cially selfi sh is also the right thing to do how can you tell if youre really being honest or just trying to talk yourself into dealing with the situation in a way that meets with your own desires she looked utterly defeated thats the question inspector and ill never have the answer the whole situation goes too far beyond me no it doesnt it starts and stops with you you hold the power you can make the decision i cant stand to hurt her she wont understand lynley snapped the briefcase closed and what does she understand as things are now sergeant that put an end to it as they walked to his car which was shoehorned into the same narrow space hed used last night on garret hostel lane he told her about his conversation with victor troughton when he was fi nished she said before getting into the bentley dyou suppose elena weaver felt real love for anyone he switched on the ignition the heater sent out a stream of cold air on their feet lynley thought of troughtons final words about the girltry to understand she wasnt evil inspector she was merely angry and i for one cant condemn her for that even though in reality you were little more than her choice of weapons lynley had asked him even though hed replied now lynley said we can never really come to know any victims heart completely can we sergeant in this sort of job we look at a life backwards starting with death and working forward from there we patch pieces together and try to make truth from them and with that truth we can only hope for an understanding of who the victim was and what provoked her murder but as to her heartas to the real lasting truth of herwe can never really get to that in the end we have only facts and whatever conclusions we draw from them the little street was too narrow to turn the bentley around so he slowly reversed towards trinity lane braking for a shadowy wellbundled group of students who came out the side gate of trinity hall beyond them fog lapped eagerly at the college garden but why would he want to marry her inspector he knew she wasnt faithful she didnt love him how could he believe that a marriage between them would have ever worked out he thought his love would be enough to change her havers scoffed at this people never change of course they do when theyre ready to grow he headed the car past st stephens church and on towards trinity college the headlamps fought with the heavy bank of fog and their illumination bounced uselessly back into the car they moved at the pace of a somnolent insect it would be a fine and certainly less complicated world if people only had sex with those they loved sergeant but the reality is that people use sex for a variety of reasons most of which have nothing to do with love marriage commitment intimacy procreation or any other lofty motive elena was one of them and troughton evidently was willing to accept that but what kind of marriage could he have expected to have with her havers asked in protest they were starting life with a lie troughton wasnt bothered by that he wanted her and she no doubt she wanted that triumphant moment of seeing her fathers face when she broke the news to him but there would have been no news to break if she hadnt been able to manoeuvre troughton into marrying her in the fi rst place inspector havers voice sounded thoughtful dyou think theres a chance that elena told her father she got the news on wednesday she didnt die till monday morning his wife was out running he was home alone dyou think we certainly cant discount it can we that appeared to be as close as the sergeant was willing to come to voicing her suspicions for she went on in a more decided tone with they couldnt have expected to be happy together elena and troughton i think youre right troughton was deluding himself about his ability to heal her anger and resentment she was deluding herself into believing shed get lasting pleasure from dealing her father such an excruciating blow one cant build a marriage on that sort of foundation are you saying in effect that one cant get on with living unless one puts ghosts from the past to rest he glanced at her warily thats a quantum leap sergeant i think one can always muddle on through life most people do i just couldnt tell you how well they do it because of the fog the traffi c and the capricious nature of cambridges oneway streets it took them just over ten minutes to drive to queens college the same time it would have taken them to walk it lynley parked in the same spot he had used the day before and they entered the college through the turreted passage so you think this is the answer to everything havers asked looking round old court as they walked across its central path i think it may be one of them they found gareth randolph in the college dining hall a hideously unappealing combination of linoleum long cafeteria tables and walls panelled in what appeared to be mock golden oak it was a modern architects salute to the utterly banal although there were other students present gareth was at a table by himself hunching disconsolately over the remains of a late breakfast which consisted of a halfeaten fried egg with its yolk punched out and a bowl of cornfl akes and bananas grown respectively soggy and grey a book was open on the table in front of him but that seemed mostly for show since he wasnt reading nor was he writing in the notebook next to it although he held a pencil poised as if to do so his head raised with a jerk when lynley and havers took seats across from him he glanced round the hall as if for quick escape or assistance from the other members of the college who were present lynley took his pencil and dashed nine words across the top of the notebook you were the father of her baby werent you gareth raised a hand to his forehead he squeezed his temples then brushed the lank hair from his brow his chest heaved once before he seemed to draw himself together by standing and canting his head in the direction of the door they were meant to follow like georgina higginsharts gareths bedsitting room was tucked into old court on the ground floor it was a perfectly square room of white walls upon which were hung four framed posters advertising the london philharmonic and three photographic enlargements of theatrical performances les miserables starlight express aspects of love the former featured the name sonia raleigh randolph prominently above the words at the piano the latter featured an attractive young woman in appropriate costume singing gareth pointed first to the posters then to the photographs mutha he said in his strange guttural voice sisser he watched lynley shrewdly he seemed to be waiting for a reaction to the irony of his mothers and sisters modes of employment lynley merely nodded on a wide desk beneath the rooms only window a computer sat it was also lynley saw a ceephone identical to the others he had already seen in cambridge gareth switched the unit on and drew a second chair to the desk he gestured lynley into it and quickly accessed a word processing programme sergeant lynley said when he saw how gareth intended them to communicate youre going to have to make notes from the screen he took off his coat and scarf and sat at the desk havers came to stand behind him the hood of her coat thrown back her pink cap removed a notebook in her hand were you the father lynley typed the boy looked long at the words before he replied with didnt know she was pg she never said told you already not knowing she was pregnant doesnt mean sodall havers remarked he cant take us for fools he doesnt lynley said i dare say he just takes himself for one sergeant he typed you had sex with elena deliberately making it a statement not a question gareth answered by hitting one of the number keys once yes when the boy pushed away from the desk for a moment he remained in his chair he looked not at the computer screen but at the fl oor his arms on his knees lynley typed the word september and touched the boys shoulder gareth glanced up read it dropped his head again a hollow sound akin to a stricken bellow rose from his throat lynley typed tell me what happened gareth and touched the boys shoulder again gareth looked up he had begun to cry and as if this display of emotion angered him he drew his arm savagely across his eyes lynley waited the boy moved back to the desk london he typed just before term i saw her for my birthday she fucked me on the floor of the kitchen while her mum was out buying milk for tea happy birthday you bloody stupid berk great havers sighed loved her gareth went on i wanted us special to behe dropped his hands to his lap stared at the screen you thought the lovemaking meant more than elena intended it to mean lynley typed is that what happened fucking gareth answered not lovemaking fucking is that what she called it thought we build something last year i took real care to make it last didnt want to rush anything never even tried with her wanted it to be real but it wasnt thought it was because if you do that with a woman it means like a pledge like you say something you wouldnt say to anyone else saying that you love each other want to be together want to have a future i thought thats why she did it with me did you know she was sleeping with someone else not then when did you learn it she came up this term i thought wed be together as lovers she didnt want that laughed when i tried to talk to her about it said whats matter with you gareth it was only a fuck we did it it felt good thats the end of it right why you getting so mooneyed over it its not a big deal but it was to you thought she loved me thats why she wanted to do it with me didnt knowhe stopped he looked sapped of energy lynley gave him a moment glancing round the room over a hook on the back of the door hung his scarf the distinctive blue of the university letterman his boxing glovessmooth clean leather with a look of having been lovingly cared forhung on a second hook beneath them lynley wondered how much of gareth randolphs pain had been worked out against one of the punching bags in the small gymnasium on the upper fl oor of fenners he turned back to the computer the argument you had with elena on sunday is that when she told you she was involved with someone else i talked about us he responded but there was no us thats what she told you how could there not be us i said what about london thats when she told you it hadnt meant anything just a poke for fun gareth we were randy we did it dont be such a twit and make it more than that she was laughing at you i cant imagine you liked it kept trying to talk how she acted london what she felt london but she wouldnt listen and then she told that there was someone else didnt believe her at first i said she was scared said she was trying to be what her father wanted her to be said all sorts of things wasnt even thinking wanted to hurt her thats a telling remark havers noted perhaps lynley said but its a fairly typical reaction to being hurt by someone you love measure still for measure and when the first measure is murder havers asked i havent discounted that sergeant he typed what did you do when shed convinced you there was another man gareth lifted his hands but did not type in a nearby room a vacuum began to thunder as the buildings bedder made her daily rounds and lynley felt the answering urgency of concluding this interview before they were disturbed by anyone he typed again what did you do hesitantly gareth touched the keys hung about at st stephens till she left i wanted to know who you followed her to trinity hall you knew it was dr troughton when the boy nodded lynley typed how long did you hang about there till she came out at one he nodded hed waited in the street for her to emerge he told them and when shed come out hed confronted her again furiously angry at her rejection of him bitterly disappointed in the loss of his dreams but most of all he was disgusted with her behaviour for he thought hed understood her intentions in involving herself with victor troughton and he saw those intentions as an attempt to attach herself to a hearing world that would never fully accept or understand her she was acting deaf she wasnt acting deaf theyd argued violently hed left her in the street never saw her again he fi nished doesnt look good to me sir havers said where were you monday morning lynley typed when she was killed here in bed but no one of course could verify that he had been alone and it would not have been an impossibility for gareth simply to have failed to return to queens college that night going instead to crusoes island to lie in wait for elena weaver and to put a permanent end to the dispute between them we need those boxing gloves inspector havers said as she snapped her notebook closed hes got motive hes got means hes got opportunity hes got a temper as well and the talent to channel it right through his fi sts lynley had to admit that a blue in boxing could not be overlooked when the murder victim had been beaten before she was strangled he typed did you know georgina higginshart and after gareth nodded where were you yesterday morning between six and half past here asleep can someone verify that he shook his head we need your boxing gloves gareth we need to give them to the forensic lab will you let us take them the boy gave a slow howl didnt kill her didnt kill her didnt didnt didnt didnt did gently lynley moved the boys hands to one side do you know who did gareth shook his head once but he kept his hands in his lap balled into fists as if they might betray him of their own volition should he raise them to the keyboard and allow them to type again hes lying havers paused in the doorway to drape gareths boxing gloves round the strap of her shoulder bag because if anyone ever had a motive to bag her hes the one inspector i cant disagree with that lynley said she pulled her cap firmly down over her forehead and drew up the hood of her coat but you canand no doubt willdisagree with something else ive heard that tone of yours before what i think he knows who killed her or thinks he knows of course he does because he did it himself directly after he pounded her face in with these she flipped the gloves in his direction what have we been looking for as a weapon all along something smooth have a feel of this leather something heavy imagine being on the receiving end of a boxers punch something capable of infl icting faceshattering damage look at a few postprizefight photos for the proof if you want it he couldnt disagree the boy had all the necessary requirements save one and the gun sergeant what the shotgun used on georgina higginshart what about that you said yourself that the university probably has a gun club to which i have no doubt gareth randolph belongs so why follow her she frowned jabbing the toe of her shoe against the icy stone fl oor havers i can understand why he would lie in wait at crusoes island for elena weaver he was in love with her shed rejected him shed made it plain that their lovemaking was just a bit of sweaty frolic on her mothers kitchen floor shed declared her attachment to another man shed teased and humiliated and made him feel a perfect fool i agree with all that so what about georgina george havers only stumbled over the thought for a moment before going on stoutly perhaps its what we thought before symbolically killing elena weaver again and again by seeking out all the young women who resemble her if thats the case why not go to her room havers why not kill her in the college why follow her all the way out past madingley and how did he follow her how havers hes deaf that stopped her lynley pressed his advantage its the country havers it was pitch dark out there even if he got a car and followed her at a distance until they were safely out of town and then drove beyond her to lie in wait in that field wouldnt he have had to hear somethingher footfalls her breathing anything haversin order to know exactly when to shoot are you going to argue that he went out there before dawn on wednesday morning and blithely relied upon there being adequate starlight in this weatherwhich frankly would have been a fairly bad betto see a running girl well enough and soon enough to aim at her discharge the weapon and kill her thats not premeditated murder thats pure serendipity she lifted one of the boxing gloves with the palm of her hand so whatre we doing with these inspector making st james work for his money this morning as well as hedging our bets she pushed open the door with a weary grin i just love a man who keeps his options open they were heading towards the turreted passage and queens lane beyond it when a voice called out to them they turned back into the court a slender fi gure was coming along the path the mist breaking before her like a curtain as she jogged in their direction she was tall and fair with long silky hair that was held back from her face by two tortoise shell combs these glittered with damp in the light that shone from one of the buildings beads of moisture clung to her eyelashes and skin she was wearing only an unmatched sweatsuit whose shirt like georginas was emblazoned with the name of the college she looked terribly cold i was in the dining hall she told them i saw you come for gareth youre the police and youre rosalyn simpson her eyes fell to the boxing gloves and her brow furrowed in consternation you dont think gareths had anything to do with this lynley said nothing havers crossed her arms the girl continued i would have come to you sooner but i was in oxford until tuesday evening and then well it gets a bit complicated she cast a glance in the direction of gareth randolphs room you have some information lynley asked i went to see gareth at first it was the deastu handout hed printed you see i saw it when i got back so it seemed logical to talk to him i thought hed pass the information on besides there were other considerations at the time thatoh what does it matter now im here im telling you what exactly like sergeant havers rosalyn too crossed her arms although it seemed more in a need to keep warm than a desire to project implacability she said i was running along the river monday morning i went by crusoes island round half past six i think i saw the killer glyn weaver edged part way down the stairs just far enough to hear the conversation between her former husband and his current wife they were still in the morning roomalthough it had been some hours since breakfastand their voices were just polite and formal enough to give a clear indication of the state of things between them cool glyn decided frosting over into glacial she smiled terence cuff wants to give some sort of eulogy anthony was saying he spoke without any evident feeling the information given like a recitation ive talked to two of her supervisors theyll also speak and adams said hed like to read a poem she was fond of there was a clink of china a cup being placed carefully into a saucer we might not have the body back from the police before tomorrow but the funeral parlour will have a coffi n there all the same no one will know the difference and as everyones been told shes to be buried in london no one will be expecting an interment tomorrow as to the funeral anthony in london justines voice was calm glyn felt her spine tingle when she heard that tone of cool determination there cant be a change in the plans anthony said try to understand i have no choice in the matter i must respect glyns wishes its the least i can do im your wife as she was once and elena was our daughter she was your wife for less than six years six miserable years as i recall your telling me more than fifteen years ago at that while you and i this situation has nothing to do with how long i was married to either of you justine it has everything to do with it it has to do with loyalty with vows i made and promises ive kept ive been faithful to you in every way while she slept around like a whore and you know it and now you say that respecting her wishes is the least you can do respecting hers over mine anthony had begun to respond with if you still cant see that there are times when the past when glyn got to the doorway she took only a moment to survey them before speaking anthony was sitting in one of the wicker chairs unshaven desiccated justine was at the bank of windows where the fog that shrouded the wide front garden pressed long streaks of moisture against the glass she was dressed in a black suit and pearl grey blouse a black leather briefcase leaned against her chair glyn said perhaps youd like to say the rest justine like mother like daughter or dont you have the nerve to carry your special brand of honesty to its logical conclusion justine began to move towards her chair she brushed a strand of blonde hair off her cheek glyn caught her arm dug her fi ngers into the fine wool of her suit and enjoyed a fleeting moment of delight when she saw justine fl inch i said why dont you finish what you were saying she insisted glyn put elena through her paces anthony glyn turned your daughter into a little deaf whore elena gave a poke to anyone who wanted it just like her mum glyn anthony said dont try to defend her all right i was standing on the stairs i heard what she said my only child dead for just three days myself struggling to make some kind of sense of it and she cant wait to tear into the both of us and she chooses sex to do it i find that most interesting i wont listen to this justine said glyn tightened her grip cant you bear to hear the truth you use sex as a weapon and not merely against me glyn felt justines muscles go rigid she knew that her dagger had hit the mark she drove it in farther reward him when hes been a good little boy punish him when hes bad is that how it is so how long will he pay for keeping you from the funeral youre pathetic justine said you cant see beyond sex any more than elena glyn dropped justines arm she looked at anthony ah there it is justine brushed at her sleeve as if to cleanse herself of the contact shed had with her husbands former wife she picked up her briefcase im off she said calmly anthony stood his eyes going from the briefcase to her moving his gaze from her head to her feet as if he had only just become aware of the manner in which she had dressed for the day you cant be intending to go back to work just three days after elena was murdered to expose myself to public censure for having done so oh yes anthony thats exactly what i intend no justine people stop it please im not at all like you for a moment anthony stared after her as she left the house taking her coat from round the newel post on the stairway and closing the front door behind her he watched her walk through the fog towards her grey peugeot glyn kept her eyes on him warily wondering if he would run out and try to stop her but he seemed if anything too exhausted to care about changing anyones mind he turned from the window and trudged towards the back of the house she went to the table upon which the breakfast things still lay bacon congealing in slim jackets of grease egg yolks drying and splitting like yellow mud a piece of toast still stood in the silver rack and glyn reached for it thoughtfully dry and abrasive beneath her fingers it crumbled easily leaving a shower of dust upon the clean parquet fl oor from the back of the house she could hear the metallic sound of file drawers sliding open and over it the high whine of elenas irish setter longing to be allowed into the house glyn walked to the kitchen from whose window she could see the dog sitting on the back step his black nose pressed into the doorjamb his feathery tail sweeping back and forth in innocent anticipation he took a step backwards looked up and saw her watching him through the window his tail picked up rhythm he gave a joyful bark she regarded him evenlytaking a small degree of pleasure in allowing his hopes to risebefore she turned and made her way to the rear of the house at the doorway to anthonys study she paused he was crouched by an open drawer of the filing cabinet the contents of two manila folders lay on the fl oor comprising perhaps two dozen pencil sketches next to them was a canvas rolled like a tube for a moment glyn watched as anthonys hand passed slowly over the drawings in a gesture like an incomplete caress then he began to go through them his fingers seemed clumsy twice he gasped for breath when he paused to remove his spectacles and wipe their lenses on his shirt she realised that he was crying she entered the room to get a better look at the drawings on the floor and saw that they were all sketches of elena dads got himself into drawing these days elena had told her shed pronounced it dawing and shed laughed about the idea theyd often chuckled over anthonys attempts to find himself through one activity or another as he approached middle age first it had been long distance running after that he had begun to swim then hed taken up bicycling like a zealot and finally he had learned to sail but of all the activities which he had pursued drawing amused them the most dad tinks hes got the soul of van gogh elena would say and shed mimic her fathers widelegged stance with sketch pad in hand eyes squinting towards the distance hand shading her brow shed draw a moustache like his on her upper lip and pull her face into a contorted frown of concentration doe move an inch glynnie she would command of her mother hol that pose holthatpose and they would laugh together but now glyn could see that the sketches were quite good that he had managed to achieve something far more in them than was depicted in the still lifes that hung in the sitting room or the sailboats the harbours and the fishing villages here on the study walls for in the series of drawings hed spread out on the floor she could see that he had managed to capture the essence of their daughter here were the exact tilt of her head the elfi n shape of her eyes the wide chippedtooth grin the contour of a cheekbone of nose and of mouth these were studies only they were quick impressions but they were lovely and true as she took a step closer anthony looked up he gathered the drawings together and replaced them in their respective folders along with the canvas which fit into the back he shoved them into the drawer you dont have any of them framed she said he didnt answer instead he closed the drawer and went to the desk where he played restlessly with the computer switching on the ceephone and watching the screen a series of menu instructions appeared he stared at them but did nothing with the keyboard never mind glyn said i know why you hide them she went to stand behind him she spoke near his ear how many years have you lived like this anthony ten twelve how on earth have you managed his head lowered she studied the back of his neck remembering unexpectedly how soft his hair was and how when overlong it curled like a childs against his skin it was greying now with scattered strands like white threads woven against black what did she hope to gain elena was your daughter she was your only child what on earth did she hope to gain his reply was a whisper he spoke as if answering someone not in the room she wanted to hurt me there was nothing else she could do to make me understand understand what how it felt to be devastated how id devastated her through cowardice selfi shness egocentricity but mostly through cowardice you want the penford chair only for your ego she said you want a beautiful house and a beautiful wife and a daughter wholl be your marionette so that people will look at you with admiration and envy so that people will say the lucky blokes got it all but you dont have it all you have practically nothing you have less than nothing because what you have is a lie and you dont even have the courage to admit it a sudden fist of knowledge squeezed at glyns heart as the full meaning of his words slowly dawned upon her even though he spoke them in a fugue you could have prevented it if only youd given her what she wanted anthony you could have stopped her i couldnt i had to think of elena she was here in cambridge in this home with me she was starting to come round to be free with me at last to let me be her father i couldnt run the risk of losing her again i couldnt take the chance and i thought i would lose her if i you lost her anyway she cried shaking his arm shes not going to walk through that door shes not going to say dad i understand i forgive you i know you did your best shes gone shes dead and you could have prevented it if she had a child she might have understood what it felt like to have elena here she might have known why i couldnt face the thought of doing anything that might have resulted in losing her again id lost her once how could i face that agony again how could she expect me to face it glyn saw that he wasnt really responding to her he was ruminating he was speaking in tongues behind a barrier that shielded him from the worst of the truth he was talking in a canyon where an echo exists but throws back different words suddenly she felt the same degree of anger towards him that shed felt during the worst years of their marriage when shed greeted his blind pursuit of his career with pursuits of her own waiting for him to notice the late nights she was keeping wanting him to notice the nature of the bruises on her neck her breasts and her thighs anticipating the moment when he would finally speak when hed give an indication that he really did care this is all about you isnt it she asked him it always has been even having elena here in cambridge was for your benefi t not for herself not for her education but to make you feel better to give you what you want i wanted to give her a life i wanted us to have a life together how would that have been possible you didnt love her anthony you only loved yourself you loved your image your reputation your wonderful accomplishments you loved being loved but you didnt love her and even now you can stand here and look at your daughters death and think about how you caused it and how you feel about it now and how devastated you are and what kind of statement it all makes about you but you wont do anything about any of it will you you wont make any declaration you wont take any stand because how might that refl ect upon you finally he looked at her the rims of his eyes appeared bloody and sore you dont know what happened you dont understand i understand perfectly you plan to bury your dead lick your wounds and go on youre as much a coward as you were fi fteen years ago you ran out on her then in the middle of the night youll run out on her now because its the easiest thing to do i didnt run out on her he said carefully i stood firm this time glyn thats why she died for you because of you yes because of me the sun rises and sets on the same horizon in your world it always has he shook his head perhaps once he said but it only sets now lynley pulled the bentley into a vacant space at the southwest corner of the cambridge police station he stared at the vaguely discernible shape of the glassencased notice board in front of the building feeling drained next to him havers fidgeted in her seat she began to flip through her notebook he knew she was reading what shed just recorded from rosalyn simpson it was a woman the queens undergraduate had said she had walked them along the same route she had taken early monday morning through the thick dun cotton wool of fog in laundress lane where the open door to the asian studies faculty shot a meagre light out into the gloom once someone slammed it shut however the mist seemed impenetrable the universe became confined to the twenty square feet which comprised the boundary of what they could see do you run every morning lynley asked the girl as they crossed mill lane and skirted the metal posts that kept vehicles off the pedestrian bridge which crossed the river at granta place to their right laundress green was obscured by the fog an expanse of misty field intermittently disturbed by the hulking forms of crack willows beyond it from across the pond a single light winked from an upper floor in the old granary nearly she answered always the same time as close to a quarter past six as i can make it sometimes a bit later and on monday mondays are slower for me getting out of bed it was probably round sixtwentyfive when i left queens on monday so youd reach the island no later than half past youre certain of that it couldnt have been later i was back in my room by half past seven inspector im quick its true but im not that quick and i did a good ten miles monday morning with the island at the start of it its part of my training circuit for hare and hounds yes i fancy a blue this year she hadnt noticed anything unusual on the morning of her run she told them it was still quite dark when she left queens college and aside from overtaking a workman who was pushing a cart down laundress lane she hadnt seen another soul just the usual assortment of ducks and swans some already fl oating on the river others still placidly dozing on the bank but the fog was heavyat least as heavy as it is today she saidso she had to admit that anyone might have been lurking in a doorway or waiting hidden by the fog on the green when they reached the island they found a small fire burning sending up weak puffs of acrid sootcoloured smoke to melt into the fog a man in a peaked cap overcoat and gloves was feeding autumn leaves trash and bits of wood into the bluetipped fl ames lynley recognised him as ned the surlier of the two older boat repairmen rosalyn indicated the footbridge that crossed not the cam itself but the secondary stream that the river became as it fl owed round the west side of the island she was crossing this she said i heard her because she stumbled against somethingshe might have lost her footing everything was quite dampand she was coughing as well i assumed she was out running like me and was feeling worn out and frankly i was a bit peeved to come upon her like that because she didnt appear to be watching where she was going and i nearly bumped into her and she seemed embarrassed well i suppose i have the university mind set about townees dont i what was she doing i thought invading my patch what gave you the impression she was a local rosalyn looked thoughtfully at the footbridge through the mist the damp air was catching on her eyelashes spiking them darkly childlike curls of hair were forming against her brow it was something about her clothes i should guess and perhaps her age although i suppose she could have been from lucy cavendish what about her clothes rosalyn gestured at her own mismatched sweat suit university runners generally wear their college colours somewhere their college sweatshirts as well and she wasnt wearing a sweat suit havers asked sharply glancing up from her notebook she wasa tracksuit actuallybut it wasnt from a college i mean i dont recall seeing a college name on it although now i think of it considering the colour she might have been from trinity hall because she was wearing black lynley said rosalyns quick smile indicated affi rmation you know the colleges colours then it was just a good guess he walked onto the footbridge the wrought iron gate was partially open upon the south end of the island the police line was gone now the island available to anyone who wished to sit by the water to meet surreptitiously orlike sarah gordonto attempt to sketch did the woman see you rosalyn and havers remained on the path oh yes youre sure i nearly ran into her she couldnt have helped seeing me and you were wearing the same clothes youre wearing now rosalyn nodded and plunged her hands into the pockets of the anorak shed taken from her room prior to their setting out into the fog without this of course she said with a lift of her shoulders to indicate the anorak she added ingenuously one gets warm enough running andher face brightenedshe didnt have a coat or a jacket on so that must have been another reason why i assumed she was a runner although a marked hesitation as she looked into the mist she might have been carrying one i suppose i cant recall but i think she was carrying somethingi think what did she look like look like rosalyn frowned down at her gym shoes slender she wore her hair pulled back colour oh dear it was light i think yes quite light anything unusual about her a feature perhaps a mark on her skin the shape of her nose a large forehead a pointed chin i cant recall im terribly sorry im not much help am i you see it was three days ago and i didnt know at the time that id have to remember her i mean one doesnt really study everyone one meets one doesnt expect to have to recall them rosalyn blew out a breath of frustration before going on to say earnestly perhaps if youd like to hypnotise me the way they do sometimes when a witness cant recall the details of a crime its fine lynley said he rejoined them on the path do you think she got a clear look at your sweatshirt oh i dare say she did she would have seen the name queens college you mean yes she would have seen that rosalyn looked back in the direction of the college although even had there been no fog she wouldnt have been able to see it in the distance when she turned back to them her face was sombre but she didnt say anything until a young man coming across crusoes bridge from coe fen descended the ten iron steps shoes ringing loudly against the metaland plodded past them head bent into the mist which quickly enveloped him melinda was right then rosalyn said quietly georgina died in my place a girl her age didnt need to carry round that sort of responsibility for a lifetime lynley thought he said you cant know that for a certainty although he was fast arriving at the same conclusion rosalyn reached for one of the tortoise shell combs in her hair she pulled it out and grasped a long lock in her fi ngers theres this she said and then she unzipped her anorak and pointed to the emblem across her breast and this were the same height the same weight the same colouring were both from queens whoever followed georgina yesterday morning thought she was following me because i saw because i knew because i might have told and i would have i should haveand if i had doneas by rights i should have and i know it you dont have to tell me i know itgeorgina wouldnt be dead she whipped her head away and blinked furiously at the cloudy mass of sheeps green and he knew there was little or nothing he could say to lessen her guilt or lighten her burden of responsibility now more than an hour later lynley drew a deep breath and let it out staring at the sign in front of the police station across the street the wide green that was parkers piece might not even have existed hidden as it was by the matwork of fog a distant beacon blinked off and on in its centre serving as a guide to those trying to find their way so it had nothing to do with the fact that elena was pregnant havers said and then what now wait here for st james see what hes able to conclude about the weapon and let him have a go at eliminating the boxing gloves as well and you ill go to the weavers right still she didnt move from the car he could feel her looking at him everyone loses dont they inspector thats always the case with a murder he said neither of the weaver cars was in the drive when lynley pulled up to the front of the house but the garage doors were closed and assuming that the cars would be kept out of the damp he went to ring the bell from the back of the house he could hear the dogs answering bark of welcome it was followed moments later by a womans voice calling for quiet behind the door the bolt was drawn back since shed met him at the door on his two previous visits lynley had been expecting to see justine weaver when the broad oak panels slid soundlessly open so he was taken aback when in her place stood a tall somewhat beefy middleaged woman carrying a plate of sandwiches these gave off the distinct odour of tuna they were surrounded by a substantial nest of crisps lynley recalled his initial interview with the weavers and the information that anthony weaver had given him about his former wife this he realised would be glyn he produced his warrant card and introduced himself she took her time about scrutinising it giving him time to scrutinise her only in height was she like justine weaver in every other way she was justines antithesis looking at her heavy tweed skirt that stretched wide across her hips her lineweary face with its loose flesh on the jaw her wiry hair liberally streaked with grey and pulled back into an unflattering chignon lynley found himself hearing once again victor troughtons assessment of his wifes middle age and he felt a surge of mortifi cation when he realised that he too was in the process of judging and dismissing based upon what time had done to a womans body glyn weaver looked up from her perusal of his card she held the door open come in she said i was just having lunch would you like something she offered the plate in his direction youd think there might be something other than tinned fish in the larder but anthonys justine likes to watch her weight is she here lynley asked is dr weaver here glyn led him into the morning room and fluttered a hand in dismissal both out one couldnt really expect justine to hang about the house for more than a day or two over something as inconsequential as a family deathand as for anthony i dont know he went off a while ago by car yes to the college i have no idea one moment he was here in the house talking to me the next moment he was gone i expect hes out there somewhere in the fog trying to think what hes going to do next you know how it is moral obligation versus cockthrobbing lust hes always had trouble when it comes to confl ict in his case im afraid lust usually wins lynley didnt respond he would have had to be a complete dullard not to recognise what was roiling beneath the thin veneer of glyns civility anger hatred bitterness envy and a terror of abjuring any of them in order to allow her heart to begin to feel the full strength of what had to be a multifurcate grief glyn set her plate on the wicker table its breakfast dishes had not yet been removed on the floor surrounding it a noticeable patina of toast crumbs lay on the wood and she walked right through this either oblivious or unconcerned she stacked the breakfast plates one upon the other mindless of the cold and congealing food upon each but rather than take them into the kitchen she merely pushed them to one side ignoring a dirty knife and teaspoon that fell from the table onto the crisp floral pillow that covered the seat of one of the chairs anthony knows she said i expect you know as well i expect thats why youve come will you arrest her today she sat down her chairs willow strands creaked as they rubbed together she picked up the sandwich and took a hefty bite chewing with a pleasure that seemed only marginally related to the food he said do you know where shes gone mrs weaver glyn picked among the crisps at what point exactly do you make an arrest ive always wondered that do you need an eyewitness what about hard evidence youve got to have something to give to the prosecutors dont you youve got to have a case that solidly sticks did she have an appointment glyn wiped her hands against her skirt and began to tick items off on her fi ngers theres the ceephone call that she claimed she received on sunday night theres the fact that she ran without the dog on monday morning theres the fact that she knew exactly where and how and what time to fi nd her and theres the fact that she hated her and wanted her dead do you need something more fingerprints blood a single hair a bit of skin has she gone to see family people loved elena justine couldnt stand that but mostly she couldnt stand that anthony loved her she hated his devotion how he always tried to make things right between them she didnt want that because if things went right between anthony and elena things would go wrong between anthony and justine thats what she thought and she was sick with jealousy youve fi nally come for her havent you eagerness appeared in wet glimmers at the corners of her mouth she reminded lynley of the crowds that once gathered to watch public executions revelling in the vengeful taking of a life had there been a possibility to see justine weaver drawn and quartered he had no doubt that this woman would be more than willing to grasp the opportunity he wanted to tell her that there was in the end no real taking of an eye for an eye and no real satisfaction to be found at any bar of justice for even if the most barbarous kind of punishment were meted out against the perpetrator of a crime the rage and grief of the victimised remained his eyes dropped to the mess on the table near the stacked plates and beneath a knife that was smeared with butter lay an envelope with the crest of the university press on it and justines namebut not her addresswritten in a firm masculine hand evidently glyn saw the direction of his gaze for she said shes an important executive you couldnt really have thought shed be hanging round here he nodded and began to take his leave will you arrest her she asked again he responded with i want to ask her a question i see just a question quite well would you arrest her if you had the proof in your hand if i gave you the proof she waited to see the reaction to her questions she smiled like a perfectly satisfied cat when his steps faltered and he turned to face her yes she said slowly oh yes indeed mister policeman she pushed away from the table and left the room in a moment he heard the irish setter begin barking again and her answering shout from the back of the house shut up will you the dog persisted here she said returning she carried two manila folders and under her arm what appeared to be an artists canvas rolled up anthony had these in the study hidden at the back of a filing drawer i found him snivelling over them an hour or so ago just before he left have a look for yourself ive no doubt what conclusion youll reach she handed over the folders first he fl ipped through the sketches that each contained all of them were studies of the dead girl all appeared done by the same hand they were undeniably skilful and he admired their quality none however could possibly serve as a motive for murder he was about to say this when glyn thrust the canvas at him now look at this she said he unrolled it squatting to place it on the floor because it was quite large and had been doubled over prior to being rolled and stored in the first place it was he saw a spattered piece of canvas with two large rips moving diagonally towards the middle and a central shorter rip meeting them there the spattering on it had been created by large gobs of paintmostly white and redthat looked as if theyd been smeared haphazardly onto the canvas with a palette knife and with no regard for artistic expression where they did not meet or overlap the colours of another oil painting showed through he stood up and gazed down at it feeling the fi rst stirring of fi nal comprehension and this glyn said it was wrapped up in the canvas when i first unrolled it she slapped into his hand a small brass plaqueperhaps two inches long and three quarters of an inch wide he took it from his palm and held it to the light knowing what it was that he would likely see elena was engraved in fine script across it he looked up at glyn weaver and saw the exultant pleasure she was taking from the moment he knew she was expecting him to comment upon the nature of the motive shed just presented him instead he asked has justine gone running while youve been in cambridge this didnt seem to be the response she expected from him but she answered well enough although her eyes narrowed with sharp suspicion as she did so yes in a tracksuit well she wasnt exactly dressed by coco chanel what colour mrs weaver colour with a hint of outrage that he wasnt keying into the ruined painting and what it implied yes the colour it was black so just how much more proof do you want that justine hated my daughter glyn weaver had followed him out of the breakfast room leaving behind the smell of old eggs tuna butter and crisps vying with one another in the air for domination whats it going to take to convince you how much more proof shed put a hand on his arm and pulled on him till he faced her standing so close that he could feel her breath on his face and could smell the oily odour of fish each time she exhaled he sketched elena not his wife he painted elena not his wife imagine watching that imagine hating each moment as it was going on before your eyes right here in this morning room because the lights good here and he would have wanted to paint her in light that was good lynley turned the bentley into bulstrode gardens where the streetlamps did not so much cut through the mist as merely colour the top layer of it gold while the rest remained a mass of wet grey he pulled directly into the semicircular drive through a mat of damp leaves fallen and blown from the stand of slim birches at the edge of the property without taking particular note of it he gazed at the house before getting out of the car considering the nature of the evidence he had with him reflecting upon the sketches of elena and what they suggested about the ruined canvas thinking of the ceephone and above all playing with time for it was time upon which the entire case hung she would have obliterated the image fi rst and taking no real or lasting satisfaction in that she would have moved on to the girl herself second glyn weaver had asserted she would have pounded her face just as shed hacked and stabbed at the painting brutalising and destroying living out her rage but most of that constituted hopeful conjecture lynley thought only part of it skirted close to the truth he tucked the canvas under his arm and went to the door harry rodger answered christian and perdita at his heels he said only its pen you want to lynleys request and then to his son go fetch mummy chris when the little boy scampered up the stairway to do so shouting mummy and bashing the worn head of a hobbyhorse against the balusters with additional cries of kerblowey kerblew rodger nodded lynley into the sitting room he swung his daughter onto his hip and glanced without speaking at the canvas beneath lynleys arm perdita curled herself against her fathers chest above them christians footsteps thumped along the upstairs corridor his hobbyhorse banged against the wall mummy small fists pounded on a door youve brought her some work havent you rodgers words were polite his face deliberately impassive id like her to look at this harry i need her expertise the other mans lips offered a brief smile one which accepted information without indicating that it was at all welcome he said excuse me please and he walked into the kitchen shutting the door behind him a moment later christian preceded both his mother and his aunt into the sitting room somewhere in his sojourn through the house hed picked up a totsized vinyl holster and he was wrestling it inexpertly round his waist its companion toy gun dangling to his knees i shoot you mister he said to lynley dragging on the guns handle and knocking himself into lady helens legs in his effort to get it out i shoot auntie leen those arent the wisest words to say to a policeman chris lady helen knelt in front of him and saying dont be such a wiggleworm she fastened the holster round his waist he giggled and shouted kerblang you mister and ran to the sofa where he beat the pistol against the pillows if nothing else he has a fine future in crime lynley noted penelope raised both hands in futility its nearly his naptime he gets a bit wild when hes tired id hate to think what hes like when hes fully awake kerplough christian yelled he rolled onto the floor and began crawling in the direction of the hall making shooting noises and taking aim at imaginary foes penelope watched him and shook her head ive considered sedating him until his eighteenth birthday but what would i do for laughs as christian began an assault on the stairway she said with a nod towards the canvas what have you brought lynley unrolled it along the back of the sofa gave her a moment to observe it from across the room and said what can you do with it do not a restoration tommy lady helen said doubtfully penelope looked up from the canvas she said heavens you must be joking why tommy its a ruin i dont need it repaired i just need to establish whats underneath the top layer of paint but how do you even know theres something underneath it look closer there has to be you can see it and besides its the only explanation penelope asked for no further details she merely walked to the sofa for a closer look and touched her fingers to the surface of the canvas it would take weeks to clean this off she said youve no idea what it would entail this sort of thing is done inches at a time across a canvas a single layer at a time one doesnt just dump a bottle of solvent on it and wipe it off like a window being cleaned blast lynley muttered kerblooey christian yelled from his position of potential ambush on the stairs still penelope tapped her index fi nger against her lip let me take it into the kitchen and have a look under stronger light her husband was standing at the stove fl ipping through the days post his daughter leaned against him one arm encircling his leg one apple cheek pressed against his thigh sleepily she said mummy and rodger raised his head from the letter he was perusing his eyes took in the canvas that penelope carried his face was unreadable penelope said if youll just clear off the work top and waited with the canvas in her hands while lynley and lady helen moved aside the mixing bowls lunch dishes story books and silverware then she fl opped the canvas down and looked at it thoughtfully pen her husband said in a moment she replied she went to a drawer and took out a magnifying glass fondly running her fingers through her daughters hair as she passed wheres the baby rodger asked penelope bent over the work top and scrutinised first the individual blotches of paint and then the rips in the canvas itself ultraviolet she said perhaps infrared she looked up at lynley do you need the painting itself or would a photograph do photograph pen i asked we have three options an xray would show us the entire skeleton of the painting everything thats been painted on the canvas no matter how many layers have been used an ultraviolet light would give us whatever works been done on top of the varnishif theres been repainting for instance an infrared photo would give us whatever comprised the initial sketch for the painting and any doctoring thats been done to the signature if there is a signature of course would any of that be helpful lynley looked at the lacerated canvas and considered the options i should guess an xray he said reflectively but if that doesnt do it can we try something else certainly ill just penelope harry rodgers face had mottled although his voice was determinedly pleasant isnt it time that the twins had a lie down christians been acting like a madman for the past twenty minutes and perditas falling asleep on her feet penelope glanced at the wall clock that hung above the stove she chewed on her lip and looked at her sister lady helen smiled faintly perhaps in acknowledgement perhaps in encouragement youre right of course penelope said with a sigh they do need to nap good then so if youll see to them yourself darling the rest of us can pop this canvas round to the fitzwilliam to see what can be done with it the babys been fed shes already asleep and the twins wont give you much trouble so long as you read them something from cautionary verses christians quite partial to that poem about mathilda helen must have read it to him half a dozen times before he dropped off yesterday she began rolling up the canvas ill just need a moment to dress she told lynley when shed left the room rodger lifted up his daughter he looked at the doorway as if in the expectation of penelopes return when that did not occur when instead they heard her saying daddy will help you have a lie down christian darling he gave his attention to lynley for a moment as christian pounded down the stairs and across the sitting room towards the kitchen she isnt well rodger said you know as well as i that she shouldnt be leaving this house i hold you responsibleboth of you helenif anything happens were merely going to the fitzwilliam museum lady helen replied sounding for all the world like a model of reason what on earth could possibly happen to her there daddy christian flung himself into the room and crashed euphorically against his fathers legs read tilda to me now im warning you helen rodger said and stabbing a finger in lynleys direction im warning the both of you daddy read duty appears to be calling harry lady helen replied serenely youll find their pyjamas beneath the pillows on their beds and the book i know where the damn book is rodger snapped and took his children from the room oh dear lady helen murmured im afraid theres going to be hell to pay for this i dont think so lynley said harrys an educated man at the very least we know he can read cautionary verses lynley shook his head the handwriting on the wall after an hour we all managed to come to an agreement the strongest likelihood is that it was glass when i left pleasance was still holding out for his theory that it was a champagne or wine bottlepreferably fullbut hes fresh from graduate school and still attached to any opportunity to expatiate frankly i expect hes more attracted to the sound of his arguments than to their viability no wonder the head of forensicis it drake wants his neck in a noose forensic scientist simon allcourtst james joined barbara havers at her solitary table in the officers mess at cambridge police station for the past two hours hed been holed up at the regional police laboratory with the disputing parties of superintendent sheehans forensic team examining not only the xrays of elena weaver but the body itself and comparing his conclusions with those developed by the younger scientist in the cambridge group it was an activity that barbara had begged off attending the brief period during her police training that had been given to watching autopsies had more than sated whatever nugatory interest she may once have had in forensic medicine please note officers the forensic pathologist had intoned as he stood before the draped cart under which was the corpse that would be their object lesson that the mark of the ligature used in strangling this woman can still be plainly observed although our killer made what he apparently believed would be an ingenious attempt at obfuscation step closer please like idiotsor automatonsthe probationary dcs had done so and three of them had fainted dead away when with a tiny smile of malicious anticipation the pathologist whipped back the sheet to display the grisly remains of a body that had been saturated with paraffin and set afire barbara herself had remained on her feet but only just and she had never been in a tearing hurry to stand in on an autopsy from that time forward just bring me the facts she always thought when a body was carted away from a murder scene dont make me watch you gather them tea she asked st james as he lowered himself into one of the chairs adjusting his position to make allowances for the brace he wore on his left leg its fresh she gave a glance to her watch well okay only moderately fresh but its riddled with enough caffeine to paste your eyelids permanently open if youre feeling clapped out st james accepted the offer and ministered to his cup with three overlarge spoonfuls of sugar after a taste of it he added a fourth saying falstaff is my only defence barbara she lifted her cup to him cheers she said and watched him drink he was looking well she decided still too thin and angular still too lined about the face but there was an appealing sheen to the undisciplined dark hair and his hands on the table seemed utterly relaxed a man at peace with himself she thought and she wondered how long it had taken st james to achieve such psychic equilibrium he was lynleys oldest and closest friend an expert witness from london upon whose forensic services they had called more than once if not a wine bottleand there was one at the crime scene by the wayand not a champagne bottle then what was used to beat her she asked and why have the cambridge people been scrapping over this issue in the fi rst place a case of male posturing to my way of thinking st james replied the head of forensic is just over fifty hes been on the job for a good twentyfive years along comes pleasance twentysix years old and acting the upstart crow so what you have is men barbara said in simple conclusion why dont they just go outside and settle their dispute by seeing who can pee the farthest st james smiled not a bad idea ha women should run the world she poured herself more tea so why couldnt it have been a wine or champagne bottle the shape doesnt make a match were looking for something with a slightly broader curve making the connection between bottom and sides like this he cupped his right palm to form half an oval and the leather gloves wouldnt work for that curve for the curve perhaps but leather gloves of that weight wouldnt shatter a cheekbone in a single blow im not sure a heavyweight could even do that and from what you said the boy who owns the gloves isnt a heavyweight by any stretch of the imagination then what barbara asked a vase perhaps i dont think so whatever was used had some sort of handgrip and it was quite heavy enough to do maximum damage with minimum effort shed only been struck three times a handgrip that suggests the neck of a bottle which is why pleasance is continuing to propound his fullchampagnebottle theory despite compelling evidence to the contrary unless of course its the most oddly shaped champagne bottle on record st james removed a paper napkin from the table dispenser and roughed out a sketch saying what youre looking for is fl at on the bottom with a broad curve on the sides and i imagine a sturdy gripping neck he handed it over barbara studied the drawing this looks like one of those ships decanters she said pulling on her upper lip thoughtfully simon did someone cosh the girl in the face with the family waterford its as heavy as crystal st james replied but smoothsurfaced not cut solid as well and if thats the case its not a container of any sort what then he looked at the drawing which she placed between them i have no idea you wont go for something metal doubtful glassespecially if its smooth and heavyis the likelier substance when theres no trace evidence left behind need i ask if you were able to fi nd trace evidence where the cambridge team found none you neednt i didnt what a ballsup she sighed he didnt disagree rather he shifted position in his chair and said are you and tommy still intent on connecting the two killings thats an odd approach when the means are so different if youre working with the same killer why werent both victims gunned down she picked at the gelatinous surface of a cherry tart that was doing service as the edible portion of her afternoon tea were thinking that the motive determined the means in each killing the first motive was personal so it required a personal means a handson means beating then strangling yes if you will but the second murder wasnt personal at all just a need to eliminate a potential witness who could place the killer at crusoes island right at the time elena weaver was strangled a shotgun suffi ced to carry that out of course what the killer didnt know is that the wrong girl got shot a nasty business quite she speared a cherry it looked disturbingly like a large clot of blood shuddering she tapped it onto her plate and tried another but at least weve got a tab on the killer now and the inspectors gone to she stopped brow furrowed as lynley came through the swinging doors his overcoat slung over his shoulder and his cashmere scarf fl uttering round him like carmine wings he was carrying a large manila envelope lady helen clyde and another womanpresumably her sisterwere right behind him st james he said by way of greeting his friend im in your debt again thank you for coming you know pen of course he dropped his coat over the back of a chair as st james greeted penelope and brushed a kiss across lady helens cheek he pulled extra chairs over to their table as lynley introduced barbara to lady helens sister barbara watched him perplexed hed gone to the weaver house for information as soon as he had it his next step was supposed to be to make an arrest but clearly no arrest had been made something had taken him in another direction you havent brought her with you she asked i havent look at this from the envelope he took out a thin stack of photographs telling them about the canvas and the set of sketches that glyn weaver had given him there was dual damage to the painting he said someone had defaced it with great smears of colour and then fi nished the job with a kitchen knife weavers former wife assumed that the subject was elena and that justine had destroyed it she was wrong i take it barbara asked picking up the photographs and flipping through them each of them showed a different section of the canvas they were curious pieces some of them looking like nothing so much as double exposures in which one fi gure was superimposed over another they depicted various portraits of a female from childhood up to young adulthood what are these havers asked passing each photograph on to st james after she perused it infrared photographs and xrays lynley said pen can explain we did it at the museum penelope said they show what was originally on the canvas before it was smeared with paint there were at least five head studies in the group one of which was more than double the size of all the rest barbara puzzled her way through them saying odd sort of painting wouldnt you say not when you assemble them penelope said here ill show you lynley cleared away the tea debris piling the stainless steel teapot the cups the plates and the silverware onto a table nearby because of its size it could only be photographed in sections he explained to barbara pen went on when the sections are assembled it looks like this she laid the photographs out to form an incomplete rectangle from whose righthand corner a quadrilateral was missing what barbara saw on the table was a semicircle of four head studies of a growing girldepicted as a baby a toddler a child an adolescentand offset by the fi fth and larger head study of the young adult if this isnt elena weaver barbara said then who its elena all right lynley said her mother was dead on the money about that where she went wrong was in the rest of the scenario she saw sketches and a painting hidden in weavers study and reached a logical conclusion based upon her knowledge that he dabbled in art but obviously this isnt dabbling barbara looked up saw that he was removing another photograph from the envelope she held her hand out for it put it into the empty spot at the bottom righthand corner and looked at the artists signature like the woman herself it was not flamboyant just the simple word gordon in thin strokes of black full circle he said so much for coincidence she replied if we can just connect her to some sort of weapon were starting to fly home free lynley looked at st james as lady helen gathered the pictures into a neat stack and replaced them in the folder what did you come up with he asked glass st james said a wine bottle no not the right shape barbara went to the table where lynley had stacked their tea things and rooted through them to find the drawing st james had made she pulled it from beneath the teapot and tossed it their way it fell to the fl oor lady helen picked it up looked at it shrugged and handed it to lynley what is it he asked it looks like a decanter my thought as well barbara said simon says no why it needs to be solid heavy enough to shatter a bone with one blow damn and blast lynley said and fl ipped it to the table penelope leaned forward drew the paper towards her tommy she said thoughtfully you know i cant be certain but this looks awfully like a muller a muller lynley asked havers said what the dickens is that a tool penelope said its what an artist first uses when hes making his own paint sarah gordon lay on her back and fi xed her eyes on the ceiling in her bedroom she studied the patterns made in the plaster urging out of the subtle swirls and indentations the silhouette of a cat the gaunt face of an old woman the wicked grin of a demon it was the only room of the house on whose walls she had hung no decoration establishing in it a monastic simplicity that she had believed would be conducive to the flights of imagination that had always in the past led her to creation they led her only to memory now the thud the crunch the crushing of bone the blood unexpectedly hot when it flew up from the girls face to speckle her own and the girl herself elena sarah turned on her side and drew the woollen blanket closer round her curling herself into a foetal position the cold was intolerable shed kept a fi re burning downstairs for most of the day and shed turned the heat up as far as it would go but still she couldnt escape the chill it seemed to seep from the walls and the fl oor and the bed itself like an insidious contagion determined to have her and as the minutes passed the cold became ever more the victor as her body convulsed with new spasms of shivering a small fever she told herself the weathers been bad one cant expect to remain unaffected by the damp the fog or the icedriven wind but even as she repeated key wordsdamp fog and windlike a hypnotic chant designed to focus her thoughts on the narrowest most bearable and acceptable pathway the single part of her mind that she had been unable to discipline from the very beginning forced elena weaver forward again shed come to grantchester two afternoons a week for two months rolling up the drive on her ancient bicycle with her long hair tied back to keep it out of her face and her pockets fi lled with contraband treats to slip to flame when she thought sarah was least likely to notice scruffdog she called him and she tugged affectionately on his lopsided ears bent her face to his and let him lick her nose wha d i have for lil scruffs she said and she laughed when the dog snuffed at her pockets his tail thumping happily his front paws digging at the front of her jeans it was a ritual with them generally carried out on the drive where flame dashed out to meet her barking a frantic delighted greeting that elena claimed she could feel vibrating through the air then shed come inside slinging off her coat untying her hair shaking it out smiling her hello a little embarrassed if sarah happened to have caught her in the act of greeting the dog with such an open display of affection she seemed to feel it wasnt quite adult of her to love an animal especially one that she didnt even own ready shed say in that halfswallowed manner that made the word sound much more like rehy she seemed shy at fi rst when tony brought her by those few nights to model for the lifedrawing class but it was only the initial reserve of a young woman conscious of her difference from others and even more conscious of how that difference might somehow contribute to others discomfort once she sensed anothers ease in her presenceat least once shed sensed sarahs easeshe herself grew more forthright and she began to chat and to laugh melding into the environment and the circumstances as if shed always been a part of them she hopped onto the tall stool in sarahs studio at precisely half past two on those free afternoons her eyes danced round the room scouting out whatever pieces had been worked on or were new since her last visit and always she talked she was at heart so like her father in that you never married sarah even her choice of topics was the same as her fathers except unlike his her question came out more like you ner mahweed sehah and it was a moment before sarah mentally worked through the careful if distorted syllables to comprehend their meaning no i never did why sarah examined the canvas on which she was working comparing it to the lively creature perched atop the stool and wondering if she would ever be able to capture completely that quality of energy which the girl seemed to exude even in reposeholding her head at an angle with her hair sweeping round and the light glancing off it like sun hitting summer wheatshe was electric and alive restless and questioning she seemed eager for experience anxious to understand i suppose i thought a man might get in my way sarah replied i wanted to be an artist everything else was secondary my da wans to be an arist as well indeed he does is he good dyou think yes an dyou like him this last with her eyes riveted on sarahs face it was only so that she could easily read the answer sarah told herself but still she said abruptly of course i like all my students i always have done youre moving elena please put your head back as it was she watched the girl reach her toe forward and rub it along the top of flames head where he lay on the floor anticipating the treat he hoped would fall from her pocket she waited breath held for the moments question about tony to pass it always did for elena excelled at recognising boundaries which went far to explain why she also excelled at obliterating most of them she grinned said sorry sarah and resumed her position while sarah herself escaped from the girls scrutiny by going to the stereo and switching it on dadll be sprised when he sees this elena said when cn i see it when its done position again elena damn were losing light and afterwards with the easel covered and the music playing theyd sit in the studio and have their tea shortbread which elena slipped into flames eager mouthhis tongue lapping bits of sugar from her fingerstarts and cakes that sarah made from recipes shed not thought about in years as they munched and talked the music continued and sarahs fi ngers tapped its rhythm against her knee whas it like elena asked her casually one afternoon what she nodded towards one of the speakers that she said you know that the music whas it like sarah dropped her gaze from the girls earnest eyes and looked at her hands as the haunting mystery of vollenweiders electric harp and moog synthesiser challenged her to answer the music rising and falling each note like a crystal she thought about how to reply for such a length of time that elena fi nally said sorry i jus thought sarah raised her head quickly saw the girls distress and realised that elena thought she herself was embarrassed by being accosted with an unthinking act of mentioning a disability as if elena had asked her to look upon a disfigurement shed prefer to avoid seeing she said oh no its not that elena i was trying to decidehere come with me and she took her first to stand by the speaker turning the sound up full volume she placed her hand against it elena smiled percussion sarah said those are the drums and the bass the low notes you can feel them cant you when the girl nodded pulling on her lower lip with her chipped front teeth sarah looked round the room for something else she found it in the soft camel hairs of dry fine brushes the cool sharp metal of a clean pallet knife the smooth cold glass of turpentine in a jar all right she said here this is what it sounds like as the music changed shifted and swelled she played it against the girls inner arm where the flesh was tender and most sensitive to touch electric harp she said and with the pallet knife she tapped the light pattern of notes against her skin and now a fl ute this was the brush in a wavering dance and this the background elena its synthetic you see hes not using an instrument its a machine that makes musical sounds like this just one note now while all the rest are playing and she rolled the jar smoothly in one long line all at once it happens elena asked yes all at once she gave the girl the pallet knife she herself used the brush and the jar and as the record continued to play they made the music together while all the time above their heads on a shelf not five feet away sat the muller that sarah would use to destroy her now on her bed in the dim afternoon light sarah clutched the blanket and tried to stop quaking there had been no other alternative she thought there was no other way that he might learn to face the truth but she herself had to live with the horror of it all for the rest of her life she had liked the girl shed moved beyond sorrow eight months ago into a limbo in which nothing could touch her so that when she heard the car on the drive flames answering bark and the footsteps approaching she felt nothing at all okay i accept the fact that the muller looks like a go for the weapon havers said as they watched the panda car pull away from the kerb taking lady helen and her sister home but we know that elena was dead round half past six inspector at least she was dead round half past six if we can trust what rosalyn simpson said and i dont know about you but i think we can and even if rosalyn wasnt definite about the time she reached the island she knows for certain that she got back to her room by half past seven so if she did make an error its probably in the other direction putting the killing earlier not later and if sarah gordonwhose account is supported by two of her neighbours mind youdidnt leave her house until just before seven she squirmed in her seat to face lynley tell me how was she in two places at once at home having her wheetabix in grantchester at the same time as she was on crusoes island lynley guided the bentley out of the car park and slid it into the spotty traffi c heading southeast on parkside youre assuming that when her neighbours saw her leaving at seven it was the first time she left that morning he said which is exactly what she wanted us to assume exactly what she wanted her neighbours to assume but by her own account she was up that morning not long after fi veand she would have had to tell the truth about that because one of the very same neighbours who saw her leaving at seven might well have seen her lights on earlier and told us about that so i think its safe to conclude that she had plenty of time to make another earlier trip to cambridge but why go a second time if she wanted to play discoverer of the body once rosalyn saw her why not just head out to the police station right then she couldnt lynley said she had no real choice in the matter she had to change her clothes havers stared at him blankly right well im a real looby then what have clothes got to do with it blood st james responded lynley nodded at his friend in the rearview mirror before saying to havers she could hardly go dashing into the police station to report having found a body if she was wearing a tracksuit whose jacket front was spotted with the victims blood then why even go to the police station at all she had to place herself at the crime scene just in casewhen the news broke about elena weavers deathrosalyn simpson remembered what she had seen and went to the police as you said yourself she had to play discoverer of the body so that even if rosalyn had been able to give the police an accurate description of the woman shed seen that morning even if the description led the local cid to sarah gordonas it might have done once anthony weaver got wind of itwhy on earth would anyone conclude that she had been to the island twice why on earth would anyone conclude that shed kill a girl go home change her clothes and return right sir so why the hell did she to hedge her bets st james said in case rosalyn got to the police before she got to rosalyn if she was wearing different clothes from those rosalyn had seen the killer wear lynley went on and if one or more of her neighbours could verify that she hadnt left her house till seven why would anyone think she was the killer of a girl whod died round a half hour earlier but rosalyn said that the woman she saw had light hair sir it was practically the only thing she remembered quite a scarf a cap a wig why bother with that so that elena would think she was seeing justine lynley circled through the roundabout at lensfield road before he continued time has been the issue that weve stumbled over from the first sergeant because of it weve spent two days following an assortment of blind leads about sexual harassment pregnancy unrequited love jealousy and illicit affairs when we should have recognised the single point of similarity which everyone shares both of the victims and every last suspect all of them can run but everyone can run and with an apologetic glance at st james who in his best moments could only manage a moderate hobble i mean generally speaking lynley nodded grimly thats exactly my point generally speaking havers gave a sigh of frustration im getting flummoxed i see means i see opportunity but i dont see motive it seems to me that if anyone was going to get beat up and strangled by anyone else in this caseand if sarah gordon did itit doesnt make sense that the victim was elena when our justine is the far better bet look at the facts not bothering to consider that it probably took sarah half an age to paint it in the first place that portrait was probably worth hundreds of pounds possibly more although what i dont know about the value of art could fill a goodsized libraryand justine destroyed it having a bit of a tantrum some real splatter and slash on an original oil sounds like a motive for something if you ask me and mind you it wasnt a bit of dabbling by her husband that she was venting her feelings on but the real thing by a real artist with a real reputation even weaver himself couldnt have been too chuffed by that as a matter of fact he might have been the one to do the killing once he saw what shed done to the picture so why bag elena her voice became thoughtful unless of course justine didnt do the slashing at all unless elena herselfis that what youre thinking inspector lynley didnt reply instead just before they reached the bridge that crossed the river on fen causeway he pulled off the road and onto the pavement leaving the motor running he turned to the others and said ill just be a moment ten steps from the bentley he was enveloped by the fog he didnt cross the street to look at the island for a third time he knew it had no further secrets to reveal from the causeway he knew he would see the shapes of trees the mistwashed form of the footbridge that crossed the river and perhaps the etching of birds on the water he would see coe fen as an opaque screen of grey and that would be all if the lights of peterhouse managed to cut through the vast and tenebrous expanse of fog on this day they would be mere pinpricks less substantial than stars even whistler he thought would have found it a challenge for the second time he walked to the end of the causeway bridge where the iron gate stood and for the second time he made note of the fact that anyone running along the lower river from queensor from st stephens would have three options upon reaching fen causeway a turn to the left and she would run past the department of engineering a turn to the right and she would head towards newnham road or as he had seen for himself on tuesday afternoon she could proceed straight ahead crossing the street to where he now stood ducking through the gate and continuing south along the upper river what he had failed to consider on tuesday afternoon was that someone running into the city from the opposite direction would have had three options as well what he had failed to consider on tuesday afternoon was that someone could have run in the opposite direction in the first place starting from the upper rather than the lower river and hence following the upper rather than the lower path on which elena weaver had been running on the morning of her death he observed this upper path now noting how it disappeared into the fog like a thin line of pencil as on monday visibility was poorperhaps less than twenty feetbut the river and hence the path next to it flowed due north at this particular section with scarcely a bend or a wrinkle to cause a walker or a runnereither of them familiar with the lay of the landany need for marked hesitation a bicycle came wheeling towards him out of the mist a headlamp affixed to the tenspeeds handlebars providing a weak beam of light not much wider than an index fi nger when the ridera young bearded man wearing a rakish trilby as an odd accent piece to his faded jeans and black oilskin jacketdismounted to open the gate lynley spoke to him where does this path lead making an adjustment to his hat the young man looked back over his shoulder as if a perusal of the path would help him answer the question thoughtfully he pulled on the end of his beard along the river for a bit how far couldnt say for certain i always pick it up round newnham driftway ive never headed in the other direction does it go to grantchester this path no mate it doesnt go there blast lynley frowned at the river realising that he might have to reassess what he had thought of as a plausible explanation for how elena weavers death had been orchestrated on monday morning but you can get there from here if youve a mind for the walk the young man said perhaps anticipating that lynley was anxious for a fogdampened stroll he slapped a spattering of mud from his jeans and waved his arm vaguely from south to southwest down the river path theres a car park just past lammas land if you cut through there and nip down eitsley ave theres a public footpath that goes through the fields its posted well enough and itll take you straight to grantchester although he eyed lynleys fine overcoat and his handtooled lobbs shoes i dont know if id try it in the fog if you dont know the route you could end up doing nothing but thrashing round in the mud lynley found his excitement quickening as the young man spoke the facts were going to support him after all how far is it he asked the car parks under half a mile i should guess i mean grantchester itself if you go through the fi elds mile and a half mile and threequarters no more than that lynley looked back at the path at the untroubled surface of the sluggish river timing he thought it all centred round timing he returned to the car well havers said she wouldnt have driven her car on the first trip lynley said she couldnt have taken the risk that one of her neighbours might see her leavingas two did later in the morningor that anyone might see it parked near the island havers looked in the direction from which hed just come so she walked in on a footpath but she must have had to run like the devil all the way back he reached for his pocket watch and unhooked it from his waistcoat who was itmrs stamfordwho said she was in a tearing hurry when she left at seven at least now we know why she had to fi nd the body before anyone else did he fl ipped the watch open and handed it to havers time the drive to grantchester sergeant he said he slid the bentley into the traffi c which although slowmoving was sparse at this time of afternoon they descended the gentle slope of the causeway and after one quick pause when an oncoming car veered into their lane in order to avoid hitting a postal van that was parked half on the pavement with its hazard lights blinking they made their way into the newnham road roundabout from there traffic diminished noticeably and although the fog was still thickswirling round the granta king pub and a small thai restaurant as if it were being stagemanaged to do solynley was able to increase his speed marginally time he asked thirtytwo seconds so far she pivoted in her seat so that she faced him again the watch still in her hand but shes not a runner sir not like the rest of them which is why it took her nearly thirty minutes to get home change her clothes load her car and get back to cambridge its little more than a mile and a half over the field to grantchester he said a distance runner could have done the same course in less than ten minutes and had sarah gordon been a runner georgina higginshart wouldnt have needed to die because she would have got home changed clothes and returned in good enough time that even if rosalyn described her accurately she could have said that she was stumbling off the island after having discovered the body right he drove on she examined the watch fiftytwo seconds they drove along the west side of lammas land a broad green of picnic tables and play areas that sprawled for threequarters of the length of newnham road they swung through the dogleg where newnham became barton and spun past a line of dismal pensioners flats past a church past a steamywindowed laundrette past the newer brick buildings of a city in the midst of economic growth one minute fifteen havers said as they made the turn south towards grantchester lynley looked in the rearview mirror at st james the other man had picked up the material which pen had assembled at the fitzwilliam museumwelcomed by her former colleagues with the sort of delight one expects to greet only visiting royaltyand he was fl ipping through the xrays and the infrared photographs in his usual deliberate and thoughtful fashion st james lynley asked whats the best part of loving deborah st james raised his head slowly he looked surprised lynley understood considering their history these were straits which they did not generally navigate thats an unusual question to ask a man about his wife have you ever considered it st james glanced out the window where two elderly womenone supporting herself by means of an aluminum walkerwere making their way towards a crampedlooking green grocers where an outdoor display of fruit and vegetables wore a sequin covering of mist orange string sacks dangled limply from their arms i dont think i have st james said but i suppose its that feeling of being thoroughly struck by life feeling alive not just being alive i cant merely go through the motions with deborah i cant make do she doesnt allow it she demands my best she engages my soul he looked into the mirror once again lynley caught his gaze sombre thoughtful it seemed at odds with his words thats what i would imagine lynley said why because shes an artist the last buildingsa row of old terrace houseson the outskirts of cambridge melted away enclosed by the fog country hedges replaced them dusty grey hawthorn preparing for winter havers looked at the watch two minutes thirty seconds she said the road was narrow undivided and unmarked it swept past fields where a nimbus seemed to rise from the land creating a solid twodimensional mousecoloured canvas on which nothing was drawn if farm buildings existed somewhere in the distance round which a farmer worked and animals grazed the heavy fog hid them they drove into grantchester passing a man in tweeds and black wellingtons who was watching his collie explore the verge as he himself leaned heavily on a cane mr davies and mr jeffries havers said doing their usual number i expect as lynley slowed through the turn into the high street she examined the face of the watch again using her fingers to help her with her calculations she said five minutes thirtyseven seconds and jerked forward in her seat with a whoa whatre you doing sir when lynley abruptly applied the brakes a metallic blue citroën was parked squarely in the drive of sarah gordons house seeing it with the mist lapping at its tyres lynley said wait here and got out of the bentley he pressed the door closed to shut it without sound and walked the remaining distance to the remodelled school the curtains on the front panel of windows were closed the house itself seemed calm and uninhabited one minute he was here in the house talking to me the next moment he was gone i expect hes out there somewhere in the fog trying to think what hes going to do next what had she called it moral obligation versus cockthrobbing lust it was on fi rst and superficial glance as much an inadvertent reference to the demise of her own marriage as it was an assessment of her former husbands dilemma but it was more than that for while glyn weaver saw her words as relating to weavers duty towards a daughters death versus his continuing desire for a beautiful wife lynley was certain now that they had another application one of which glyn could not possibly be aware one which was presented pellucidly in the simple form of a car in a driveway i knew him for a time we were close hes always had trouble when it comes to confl ict lynley approached the car and found it locked it was also empty save for a small tan and white carton that lay partially open on the passenger seat lynley froze momentarily when he saw it his eyes snapped to the house then back to the carton and the three red cartridges that were sliding out of it he jogged back to the bentley whats before havers could fi nish the question he switched off the ignition and turned to st james theres a pub just a bit beyond the house on the left he said go there phone the cambridge police tell sheehan to get out here no sirens no lights but tell him to come armed inspector anthony weavers in her house lynley said to havers hes got a shotgun with him they waited until st james had disappeared into the fog before they turned back to the house some ten yards beyond them in the high street what do you think havers said that we cant afford to wait for sheehan he peered back the way they had come into the village the old man and the dog were just ambling round the bend in the road theres a footpath somewhere that she had to have used on monday morning he said and it seems to me that if she got out of her house without being seen she cant have left the front way so he looked back at the house and then again down the road this way they set off on foot in the direction from which they had just driven but they hadnt gone more than five yards when the old man and the dog accosted them the man raising his cane and poking it at lynleys chest tuesday he said you lot were here tuesday i remember that sort of thing you know norman davies good with my eyes i am christ havers muttered the dog sat at attention at mr davies side ears pricked forward and an expression of friendly anticipation on his face mr jeffries and ithis with a nod at the dog who seemed to dip his head politely at the sound of his namehave been out for an hour nowmr jeffries having a bit of a time answering the calls of nature at his advanced ageand we saw you pass didnt we mister and i said those folks have been here before and im right arent i i dont forget things wheres the footpath to cambridge lynley asked without ceremony the man scratched his head the collie scratched his ear footpath you ask you cant be meaning to take a walk in this fog i know what youre thinking if mr jeffries and i are out in it why not you two but were out taking a ramble in order to see to the necessary otherwise wed be snug inside he gestured with his cane to a small thatched cottage just across the street when we arent out seeing to the necessary we mostly sit in our own front window not that we spy on the village mind you but we like to have a look at the high street now and again dont we mr jeffries the dog panted agreeably lynley felt his hands itch with the need to grab the old man by the lapels of his coat the footpath to cambridge he said mr davies rocked back and forth in his wellingtons just like sarah arent you she used to walk to cambridge most days didnt she i had my constitutional this morning already shed say when mr jeffries and i would stop by of an afternoon and ask her out on a ramble with us and id say to her sarah anyone as attached to cambridge as you are ought to live there just to save yourself the walk and shed say im planning on it mr davies just give me a bit of time he chuckled and settled into his story by digging his cane into the ground two or three times a week she was heading over the fields and she never took that dog of hers with her which frankly is something i have never been able to understand now flamethats her dog doesnt get near enough exercise to my way of thinking so mr jeffries and i would wheres the bloody path havers snarled the man started he pointed down the road just there on broadway they set off immediately only to hear him call you might express some appreciation you know folks never do think the fog shrouded his body and muffl ed his voice as they rounded the bend where the high street became broadway as misnamed as a country lane could possibly be narrow and thickly hedged on either side just beyond the last cottage not twotenths of a mile past the old school a wooden kissing gategreen with its growth of winter mosshung from rusty hinges at a lopsided angle its corner in the mud a large english oak spread its branches above it partially hiding a metal sign that was posted on a pole nearby public footpath it said cambridge miles the gate opened onto pasture land thick and lush with grass that bent under the weight of the days heavy fall of moisture drops showered their trouser legs and their shoes as they hurried down the track that ran along the rear garden fences and walls which marked the property boundaries of the cottages along the high street of the village dyou really think she made a hike into cambridge in fog like this havers asked jogging at lynleys side and then ran back without getting lost she knew the way he said you can see the path itself well enough and it probably skirts the fields rather than heads across them if you were familiar with the lay of the land you could probably do it blindfolded or in the dark she finished for him the rear garden of the old school was contained by a barbed wire fence rather than a wall it consisted of a vegetable garden gone extensively to seed and an overgrown lawn beyond this was the back door of the house set above three steps on the top one of these stood sarah gordons mongrel pawing at the bottom of the door giving a low worried whine hes going to set up a row the moment he sees us havers said that depends on his nose and his memory lynley replied he gave a soft whistle the dogs head darted up lynley whistled again the dog gave two rapid barks damn havers said and bounded down the steps he trotted briskly across the lawn to the fence one ear perked up and the other drooping over his forehead hello flame lynley extended his hand the dog sniffed and examined and began wagging his tail were in lynley said and slipped through the barbed wire flame leaped up with a single yelp eager to say hello he planted muddy paws on the front of lynleys coat lynley grabbed him lifted him and turned back to the fence as the dog licked his face and squirmed in delight he handed the animal over to havers and pulled off his own muffl er put this through his collar he said use it as a lead but i weve got to get him out of here sergeant hes willing to say hello but i doubt hes willing to sit on the back step quietly while we slip into the house havers was struggling with the animal who seemed to be mostly tongue and legs lynley looped his muffler through flames leather collar and handed the ends to havers as she set the dog on the ground take him to st james he said what about you she looked towards the house and came up with an answer that she clearly didnt like she said you cant go in there alone inspector you cant go in at all you said hes armed and if thats the case get out of here sergeant now he turned away from her before she could speak again and in a crouch quickly crossed the lawn on the far side of the house lights were on in what had to be sarah gordons studio but the rest of the windows stared blankly into the fog the door was unlocked the knob was cold wet and slippery in his hand but it turned without a sound admitting him into a service porch beyond which was the kitchen where cupboards and work tops threw long shadows across the white linoleum fl oor somewhere in the gloom nearby a cat mewled the sound was followed a moment later by the appearance of silk slithering in from the sitting room like a professional housebreaker the cat paused abruptly when he saw lynley in the doorway scrutinising him with an undaunted stare then he leapt onto one of the work tops where he sat with egyptianlike tranquillity his tail curling round his front feet lynley walked past himhis eyes on the cat the cats eyes on himand edged to the door which led into the sitting room like the kitchen the room was empty and with the curtains drawn it was filled with shadows and illuminated only by what little daylight made its way through the curtains and through a small chink that kept those same curtains from being completely closed a fire was burning low in the fi replace hissing gently as wood turned to ash a small log rested next to this on the floor as if sarah gordon had been in the act of adding it to the others that were already burning when anthony weaver had arrived to interrupt her lynley shed his overcoat and passed through the sitting room he entered the corridor that led to the rear of the house ahead of him the door to the studio was partially closed but light streamed out from the narrow aperture in a transparent triangle on the bleached oak fl oor he heard the murmur of their voices fi rst sarah gordon was talking her voice was drained she sounded exhausted no tony that isnt how it was then tell me damn you in contrast weavers voice was hoarse youve forgotten havent you you never asked me to return the key oh god yes after you ended things between us i thought at first that youd simply overlooked the fact that i could still get into your rooms then i decided you must have changed the locks because that would have been easier for you than asking me to give the key back and risking another scene between us then later ia lifeless brief laugh sounding mostly selfdirectedi actually started to believe that you were just waiting until youd secured the penford chair before youd phone and ask me to meet you again and id need the key for that wouldnt i how can you think what happened between usall right what i made happen between ushad anything to do with the penford chair because you cant lie to me tony not at the heart of things no matter how much you lie to yourself and to everyone else this is about the chair it always was it always will be you merely used elena as an excuse that was nobler in your mind and far more attractive than academic greed better to end your affair with me because of your daughter than because you might lose a promotion if everyone knew you walked out on your second wife for another woman it was elena elena you know it oh tony dont please not now you never tried to understand anything about us shed finally begun to forgive me sarah shed finally begun to accept justine we were building something together the three of us were a family she needed that you needed it you wanted the appearance it offered to your public i stood to lose her if i left justine theyd started to develop a relationship together and if i left justinejust as id left glyni stood to lose elena for good and elena came fi rst she had to his voice grew louder as he moved in the room she came to our home sarah she saw what a loving marriage could be like i couldnt destroy thati couldnt betray what she believed about usby leaving my wife so you destroyed what was best about me instead it was after all the more convenient thing to do i had to keep justine i had to accept her terms for the penford chair no god damn you i did it for elena for my daughter for elena but you could never see that you didnt want to see it you didnt want to think i could possibly feel anything beyond narcissism selfinterest in answer metal slid savagely against metal it was the unmistakable sound of a round being chambered within a shotgun lynley moved to within two inches of the studio door but both weaver and sarah gordon stood outside his line of vision he tried to gauge their positions by listening to their voices he rested one hand lightly against the wood i dont think you really want to shoot me tony sarah gordon was saying any more than you want to hand me over to the police in either case a scandal will come crashing down round you and i dont think you want that not after everything thats happened already between us you killed my daughter you phoned justine from my rooms on sunday night you arranged that elena would run alone and then you killed her elena you killed elena your creation tony yes i killed elena she never touched you or hurt you she never even knew that you and i were lovers no she never knew i was good about that i kept my promise i never told her she died thinking you were devoted to justine and thats what you wanted her to think isnt it isnt that what you wanted everyone to think although enormously weary her voice was more clearly defined than his she would lynley thought be facing the door he pressed on it gently it swung inward a few more inches he could see the edge of weavers tweed coat he could see the gunstock resting at his waist how could you bring yourself to it you met her sarah you knew her she sat in this room and let you sketch her and pose her and talk to her and his voice caught on a sob and she said and tony and she gave a small painstricken laugh when he didnt respond and paint her thats how the story goes but it doesnt end there justine made certain of that no yes my creation tony the only copy just like elena i tried to tell you how sorry sorry sorry for the first time her own voice broke i had to accept her terms once she knew about us i had no choice neither did i so you murdered my daughtera human being flesh and blood not a lifeless piece of canvasto get your revenge i didnt want revenge i wanted justice but i wasnt going to get it in a court of law because the painting was yours my gift to you what did it matter how much of myself id put into it because it no longer belonged to me i had no case so i had to balance the scales myself as im about to do now there was movement in the room sarah gordon passed in line with the door her hair matted her feet bare she was wrapped in a blanket her face was colourless even to her lips your cars in the drive no doubt someone saw you arrive how do you intend to get away with killing me i dont particularly care about the scandal oh but there wont be much of one will there youre the grieving father driven to violence by his daughters death she straightened her shoulders and faced him directly you know i think you ought to thank me for killing her with public opinion so much on your side youre guaranteed the chair now damn you but how on earth will you manage to pull the trigger without justine here to steady the gun ill manage it believe me i will with pleasure he took a step towards her weaver lynley shouted and at the same instant threw open the door weaver whirled in his direction lynley dived for the floor the gun discharged a deafening explosion roared through the room the stench of gunpowder filled the air a cloud of blueblack smoke seemed to rise out of nowhere through it he could see sarah gordons crumpled form not five feet away from him prone on the fl oor before he could go to her he saw rather than heard the click and slither of metal once again as weaver reloaded he surged to his feet a moment before the history professor turned the gun awkwardly on himself lynley leapt at the other man shoving the gun to one side it discharged a second time just as the front door to the house was kicked open half a dozen men from the police firearms unit stormed down the corridor and into the studio guns extended ready to fi re hold off lynley shouted over the tremendous ringing in his ears and indeed there was no need for further violence for weaver sank dully onto one of the stools he removed his spectacles and dropped them to the floor he crushed their lenses i had to do it he said for elena it was the same crimescene team that had done the honours at georgina higginsharts death they arrived only minutes after the ambulance had roared off towards the hospital cutting a wide path through the curious who had gathered in a cluster at the foot of the drive where mr davies and mr jeffries were holding court proud to name themselves fi rst at the scene proud to be able to announce to all listeners that theyd known something was wrong the minute theyd seen that plump little lady leading flame towards the pub sarahd never give flame to just anyone he said and him not even on his lead i knew there was something wrong the minute i saw that didnt i mr jeffries in other circumstances mr davies continued presence might have been irksome to lynley but as it was the man was a godsend for sarah gordons dog knew him recognised his voice and was willing to go with him even when his owner was carried out of the house swathed in temporary bandages with a pressure pack applied to stop arterial bleeding ill take the cat as well mr davies said as he shuffled down the drive with flame in tow not much for cats mr jeffries and i but we wont want to see the poor thing go begging for somewhere to lodge till sarah comes home he gazed uneasily in the direction of her house where several members of the fi rearms unit stood talking together shes coming home sarah is isnt she shell be all right shell be all right but shed taken the shot straight on in her right arm and from the look the ambulance attendants had given the extent of the damage lynley wondered how all right would be defined he walked back to the house from the studio he could hear the sound of sergeant havers sharp questions and anthony weavers deadened responses he could hear the crimescene team gathering evidence a cupboard closed and st james said to superintendent sheehan this is the muller but lynley didnt join them instead he went into the sitting room and studied a few of the pieces of sarah gordons work that hung on the walls five young blacksthree crouched two standinground a doorway in one of londons most disastrous tower blocks an old chestnut seller hawking his product outside the underground in leicester square as wellfurred and wellgarbed theatregoers passed him by a miner and his wife in the kitchen of their tumbledown welsh cottage some artists he knew make their work a mere showcase for a clever technique in which little is risked and less is communicated some artists merely become experts in their medium working clay or stone or wood or paint as proficiently and effortlessly as an ordinary craftsman and some artists try to make something out of nothing order out of chaos demanding of themselves that they ably communicate structure and composition colour and balance and that each piece they create serve to communicate a predetermined issue as well a piece of art asks people to stop and look in a world of moving images if people take the time to pause before canvas bronze glass or wood a worthy effort is one which does something more than act as nonverbal panegyric to the talents of its creator it doesnt call for notice it calls for thought sarah gordon he saw was that kind of artist she had played her passions out on canvas and stone it was only when she had tried to play them out in life that she had failed inspector sergeant havers entered the room with his eyes on the painting of pakistani children he said i dont know if he really intended to shoot her barbara he was threatening her yes but the gun may well have gone off accidentally ill have to say that in court it wont look pretty for him no matter what you say his culpability is moot all he needs is a decent lawyer and public sympathy perhaps but you did the best that you could she extended her hand in it she held a folded piece of white paper one of sheehans men found a shotgun in the boot of her car and weaver he had this thing with him he wouldnt talk about it though lynley took the paper from her and unfolded it to see a sketch a beautifully rendered tiger pulling down a unicorn the unicorns mouth opened in a soundless scream of terror and pain havers went on all he said was that he found it in an envelope in his rooms at the college when he went by yesterday to talk to adam jenn what do you make of it sir i remember that elena had posters of unicorns all over her walls but the tiger i dont get it lynley returned the paper to her its a tigress he said and fi nally understood why sarah gordon had reacted to his mention of whistler on the first day they had spoken to her it wasnt about john ruskins criticism nor was it about art or painting the night or the fog it was because of a woman who had been the artists mistress the unnamed milliner he had called la tigresse she was telling him that shed murdered his daughter havers jaw dropped she snapped it closed but why it was the only way to complete the circle of ruin theyd inflicted on each other he destroyed her creation and her ability to create she knew hed done so she wanted him to know that shed destroyed his justine met him at the front door hed only inserted his key into the lock when she opened it for him she was he saw still dressed for her working day and although she had worn the black suit and pearl grey blouse for at least thirteen hours now they remained unwrinkled she might have just put them on she looked beyond him to the receding lights of the panda car in the drive where have you been she asked wheres the citroën anthony where are your glasses she followed him to his study and stood in the doorway while he rooted through his desk for an old pair of hornrimmed spectacles that he hadnt used in years his woody allen specs elena had called them you look like a clod with those on dad he hadnt worn them again he looked up at the window in whose refl ection he could see himself and his wife behind him she was a lovely woman for the ten years of their marriage she had asked for little enough from him only that he love her only that he be with her and in return she had created this home into it she had welcomed his colleagues she had given him support she had believed in his career she had been perfectly loyal but she had not been able to give him that ineffable connection that exists between people when their souls are one as long as theyd had a mutual goal towards which they were workingscouting round for a house painting and decorating purchasing furniture looking at cars design ing a gardentheyd existed quite securely within the illusion of their ideal marriage he had even thought ive got a happy marriage this time round its regenerative devoted committed tender loving and strong were even the same astrological sign gemini the twins its as if we were meant for each other from birth but when the superficial commonalities had disappearedwhen the house had been purchased and furnished to perfection when the gardens had been planted and the sleek french cars sat shining in the garagehe had found himself left with an indefi nable emptiness and a sense of vague uneasy incompletion he wanted something more its the absence of an outlet for creativity he had thought ive spent more than twenty years of my life in dusty academia writing giving lectures meeting students climbing up its time to broaden my horizons and stretch my experience as in everything else she had supported him in this she did not join himshe had no abiding interest in the artsbut she admired his sketches she mounted and framed his watercolours and she clipped out of the local newspaper the announcement of the class that sarah gordon would teach this is something you might like to take darling she had told him ive never heard of her myself but the paper says shes quite an astounding talent wouldnt it be wonderful for you to get to know a real artist that he felt was the greatest of the ironies that justine should have been the instrument of their acquaintance but then her having made him aware of sarah gordons presence in grantchester in the first place actually completed the circle of the story in a wellbalanced fashion justine after all was uniquely responsible for the final set of events in this obscene tragedy so it was only appropriate that she also would have been instrumental in setting in motion the initial events that began with a lifedrawing class in sarah gordons studio if its over between you get rid of the painting justine had said destroy it get it out of my life get her out of my life but it hadnt been enough when he defaced it with oils only its complete destruction would appease justines anger and assuage the pain of his infi delity and at only one time in only one place could this act of destruction be carried out in order to convince his wife of the sincerity with which he was putting an end to his affair with sarah so three times he had driven the knife through the canvas as justine looked on in the end however hed been unable to bring himself to leave the ruined painting behind if shed only been what i needed in the fi rst place none of this would have happened he thought if shed only been willing to open her heart if shed got in touch with her spirit if creating meant more to her than merely possessing if shed done more than just listen and appear sympathetic if shed had something to say about herself about life if shed tried to understand me at the deepest level of who and what i am wheres the citroën anthony justine repeated where are your glasses where on earth have you been its after nine oclock wheres glyn he asked having a bath and using most of the hot water in the house to do it shell be gone tomorrow afternoon id think you could manage to put up with her that much longer after all yes i know shes lost her daughter shes been crushed and devastated and i ought to be able to overlook everything she doesand every rotten thing she saysbecause of that fact well i wont buy it and youre a fool if you do then i suppose im a fool he turned from the window but thats something youve used to your advantage more than once isnt it a spot of deep ruby appeared on each of her cheeks were husband and wife we made a commitment we made vows in a church at least i did and ive never broken them i wasnt the one all right he said i know the room was too warm he needed to take off his coat he couldnt summon the will to do so she said where have you been what have you done with the car its at the police station they wouldnt allow me to drive it home theythe police whats happened whats going on nothing not any longer at least whats that supposed to mean she seemed to grow taller as some sort of realisation dawned upon her under the fi ne material of her suit he could imagine her muscles ripple and coil youve been with her again i can see it in your face you promised me anthony anthony you swore to me you said it was over it is believe me he left the study and headed for the sitting room he heard the sound of her high heels tapping along behind him then whathave you been in an accident have you wrecked the car are you hurt in some way hurt an accident there could be no greater truth he wanted to chuckle at the grim gallows humour she would always assume that he was victim not avenger she couldnt conceive that he might take matters into his own hands for once she couldnt conceive that he might fi nally act at his own behest without regard for opinion or condemnation any longer because he believed it was right to do so and why should she really when had he ever acted on his own before other than to walk out on glyn and hed paid for that decision for the last fi fteen years anthony answer me whats happened to you today i finished things finally he went into the sitting room anthony hed once thought the still lifes hanging above the sofa represented his very best work paint something that we can hang in the sitting room darling use colours that match he had done so apricots and poppies one could tell what they were at a single glance and isnt that what true art is all about an accurate duplication of reality hed taken them off the wall and carted them proudly to show her on the first night of class no matter that it was life drawing she was teaching he wanted her to know from the very start that he was a cut above all the rest raw talent just waiting for someone to mould him into the next manet shed surprised him from the fi rst perched on a stool in the corner of her studio she began by offering no instruction at all instead she talked she hooked her feet round the rungs of the stool put her elbows on her thoroughly paintspattered knees cupped her face in her hands so that her hair spilled through her fi ngers and talked at her side stood an easel holding an unfinished canvas depicting a man sheltering a touslehaired little girl she never pointed to it as she spoke it was clear that she expected they would make the connection youre not here to learn how to put paint on canvas she had said to the group there were six of them three elderly women in smocks and brogues the wife of an american serviceman with time on her hands a twelveyearold greek girl whose father was spending a year as a guest lecturer at the university and himself he knew at once that he was the serious student among them she seemed to be speaking directly to him any fool can make splatters and call it art she had said thats not what this course is all about youre here to put part of yourself on canvas to reveal who you are through your composition your choice of colour your sense of balance the struggle is to know whats been done before and to push beyond it the job is to select an image but to paint a concept i can give you techniques and methods but whatever you produce ultimately has to come from your self if you want to call it art and she smiled it was an odd bright smile completely without selfconscious affectation she couldnt have known that it wrinkled her nose in an unattractive fashion but if she did know she probably didnt care externals did not seem to have much importance to her if you have no real self or if you have no way of discovering it or if for some reason youre afraid to find out who and what it is then youll still manage to create something on canvas with your paints itll be pleasant to look at and a pleasure to you but itll be technique it wont necessarily be art the purposeour purposeis to communicate through a medium but in order to do that you must have something to say subtlety is the key she had told them a painting is a whisper it isnt a shout at the end of it all hed felt ashamed of his arrogance in having brought his watercolours to show her so confident of their having merit he resolved to slink unobtrusively out of the studio with them safely tucked in their protectiveand suitablebrown wrapping paper under his arm but he wasnt quick enough as the others filed out she said i see youve brought some of your work to show me dr weaver and she came to his worktable and waited while he unwrapped them feeling as he hadnt felt in years in a welter of nerves and completely outclassed shed gazed on them thoughtfully apricots and he felt his face grow hot oriental poppies ah she said and then quite briskly yes very nice nice but not art she turned her gaze to him it was friendly and frank he found it disconcerting to be engaged so directly by a womans eyes dont misunderstand me dr weaver these are lovely watercolours and lovely watercolours have a place but would you hang them on your wall i her gaze flickered under his then held quite firmly i tend to like a painting that challenges just a bit more its a matter of taste and these dont challenge she studied the watercolours once more she perched on the worktable and held the paintings on her knees first one then the other she pressed her lips together she blew out her cheeks i can take it you know he said with a chuckle that he realised was far more anxious than amused you can give it to me straight she took him at his word all right she said you can certainly copy heres the evidence of that but can you create it didnt hurt nearly as much as he thought it might try me he said she smiled a pleasure hed thrown himself into it for the next two years fi rst as a member of one class or another which she offered the community then later on as a private student alone with her in winter they used a live model in the studio in summer they took easels sketch pads and paints out into the country and worked off the land often they sketched each other as an exercise in understanding the human anatomythe sternocleidomastoid muscles tony she would say and put her fingertips to her neck try to think of them like cords right beneath the skin and always she filled the environment with music listen to me if you stimulate one sense you stimulate others she explained art cant be created if the artist himself is an insensate void see the music hear it feel it feel the art and the music would starta haunting array of celtic folktunes a beethoven symphony a salsa band an african mass called the missa luba the nerveshaving whine of electric guitars in the presence of her intensity and dedication hed begun to feel as if hed emerged from fortythree years of darkness to fi nd himself walking in sunlight at last he felt completely renewed he felt his interest engaged and his intellect challenged he felt emotions spring to life and for six straight months before she became his lover he called it all the pursuit of his art there was after all a certain safety in that it did not beg an answer for the future sarah he thought and he marvelled at the fact that even nowafter everything even after elenahe could still wish to murmur the name that he hadnt allowed himself to say for the past eight months since justine had accused and he had confessed theyd pulled up to the old school on a thursday evening just at the time hed usually arrived the lights were on and a fire was burninghe could see its shifting glow through the drawn front curtainsand he knew that sarah was expecting him and that music would be playing and a dozen or more sketches would be strewn among the pillows on the fl oor and that she would come to meet him when the doorbell rang that she would run to meet him throw open the door and draw him inside saying tonio ive had the most marvellous idea about how to compose that picture of the woman in soho you know the one thats been making me wild for a week i cant do this he said to justine dont ask me to do this its going to destroy her i dont much care what its going to do to her justine replied and got out of the car she must have been passing the door when they rang the bell because she answered it just as the dog began to bark she called over her shoulder flame stop it its tony you know tony you silly thing and then she turned back to the door to the sight of them both he in the foreground and his wife in the background and the portrait wrapped in brown paper and held under his arm she didnt say anything she didnt even move she merely looked beyond him to where his wife stood and her face summed up the count of his sin betrayal works in two directions tonio shed said in the past and he understood that clearly when she dropped into place that insubstantial patina of breeding and civility that she actually believed was going to protect her tony she said anthony justine said they walked into the house flame trotted out of the sitting room with an old knotted sock between his teeth and he barked through it happily at the sight of a friend silk looked up from a doze by the fire and undulated his long serpent tail in lazy greeting now anthony justine said he lacked the will to do it to refuse even to speak he saw sarah look at the painting she said what have you brought me tonio as if justine were not standing at his side there was an easel in the sitting room and he unwrapped the painting and set it there he expected her to fly to it when she saw the great smears of red white and black that obscured the smiling faces of his daughter but instead she simply approached it slowly and she gave a low cry when she saw what she had to have known she would see on the bottom of the frame the little brass plaque the scrolled elena he heard justine move he heard her say his name and he felt her press the knife into his hand it was a sturdy vegetable knife shed taken it from the drawer in the kitchen of their house shed said get it out of my life get her out of my life youll do it tonight and ill be there to make sure he made the first cut in a blaze that mixed both anger and despair he heard sarah cry no tony and felt her fingers on his fist and saw the red of her blood when the knife slid across the back of her knuckles to carve a pathway through the canvas again and then the third cut but by that time she had backed away with her bleeding hand held like a child against her not crying because she wouldnt do that not in front of him not in front of his wife thats enough justine said she turned and left he followed her out he hadnt said a single word she had talked one night in class about the risk and the reward of making art personal of offering little hereandthere bits of ones essence to a public who might misunderstand ridicule or reject although he had listened dutifully to her words he had not understood the meaning behind them until he had seen her face when he destroyed the painting it wasnt a reaction to the weeks and months of effort it had taken her to complete it for him nor was it a response to his mutilation of a gift it was simply that three times he had driven the knife through what had represented to sarah the most singular manner in which she could show him compassion and love this was perhaps the greatest of his sins to have prompted the gift to have ripped it to pieces he took his watercoloursthose terribly safe apricots and poppiesfrom the wall above the sofa they left two darker spots on the wallpaper but that couldnt be helped no doubt justine would find something suitable to replace them she said what are you doing anthony answer me she sounded frightened finishing things he said he carried the paintings out into the hall and balanced one carefully thoughtfully on the tips of his fi ngers you can copy she said but can you create the last four days had given him the answer that two full years with her had failed to provide some people create others destroy he smashed the painting against the newel post at the foot of the stairway glass shattered and fell onto the parquet floor like crystal rain anthony justine grasped his arm dont those are your paintings theyre your art dont he smashed the second with even greater force he felt the pain of connecting with the wooden post shoot like a cannonball through his arm glass flew up at his face i have no art he said despite the cold barbara took her cup of coffee out into the ruined rear garden of her house in acton and sat down on the cold block of concrete that served as the back step she pulled her coat more closely round her and balanced the coffee cup on the top of one knee it was not black dark outsideit never could be when one was surrounded by several million people and a teeming metropolisbut the heavy night shadows still made the garden a less familiar place than was the inside of the house and thus a place less weighted down by the conflict that sprang from the opposing forces of guiltridden memory and simple necessity what kind of bond truly exists between a parent and child she wondered and at what point does it finally become necessary to break or perhaps redefine that bond and in either case is breaking or redefining even possible during the last ten years of her life she had grown to believe that she would never have children at first the realisation was a source of pain to her inextricably connected as it was to the knowledge that she would probably never marry she knew quite well that marriage was not a prerequisite for parenthood singleparent adoptions happened more and more and with her career finally off the ground she would be a serious contender in the pool of prospective single parents seeking a child should she volunteer for a hardtoplace child her success would be virtually guaranteed but perhaps too conventionally she had always seen parenthood as a joint venture between two partners and as the likelihood of a partner in her life grew more remote every year the distant possibility of becoming a mother grew more hazyedged more like a fantasy ungrounded even slightly in the reality of her circumstances it wasnt something she thought of very often most of the time she was simply too busy to dwell upon a future that felt like ice but while most people getting older experienced the growth of family and the increase in connection brought about by the ties of marriage and children her own family was steadily diminishing now and her own connections were being severed one by one her brother her father both dead and buried and now she faced the prospect of cutting the fi nal tie with her mother as well in the end life is all about seeking reassurance she thought were all engaged in looking for some kind of sign that will tell us were not really alone we want a bond an anchor that will hold us fast to a landmass of belonging somewhere of being close to someone of having something more than the clothes on our backs or the houses we live in or the cars that we drive and in the end we can only gain that reassurance through people no matter how we fill our lives with the trappings of a carefree independence we still want the bond because a vital connection with another human being always carries the potential to act as a viable approbation of the self if i am loved i am worthy if i am needed i am worthy if i maintain this relationship in the face of all difficulties i am somehow whole what indeed was the real difference between anthony weaver and herself wasnt her behaviourlike hisgoverned inherently by an anxiety that the world might withdraw its approval of her didnt her behaviourlike hismask a desperation which rose from the same insidious source guilt mum had a fine day today barbie mrs gustafson had said she started out a bit rough round the edges though at fi rst she wouldnt mind me at all and she kept calling me doris then she wouldnt eat her teacakes and she wouldnt have her soup when the postman came she thought it was your dad and she wouldnt let me hear the end of wanting to be off with him to majorca she said jimmy promised me majorca she said and when i wanted to tell her that it wasnt jimmy she tried to chuck me out the door but she fi nally settled down her hand fl uttered nervously upwards towards her wig like an indecisive bird and she touched her fi ngers to the stiff grey curls she hasnt wanted to go to the loo though i cant think why but the tellys on for her and shes been as good as gold for the last three hours barbara found her in the sitting room in her husbands tattered easy chair lolling back into the greasy indentation which his head had made over the years the television was roaring at a volume that accommodated mrs gustafsons failing hearing it was humphrey bogart and lauren bacall the film that had that line about whistling barbara had seen it at least a dozen times and she shut it off just as bacall made her fi nal shimmy across the room in bogarts direction barbara had always liked that moment best shed always liked its veiled promise of the future now shes all right barbie mrs gustafson said anxiously from the doorway you can see shes all right mrs havers was slumped to one side in the chair her mouth was slack her hands played with the hem of her dress which shed drawn up to the height of her thighs the air surrounding her was foetid with the odour of excrement and urine mum barbara said she didnt respond although she hummed four notes as if with the intention of beginning a song see how quiet and nice she can get mrs gustafson said she can be a real jewel can your mum when she wants on the floor just inches from her mothers feet the hose of the vacuum cleaner was curled into a coil whats that doing here barbara asked now barbie it does help keep her barbara felt something inside her give way like a dam that crumbles when it cannot contain the pressurebuild of standing water any longer didnt you even notice that shed messed herself she said to mrs gustafson she found it a miracle that her voice sounded so calm mrs gustafson blanched messed why barbie you must be mistaken i asked her twice she didnt want the loo cant you smell her havent you checked her have you left her alone mrs gustafsons lips quivered with a hesitant smile i can see youre feeling a bit put out barbie but if youve spent some time with her ive spent years with her ive spent my whole life with her i only meant to say thank you mrs gustafson you wont be needed again why i mrs gustafson clutched at the front of her dress approximately in the location of her heart after all ive done thats right barbara said now she stirred restlessly on the back step feeling the cold seeping through her trousers trying to force from her mind the image of her mother as flaccid as a rag doll in that chair reduced to inertia barbara had bathed her feeling struck to sadness at the sight and the feeling of her withered flesh she led her to bed tucked in the covers and turned out the light through it all her mother did not say a word she was like the living dead sometimes the right thing to do is also the most obvious thing to do lynley had said there was truth in that she had known from the first what had to be done what was right what was best what would serve her mother it was in the fear of being judged as a callous and indifferent childby what she knew was largely a callous and indifferent worldthat barbara had floundered waiting for direction instruction or permission that wasnt going to come the decision rested with her as it always had what she hadnt realised was that judgement rested with her as well she pushed herself off the step and went into the kitchen the smell of mouldy cheese was in the air there were dishes to be washed and a floor to be scrubbed and a dozen distractions to allow her to avoid the inevitable for at least another hour but shed been avoiding it since her fathers death in march she couldnt do so forever she went to the phone odd to think that shed memorised the number she must have known from the fi rst that shed be using it again the phone rang four times on the other end a pleasant voice said mrs flo here hawthorn lodge barbara spoke on a sigh this is barbara havers i wonder if you remember meeting my mother monday night lynley and havers arrived at st stephens college at half past eleven theyd spent the early part of the morning assembling their reports meeting with superintendent sheehan and discussing what sort of charges might be filed against anthony weaver lynley knew that his hope for attempted murder was a futile one at best weaver was after all the originally injured party when one considered the case from a purely legal standpoint no matter what intimacies oaths and lovers betrayals had led up to the killing of elena weaver no real crime had been committed in the eyes of the law until sarah gordon had taken the girls life driven by his grief the defence would argue weaver himselfwho would wisely not stand in his own defence and thus run the risk of crossexaminationwould emerge as loving father devoted husband brilliant scholar cambridge man if the truth about his affair with sarah gordon managed to work its way into the courtroom how easily it could be dismissed as a sensitive artistic mans giving way to a lethal temptation in a moment of weakness or during a time of marital estrangement how easily he could be depicted as having done his bestdone everything in his power in factto put the affair behind him and get on with his life once he became aware of the extent to which he was hurting his faithful and longsuffering wife but she could not forget the defence would argue she was obsessed with the need to avenge herself for his rejection of her so she killed his daughter she stalked her as she and her stepmother ran in the morning she noted the clothes which her stepmother wore she created the means to have the girl run alone she lay in wait she beat in her face and she killed her having done so she went to dr weavers college rooms by night and left him a message that revealed her culpability faced with that what was he to do what would any mandriven to despair by the sight of his childs corpsedo thus the focus would subtly turn from anthony weaver to the crime that had been committed against him and what jury would ever be able to consider the crime weaver had committed against sarah gordon in the fi rst place it was only a painting after all how could they hope to understand that while weaver struck out at a piece of canvas he carved cleanly through a unique human soul when one stops believing that the act itself is superior to anyones analysis or rejection of it then one becomes immobilised thats what happened to me but how could a jury hope to understand that if its members had never felt the call to create far easier to limn her a woman scorned than to try to understand the extent of her loss sarah gordon taught bloody instructions the defence would argue and they came back in full measure to plague her there was truth in this lynley thought of his final sight of the womanso late into the night that milk delivery was already rumbling in the streetsfive hours after they had wheeled her out of the operating theatre she was in a room outside of which a uniformed constable sat as a guard a ludicrous formality required to guarantee that the offi cial prisonerthe killer of recordnot try to escape she seemed such a small fi gure in the bed that the form of her barely disturbed the covers she lay heavily bandaged and heavily sedated her lips blueedged and her skin bruised snow still alive still breathing and still unaware of the additional loss she would have to face we managed to save the arm the surgeon told him but i cant say shell ever be able to use it again lynley had stood by the bed looked down on sarah gordon and thought about the alternative merits of seeking justice and obtaining revenge in our society the law calls out for justice he thought but the individual still craves revenge yet to allow a man or woman to pursue a course of retaliation is to invite further violence as a result for outside a courtroom there is no real way to balance the scales when an injury has been done to an innocent party and any attempt to do so only promises grief additional injury and further regret there is no eye for an eye he thought as individuals we cannot design the means of anothers retribution but now he wondered about that facile philosophyso appropriate to a hospital room at dawnas he and sergeant havers left the bentley on garret hostel lane and walked back towards the college to clear his belongings from the small room in ivy court directly in front of st stephens church a hearse was parked lined up before it and behind it were more than a dozen other cars did she say anything to you havers asked anything at all she thought it was her dog elena loved animals thats it yes no regrets no remorse no lynley said i cant say she acted as if she felt either but what did she think sir that if she killed elena weaver shed be able to paint again that murder would somehow free up her creativity i think she believed that if she made weaver suffer as she was suffering shed be able to go on with her life somehow not very rational if you ask me no sergeant but human relationships arent rational in the least they skirted the graveyard havers squinted up at the churchs norman tower its slate roof was only a few shades lighter than the sombre colour of the late morning sky it was a suitable day for the dead you were right about her from the very start havers said nice policework lynley no need for compliments you were right as well right hows that she reminded me of helen from the moment i saw her it was only a few minutes work to gather his belongings and see to his suitcase havers stood by the window looking down on ivy court while he emptied cupboards and packed up shaving gear she seemed more at peace with herself than she had been in months she wore with a fair degree of comfort the relief that comes from effecting a closure he said casually as he threw a final pair of socks into his case did you take your mother to greenford yes this morning and havers picked at a flaking patch of white paint on the window sill and ill have to get used to it letting go i mean being alone thats what one has to do sometimes lynley saw her look in his direction saw her start to speak yes i know barbara youre a better man than i am i havent been able to manage it yet they left the building and crossed the court skirting the graveyard through which a narrow path wound between sarcophagi and tombstones it was old and bent cracked in places where tree roots lifted it and weeds pushed through from the church they could hear a hymn coming to an end and rising out of its concluding notes came the high sweet sound of a trumpet playing amazing grace miranda webberly lynley guessed giving elena her own public form of farewell he felt unaccountably touched by the unadorned melody and he marvelled at the human hearts capacity to be moved by something as simple as sound the church doors opened and the evenpaced procession began to file out headed by the bronzecoloured coffi n which was carried on the shoulders of six young men one of them was adam jenn the immediate family followed anthony weaver and his former wife behind them justine and then the mourners a large crowd of university dignitaries colleagues and friends of both the cambridge weavers and countless junior and senior fellows of st stephens among them lynley noted victor troughton with a pearshaped woman leaning on his arm weavers face registered neither reaction nor recognition as he passed by lynley following the coffin which was draped with a sheet of pale pink roses their odour was sweet in the heavy air as the rear door of the hearse closed upon the coffin and one of the undertakers scuttled inside to rearrange the cave of additional flowers in which the coffi n rode the crowd pressed in round weaver glyn and justine blackgarbed men and women with melancholy faces earnestly offering affection and condolence among them was terence cuff and it was to cuff that the college portercrossing the lane from the gatehouseexcused his way through the crowd to see he carried a thick creamy envelope which he handed to the master of the college with a quiet word which cuff bent to hear cuff nodded tore open the envelope his eyes scanned the message his face fl ashed briefly with a smile he was not standing far from anthony weaver so it took only a moment for him to reach his side and only another moment for the words he murmured to filter back through the crowd lynley heard it coming from several directions at once penford chair hes been named so deserved an honour next to him havers said whats going on lynley watched weaver lower his head press a clenched fist to his moustache then raise his head again shaking it perhaps stunned perhaps touched perhaps humbled perhaps disbelieving he said dr weaver has just reached the pinnacle of his career before our very eyes sergeant hes been awarded the universitys penford chair in history to which she replied he has bloody hell my sentiments exactly lynley thought they stayed for a moment longer watching the condolences change to quiet congratulations hearing the murmurs of conversation that spoke of triumph coming upon the heels of tragedy havers said if hes charged if he goes to trial will they take the chair from him chairs are for life sergeant but dont they know about what he did yesterday the committee how could they the decision was probably made by then anyway and even if they did know even if they decided this morning he was after all only a father driven wild by his grief they edged round the crowd and headed in the direction of trinity hall havers was dragging her feet on the ground her attention given to the tops of her shoes she drove her fists into the pockets of her coat did he do it for the chair she asked abruptly did he want elena to go to st stephens because of the chair did he want her to behave because of the chair did he want to stay married to justine because of it did he want to end his affair with sarah gordon because of it well never know havers lynley replied and im not sure weaver will ever know either why because he still has to look at himself in the mirror every morning and how can he do that if he ever starts digging through his life for the truth they rounded the corner into garret hostel lane havers stopped abruptly slapping a hand to her forehead with a loud groan nkatas book she said what i promised nkata id pop into a few bookshopstheyre supposed to have a decent place called heffersand look fornow what was itwhere did i put the fl ipping she zipped open her shoulder bag and began mauling her way through its contents saying you go on without me inspector but weve left your car no problem the stations not far and i want to have a word with sheehan before i head back to london but its okay really fine see you bye and with a wave of her hand she whipped back round the corner he stared after her detective constable nkata hadnt read a book in a decade or more as far as he knew his idea of an evenings entertainment was having the senior offi cer on the bomb squad retell the story of how as a member of the mets psu he lost his left eye in a brawl in brixton which no doubt nkata himself had probably instigated during his salad days as chief battle counsel for the brixton warriors they would talk and argue and laugh over scotch eggs pickled onions and beer and if they moved on to other topics none of them were likely to be centred round literature so what was havers up to lynley turned back to the lane and saw the answer sitting on the top of a large tan suitcase at the side of his car havers had seen her as they turned the corner she had read the moment and left him to face it alone lady helen stood tommy she said he walked to join her trying to keep his eyes off the suitcase lest looking at it make the purpose for its presence something other than what he hoped it would be how did you find me he asked luck and the telephone she smiled at him fondly and knowing that you have a need to finish things even when you cant fi nish them the way that youd like she looked towards trinity lane where cars were starting and people were calling out quiet farewells its over then the official part of it and the rest the rest the part where you blame yourself for not being quicker not being more clever not being able to stop people from doing the worst to each other ah that part he let his eyes follow the progress of a group of students who passed them pedalling their bicycles in the direction of the cam as the bells of st stephens church started tolling the hollow stately accompaniment to a funerals conclusion i
