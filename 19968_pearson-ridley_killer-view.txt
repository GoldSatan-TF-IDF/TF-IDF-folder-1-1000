artists for their representation killer view was written using storymill word processing software sunday he saw himself as a camera would and often thought of himself in the third person as if an omniscient eye were looking down on him and his activities it was no different that halloween night as he prepared the syringes he talked to himselfout loud narrating every carefully conceived action as if reading from a script he could picture himself as one of those guys on the discovery channel or a e he moves with the utmost care as he makes his preparations as skilled a technician as he is a hunter the snow was falling to beat hell which brought a twisted grin to his scrappy face virgin snowthe irony not lost on him although his education had stopped in the ninth grade and irony per se was unknown to him freshfallen snow erased tracks no one knew this better than a tracker and according to the voiceover he was among the most accomplished trackers in all of idaho all of the west if you excluded montana because there were guys up there who could follow wolves for three hundred miles on foot without a dog not him he used his dogs and their radio collars whenever called for the final preparations almost complete he anticipates the events in the hours to come with nearmilitary precision on that night he was scheduled for a twofer a tricky bit of timing and complicated logistics especially given the storm he intended to get an early start for just this reason the narrator in his head reminding him of the importance of meticulous preparation and execution he arranged the five darts and two syringes methodically checking dosages storing them in two metal lunch boxes the kind hed once carried to school the kind his daddy before him had carried into the mine this one was lined with a gray foam rubber not a white napkin or sheet of paper towel he doublechecked the charge on the taser was half tempted to test the thing on one of the dogs as he sometimes did but with peppers staying behind plump with a litter he couldnt afford to have another one out of commission for the night next came the firearms the gauge dart rifle the mac with its threespeed taped magazines the doublebarreled sawedoff for under the seat of the pickup he was careful to separate the bore thunderflash bang cartridges from the gauge shot the flash bangs performed like stun grenades but could be fired from the sawedoff he kept the right barrel loaded with one of these in case of a runin with law enforcement hed stun the bastard and then shoot him up with some ketamine and leave him by the side of the road knowing he wouldnt remember what day it was much less the make or registration of the truck hed pulled over he attached the magnetic license plates over the pickup trucks existing onesa move as routine to him as brushing his teetha necessary precaution when working with his private clients the plates were registered to a similar truck in bannock county he stuffed some fresh chew behind his molars hawking a gob of spit onto the garages dirt floor even after being off of crystal meth for six months at moments like this he found the allure of it tough to resist he checked the straps on the wire cages for the dogs the snow wouldnt hurt them any and he was in too big a hurry to trade them out for the vinyl carriers that were better in bad weather he put only one of the weatherproof carriers in the back the biggest he had he double and triplechecked its electric mat a black sheet of heavy rubber a wire from which ran to a volt outlet installed in the side paneling of the truck bed it was warm to the toucha good sign the specially outfitted carrier was large enough to hold a mastiff or bernese mountain dog or a mature sheep beneath his stubble he carried a hard scar on his chin looking like a strip of stretched pink leather the result of a meat hook slipping when transferring a shecat from the pickup to the dressing shed he scratched at it a nervous habit the result of too many hours with nothing to do he spent far too much of his life waiting for others a disappointing aspect of being a workforhire but now he had purpose a higher calling it was time to put things straight there were enough assholes in washington to fill a latrine it was about time they remembered him and others who believed in their country the male caucasian twentyfour a skier was said to have been missing for over three hours a mans panicked voice had made the call to a friend of mine he never showed up we thought wed accounted for everyone i have no fricking idea how we missed him but i think hes still up there calm down sir the countys erc operator calm down we left him up there we were skiing the drop on galena pass he never came off that mountain hes out there somewhere you got to do something click sir blaine county sheriff walt fleming had listened to the emergency response center tape several times trying to judge if it was a prank or not it wouldnt be the first time some yahoo had called in a false alarm to search and rescue this one sounded authentic and hanging up on such calls was sadly not that unusual guilt could be a powerful motivator didnt need to tell a sheriff that a life in the balance a snowstorm a miserable night walt had set search and rescues phone tree into operation now standing in blowing snow in the freezing cold with only his pale face protruding from the parka walt caught his reflection in the glass of a nearby pickup where others saw a capable outdoorsman walt saw a softness settling in his desk job taking over where others saw a face that could be elected walt saw fatigue no one had ever called him handsome the closest hed gotten was goodlooking and that from a woman who no longer shared his bed he blamed his sleepless nights on her the mental images of her riding his own deputy tommy brandon flickering through his mind the two of them laughing at him after twelve years of marriage shed left him alone with their young twins and as much as he wouldnt have it any other way it wasnt working he was failing as a single dad barely keeping his head above water as the county sheriff with the help of only eight fulltime deputies he oversaw law enforcement in a piece of idaho roughly the size of rhode island now he faced galena summit in a snowstorm when all he wanted was a night playing uno with his kids and a decent nights sleep he awaited the dogs looking through the heavy snowfall past the bluish glare of halogen headlights thrown from several pickups and suvs parked in the turnout he searched for some sign of the aker brothers a freak october storm the forecast calling for eighteen inches above nine thousand feet they were now above ten thousand occupying a wide spot in the road along a series of switchbacks that constituted a part of state highway thirteen inches of fresh powder and no signs of a letup the conditions were horrible for an organized search but statistically the probability of the missing young man surviving exposure went from bad to worse after the first four hours they were now well into hour six so awaiting first light wasnt an option walt saw a flicker of headlights and turned to watch a pickup truck make the hairpin turn in a wheelspinning ascent and pull into the turnout parking with the other vehicles dogs barked from crates lashed to the bed of the arriving truck which prompted the other canines to compete walt couldnt hear himself think after another minute and a lot of peeing the dogs settled down local vet mark aker and his younger brother randy came out of the truck arguing this coat stinks randy complained zipping up a winter jacket i mean it smells bad broamoxicillin mixed with stale beer it takes a moron to forget a coat on a night like this mark said loudly enough for everyone to hear by now the others had climbed out of their vehicles no it takes a moron to be out on a night like this randy replied walt and the aker brothers went back years walt had first met mark as a teenager when his family had spent summers and christmas breaks with his grandparents in sun valley theyd been in a summer camp together had raised some hell as teenagers on the sun valley ski slopes now with three dogs at home walt basically lived at the vets it felt as if he might as well sign his paychecks over to the aker brothers randys specialty was large animals horses and cattle marks primarily cats and dogs in the glitzy celebritystudded sun valley community it was marks practice that had soared with working ranches giving way to showy estates and ranchettes randys large animal practice had nearly vanished in the last ten years causing some envy and friction between the brothers things had gotten more cozy between walt and mark when mark had volunteered his services to search and rescue developing an effective k unit walt felt more like the third brother than a good friend hearing that randythe wilder of the twohad forgotten his coat came as no big surprise hed probably done it on purpose just to frustrate his more responsible brother if anything randy was a professional thorn in his brothers side like most brothers walt and mark divided up the k teams into four pairs randy the odd man out and the most experienced backcountry skier would work solo head higher up the road and find his way out to the drop from where he would ski the face of the mountain in search of the missing skier the plan was for him to rendezvous with his brother and walt midmountain the teams headed off without a pep talk or sermonjust a check of avalanche peeps the radios and gpss radio checks would be made every fifteen minutes if the radios failedand they often did in the mountainsthen communicate by flares if the young man was discovered orange if you got yourself lost six hours twentyfive minutes the ache in the pit of walts stomach had nothing to do with the rope tied around his waist pulling the evac sled now it was all up to the dogs mark released tango his bitch german shepherd and the best scent dog hed ever trained she would go ahead of them searching for anything human dead or alive fifteen minutes rolled into twenty a walkietalkie check produced reports from everyone but randy aker already out of range the terrain proved slow and difficult walt was in a full sweat his parka hanging open it was twentyeight degrees out snow fell in flakes the size of nickels steam rose from his neck and swirled around his headlamp like a halo i wanted to talk to you about something mark aker said breathlessly the falling snow deadened all sound good a time as any walt said he knew what mark was up to he was trying to keep walts worry at a manageable level we never talk politics aker said testing walt in a way that made him pay closer attention i run for office every four years thats enough politics for me not those kinds of politics i dont pay too much attention to washington or boise if thats what you mean walt said you ever hear that storytrue story by the wayabout some budget committee hearing where the congressman from back east had found a line item listing thirtyfive hundred cattle guards and made the recommendation to take them off the federal payroll someone had to explain to the idiot that a cattle guard is a couple pipes welded together to prevent cows from crossing a fence line on a road not a person on a payroll thats the point i guess whats the point walt asked that congressmen are ignorant mark didnt answer at this temperature over this amount of time the batteries in the missing mans peepan electronic device used to help searchers locate someone in the backcountry trapped by snowwould fail sometime soon it was a human life and his survival weighed on walts every step in the cumbersome snowshoes were going to lose his peep soon walt said if we havent already hypothermias the enemy not the energizer bunny point taken they continued for a few more difficult yards are you going to explain what you mean by politics but before aker could answer both men stopped at the exact same moment did you hear that mark asked a branch snapping under the weight of the snow walt moved his headlamp around a badly bent and sagging pine bough shed some snow and sprang up others seemed to bend lower with each flake of fallen snow the two men moved on mark aker with less grace than walt hed spent too much time in the clinic he rocked forward and back on the snowshoes wasting energy but walt knew better than to try to tell him anything mark was a doctor after all youre thinking it was a gunshot walt said a rifle light gauge twentytwopower load or an ar it didnt sound like a tree branch to me too far away aker said breathlessly winded by the climb but youre the expert a few nearby branches snapped surrendering to the snow load hearing this both men turned their attention uphill then aker trained his headlight directly on walt blinding him youre right walt said raising his glove to shield his eyes that was a gunshot walt reached for his radio tango bounded toward him throwing up the snow all around her mark aker praised the dog and signaled walt to stop and be still in the shifting light from their headlamps tango circled aker tripping over the rear spines of his snowshoes and sat down excitedly on his left side soaking wet and panting she sank into the snowdrift up to her chest her whole attention fixed on aker shed returned only once forty minutes earlier on that visit she had circled aker twice and then charged back into the dark following the dull impressions of prior skiers and her own fresh tracks this was her message to her handler that shed found nothing at that time aker had made a point of asking walt to bump the location into his gps knowing it might prove useful later but now with tangos second return mark stood perfectly still waiting to see what the dog had in mind tango stabbed her wet nose into his left glove she sat back down then stood up and stabbed his glove again shes found someone aker said rewarding the dog with a treat from his pocket and lavishing praise on her tango immediately ran out ahead of them stirring up her own tracks she glanced back her eyes a luminescent green in the lights and was gone the two men trudged off impeded by the cumbersome snowshoes and limited by their own exhaustion walt reported the news and their position to the others but did not call them back it was critical they find the missing skier and until he had more than a dogs excitement he wanted the search continued no word from randy walt called back to aker fucking radios said aker huffing so hard he could barely get a word out walt pulled ahead of aker as he followed tangos path through the snow he snaked his way through a copse of aspen the barren limbs graywhite tree trunks and shifting shadows unusually beautiful in the constantly moving light from his headlamp his breath formed gray funnels his thighs ached from dragging the sled from lifting and planting the snowshoes the effort clumsy tangos time between her returns warned of a long hike she would head directly to the target then return to her handler before repeating the circuit as often as necessary she would not stop until her arrival back at the target then missing her handler she would return the full distance give the hard indicator again and take off once more the process known as yoyoing would continue until she led her handler directly to the hard target walt calculated that the missing skier was somewhere between twenty and thirty minutes away for her for a man hiking in snowshoes it could be double or triple thatan hour or more he paced himself endurance was everything now walt was already conserving energy in order to get the missing skier back out of the wilderness he came by his wilderness skills honestly not through textbooks or seminars hed grown up in these mountains with a dad who worked for the fbi and moved the family every two to four years the wood river valley had been his real home hed seen it change from a sleepy little destination ski resort into the fashionable celebrity enclave it had become and hed grown with it finding backcountry skills and survival tactics that had served him well for the past twenty years he ate a powerbar and gulped down some icy water foregoing the small thermos of coffeethe caffeine was welcome but not its dehydratingeffects he reviewed the work ahead medical treatment if they were lucky sledding him out recalling the team getting back down the snowcovered highway to the hospital it was anything but over when he next checked behind him hed lost mark to the storm so he waited as the snowflakes changed from nickels to quarters suggesting warming it was the one thing he didnt need right now if the snow went to slush the mountain went to concrete and would be more prone to slides he switched off his headlamp and peered into the dark finally spotting a pinprick of flickering bluish white light in the distance mark moving considerably slower he was weighed down by more than just the backpack and physical exhaustion walt knew something was troubling him it took him back to marks mention of politicsa conversation that had been interrupted tango streaked past walt bounding down the hill for aker wet and breathing hard she passed walt a few minutes later charging back up the hill she was still on the target walt checked his watch bumped the gps and estimated the missing boy was now less than ten minutes away the moment aker reached him walt headed off following the dogs zigzag route as it traversed the steep snowfield he now took a more vertical path connecting the dog tracks but climbing more steeply the steady climb driving his heart painfully he pulled a heavy sixcell flashlight from his pack its halogen bulb produced a sterile highpowered light which catching the edges of forest to their right and left revealed that the snowfield narrowed ending in a rock outcropping now a hundred yards straight up the drop doesnt make sense aker said huffing as he caught up we should have seen randy by now in the excitement of the find walt had forgotten about randy its possible he found fresh ski tracks leading into the trees or something walt said we wouldnt necessarily see him in the trees but he was thinking back to that earlier unexplained sound and knew mark was too now as they ascended together walts flashlight suddenly caught the eerie glow of animal eyes at the base of the towering rocks tango her position there suggested a fall damn mark said yeah despite the drag of the sled walt pulled ahead of aker people survived falls into snow he reminded himself wondering if maybe randy had fired that shot theyd heard earlier tango bounded from a hole shed dug deeply in the snow she raced past walt to the trailing mark aker then she streaked past walt on her return walt arrived to her flurry of digging and trained the beam into the hole he glanced back at mark and raised his hand stop there he shouted aker ignored him and arrived at walts side just as walt switched off the flashlight but akers headlamp found the twisted human form in the snow randys head was raked fully around pointed horribly unnaturally over his back like an owls his open still eyes crusted with ice crystals walt was the first out of his snowshoes he jumped down into the pit dug by the dog and quickly searched the body for a gunshot wound but there was no blood no wound visible yet theyd heard a gunshot he felt certain of it mark was on his knees sobbing the snow fell around him like a curtain walt climbed out of the hole and dropped to his knees to block marks view of the body he opened his arms and pulled his friend to him the sobbing came uncontrollably then tango circled them whining with her nose to the hole her innate empathy steering her nearer and nearer to her master until pressing up against him tentatively and then nuzzling in as if to keep mark warm walt watched the pickup pull away sadness rattling around in his chest mark aker had barely said a word since the discovery of his brothers broken body walt hadnt been as close to randy but loved mark like a brother now that randy was gone marks loss echoed inside of walt as well walts brother bobby had died only a few years before the tragedy had torn his family apart walt and his father never on great terms were finally talking again but it was a relationship often on eggshells now he and mark shared something unspeakable randy the womanizer the wiseguy the irreverant jokester the brooding secretive brother whose name had crossed walts desk recentlya memo that had been subsequently buried into a stack did that memothose accusationshave something to do with marks political reference made only an hour ago grief and empathy overcame walt he looked away and dragged a glove across his eyes he still ached over bobbys loss mark was in for a hellish few years he caught marks eye during the loading his face bathed in the red splash from the taillights the vet so used to death was visibly shaken by rigors unnatural positioning of randys arms angled up over his head they finally fit the corpse into the bed of a pickup truck but only after a great deal of wrangling they covered him with a blue tarp and tied it down with bungee cords it was the addition of the cords that got mark cryingthe finality of fastening them and the anchoring of the tarp as if holding down firewood death was in the details and those details racked mark aker with heartbreak anger and frustration sheriff it was his deputy tommy brandon walt felt as if hed chugged a soda too fast the fact that sheriffs deputy tommy brandon was shacked up with walts soontobeex wife kept the men at arms length as far as walt was concerned the proper thing for deputy sheriff tommy brandon to do was transfer to one of the local police or sheriffs departments walt certainly wasnt going to resign his office simply because his deputy was doing his wife but for brandon what was the difference walt couldnt fire him without fearing a lawsuit it was almost as if brandon was hanging around to torture him what made things even more complicated and tricky was that brandon was his best deputygoddamn him losing brandon would hurt the office but with every small confrontation every brush of the elbows every look that passed between them it seemed increasingly inevitable and necessary even the smell of the mans aftershave bothered walt hadnt gail carried that same smell to bed a few times when theyd still been a family midnight had come and gone another two inches of fresh powder lay on the roofs of all the roadside vehicles none of the dogs had picked up any scents the searchers were warming themselves in the cabs of their trucks behind fogged windshields awaiting orders lets call the search off for tonight tommy well start over in the morning were going to want the original call confirmed if possible i want to know who made that call and i want to talk to him personally got it we traded a life for a life tonight and thats just plain wrong for all they knew the missing skier had found his way home safely brandon moved between the vehicles speaking with the various drivers a few minutes later the pickup trucks began to pull out walt was sitting on the back bumper of the offices hummer a vehiclehe used for search and rescue he was strapping snowshoes onto his boots as the last of the trucks departed leaving only brandon s big red dodge suv everything about tommy brandon was big tempting walts imagination and begging him to hate the guy sheriff im going back out there tommy not alone youre not im not looking for the missing kid tommy i want some photos before everythings covered randy skied off the drop sheriff end of story as far back as walt could remember tommy had never called him by anything other than his rank it made the guy even harder to dislike walt told him about hearing the branch snapping how his first reaction had been gunshot the hummer was idling for warmth the slapslap of its wipers rising above the grind of the engine but randy wasnt shot we dont know anything about what drove him off those rocks mark and i had to get the body out there was no time to look around he dug into the back of the hummer and withdrew a broken piece of ski and tangled metal edging it was a piece from the middle of a ski and contained the sophisticated mountaineering binding that allowed the heel to be locked down or the toe to be used as a threepin binding the equipment was different than that found on recreational downhill skis a hybrid system this gear allowed a crosscountry skier to convert his equipment to downhill on a single pair of skis he passed it to brandon who shook the water offthe snow having meltedand studied it so what brandon said the sticker walt said taking the broken piece of ski from him he pointed out the just below the three pins that secured the toe of the boot its a patent or whatever so what its not a registered trademark tommy its an r for rightas in right ski for the right boot theyre paired same as downhill skis and this ski was on his left foot brandon took it out of walts hand and studied it in the light from the cars interior so he got em mixed up it was dark and snowing big deal youve never crosscountry skied i see hed have known in the first few seconds he had them reversed the skis dont track well they pull to the outside drives you crazy and costs you energy a guy like randy wouldnt have reversed them in the first place but if he had hed have stopped and made it right within the first few minutes storm or no storm yeah but maybe it just didnt bother him sheriff he looked on as walt fastened the second of his two snowshoes to his boots or maybe he took them off for some reason had to take a dump or something put them back on reversed jumped off the cliff who the hell knows thats what im going to find out then im going with you no need tommy ill be fine its late get back and get the paperwork started on randy ill call you in an hour if thatll make you feel better tommy crossed to his truck and returned with his own snowshoes nothing more was said between the two men for over twenty minutes walt navigated a more direct route to the drop following the gps both men arrived at the top of the rock outcropping winded and sweating the storm had covered an area of snow greatly disturbed by dozens of prior skiers walt had been right about the snowfall covering any chance to backtrack randys movements it was nearly too late already working on his theory that randy had taken a bathroom break brandon followed a set of ski tracks that deviated from the main route into the woods walt was leaning over the rocks aiming his sixcell down at the hole some forty feet below when brandon called out over the radio sheriff got something interesting here walt followed brandon s fresh tracks into the quiet stillness of the forest they curved to the right slightly downhill and aimed southwesttoward state highway brandon had traveled a long distance walt found him at the base of a tree with the evergreens acting as giant umbrellas the snow cover here was only a few inches deep the area was heavily disturbed you do this no sir wolves maybe i think they may have treed him walt got down on hands and knees we didnt see any wolves didnt hear any and neither did tango could be dog prints just as easily theyre small for wolves all the dogs were accounted for all of our dogs walt said meaning i dont know tommy im thinking out loud okay he snapped at him realizing too late that either his fatigue or his resentment of the man was working its influence brandon studied the area well were never gonna find a shell casing until spring if thats what youre thinking i suppose wed better mark the tree though he took out a knife and carved away a section of bark im not connecting the two at all right now walt said brandon shined his light on the animal tracks they came up through the trees in a direct line now covering randys ski tracks but it was clear the two sets of tracks were connected and had been made at the same time i dont know a pack of wolves makes sense sheriff randy would have known what he was up against and it fits with the skis being reversed they tree him his skis are down here then they take off and hide he knows what theyre about and they know where he is its a race maybe he tries the radio and its no dice so he has to go for it gets out of the tree as fast as he can puts the skis on the wrong feet takes off for the drop knowing he can outski the wolves if he can get into some downhill terrain in the confusion he picks the wrong part of the drop to jump from a lot of kids jump off these rocks but its the west end not the middle walt liked the explanation and said so he ran off some photographs none of which came out very well he suggested they backtrack until they discovered where the animal tracks had caught up with randys ill want some photographs of that as well im going to cross here brandon said pointing to the course of disturbed snow and well parallel the tracks the two separated staying on each side of the wide path of disturbed snow once out of the woods the tracks became humped with snow left by the storm tracking the pattern was not difficult but it became less and less clear what they were following walt shuddered at the thought of being pursued by a pack of hungry wolves in a snowstorm hed searched randy for a weapon and hadnt found one but he could have dropped it during the chase this would help walt explain the single report he and mark had heard if it was wolves walt finally said then why didnt they scavenge on the body yeah brandon said i was hoping you wouldnt think of that walt popped on the sixcell flooding the area in a harsh light the mass of tracks theyd been following separated here there was no question that the animal tracks joined and followed the ski tracks this sucks said brandon looking down walt crossed the tracks to take a look a single impression partly protected by a fallen tree trunk its shape and pattern unmistakable a snowshoe motherfucker brandon said tell me thats you or mark aker walt remained silent as he took a series of photographs the flashes like small explosions in the overwhelming white again he checked the cameras screen none of the shots was any good that could have been left earlier today with all the snowfall we cant say for sure its connected to the animal tracks brandon said he was right there was no knowing when any of these tracks had been left snow blew and drifted it fell out of trees it slid down mountains a print like this tucked under a log could be preserved for days walt snapped more photos informing brandon he believed the connection between the snowshoe and the animal prints significant just so you know brandon said even if it takes all night im following these tracks it wont take all night tommy walt pointed down a slope to where a stream of white light ran steadily along the tops of trees a car or truck the sound of the chains clapping against the pavement a half mile away thats highway seventyfive he said ten bucks thats where theyre going to lead us his selection of a stool near the end of the bar was no accident for it was at the end of the bar where the waitresses refueled their trays it required patience to wait for the seat right next to the waitress station halloween brought out the crazies and the place was packed there were two kinds of people who sat at a bar those waiting for a table or in a hurry and those with their elbows shellacked to the surface thankfully the two stools to his right were not the thrones of legitimate barflies but only rest stops fifteen minutes after he took his place on the third stool he had migrated to his right and the seat adjacent to the brass bar that segregated the drunken masses from the waitresses reconnaissance had told him that the girl underage as she most definitely was was drinking a kir royalechampagne dyed red with crème de cassis easy to spot among the beer and vodka of her peers that filled out the tray as the empties returned easy to identify as the bartender placed a fresh one on the bar before turning his skills to the vodka mixes the decentlooking waitress busied herself with garnishes of lemon and lime she stabbed a line of three olives onto a yellow plastic stick dressing the vodka glasses as they surfaced the man now sitting on the stool next to her waited for the right moment the bartenders head came up the waitress slipped a wedge of lime on the highballs rim the man pointed to a bottle of single malt his right arm impolitely extended between the two of them he asked about the cost and quality of the scotch as they directed their attention to the bottle his left hand waved over the top of the kir like a magicians for anyone looking closely the champagne briefly fizzed a little more than it had before a few grains of sediment sank to the bottom of the glass and then vanished he was told the scotch was excellent and cost as much as a tank of gas he ordered a draft beer and stayed on the stool long enough to watch the tray make its way through the crowded room carried high on the end of the waitresss steepled fingers waited through half the beer knowing that a young woman would go to the washroom when her head began spinning she wouldnt tell her older friends anything was wrong might not even ask a friend to join her in the washroom first she would try to deal with this herself that was when hed strike he finished the beer placed a modest tip on the barneither too small nor too large to be rememberedand freed the stool to one of the many waiting behind him working through the busy bar took some time given his size and the power of his body he could have made quick work of it but invisibility mattered more than efficiency he took his time finding openings and squeezing between the crowded tables reaching the roughwoodpaneled back hallway the two restrooms shared a wall across from a gallery of tintypes of mining camps from more than a century ago an exit at the end led to the back parking lot it helped that it was snowing heavily helped that his pickup was parked less than twenty feet from the door he saw it clearly unfold in his mind like watching a film but with him in it if there was one thing he knew it was how to hunt to stalk to kill he celebrated his own brilliance reveled in the warmth that anticipation raised in his bloodstream got high on it to everything a time for every purpose under heaven he admired the tintypes or at least pretended to scragglylooking guys from the s showing off rows of enormous brook and rainbow trout hanging from laundry lines outside canvas tents with the alcohol as a catalyst it wouldnt take long for her to feel it a swimming head an unexpected warmth and euphoria an unfamiliar lack of inhibition accompanied by a penetrating relaxing of her muscles he stole glimpses of her across the barroom each time she laughed her strapless bridesmaids dress slipped a little lower on her chest revealing the remnant of a summertan line she might have paid more attention to this even twenty minutes earlier but now lightheaded and prone to laughter she didnt know what she felt except a little too good less than five minutes later just before her left breast completely escaped her forearm caught the dress and she pinched the fabric below her smoothly shaved armpits and hiked it back up this moment of modesty triggered something in what remained of her conscious mind informing her something was wrong it couldnt have been more than a glimpse a flicker given the dose but in that instant she excused herself briefly lost her balance stumbled burst out laughing and once again caught the bust of her dress just prior to total exposure and then to his pure delight she headed directly for him a syringe occupied each of his coat pockets making one easily available to either hand he wasnt going to need the taser she was cranked she reached to the backs of chairs for support as she negotiated her way through the crowded room the live band pounded through a john mellencamp song loud enough to make it impossible to think she caught the beat and smiling sublimely swayed her hips side to side now on final approach she was an eyeful unblemished skin thick red hair held high on her head in an elaborate braid a body ripe and heavy with fruit rendered helpless and without a conscious thought she grinned behind halfmast eyes her round hips punched out the beat she tripped once more as she cleared the chairs and tables and headed for the hallway where he waited licking his chops like the proverbial wolf this was going to be fun she crashed right into his arms whoa there he said she laughed looked up and bent back as she tried to focus eyebrows arched and then pinched as she failed to recognize him and no memory of how shed gotten there excuse me she said some drool running off her lower lip he held her by the elbow knowing she probably didnt feel it things would be going spongy nowin crystalline form this stuff worked quickly no problem he said giving his most reassuring smile just need the little girls room she said she remembered that much but little else he took in both ends of the hall the timing couldnt have been better they were alone his left hand found the syringe in his coat pocket and slipped off the needle guard maybe a little fresh air he said guiding her a few feet closer to the exit you think she stopped looked up into his face tried to concentrate do i know you its cold out feels pretty good when youre feeling dizzy i am dizzy she said howd you know been there he said warmly she wore five earrings up the curve of her left ear a rainbow of gems ruby sapphire emerald two diamonds an ear worth ten grand shed be missing those by morning she glanced at the word gals on the roughhewn door as they passed it then at her escort and something registered behind her outoffocus eyes that the train had missed its stop but nothing too alarming it must have felt good to have someone holding her up cold air she muttered its snowing itll feel good he encouraged she exhaled suddenly leaning more fully on his arm relying on his assistance now she sagged her muscles going all creamy her head bobbing like a marionettes i dont know she said i feel pretty good already no crime in that real good actually probably too good that made her laugh she cracked herself up her voice still bubbly and light as the exit door slipped shut behind her he checked the alley in both directions hard to see more than ten yards in the swirling darkness hed knocked out the only spotlight on his way inside earlier a streetlamp thirty yards to his right showed a cone of snow large flakes falling heavily the pickups tailgate was already down a half inch of fresh snow had collected there the door to the dog carrier hung open as well whats going on she said a fleeting moment of awareness but then she stuck out her pink tongue and tried to catch snowflakes she giggled childishly were going to have a good time he said were going to party i like to party one last check in all directionsthe snow and the darkness like a privacy curtain someone three cars over wouldnt have been able to see them clearly he hit her in the left buttock with the syringe hey she said as if hed pinched her there she weighed about a hundred and ten he picked her up and folded her in half without straining this is a game he said you have to be quiet shh she said still giggling as he pushed her inside the carrier and shut its door with a metallic click of finality walt had followed the disturbance in the snow back through a mile and a half of woods to the twolane idaho state highway wondering now if the plan had been for the storm to cover the tracks removing the evidence he feared randy akers death was anything but accidental proving it would be something else given that the storm had buried even the circumstantial evidence so preserving what little hard evidence he believed he had became paramount he sent brandon down the snowcovered road on foot to retrieve the hummer while walt kneeled sweating and shivering in the cold his winter coat spread out and supported by small sticks to make a tent above a section of the turnout where he and brandon had carefully uncovered a tire print theyd gotten lucky the road had been recently plowed before the car or truck had parked in the turnout its prints had frozen in the quickly freezing slush left behind by the plow by carefully brushing away the light powder he and brandon had excavated a portion of the icy tire impression now that it was exposed though the falling snow seemed to be crystallizing on top of it adhering to it necessitating the improvised covering alongside the impression were two telltale paw printsa dogs not wolf not coyote walt continued to gently brush away the powdery snow exposing three additional animal tracksalso dog prints no fivelegged dogs as far as he knew so there were two or more he heard the grind of an engine long before he caught sight of the approaching headlights the snow was really coming down now the flakes turning larger and wetter the kind of warm snow that melted as it fell covering everything in a pasty slush a tent twig snapped and one arm of his coat sagged toward the tire impression and as the wind caught the coat dragged it in the snow perfectly erasing two of the dog prints walt did his best to shield the remaining three while struggling to support his sagging coat he glanced up somewhat desperately at the headlights and saw two people in the cab and as it drew closer and parked he identified the passenger as fiona kenshaw when he thought of fiona in his minds eye she wore a tight tshirt and fishing waders she had her hair trimmed summer short and she wore no makeup but as she climbed out of the vehicle lugging a camera case over her shoulder he saw she wore a purple downhill ski suit no hat driving gloves and a pair of gray uggs that kind of ski suit was for the sun valley set not fiona maybe it was borrowed he thought but even in the headlights her face was simple and pleasant with eyes that worked hard to disguise some truth he knew nothing about maybe he liked her for this mystery she always carried maybe for her independence but he liked her and as so often happened in this county his office relied upon her parttime help sorry i was working a wedding she apologized cutting off any comments he might make about how shed dressed a freelance thing got here as soon as i could brandon explained we left her car down with my truck walt directed brandon to retrieve the blue tarp and tent poles in the back of the hummer ten minutes later he got his coat back and with brandon holding one of the four corners and walt the other with a third corner tied to the bumper of the hummer they improvised a tent under which fiona went to work you really drive this thing she asked him not often it was donated by one of our resident billionaires comes in handy sometimes all those toys and you cant take your own pictures i tried all i got was white on white walt explained were going to lose this scene fast i need as much detail as you can get fiona asked brandon to hold a bounce screen against his knees angled to reflect the light off the hummers headlights she set up a large batterypowered umbrella flash opposite brandon and ran off a series of shots she checked the back of her camera didnt like the results and rearranged the lighting and tried again twenty minutes passed doing four different setups the snowfall increased and the wind picked up lifting ghostly white sheets of powder off the pavement and spreading them around a thin drift blew across the tire print and briefly covered it fiona used a soft lens brush to sweep it off but it was obvious to all of them they were losing the battle these suck she said no contrast bad shadows youre not going to like them i need this walt said yeah well i need a contrast agent a dark powder hang on she hurried back to the hummer pulled her purse from the car and dug through it pays that i was at a wedding and wanted to look presentable she held up a compact case face powder whos got a coin she scratched the compressed face powder to dust and blew across it to color the icy tire impression a few minutes later she had the shots she wanted and showed them to him on the cameras small screen before the three of them took down the rigging and piled back into the hummer do i get to know what this is about she asked walt from the backseat brandon looked over curious as to how walt would answer its a murder investigation walt said he hummed a little theme music in his head as a soundtrack real life felt like the movies or television only when you added a soundtrack the cabin was dark and smelled of wood smoke and other odors not easily placed cordite medicines old dog hed placed her in his only comfortable chair next to the woodstove it had a green pendleton blanket pulled over the cushions to hide the stuffing that escaped its worn pillows an unusual footstool woven cane with deer antler legsheld up her bare feet hed bound her wrists to the arms of the chair with plastic ties hed left her legs free for obvious reasons you all right he asked her he didnt care but he offered his concern as a courtesy she giggleda wet guttural groanpart of her given to fantasy part terror that odd laughing of hers was enough to make him sick then again it aroused him to the point he was needing some satisfaction and that brought him back to the soundtrack because now he was humming the rolling stones i feel great he answered speaking for her one of her eyes lifted partially open as he spoke for her and only then with great effort the eyeball spun in her head her lid fell shut then blinked open again the eye surveyed her surroundings and she tried to sit up her left breast popped out of the dress she looked down at herself and some drool spilled from her mouth to her chest and slid into the gulf the fleshy abyss and was gone oops he said for her now laughing along with her as she made that sound again hey whats with my arms anyway he narrated i mean i cant feel anything isnt that right he asked her numb as novocain the good news is you wont want to remember any of this good for both of us wont feel hardly anything either but thats your loss he rubbed his crotch and then took hold of it and squeezed it like a rapper old max is dying to meet you his looks must have frightened her on some level for he was a big son of a bitch with too much hair and too little grooming he waited for her but got only that one wandering eye he raised his voice an octave to imitate her i like to par ty were going to have fun all right he said ostensibly he was on contract but he had ulterior motives information of his own to collect from her had she been horsey he might have gleaned the information and been done with her but she was a rare thing of youthful beautyand the ketamine cocktail would erase any memory of these precious hours as a survivalist he knew never to waste anything put everything to good use well what are we waiting for his ventriloquist puppet asked her good eye was locked onto the stove apparently having lost track of him but he didnt let that bother him you didnt lose track of a man with a nearthreefoot span to his shoulders and twentyeightinch thighs for very long you just chose to ignore him but that wouldnt last either old max was coming to attention a geometric pattern of light rounded the ceiling and fled down a wall like a ghost and a car engine was heard shutting off the cabin door opened a moment later and with it came a gust of cold that turned them both that direction nice the visitor said noticing the gooseflesh on her exposed breast the tight pucker to her nipple and areola as he shut the door who are you he imagined her asking hes who you have to thank for this he answered himself silently the visitor was dressed like a shoe salesman he removed his eddie bauer jacketblack suede peppered with melted snowand stepped away from the door and into the light he had uncommon good looks though his face was difficult to read he might have once been a high school quarterback or varsity pitcher the kind of guy that didnt need to drug a girl to get some action stop humming he said the big man went silent and backed away he could break this guy with one hand tied behind his back if he had to but he wasnt about to both men knew that the visitor stepped toward the woodstove holding his hands out for warmth kira you can hear me and understand me do i know you her words slurred it was the first time shed spoken since leaving the bar help me i will help you but i need your help first okay he waited ill take that as a yes he said the visitor looked over his shoulder and the big man handed him a syringe from the kitchen table you work at the sun valley animal center the visitor said do i know you she repeated youre mark akers secretary his assistant assisnt she said amusing herself how do you know that the quavering of her voice changed her in the big mans eyes she looked so incredibly young and childish all of a sudden just a baby in a bridesmaids dress tell me about the sheep what sheep which sheep the sheep the sick sheep why are the sheep so sick are we going to party or talk nursery rhymes she giggled throatily whats wrong with the sheep the visitor asked what does your boss think is wrong with the sheep what sheep the narrator inside his head answered she had said nothing apparently having lost consciousness her head now sagging what happened to the partying anyway the big man wondered the visitor lifted her head by the hair and the whites of her eyes showed he held the syringe where she could see it no one liked a needle the girls eyes popped and she shied away kira if you dont tell me about the sheep im going to inject you with this you will not like what it does everythings going to be a lot more real more clear for you once youve had this shot a lot less fun i promise he and i are still going to party with you kira but something tells me youre not going to like it you see how big a man he is the visitor pointed at him he gets sloppy seconds think about that a minute he waited for some sign from her got nothing i need to know what your boss is thinking about the sheep the visitor said i need to know that right now you can help yourself a lot by telling me did he really think she heard him maybe she could see his lips move maybe even she recognized every other word but she was too far down too far back to fully understand him at normal speed you know you are really hung up on these sheep the visitor spun around and looked at him only then did he realize hed spoken it aloud into the room what the fuck did you just say the visitor asked she came to life again baaing like a sheep it saved him having to answer she laughed gutturally as she surfaced you arent like one of those kind of guys she pursed her lips trying to contain her laughter but it spilled out of her along with a good deal of spittle which the visitor then wiped off his hand and onto his pressed pants can i tell you a little secret she egged him closer the visitor leaned in to her the syringe hovered in his right hand like a preachers cross at last rites she said if a guy wants to visit my kitchen door now and then thats okay with me i even kind of like it but if he comes around to my front door hed better wipe his feet she guffawed rocking up the front legs of the big chair one last try kira he wielded the syringe impossibly close to her face she appeared to lock onto it perhaps for just a fraction of a second she grasped her situation understood what was to come i want to go home she said the sheep kira whats wrong with the sheep the needle pointed south aimed directly at her forearm i want to go home monday keep trying walt told nancy his secretary the phone clutched under his chin as he kneeled on the kitchen floor wrestling a small foot into a tight boot its too tight his daughter complained push harder he said me nancy asked over the phone no thats for emily you keep trying to reach mark i want to hear the minute you find him got it he hung up and set the phone down on the kitchen table and went back to the battle of the boots hed been caught by the fluke fall storm hadnt had any of the girls winter clothes ready now he was racing to get them dressed and into the car in time to avoid a tardy hed managed four hours sleep what if i put soap all over it he said holding her foot you think thatll help it get into that boot he tickled the bottom of her foot and emily screeched it was strange that she should be so ticklish when nikki was not in every other way they were identical until nikki had developed a tiny mole by her right eyebrow even their parents had had trouble telling them apart nooo she giggled olive oil he asked nooo snot emily burst out laughinga barking cackle from her gut that was infectious to anyone within earshot in seconds the two of them were rolling around on the floor while nikki stood away trying to force the grin from her face nikki had suffered the most from her mothers abrupt departure it was she whom walt worried about on his sleepless nights the morning report from nancy was pretty typical for the day after a storm five highway collisions throughout the earlymorning hours none fatal three duis issued a ski shop had found a back window broken and was conducting an inventory a nineteenyearold girl had been reported missing by her parents a few months earlier hed not needed phonedin reports from nancy he would have already been at his desk by now he resented gail for every intrusion in his routine there was no seam in their family life her indiscretion had not penetrated and infected it was as if the waning gifts of a young face and tight body had compelled her to prove herself still attractive with no regard to the three she had left behind with nancy s help hed dispatched a team of twelve search and rescue to continue looking for the missing skier he felt he owed his energy to mark aker and the investigation into randys death he was the only trained investigator for a hundred miles in any direction as such he also asked for more on the missing girl nancy told him that kira tulivich attended a wedding had gone out drinking with friends and had not come home walt assumed she would stagger home sometime later in the day with apologies but he knew to consider it a crime first and to be happy if it turned out differently my coat wont zip nikki complained all trace of humor gone from her face okay okay he said emilys foot finally sliding down into the boot a small victory he tried nikkis zipper but she was right the coat wouldnt close around her damn daddy said a bad word nikki announced loudly this time both girls giggled daddys tired i shouldnt have said that lisa the sitter would pick them up from school get them home and start dinner she worked for a flat daily fee not hourly and she gave him all sorts of breaks doing everything from picking up dry cleaning to running to the supermarketand never charged him shed made his transition to single parenting doable though he had miles to go he felt like a failure most of the time as if no matter how hard he tried no matter how much he cared he moved backward he held himself to higher standards than what he was capable of he was digging in sand and worst of all he thought the girls knew it there was nothing much to do about the jacket new winter outfits were needed he tried the snaps got the middle two to hold thats going to have to do but it wont zip its the best we can do for now talk of the zipper reminded him of randy akers body bag he thought he should probably hurt more for randys loss in truth he felt bad for mark but it was difficult to take the victims death personally that emotion had been trained out of him clipped from his dna even bobbys untimely death had hit him much the same way he grieved not for the dead but for the living i dont want to wear it if it doesnt zip nikki said dont please dont not this morning okay weve got to get to school well fix it later maybe you can go shopping with lisa he was thinking how expensive kids winter clothing was maybe hed get lucky and find a secondhand jacket at the barkin basement despite the best intentions he went from fuming mad to blind anger as he made the short drive to hailey elementary gail had cited a dozen reasons for leaving himhis time on the job the nature of his work and the fear it forced her to live with her unfounded jealousy of other womenbut they both knew the real reason the two girls in the backseat motherhood had not only not come naturally it had barely ever come at all he had watched her descend from the initial glow of motherhood to the reality of being overwhelmed year by year she had grown more resentful of losing her own freedom she might have survived a single child but the needs of two proved too much when early frustrations had evolved into resentment manifested as screaming rants and threats that shaded dangerously close to child abuse shed done the only thing available removed herself from the home shed used the affair with tommy brandon to keep friends and neighbors in the dark as well as to renew her own sense of selfworth but he suspected her failure as a mother was rotting away what little chance at happiness she dreamed of for him whatever feelings hed had for her had dissolved with her inability to cope in the end hed realized hed never really known her never mind that the added burden of single parenting drained him never mind that her departure and absence influenced every moment his every decision even something as simple as a drive to school they had reached a disconnect with divorce now inevitable he reminded himself to keep it from getting bloody the girls had to be protected at all costs by the time he reached the sheriffs office an unremarkable onestory brick building with the jails coiledrazorwire exercise area slung off the back side he pushed gail aside expecting that nancy would have found mark aker while hoping she might have word on the missing teenage girl as well instead he saw tommy brandon and two other deputies across the street from the office the lights of one of their cars flashing walt parked and joined them his heart sinking crazy dean falco was chained to a tree the sheep are all dying falco shouted for walts sake the environment is a killer all corporate profiteers should be hanged falco himself had been arrested and tried no fewer than six times for similar stunts he usually found a small group to join him but typically in the summer months not in twentydegree winter weather the chain was big and thick and was padlocked with a hardened steel lock that would be hell to cut using an oxyacetylene torch might scar the tree giving falco added ammunition to his cause he began shouting his message again though louderanimals in peril the poisoning of the environmentcausing walt to check behind him wondering at his audience he saw fiona with her camera gear and a reporter sue bailey they crossed the street suppressing grins everyone knew dean falco strained the chains working himself up to a lather brandon was on his cell phone working with elbies tire and auto to bring a cutting torch up there no bolt cutter was going to handle that heavygauge steel walts father jerry enjoyed ridiculing his son about the smalltime nature of his sheriffs job though sun valley had grown into an internationally recognized playground for the rich and famous bigcity crime had for the most part not found its way here yet the wood river journal still carried stories on its front page about bands of sheep stopping traffic and the senior center s vending machine being robbed jerry fleming made fodder from all of it for this reason walt hoped to avoid being in any of the photographs jerry subscribed to both local newspapers the mountain express and the wood river journal he shuffled over to fiona i know youre wearing another hat at the moment he said but id sure appreciate it if i didnt end up in any of the pictures keeps your name in front of voters she suggested makes me look like all ive got time for is babysitting tree huggers said walt if i arrest him im antienvironment if i dont im a flaming liberal what if you just set him on fire she asked he barked a laugh and then hid his smile behind his hand a reasonable reaction i think or better yet just leave him do nothing you think like a cop he said hell freeze his butt off out here with no one to preach to i think ill take your advice he said squeezing her arma nice firm arm he headed for his office nancy offered him a grim look nothing on mark she said cell phone not answering work they dont open until ten i tried the emergency number but the woman who answered hadnt heard from him she reminded me unnecessarilyhow close he was to randy she said he may have just shuttered himself in for the morning i doubt that despite the mountain of paperwork walt had to admit that he loved his office it gave him an excuse to shut the door and lock the world out yet these days thanks to gail he would catch himself behind his desk staring into space ten minutes lost to the black hole what about the runaway bride bridesmaid nancy corrected her sense of humor stopped when she occupied that chair her name is kira tulivich no still no word hed made up his mind im going over to marks he said ive called she reminded we could send a cruiser by if youd rather no im doing it myself before he left he gave nancy his wish list he wanted more on kira tulivich all her friends boyfriends and fellow bridesmaids he wanted to know why the erc had not yet provided the caller id for the search and rescue call that had sent them up galena in the first place and he wanted photos from fiona of the tire tracks got those nancy said she just dropped them by she handed walt a manila envelope and he doublechecked the contents if you get a minute call the barkin basement and see if they have a kids winter coat nikkis size zipper not snaps he drove the four miles north to the starweather subdivision marveling at the beauty of a fresh snowfall sparkling in the sunlight a sky of perfect blue sugarcoated evergreens bowing to gravity highway ran northsouth bisecting the twentymilelong valley it was the only road that connected the three main towns bellevue hailey and ketchumsun valley for most of the drive the south faces of the mountains were without trees covered in a fresh snowfall they looked like giant marshmallows forming a v with sun valley near the tip that pointed north dozens of smaller roads all hosting milliondollar homes led east or west off the spine of highway he drove his departmentissue cherokee down a small hill into a forest of aspen trees starweather formed a large oval through the woods akers driveway hadnt been plowed snow slipped down into walts boots and melted around his ankles as he headed from the cherokee the multiple tire tracks he followed suggested vehicles coming and going at a very early hour when walt had arrived home just after two am the snowfall had still been steady the tracks he was following had been left somewhere before three am when the storm had stopped completely the driveway curved to reveal a modest oneandahalfstory log home with a riverrock chimney about an acre of trees had been cleared around the house and walt knew from many summer evenings spent on the back deck that it overlooked a small lawn leading to the edge of the big wood river a magpie floated overhead on fixed wings landed between walt and the house and then took off again no motion in any of the windows a pair of spotlights on the corner of the roof nearest the garage left on another light glowed by the front door combined with the lack of any interior lights walt didnt like the look of the place it was possible of course that a grieving mark aker had turned off all the phones and was sleeping in possible but unlikely as a smallanimal vet mark lived with death no matter his emotions he was not a person to hide himself away and even if he had needed some time francine would be fielding calls he rang the front bell to no success maybe theyd headed south to marks parents and the family farm he walked around back and tried to see into the kitchen he knocked loudly on the living rooms french doors but there was no sign of life he tried the back door locked tried it again stared at it mark never locked his doors the fact that hed done so now and had apparently left townin the middle of an awful nighttold him something was terribly wrong mark not answering his cell phone also needed explanationhe was on call the more walt looked at this the more it stank mark had brought up politics the night before had done so with difficulty they never talked politics coincidental or related had it had something to do with randy returning to his cherokee walt took a minute sitting on the back bumper with the tailgate up to clean the snow out of his boots and brush off his socks the rumors about randy had to do with biggame poaching hunting violations belonged to fish and game so walt had steered clear no doubt mark had heard the same rumors might even know of randys associates was he trying to protect the family name by running or knowing mark was he determined to handle this himself politics back behind the wheel walt drove fast now intent to keep his friend from exacting vengeance yet having no idea where to begin elbie of elbies tire and auto was a stout man with a potbelly whom walt had known since back when the man had hair elbie greeted walt with a calloused right hand that had the feel and texture of a gardening glove left outside for the winter come on in he said show me what you got an air gun rattled periodically from the garage interrupting music playing on an oldies station since when had talking heads become oldies walt pondered this as they reviewed fionas photograph i need the make of the tire he explained and what kind of vehicle i might be looking at i repair flats and do alignments weve got a special right now on wiper blades please its a toyo tire elbie had the nasty habit of making a whistling wet sucking sound between his teeth when he paused to think he led walt across the garage past three kids in soiled jumpsuits who were busy with machinery and he tugged a tire down from the rack they call it the observe see this center pattern easy to spot its a good solid tire expensive though vehicle its a truck tire pickup suv that doesnt narrow it down much does it we sell a lot of them and they come standard on some toyota allwheel drives this same size you scaled the photo with a glove walt kinda hard to pinpoint a particular size anything at all to help me narrow it down its underinflated see how wide its spread elbie said pointing to the photo and its worn to the outside overloaded and underinflated or maybe someone just wanted better traction in all this snow itll hold better this way but itll cut the life of the tire in half if its not corrected an overloaded pickup truck driving on snow walt said disappointedly only a couple thousand of those to pick from i can put you into a new set of wiper blades elbie noticed walt eyeballing one of the workers listen walt i know taylor s history with you with your office but hes a hardworking kid and im giving him a fresh start did i say anything walt asked defensively im glad to see him gainfully employed but what the hell happened to his face said he hit a tree skiing this morning on the mountain walt said sarcastically at sixty bucks a day taylor crabtree hes doing four hundred hours of community service for mounting a webcam in the girls bathroom of the alternative school you really think hes spending a lot of time on the mountain elbie he hit a tree thats good enough for me he does afternoons for me kids this age a boy like this basically on his own you know how it is in this valley walt hell a guy with a real job cant afford to live here anymore a kid like taylor its not easy crabtree sneaked a look in walts direction walt read all sorts of things into that look among them avoidance and fear but there was something else as well a searching expression as if crabtree wanted to talk to him listen walt said do you have any ink or oil or something that would give me a print of this tires tread pattern i probably have a picture of it in one of the books could you give a look for me elbie glanced from walt to taylor and back again go easy on him thats all i ask as walt crossed the garage crabtree lowered his head and tried to look busy up close walt could see that the bruised eyes and split lips were clearly not the work of a tree there were no scrapes hed been hit once real hard take a break with me out back walt said crabtree set down his tire iron and followed like his boots were two sizes too big once outside walt checked for anyone within hearing range the effort won crabtrees attention how many hours are left on your community service walt asked two hundred eightytwo but whos counting right walt said hed hoped to win something other than a scowl but failed i could use your help with something maybe cut back some of those hours do i have a choice have you heard about any recruiting going on after school the kid shrugged avoiding eye contact they call themselves the samakinn walt said its a blackfoot word for spear word is they want to recruit high school kids to do their dirty work get someone else to commit the felonies guys like that they talk about the mexicans having ruined everything taken all the jobs crowded the schools get someone mad enough theyll do about anything you know anything about it crabtrees eyes met walts his were swollen and bruised and walt knew what kind of a blow it took to leave that kind of damage maybe theyve roughed up kids that disagree with them crabtree shrugged the idaho bureau of investigation had put out an alert on the samakinn for central idaho it was said to be a small but determined cell you and i might disagree on a lot of stuff taylor but no one wants this kind of thing around here dont know nothing about it this is nothing but a small group of bozos hiding behind the blackfoots good name theres no proof theyre even native americans they want their manifesto heard make a name for themselves they think violencesabotageis going to get them heard theyre said to be interested in recruiting kids your age get them hooked on meth get them to do stuff for them like dropping power lines blowing up bridges stuff like that frontpage stuff that if they do enough of that people will listen he gave this a moment to sink in maybe they beat up the ones who wont play along crabtree lit a cigarette he played the scene deadpan kids saw too many movies walt thought thing of it is taylor i could probably convince a judge to cut that two hundred eightytwo hours in half if you were to give me something that led me to these guys if we got a conviction he might make that time go away completely crabtree stared at the scuffed toes of his winter boots he flicked the long ash off the cigarette and finally inhaled maybe you didnt hit a tree maybe you can identify one or two of these guys from photos i hit a tree eyes still fixed on the ground they threaten you i can help with that he huffed out a laugh and some smoke with it why dont you ask someone else because most kids are afraid of them walt gave that a few seconds to sink in you dont strike me as a kid whos afraid of much crab crabtree glanced up briefly from the toes of his boots id like to know how many there are what they drive where theyre staying who they know anything along those lines you think you could do that he shrugged community service cant be too wonderful this time of year what do they have you doing shoveling sidewalks at rowan house cleaning the dog shit off the ski trails i can make that go away youre the one put it there in the first place was i the one who broke into that laundry to steal chemicals dont put that on me elbie banged on the inside glass of the door to the garage and held up a threering binder crabtree snuffed out his cigarette and shuffled back inside walt trailing behind walt took the manufacturers product descriptionthe sheet included a print of the tread patternand thanked elbie there was no mistaking its similarity to the tire tread in fionas photo as he climbed back into the cherokee walt caught a glimpse of crabtrees bruised face through the filthy gray glass of the garage doors myra walts sisterinlaw sat on the only free chair in walts crowded office pushed back into a corner against a bookshelf she faced his desk her skinny legs crossed a solemn expression dominating her shrunken face her awkwardly cropped brown hair was held out of her eyes with a pink plastic clip brown eyeliner was smudged over her right eye to what do i owe the pleasure he asked giving her a peck on the cheek as he crossed to his desk she returned the kiss and then grabbed his arm and worked the thumb of her left hand against his cheek to remove the lipstick left behind you look tired i am walt answered and im busy myra a lot on my plate hed received an update from search and rescue forty percent of the mountain below the drop had been searched with no sign of the missing skier he didnt want to say how she looked and he didnt want to get her talking once started she was like an avalanche there had been a time three years ago back before the death of walts brother when shed had some weight to her breasts and hips had even turned a few heads but grief had freezedried her and there was no reconstituting that original myra roberts death had cost walt toohis marriage among other things myra kicked the office door closed walt rarely shut his office door he could almost hear the gossip begin on the other side of it you asked kevin about something going on at school im talking to a bunch of the kids he said just spoke to taylor crabtree a few minutes ago you could have told me its kind of quiet right now i asked kevin to keep it between us if youre turning your nephewmy soninto an informer id like to know about it and if it gets that far you will walt shuffled some papers you and kevin have dinner plans now we do eight oclock walt smiled good girls okay nikki needs a new coat emilys growing out of her boots he looked up exasperated i suck as a father not true work is taking over again it goes in cycles you know that youre tired give me the girls for a couple days catch a movie or something yeah right you cant be everything for everyone theres no one complaining but you the girls are happier youre better off than you were with gail around at least things are consistent thats a major improvement she picked some lint off her sweater have you cleaned out her stuff walt hit her with an icy stare i cant myra not yet thats where it starts walt i offered before i can do this for you you come home from work its done he shook his head pursed his lips no thanks openended offer lets change the subject she stirred he hoped she might get up and leave but it wasnt to be and what about the primary what if you lose myra asked walt closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose he dreaded the election cycle every four years like a plague have you thought about what happens if you lose this election myra im a little busy for this its not as if there are other sheriff jobs in this valley if you and gail sell the house and you end up unemployed youre going to be forced out of the valley like every other worker who can afford these prices anymore then what will the court let you take the girls out of state courts love the mother the mother doesnt want them not now she doesnt but just wait until she sees you with another woman sees you happy shell do anything to stop that thats not going to happen anytime soon he said then itll be when you challenge her for custody but the day is coming when shes going to regret all this mark my word he swallowed that one away hoisted a pile of pink messages ill figure it out ive got a ton of work here myra you need this election ill give it more thought well talk about it at dinner she stood no one could take that chair for too long you give me the word ill have every trace of her out of that house in twenty minutes and she meant it walt was en route to randy a kers cabin when the call came in kira tulivich the missing bridesmaid was in emergency at st judes he reached fiona and asked her to meet him there she wandered in through the front door about fourthirty this morning the attending desk nurse told walt she didnt know who she was or where she was the nurse continued and there was some confusion on our end in contacting you as i understand it because we thought we might be dealing with a minor weve cleaned her up and examined her brought in a sane nurse sexual assault nurse examiner this told walt all that he wanted to know she gave us her name about an hour ago shes nineteen doesnt want her family notified and we have to honor that you do but i dont he said well let them know the nurse seemed relieved he placed a call to nancy and asked her to inform the family as fiona came through the doors he guessed they had fifteen to twenty minutes before the onslaught they waited quietly in seats alongside a set of automatic doors that errantly reacted to the slightest motion walt felt paralyzed reeling over marks disappearance a tall artificial tree stood in the corner of the waiting room its dustcolored silk leaves looking pathetic one of the seat cushions bore the artistic efforts of a child with a purple marker the walls were covered in a sand brown corduroy fabric youre awfully quiet she said i called the hailey mortuary on the way up here marks never called they sat in silence walt checked his watch then the wall clock then his watch again i dont love the idea of photographing this woman cant the doctors do that the nurses yes youll only be shooting her face and hands and belongings believe me the quality of their pictures leaves a lot to be desired and youre the best weve got im the only one youve got i have a hidden agenda im required to have a woman deputy in the room with me and you were the closest last time i checked walt i was also a civilian consider yourself deputized seriously its done i want a badge she said and a car with a siren so noted they were shown into a brightly lit examination room that held an array of colorful machines hung from stainless steel stands yards of clear plastic tubing and three boxes of differentcolored examination gloves fiona saw the young womans face and gasped her reaction turned walt toward her listen if you cant handle this its not that she countered in a whisper i know her walt from the wedding last nights wedding on the dance floor she was there for heavens sake can you do this he asked of course the girls knees were raised beneath a white cotton sheet adorned with pale blue bees her head elevated by several pillows beneath the blotchy complexion and runny nose she was a pretty girl of nineteen but with a tormented sadness in her dull eyes that cut to the quick her red hair was a tangled mess her makeup was smeared down her face there were bundles of oversized paper bags on a rolling table to the left of the bed her clothes and belongings one of those bags would contain a bedsheet she would have stood on while undressingwalt wanted a look at any debris that had fallen off her the nurse was an attractive woman in her late forties wearing the name tag hope on the chest of her scrubs she spoke in a dry husky voice her behavior when we admitted her was consistent with date rape catatonic possibly a result of shock but more likely the drugs i wouldnt be surprised to find either rohypnol or ketamine bloods are cooking in the lab injuries are consistent with oral anal and vaginal penetration well run a rape kit on her next but that can take hours i was told to wait for you guys first id like to talk to her if possible walt explained and ive asked deputy kenshaw to take a few picturesface and hands ive got no problem with that she leaned over the victim kira the police are here the girl squinted open bloodshot blue eyes she didnt focus well her pupils were completely dilated making him think of roman death masks with coins placed over the eyes walt kept his voice low he made introductions can i ask you a few questions kira i dont remember anything she said sounding doped she took a sip of water from a straw offered by the nurse tears followed tracks down her cheeks sometimes we know more than we think whats the last thing you recall we were at whiskeys dancing then i woke up in this car she pinched her eyes shut tightly he dropped me out front i think he walt asked the girl do you know whoever drove you she opened her eyes and looked at walt as if shed never seen him who are you walt reintroduced himself and fiona did you get a good look at the man that dropped you off do you know him kira she stared right through him a friend family someone from the wedding he asked he thought hed lost her her eyes rolled up and her lids closed her chest rose and fell heavily kbs she whispered almost inaudibly kbs was a burrito shop in town two restaurants one in hailey one in ketchum someone you know from kbs walt asked a jolt of energy pulsing through him her head rocked faintly side to side or maybe she had just nodded off a person who works there kbs her lips moved silently kbs walt repeated back to her her head moved infinitesimally she just nodded yes he asked fiona who shrugged kira a minute or two passed it seemed much longer my two cents the nurse said walt nodded the bruising indicates violent assault this wasnt a frat house rape or if it was it was multiple partners it was a violent assault if that helps you any i need her last twelve hours walt said his voice cracking its important i doubt youll get it not if the bloods come back positive for rohypnol may i walt said indicating the girls hands he donned a pair of gloves and a pair of glasses then picked up her limp right hand leaning close he asked fiona for some photographs and she went to work she was bound he said addressing the nurse wire or plastic tie youll scrape the fingernails as part of the kit absolutely id like her fingernails clipped and bagged please if thats possible of course he indicated the paper bags on the stand her dress a piece of panty hose shoes ive held off on the rape kit as i said she sounded a little defensive shes wearing a strapless bra it was not in place and ive left it where it was theres bruising visible on both breasts no underwear probably torn off during the attack the possibility of evidence left behind at the scene sparked a moment of optimism in him alcohol was also involved the nurse said interrupting she tested pointonefour upon arrival she answered walts inquisitive expression we ran a breathalyzer as part of admittance pointonefour walt said thats juiced well over the limit a good wedding i suspect agreed the nurse walt and fiona exchanged a glance concerned over the chain of evidence fiona donned a pair of surgical gloves and photographed the clothing and personal effects in the bags without removing them you never can have too much documentation walt said fiona went about this methodically bag to bag i still need her last twelve hours walt repeated as if no one had heard him the first time what about security cameras i know there are some here outside er the nurse said im not aware of any out front but maybe no one beats a woman and then drives her to the hospital fiona said with the sound of authority that just doesnt happen thats why we need the driver walt said if he wasnt involved why abandon her the nurse crossed her arms tightly and looked at the girl sympathetically unfortunately sheriff i dont think shes going to tell you much then maybe this will fiona said pointing into the white paper evidence bag walt saw two dirty highheeled satin shoes mud he said the shoes were caked in it she didnt just step in some road sludge fiona said she sank up to her ankles her legs are the same the nurse gently and carefully pulled up the sheet to reveal the girls lower legs they were splattered with dried mud but the ground is frozen solid fiona said has been for a couple days at least a week or more she ran off several photographs of the shoes in the bag then glanced up at walt so where was she the icy surface of the roads carried a thin skim of melt walt drove cautiouslythere was little more embarrassing than the sheriff needing to be towed out of a snowbank ketchum the town that serviced the sun valley hotels and condominiums was nestled at the base of the ski mountain in the s the northfacing slopes had been developed along warm springs creek and a likenamed road surrounded by desirable real estate warm springs continued as a dirt track for some twenty miles past the small village of ski shops and restaurants that had grown to service the condominiums and second homes a hundred years earlier the road had provided access to small mines that had never proved lucrative despite the avalanches that closed the road regularly in winter a few daring souls had built past board ranch which for generations had been the last stop on the road theyd left fionas subaru at the hospital ostensibly because of the remote location and the treacherous road conditions but there was an undercurrent of something more to her request for the ride a sense she had something on her mind walt even more socially incompetent than usual couldnt find a way to prime the pump fiona tried to pick up the slack couldnt it just be that they wanted to grieve as a family together that theyve gone off on a retreata friends ranchto pull themselves together possible he said but i dont know the road wound through stands of lodgepole pine spruce and aspen all covered in a dusting strong sunlight slanting through the limbs forced harsh shadows onto the undisturbed rolling white carpet of fresh snow a pair of magpies flew across the road and landed on an old rail fence high overhead a jets vapor trail cut a pure white line across the rich blue sky times like this she said i could just keep driving she caught herself embarrassed by the sentiment opened her mouth to say something but then coughed out a selfconscious laugh and turned toward the side window its real pretty walt said he wondered if his boot would fit in his mouth along with his foot he fourwheeled following car tracks out to some natural hot springs fiona remained in the car as walt surveyed the area the yearround hot springs were well known to locals it made sense that a drunken wedding or halloween party might have driven out and skinnydipped during a snowstorm made sense that this might have been where some guy had assaulted kira tulivich out where no one would hear her screams to walts disappointment he found no signs of recent activity around the pools no mud with no tracks leading to the pools and no sign of the telltale mud walt had to rethink his theory another mile out warm springs road they reached randys cabin it had been part of the board ranch a cattleandhorse operation that had gone bust in the s the owners had wisely retained the property selling off fiftyyear leases most of which had been sublet a dozen times by now its eight hundred acres lay directly in the shadow of bald mountain a satellite dish hung beneath the southfacing eave and somehow broke the romanticism of the setting walt and fiona followed tracksfresh tracksto the cabins door they found it unlocked which was not at all surprising until recently locals had commonly left their keys in the ignition while at the grocery store on frigid days cars were left running out in the parking lot much of that had changed with the white flight from los angeles in the early s celebrities had followed their affluent friends and agents whod come to idaho in response to the riots and wildfires with sun valley in the tabloids ten years of constant development had transformed a modestly popular ski resort into an enclave of the very rich and very famous all of which had pushed locals like randy aker to less expensive housing on the outskirts of the town start shooting when youre ready walt said banging the snow off his boots and stepping inside im going to look around i want everything in here documented anything and everything they stood in a single open room with a woodstove in the righthand corner a small love seat facing it a tv on a low table viewable from the couch bookshelves along the near wall crowded with videos dvds and books a small kitchen was just beyond its ushaped countertops framing a butcherblock island a small table for two that backed up to the love seat the bedroom and bath were to the left electric baseboard heat fought to keep the temperature in the low sixties the woodstove no doubt contributing when lit walt kept his coat zipped but removed his winter gloves in favor of a pair of latex looking for anything in particular fiona asked he shrugged well know when we find it she started making pictures her camera flashes annoying him to the left of the front door was a narrow harvest table and a laptop computer more flashes dont you think its a little weird for a veterinarian to have animal heads on his walls there was a bull elk a buck deer and more of a surprise the head of a mountain goat a protected animal anyone localand the akers are localhunt they do it for food for tradition because their granddads taught them to i still think its strange she said they heal them monday through friday and kill them on the weekends i doubt theyd see it that way walt said having trouble taking his eyes off the goat head mountain goat hunts were by lottery with only a few tags sold each year and they were the most expensive tags offered along with bighorn sheep and moose he thought he would have heard from mark if randy had bagged a goat considering the dust on the elk and deer the goat was a recent trophy he searched all the kitchen cabinets the refrigerator and oven knowing people hid things in strange places he tapped the plank flooring listening carefully for a hollow sound if the rumors about randys illegal poaching were true walt expected to find some evidence the goat head wasnt proof of anything he wanted a bank account checkbook or a cashbox he planned to take the laptop with him you know anything about radio collar hunting he asked fiona as she clicked off more shots isnt that where these rich golfer types hire someone to tree a cougar then fly out to shoot it exactly the guide uses dogs to hunt down the game it can take days when the dogs get a cougar treed they look up at it barking and keeping it there the poachers follow the signal to the tree they phone their clientit can take most of a day for him to get therethen he climbs out of the helicopter and is handed a rifle he shoots the cougar then flies off single shot ten minutes max the cat is taxidermied and shipped to him a few months later and thats called hunting its called poaching the collars are illegal to use and the cats require a tag from fish and game so the whole thing is one violation after another a hundredthousanddollar fine and up to five years in prison so its an expensive way to hunt the client pays about ten grand an animal why are you telling me this randys name surfaced in a bust in eastern washington it reached me through a friend word was hed begun taking clients on his own and that kind of thing can get a man killed out here and mark probably knew he has his ear to the ground that couldnt have been easy and youre looking for a possible connection she said we are yes thats right im deputized dont let it go to your head you want the contents of the kitchen cabinets she asked why not he answered walt searched the tiny bedroom and small bath while fiona sparked flashes in the kitchen frustrated by a lack of evidence or even anything interesting he climbed on a chair and lifted up all three game heads in succession hoping an envelope or paperwork might have been hidden behind the trophies all he got was dusty heres a curiosity fiona called out walt joined her in the kitchen she pointed to the kitchen cabinets box of nongluten pancake mix several boxes of pasta also glutenfree and a breakfast cereal all corn lots of rice and rice noodles no pretzels or chips so hes glutenintolerant walt said wheres the crime in that check it out sherlock the toe of her boot pointed at an open drawer there were some potatoes a bag of onions and a loaf of bread whats he doing with the loaf of bread if he cant eat gluten just because he doesnt eat it doesnt mean he doesnt serve it but shed raised his curiosity he bent down and retrieved the loaf from the drawer and its moldy to boot probably forgot he even had it he balanced and bounced the loaf in his hand a couple of times weighing it unusually heavy i want a record of this he said as he placed the loaf on the cutting board he didnt like that he had missed this liked it even less that she had pointed it out to him but there was no changing that now and he wasnt going to ignore it simply because she had brought it to his attention though the thought crossed his mind pictures of you opening a loaf of bread seriously just shoot it please she ran off a series of shots as walt unfastened the plastic clip and opened the wrapper his gloved hand reached in and pulled out the first few slices the center of the loaf had been hollowed out a brick of money wrapped in stretch plastic wrap filled the cavity click click fiona gasped while running off more shots walt peeled back the stretch wrap revealing onehundreddollar bills three inches high walt whistled theres got to be thirty or forty thousand dollars here good lord she said ive never seen that much cash his own little injoke bread dough and thats where he hid it poaching its got to be dirty walt said but hes a doctor dont forget it could be poaching it could be drugs abortions blackmail i suppose and well never know she said what are you talking about walt said irritably of course well know its my job to know to find out dont say things like that youll jinx it you superstitious careful is how i think of it the weirdest things can squirrel an investigation never speak ill of the dead and never ever claim youve got a suspect until the court case is over and hes behind bars sage advice for a freshman deputy just take the pictures watson would you please walt began counting the money walt loved technology he didnt understand it half the time but the beauty of good technology was that he didnt have to understand it just use it his patrolmen were currently taking advantage of a quiet evening by updating the score of monday night football over the police band radio mistakenly thinking their boss off air otherwise they wouldnt have dared do it in fact walt was a seahawks fan so on the ride home he listened in guilty pleasure lisa had been kind enough to stay with the girls while walt had dropped fiona back at her car hed then spent thirty minutes talking to employees at mark and randy akers veterinarian practice jillian davis was marks head nurse and sometime bookkeeper she led walt into the family room where for an additional fee boarding pets were treated to a home environment that included two couches some throw rugs and a television running all the time the rooms popularity with customers spoke to the excesses of sun valley mark had turned wealthy guilt into a profit center for his boarding clinic jillian worked to keep her composure a sturdy woman in her early forties with kind eyes and a severe brow she wore blue scrubs with a pilled cardigan sweater hed caught her at the end of what had to have been a long difficult day he cautioned her that for both their sakes he was going to speak directly warning her that anything discussed must not leave the room she agreed then turned up the television to cover their voices i have circumstantial evidence that randy was involved in poaching he said highstakes stuff probably mountain goat cougar and bear any talk around here to that effect she nodded reluctantly only that talk it came up when our inventory was off incapacitating meds that we rarely use were found to be in short supply so mark knew he made it a statement im sure he suspected as did i to my knowledge no one else and before you ask if mark confronted randy i never heard about it would mark have considered the whole subject matter of hunting tags and fees political did he look at it that way ive heard both of them talk about their childhoods when there were no restrictions on hunting some limits to be sure but the state wasnt running lotteries and such does mark talk politics with you no just business were very busy hereall the time these days was he doing anything political volunteering fundraising not that im aware of did you see anyone anything bothering randy giving him trouble visitors that you wouldnt have expected phone calls nothing like that we all loved randy he was a terrific guy really good with the large animals any conflicts in either of their practices lately threats lawsuits nothing out of the ordinary business was down on randys side he could read it in her face she was holding back but he said she hesitated by talking to me youre helping him jillian you have to believe that marks been up to something it came out of her like a confession she hung her head as if ashamed of herself secretive brooding at times you know how up he usually is that kind of went out of him lately trouble at home no at least i dont think so he spent a lot of time here at the clinic after closing and he wasnt training wasnt doing paperwork the one time i checked on him he was in the lab and he blew up at me for surprising him like that any idea no thats just the thing she said interrupting none hes been spending a lot of time at their cabin in challis been going there a lot lately sometimes overnight was he following randy or something i dont know some of our deliveries hed put them straight into his truck and that was always when hed go north for a day or so do you know what was in those boxes no clue receipts i could check with sally our bookkeeper there might be records walt had forgotten about marks cabin and chastised himself its on francines side the cabin i didnt think they used it some family battle they got embroiled in a relative lived up there didnt he youre right her brother but he moved to maine i think it was this is like a year ago and mark and francine took over caring for the place so hed been going up there to fix it up initially yes but then he and randy started using it to hunt walt said when she failed to finish yeah you knew about that they didnt exactly want that to be public knowledge bad for business ive known mark a long time walt said still angry at himself for having forgotten about the cabin do you know where it is exactly she shook her head randys death was an accident right sure looks like it walt said not wanting to start anything but we have to investigate it anyway they were superclose it doesnt surprise me marks gone off like this tears formed in her eyes they werent the first who else might know walt said about the cabin anyone who works here i doubt it francine of course as she met eyes with walt a spark of realization ignited in hers shes missing too isnt she oh my god you cant find either of them as you said walt reminded keeping his voice level they probably just need a day or two in private to grieve my guess is well find them at the cabin i might give them another day before trying her eyes softened thanking him and she nodded good people she choked out yeah the tears finally spilled and she laughed at herself out of embarrassment saying i thought i was done with this she dabbed her eyes with tissue if sally could get back to me about those deliveries he said will do as walt stood the dozen dogs in the room hurried to him nosing him and whining she laughed we kind of spoil them in here ill say he pet several you might try kira she said excuse me he said mention of the name turned walt around sharply to face jillian marks assistant kira i suppose theres a chance she might know how to find the cabin walt felt it like a blow to his sternum he took a moment to recover to clear his head so that his voice didnt give away his surprise kira tulivich he asked hed left her in the hospital only hours earlier youve already spoken to her kiras marks assistant he tried to keep the shock from his face he had a good deal of practice with such things but this one hit him hard and he was afraid hed shown his cards i didnt know that he said you know she didnt show up today either she paused you dont think mark and kira absolutely not walt said the idea swam around in his head do you no of course not walt needed some time to think this through i doubt she knows anything more than i do jillian said whatever he was up to he wasnt sharing and yes i thought it might have something to do with randyyou know because of the inventory but that was never anything more than a wild hunch his cell phone rang and he chased a decent signal across the room and out the door he took the call in a back lot used for animal exercise and training his office informed him that americell had traced the emergency call that had sent search and rescue into the mountains the night before the owner of the cell phone that had made the call had a billing address in west ketchum he returned to the door thanked jillian and asked that she keep their discussion private you know about this valley and rumors he said mark doesnt need that on top of everything else i wouldnt think of it she said as walt pulled down bird drive in west ketchum a kpd patrol car pulled away from the corner and followed him out of courtesy hed called ahead to his friend cory limon the ketchum police chief detailing his intention of making an arrest and cory had assigned the backup walt and one of the kpd officers approached the front door of a grayandwhite boardandbatten singlefamily residence while the other officer sludged through the snow to cover the back the clutter of snowboards mountain bikes and other gear on the covered porch suggested a rental property walt rapped sharply on the door and called out sheriffs office open the door please it took another try before the door finally was opened by a girl in a tightfitting tshirt black lycra stretch pants and gray wool socks walt and the officer stepped inside for the time being walt ignored the faint smell of pot looked past the clutter of pizza boxes and the clumps of clothes on the floor a dormitory room may i help you she asked a little taken aback by their entering im looking for charles jones walt said glancing around casey she shouted over her shoulder then more softly can i help you do you live here walt asked no just a friend we all went boarding today amazing powder you might want to take off walt said im only interested in charlescasey but officerwalt read the mans name tag shanklin might have an interest in the incense got it she said and immediately went searching for boots and a jacket she was out of the house before the boy arrived downstairs charles jones yeah he said he was a gangly boy with curly unkempt hair a skiers tan and a failed attempt at facial hair like most of the kids his age that walt encountered he did not cower at the sight of law enforcement he carried his shoulders straight and high and his mouth remained small as he talked like hed been sucking on a lemon your cell phone placed an emergency call to the countys erc the emergency response centerat six thirtytwo pm yesterday the boy appeared to be chiseled out of marble for a moment he didnt breathe and didnt blink think carefully casey walt warned can i call you casey yes sir the shoulders hunched forward eye contact was broken think carefully about how you answer these next few minutes are critical do you understand me yes sir your cell phone bills are being sent to this address walt said thats how we found you youve cost this county time and money the money will have to be repaid but whether or not we treat this as a crime well that depends on you and how forthcoming you are yes sir was it a prank a dare jones looked up his face a pool of shame it wasnt was it walt said a thing like this you get one chance and one chance only that chance is to tell the truth you lie to me son and youll pay for it for the rest of your life so you want to think about that okay you want to think about your parents your friends your family and how this is going to reflect on all of them because there are no second chances you lie to me and youll start a progression of events that youll look back and regret forever i need to know you understand that yes sir all right then there are two ways to do this i can arrest you right here and now if i do officer shanklin here is likely going to search your residence and that may complicate your situation judging by the odor in the air the situations of others living with you as well so thats one way the other is to talk this out for a few minutes for you to tell me the truth for me to decide where to go from here you agree to do that and officer shanklin goes back to his cruiser and waits for me do you understand its just you and me but im only interested in door number two if youre interested in sharing the truth with me in my line of work you get so you can spot the truth son so dont even think about trying to lie to me the choice is yours door one or door two times up so which is it shanklin shut the door on his way out walt took a seat on the spongy couch moving an xbox controller out of the way jones took the dilapidated overstuffed chair across the coffee table from him you all set walt asked the boy nodded did you make that call to yes sir was it the truth no sir there was no skier left behind on galena no walt fought back the emotions that set his teeth grinding whyd you do it the boy wouldnt answer walt asked a second time i was paid by the government the government walt said unable to disguise his astonishment a guy from you know i dont know some agency he told me but i forget exactly which one he said its like routine to check the response time of search and rescue teams that with caller id and everything the government cant make the calls because then people know its a test so they ask common citizenslike meto make the calls for them you were paid to make the call exactly then they time the search and rescue his voice trailed off what are you saying exactly this guy was for real right walt removed his notebook from his uniforms breast pocket can you describe him please i dont know about my height i guess khakis coat and tie mustache kinda short hair your coloryou know kinda sandy and gray normallooking dude he told you what to say walt stated gray he wondered yeah said it had to be done a certain way to make all the tests comparable he had it typed out he had the message you were to read typed out yeah and you read it exactly as hed written it yes and do you have that i dont know card sheet of paper currently in your possession he took it back of course he did walt muttered whats that nothing did i fuck up or something how much did he pay you for this service a cnote a man offered you a hundred dollars to make a phone call and you didnt question it i questioned it all right i demanded to see the money up front walt hurried out to the car and radioed in to call off the search he took a minute to settle himself reeling over the wasted manpower and the risk to the searchers when he returned inside his voice was irrationally calm how bout credentials did you demand or did he show you any credentials confirming he was with the government he flipped open some id when he first came up to me not that i took that good a look or anything i wasnt going to blow off some government dude and then when he got explaining it it sounded good to me but not too good to be true whats that would you recognize him if you saw him again a photo maybe i dont know i guess so lay off the pot for a while okay i need your memory clear if the boy could have dissolved into the chair he would have eyes to the dirty carpet chin down he said nothing for a moment then he looked up i take it he wasnt with the government mr jones youre not to leave the county without my permission you do so and you will be considered at flight is that clear is that legal you want to involve the courts im happy to do so its clear the boy said i want a written statement from you exactly what happened where when who what every detail you can recall accent clothes mannerisms expressions shoes car glasses glovesi dont care how insignificant you think it might have been i want that on my desk in hailey by six pm this evening is that clear yes sir no excuses no delays no makeups six pm does it have to be typed jones asked walt shook his head in frustration it has to be truthful i dont care if its a podcast i just want to know what happened in your words to the best of your ability he dug himself out of the couch and made for the door and id lose the weed if i were you ketchum police will be watching you now he headed out the door and as he did so he tugged on his jacket against the cold the process of pulling the jacket up onto his shoulders instantly took him back to randys coming out of the pickup truck the night before randy and mark had been throwing jabs about randy borrowing the coat walt recalled randys complaining about the smell of the winter jacket and marks chastising him for forgetting a coat of his own in the middle of a blizzard it had been marks coat that randy had been wearing up on the mountain a loaner a coat carrying marks scent not randys walt had all but proven that dogs had been involvedthe prints found alongside the tire track what if randy had been pursued by dogs meant to target mark we never talk politics mark had tried to discuss something walt had joked about it had failed to listen the same complaint hed gotten from gail on her way out the door tuesday roy coats left the dogs behind this time he didnt need to track some guy through a snowstorm he didnt need a cage to hide a girl pulling a sled he rode the snowmobile a yamaha phazer several miles up sunbeam road pulled it into the trees and locked and chained it to some this was the middle of nowherefifty miles past galena summit in a national forest of four million acres so vast that it included the onemillionacre river of no return wilderness area the largest wilderness in the continental united states he could have called upon the others to help him but he was the best shot he pursued this alone during the work on the girl with the client in the other room cleaning himself up coats had made promises to her that hed be gentler than the visitor had been hed won a moment of compromise on her part shed mentioned the docs frequent trips to a cabin in challis she didnt know anything about any sheep but knew hed been hauling mailorder gear up there coats had still done her but he hadnt yanked her hair or slapped her around the way the client had now he snowshoed the final mile following nothing more than his internal compass working from memory having viewed a topographical map only once he ascended a steep mountain ridge holding just below the tree line and then dropped down into thick forest as the cabin came into view he picked up the fresh tracks of an elk herd and stayed among them for the sake of covering his own prints in the snow he carried a cheytac intervention m slung over his right shoulder the weapon carried a nightforce scope which could be upgraded all the way to a digital device that plugged into a pda and gave the weapon an effective range of twentyfive hundred yardswell over a milethat accounted for wind speed and atmospheric pressure the newspapers called it a sniper rifle to enthusiasts like himself it was an antipersonnel rifle providing longrange softtarget interdiction hed replaced the muzzle brake with an opsinc suppressor it wouldnt scare a chickadee in the next tree over if he had to use it his choice was not to use it because it would be one hell of a tricky double shot he had it sighted for two hundred yards if needed his target would never have a clue to his position the target would not hear a thing until the wet thwack of his own shredded flesh thankfully the contracted inventory included only the adults and excluded any children he didnt have any desire to chalk a kid tied onto the left side of his day pack was a ds cartridgefired rifle that he often employed in his private client work with his special loads and the fourpower scope he could accurately project a dart from one hundred twentyfive yards a singleshot rifle it weighed eight pounds but was worth every ounce the ds was his weapon of choice for the work that lay ahead but it was the cheytac that made him feel secure he rubbed his sore knuckles through the glove mulling over his recent mistakes how hed killed the wrong brother was beyond him the dogs didnt make such errors he pushed that from his mind and stayed with the elk tracks huge halfmoons the size of horse hooves as hard as it was to get past his mistakes they had given him time to rethink his own priorities he had his own uses for the doctor he climbed a tree to verify his position keeping the pack and both rifles with him from his position thirty feet up he had an unobstructed view of a cirque of rock to the south bejeweled and glistening in the spectacular afternoon sunlight to the east a semiforested expanse that trailed down toward the small town of challis just the roofs of a few small buildings visible dead center looking southeast stood a small log cabin in a sea of white alone at the top of an escarpment looking to him like a mole on a mans bald head carefully scanning the area with a pair of binoculars he spotted the elk herd slightly north watering at a spring above the bald mans left ear a mighty herd at thatthirty to fifty head he located the herds only buck carrying a monstrous twelvepoint rack that hed have loved to have on the wall of his own cabin but that was for another day he returned to the snow and moved deeper into the forest working his way silently to the very edge of the trees less than fifty yards from the front of the cabin and the apron of snow that surrounded it the snow was deep so he climbed fifteen feet into a lesser tree and found a perch he sighted the cheytac and strapped it to a branch so that it was firmly locked onto the lowerleft corner of a window to the left of the cabins front door at this distance he could have shot a screw out of the door hardware if hed chosen to next he readied the dart rifle directly alongside the cheytac slinging a pouch at his waist carrying four extra darts it was a double shot the cheytac would shatter the window so the dart could travel through smoothly and on target a difficult technical shot that only made it all the more attractive to him he had no plans to kick in the door playing bruce willis was definitely plan b patience was a hunters true gift his best tool the ruse he doubted he could coax the good doc to come outside onto the porch but that was why hed brought the two rifles the double shot would do the trick he rechecked the sights of both riflesthe cheytac was strapped in place the dart rifle free he spent fifteen minutes getting the setup just right the cheytac would be triggered with his left hand the ds aimed and fired from his right hed have just the one chance because of the single dart after that like it or not hed have to pull a bruce willis on the cabin the narrator inside his head favored this second option the hunter opted for the first with a piece of velcro holding the barrel of the dart rifle in place coats produced a doublereed elk bugle from his pack and held it to his lips the bull elks bugled when in rut and though the season had just passed the snow had come early and it was not impossible that a male might still be out here sounding his call a vet would know this only the most effective bugling would ensure success but he was a professional hunter few understood the art of duplicating the wailing oboelike sound of an adult bull elk as he did he believed any vet any hunter would be drawn by the chance to see a bull elk up close there were few animals as beautiful and regal the procedure took some practice sound the bugle secure the device in his belt reach for the ds and pull his eye to scope bugle belt rifle scope he waited he tried another dry run it took five seconds for him to get the bugle stashed and his eye to scope it would take a person in that cabin at least a few seconds to get to a window upon hearing it bugle belt rifle scope he was ready he let out an enormously loud bugle quavering with tremolo more of a shriek than a cry his eye focused on the cabin window waiting waiting no one came another try a second loud buglea trill up and down an outoftune scale a screech like fingernails on a blackboard eye to the scope light shifted on the far side of the window it was an incredibly subtle change but something was moving inside the cabin coats exhaled and then drew in a deep breath his index finger moving from the trigger guard to in front of the trigger demonstrating the patience of a martial arts master our hunter slows his bodily functions in apprehension of the shot steady his trigger finger never falters as he holds himself as still as a statue another change of light a slight movement of the curtain there the curtain was pushed aside seen through the scope the hand looked gigantic a head moved into the frame a man middleaged he could see the dayold whisker stubs on the mans cheeks aker the scopes crosshairs stopped a few centimeters from dead center he trained this magnified empty space on akers chest his own heart thumping wildly his left hand came up and found the cheytacs trigger he had yet to breathe still working on the same breath he squeezed left then right the cheytacs recoil ripped it off the limb but that scraping sound was the only noise it made the ds popped sounding like one strong handclap through the scope he saw flashes of blinding light as the window shattered pieces of glass rained down both inside and out the curtain fluttered then nothing no indication of success no indication of failure nothing he jacked the cheytac into place ready to unload the magazine if need be if hed missed with the dart if the doc made a run for it he waited one minute two he had no choice time for uncle bruce the barren snowcovered hill rose steeply from the locked gate like a bubble of shaving cream a primitive road had been cut into the winding hillside jutting out like a frown walt saw what might have been tracksit could have been game or peoplebut there was too much drifting snow to know for certain the top of mark akers four hundred acres abutted the western edge of the challis national forest a quarter mile to the west ran yankee fork road a dirt track snowed in for the winter that connected the town of challis to the abandoned mining town of sunbeam to the east were a few sprawling ranches this was gods country the last vestiges of community before the national forest spread north and east for hundreds of square miles no sign this gates been opened recently brandon complained you still want to go through with this a sharp but distant rifle report sounded smallgauge walt thought as he connected the sound to the one hed heard the night of the search like a limb snapping if anything was the wild west it was challis idaho the sound of a rifle even out of hunting season would normally have been of no interest the reverberating dull echo prevented walt from determining the direction of origin but its proximity to akers cabin put a spur in his backside hurry it had taken him all morning to round up brandon and to make the threehour drive the sound of a gunshot fueled his impatienceit made sense that mark might hide his family herewith the property listed under francines maiden name there was little chance it would be connected by others to markbut maybe they hadnt been the only ones to figure it out they vaulted the gate walt pulled his snowshoes through and was strapping them on as brandon beat him to it and started up the unplowed road walt charged off and quickly caught up the technique more familiar to him larger and heavier brandon sunk down more deeply and couldnt find a rhythm to his mechanics within a minute or two walt found his pace and passed brandon brandon then leaned into the hill and regained lost ground pulling even with walt it didnt escape walt that they were acting like schoolboys but it didnt slow him any either after a quarter mile of climbing steam pouring off them and just as they rounded the last of three ascending turns the buckle on walts snowshoe popped loose and he went down into a faceplant brandon glanced back but didnt slow down walt sat up and tried to make sense of the equipment failure he couldnt find the buckle he knotted the straps together as tightly as possible and took a few steps it held ahead of him brandon was closing in on the tiny cabin it had a covered porch that wrapped around two of its sides a stovepipe jutted out of the roof no smoke coming from it the one window on this side was blocked with a curtain hold up he hollered to brandon procedure dictated they approach the structure with one man covering but his deputy took this as walts attempt to fix the race and continued ahead stand down deputy walt tried again brandon glanced back grinned and then bent over to loosen the snowshoes he came out of them fast and climbed up onto the porch banging a shoulder into a wind chime light flashed from the spinning metal and the tinkle of bells carried on the wind a spurt of blood burst from brandon s shoulder and the exterior wall of the cabin splintered with a thwack he spun reached out and pulled down the wind chimes with him as he fell to the deck tommy walt dove into the snow rolled onto his back and dumped his gloves in order to lose the snowshoes he fumbled with the straps finally kicking the snowshoes loose beretta in hand he bellycrawled toward the cabin stay down he shouted and dont move he stole a glimpse up the hill toward the woods believing the shot had come from somewhere out there fresh tracks led through the snow in that direction then he lowered his head and continued his belly crawl staying below the snows surface he crawled paused listened it felt as if the cabin was moving away from him as hard as he crawled he didnt seem to get any closer fuck it was brandon from the porch stay down walt shouted im hit stay down and dont move shut the fuck up im hit im coming the fuck you are hell pick you off thered been only the one shot it offered two possibilities a shoot and run or a shoot and hunt to the death walt needed cover he saw the move as he finally drew closer he jumped up onto the deck spun back first to the house tucked himself into a ball hands over his face and vaulted backward through the window the glass exploded and rained down around him he hit a table caught a lamp with his toe and brought both down on top of him he scooted away from the glass came to a standing position and rushed the front door the other window was shattered too glass on the inside had that happened when brandon had been shot he didnt recall the sound of breaking glass only the bells of the wind chime he reached the open window and peered out past the jagged frame brandon lay below him faceup the mans glove was gripped high on his left arm which was bloodcovered and still oozing you okay dandy brandon answered with a grimace im going to pull the door open were going to do this fast on three you with me three brandon said and he started to slide on his back toward the door shit walt said as he yanked open the door reached out and found the mans right shoulder he dragged himthe man was heavythrough the door and slammed it shut motherfucker hurts said brandon goddamn it he ran through every expletive he knew as walt opened the jacket and worked it off the mans left arm as wounds went it was pretty awful the bullet appeared to have missed the bone but the exit wound was twice the size of the entrance leaving a hole the size of a golf ball the bleeding was severe possibly arterial the wound wouldnt kill him but the blood loss might with brandon compressing the wound walt stripped a shoelace out of the mans boot no brandon said im going to tie it off the hell you are brandon said once we do that we cant go back the toxinsll kill me if we loosen it and if we dont they take the arm fuck that compression for now we only go to tourniquet if i pass out and you see no other choice there is no other choice im not losing my arm sheriff nice try tommy no fucking way ive done the course sheriff im not losing this arm unless i have to walt looked around the room as if someone might arrive to help him youve got to go after him brandon said the hell i do yes you do brandon couldnt point so he shook his head in the direction of the door it took walt a moment to see the plastic dart canister wedged into the intersection of the wall and floor they got him sheriff thats what we heard with that first shot were maybe what fifteen twenty minutes behind him walt processed everything brandon was saying and his eyes were telling him darted him inside the cabin i dont buy that who the fuck knows thats a dart and unless im mistaken no ones home youre bleeding out i can get down the hill its easier than going up bullshit give me the keys this isnt going to happen tommy im going with you well use the radios brandon said ill keep talking as long as im conscious you keep heading up there i go silent then sure come back and be the hero give it a rest theres procedure tommy im evacuating the wounded youre pursuing the hostage the first twelve hours sheriff you know the drill if someone took mark theyll be on snowmobile im on foot tommy and when i get down to town ill send a deputy up yankee fork on a snowmobile looking for you got it all planned out do you yes sir i do marks a vet the dart could be his walt said could be gripping his arm tightly brandon said ill need help with the snowshoes and youll need a pair of gloves were going to clean and wrap the wound walt said we can get a lot of compression with the wrap well fucking hop to it brandon said hes got a head start on you walt passed him the keys walt followed the trail of packed snow for only the first fifty yards then gave one final look back at brandon before cutting to his right and entering into a stand of towering lodgepole pine that formed the southwestern boundary of the national forest he had first learned to track in boy scouts but where other kids picked up footballs or soccer balls walt had spent his schoolday afternoons in the wilderness with his head down a man named jeff longfeather a blackfoot indian who worked as a farmhand for his maternal grandfather had seen the boys passion and had taught him the natural state of indigenous flora and fauna the different ways and speeds that mud dried the forces behind impact prints taught him the feeding watering and mating habits of big game how to bugle an elk to within fifty yards how to construct a blind to survive in the woods for days at a time eating pine nuts and edible roots and burying his own scat in the process walt had come to respect the environment in ways that wouldnt be popular for twenty more years but his reverence had paid off jeff longfeather turned a wetbehindtheears boy scout into a fine tracker who could stalk a bull elk or deer for days without revealing himself walt had not stayed with scouting but hed visited the family farm weekends and school holidays and had come to view jeff as something of an older brother spiritual adviser and mentor he disappeared now into the woods his mission twofold to track the man who had kidnapped mark aker for there was only one set of snowshoe tracks coming and going and to make certain no one tracked him brandon s ramblings crackled on in his earpiece as his deputy descended from akers cabin toward the cherokee the reception wasnt great but he continued to hear brandon s voice which was all that mattered the snowpack was thinner inside the woods most of it caught by branches he doubled back on his own tracks removed the snowshoes and climbed rocks to break his own trail from being followed he climbed trees for surveillance and never left the confines of the forest even when the tracks he was following reached across acres of snowfield he located and climbed two trees that had clearly been used to scout the cabin theyd been climbed by a strong man with a goodsized leg spreada man with coarse black hair judging by the strands he found stuck to the pine sap at the top of one of the trees he found a rubbed spot on a stout branch that suggested an object had been braced therea rifle or monocularthe location offering an unobstructed view of the cabins porch brandon had not been shot from such an elevation but the dart on the floor of the cabin lingered in walts mind what was mark involved in why would anyone want first to try to kill and then later kidnap a local veterinarian if hed been willing to shoot brandon why not mark aker why the dart being up a tree helped with radio reception brandon had reached the vehicle and felt able to drive himself into challis they signed off with brandon promising walt a snowmobile on yankee fork road in short time walt returned to the snowfield and stayed parallel to the tracks jeff longfeather had taught him about time and patience where possible he stole into the center of the welltraveled elk trail and reestablished the snowshoe tracksthe man was pulling a heavy sled mark hed clearly made good time establishing himself in walts mind as big and strong he was also an expert with a sniper rifle keeping walt mindful of his cover an hour and a half passed before his radio barked again the challis sheriff and a deputy were waiting nearby on yankee fork road walt discovered some cigarette ash dancing on the snow the butt had been gid or packed out leaving only the rolling worms of ash as evidence the man towing mark had paused here had come back to the sled and done somethinghad administered more drugs maybe or delivered a warning walt followed the tracks and soon met up with two men on snowmobiles they wore sheriff patches a track of a snowmobile towing a sled was evident it headed not toward challis as hed expected but deep into the national forest introductions were made steam poured from walts clothing the two eyed him apprehensively he sensed reluctance in them that he didnt understand riding a snowmobile would chill him down quickly so he took a moment to strip down to his bare chest and change into a fresh capilene undershirt he redressed in his uniform shirt and zipped up his jacket shifting on his feet to get his body heat back the conversation never stopped as he caught up the challis sheriff a man with whom hed had a major fallingout over the killing of a wolf a year earlier there was no love lost between them and he thought that that explained their mutual reluctance the challis sheriff established that theyd crossed no fresh snowmobile tracks this guys headed back the way he came but whats out there walt inquired not much not for a long ways anyway said the sheriff sunbeam or clayton i suppose the deputy said with a bit of a twang his face barely showed out of the tightened hood and ski goggles nothing else between here and there but a shitload of snow and your odd summer ranch on grandfathered parcels the sheriff added would be a hell of a lot faster to head back to town and drive down to clayton than punching through on yankee fork road but the only sure way to know where hes going is to follow the snowmobile track walt said cant argue with that the sheriff said im just saying there aint many places a fella can meet up with highway seventyfive and claytons the most likely of em but not the only one walt said i think we established that the sheriff said indignantly you mind if i borrow one of your machines walt asked ill follow on the trail while you get your guys down to clayton it wouldnt hurt to roadblock seventyfive at the turn to may radios wont do shit in there youve got maybe a mile of coverage nothing more walt tapped his pack satellite phone he said raising a snarl in his counterpart the challis sheriffs office wasnt at the forefront of technology my deputy has the number you sure you want to do yankee fork road the deputy asked one final time there aint nothing out there for thirty miles sheriff walt saw red he didnt like his decisions being questioned hed had that a lot over the past six months people had expected him to fire tommy brandon myra had expected him to dump gails clothes out the front door minutes later he found himself riding the snowmobile at forty miles an hour following in the tread impressions that played out before him it wasnt until he caught a glimpse of himself in the snowmobiles vibrating rearview mirror that he understood the reluctance hed seen on their faces mucus from his nose had frozen in twin lines on his upper lip his eyebrows were white with frost as were his eyelashes and some hairs on his neck and lower ears his cheeks were an unnatural red and some drool was frozen to his chin he looked like a wild mountain man he rubbed his face clean with his glove you couldnt tow a sled at the speed he was going which meant he was making up time but he was riding fast and often blind into the path of a sniper who wasnt shy about shooting cops he began slowing down at every curve and wishing the snowmobile didnt whine like a chain saw announcing his approach inspired by the panoramic view of pristine wilderness the soundtrack from the sound of music played in his headno narration just the gentle strains of julie andrewss belllike voice he took something of a risk in leaving the vet down there in the sled as he climbed a mountain ridge overlooking a long bend in yankee fork road strong winds had blown away the snow leaving scrabble rock and patches of ice which he negotiated with care the ascent is carried out with precision the timing critical as he leaves his captive bound and unconscious far below to make even the slightest mistake now can cost him everything and so he goes about his mission with great care he loved grenades it was well worth the climb to achieve the godlike sense of power associated with kicking an avalanche he carried the cheytac as a measure of precaution he could shoot the eye out of an eagle at half a mile with the thing but it was the two grenades that really warmed his nut sack he stopped several times to catch his breath in the thin air looked down at the snowmobile and sled a quarter mile beyond the turn no one was going to come down this road unless they were after him but if anyone did hed covered the unconscious vet with a blanket to hide the sleds contents people had seriously misjudged the man they took him for a hick and an incompetent but in doing so they had allowed him to overhear the girls interrogation they had given him a way out of this mess the doctor was the witnesshed longed for a simple double cross and his missionhis messagewas saved he sat down on a rock to quiet himself it wouldnt do to handle grenades in this state he smoked a cigarette and took in the scenery his plan was a simple one as a precaution he would kick an avalanche and cover the y in yankee fork road making it impassable snowmobiles would be blocked by a giant wall of ice and rock and to the right a precipitous dropoff no one would get through here except on foot he heard a buzzing in his ears as he removed the concussion grenade from his satchel pulled the pin and heaved it well out into the snowfield moments later he heard its soft cough watched as the center of the slope calved and caved simultaneously an enormous shelf of snow sinking and breaking free from the uniformity above snow rippled as the newly created shelf pushed against the snow below looking like age lines on an elderly face the sounds came next a deep groaning like the awakening of some great beast this was interrupted once again by the buzzing whine of an insect the contained anger pulsing past his ears the crack in the slowly shifting shelf of snow widened then he saw what appeared to be a little black bug shooting along the road and the insect sound took on an entirely new meaning a snowmobile it was barreling down yankee fork road coming from the direction of challis alone it all but ruled out the cops they always traveled in pairs or groups no this was some poor shit out on a nature ride whod chosen the wrong day and the wrong route all at once the snow slid in a massive beautiful display of the raw power of nature it was like a dam bursting he gloried in the moment feeling the earth shuddering at his feet hearing that sound now more like a jet taking off it buried the buzz of the snowmobile wiped out the soundtrack silenced the narrator it moved first as a unit as if the whole side of the mountain were falling but then inertia and momentum collided and a central chute rose in a massive upheaval a wide river of flowing snow rock and ice gorging out the center of the slide and sucking more and more snow and debris down with it two huge trees at the edge of the far hill snapped like matchsticks and were carried down swallowed whole and there still unaware came the black bug of the snowmobile curving slowly around the long bend headed directly into its unforgiving path it began as a shudder as if hed pushed the snowmobile too hard had thrown a belt or burned up some bearings walt felt it first in his legs then his waist and finally some spinal signal reached his brain that told him to look to his left his greatest fear was death by fire with asphyxiation a close second this included drowning but more than drowning being buried in an avalanche hed led enough search and rescue teams both successful and not to know the horror stories and to see the results firsthand if you were lucky enough to survive the churnand few werethen you found yourself in a sea of blackness disoriented and buried alive death came slowly as your body chilled into hypothermia your own breath contaminated what little air existed in your icy tomb and you suffocated thrown first into hallucination and finally a lungbursting death his first thoughts as he saw the mountain collapsing toward him were not thoughts at all but images hed pulled out bodies the faces frozen in looks of madnessterrorridden masks of inescapable panic then for just a fraction of a second above the fluid hillside cascading toward him he made out the silhouetted shape of a man standing on the distant ridgeline it might have been his imagination or wishful thinking wanting to attribute this devils work to a man instead of synchronicity his being in the wrong place at the wrong time it was too big a slide traveling too fast down the hill to try to cross its path the one bit of luck working for walt was that hed slowed considerably as hed headed into the curve cautious of the range of the snipers rifle he was not quite midslide an area that looked to cover about two hundred yards the first boulders of snow tumbled onto and across the cut of the roadbed itself already buried in four feet of fresh snow he jacked the handlebars threw his left leg out and gassed the accelerator fishhooking the snowmobile into an aboutface and cutting a deep rut that threatened to swallow the machine ironically a snowmobile only worked well in deep snow if moving if stopped or slowed significantly it bogged down and was stranded the time consumed in turning it around cost him more chunks of snowtwo and three feet acrossbounded on the road the tremendous grinding sound of the slide overwhelmed him and literally shook the mechanized sled beneath him the avalanche came down the hill not as an arrow but as a snakes tongue its forks faster and more charged than its center beyond the roads manmade twentyfootwide patch of level track the hill dropped away again precipitously covered with trees and rock outcroppings he wasnt going to make it the snowmobile had slowed as a result of the turn and the rush of snow now coming down pushed across the road as a unit shoving walt and the snowmobile sideways out in front of its headlong force he had to make it at least another sixty yards to clear the turn and it wasnt going to happen walt tugged on the handlebars and jumped the sled off the road the snowmobile plowed into a drift and walt came fully off the seat attached only by his bloodless grip behind him the roar was unlike anything hed ever heard the open throat of a monster the vehicle pulled up and out of the drift walt slammed back down onto the seat and twisted the accelerator the full force of the avalanche now only yards behind hima rising wall of debris shoved ahead of its unchecked force above the din he heard the explosions of trees succumbing the speed with which it now traveled dwarfed his own one glance back told him as much there was no outrunning it at an incredible speed increased by the pull of gravity he slalomed the sled down the hillside narrowly missing tree trunks and dodging rocks he tried to back off the accelerator but it was no use the whole hillside was moving out in front of that force like he was riding a carpet being tugged out from under him with the snow that carried him now itself in motion the steering became unresponsive he was no longer in control of the vehiclethe movement of the snow dictated his direction he faced a huge snowcovered rock to his right and a stand of massive trees straight ahead he goosed the accelerator yanked on the steering yokeand nothing happened the snowmobile carried him as if on tracks right for the tree trunks he leaped free and rolled scrambling for the lee behind the rock outcropping it was like swimming in sand the crush of the avalanche lifted the snow beneath him and he rose like riding a wave it firmed as it rose the packed mass out in front shelving up from under the fresh powder he came to his knees like a surfer measured his speed against the fixed position of the intractable rock outcropping and dove never the most athletic person walt nonetheless managed the perfect jump now behind the enormous rock that towered some twenty feet overhead he scrambled on hands and knees to hide in its lee the snowmobile crashed into the trees walt reached the shelter of the rock face hugging himself to the stone and gripping it with both gloves it divided the avalanche the ice and snow flying past in a deafening roar that terrified him more than the snow itself some rocks and chunks of ice flew overhead but landed beyond him the outcropping fully screening him from the downthrust of the slide it seemed to last an hour in all it was just over four minutes walls of snow now rose fifteen feet on either side of him as the avalanche advanced down the hill he thought he would be buried and then without warning it stopped as still as concrete all sound seemed to stop along with it replaced by the quiet calm of a winter forest some wood creaked he heard the chittering of a squirrel followed by the irritated call of a western magpie he slid down to a sitting position on a slight cushion of snow in the protection of the rock and gave a prayer of thanks then suddenly he heard the distinctive buzz of a snowmobile it was running hard traveling away from him fading slowly behind the frantic pulse of blood in his ears walt called out on the satellite phone and a challis deputy picked him up on yankee fork road an hour later once in town the challis sheriff vented his frustration over walts destruction of their property and the dispatching of his men on what turned out to be a wildgoose chase no one towing snowmobiles or matching akers description had been turned up at the nowdefunct roadblocks walts promise to replace the destroyed snowmobile failed to gain him much ground the wolf incident a year earlier lay between them brandon had been driven to a hospital in salmon idaho which as far as walt was concerned was the kiss of death given the communitys isolation the polio vaccine was considered advanced medicine in salmon brandon s only hope was that salmon probably saw plenty of gunshot wounds walt and the sheriff organized a team of four to revisit the akers cabin and collect evidence there was much to be done from photographing tracks the broken window and the cabins interior to searching beneath the trees for shell casings walt called in fionas services and waited the two hours for her arrival it was agreed that walt and fiona could initially work the cabin instead of snowshoeing up everyone teamed up on snowmobiles fiona climbed on behind walt her gloves were too thick for the strap on the seat behind him so she ended up wrapping her arms around his waist and she and walt bounced their way up the road he leaned over his shoulder and shouted above the machines roar everything we have points to a kidnapping she shouted back this thing just gets crazier and crazier walt hadnt told her about the avalanche only the possible abduction and brandon s shooting which seemed enough information to process a few minutes later they entered the cabin and walt propped the broken door shut to try to contain some of the warmth from the propane heater they circled the cabins main room walt pointing out areas he wanted photographed they hadnt been inside but a few minutes when she asked do you know a guy named roger hillabrand i know of him sure extremely wealthy wellconnected i met him at a wedding i was shooting and i need to know this because having worked the floor for one full turn walt directed his attention to the furniture and the walls no reason just wondered i dont believe that he said from the opposite side of the room no reason she repeated women dont mention other men for no reason youre the sheriff that gives you an insiders position when it comes to people like roger hillabrand hes not a serial killer walt said that im aware of thank you now youre mad at me no im not if you want me to be jealous im considering it furthest thing from my mind i promise you she hesitated why would i want you to be jealous anyway my mistake he said it most certainly was government contracts like halliburton that kind of thing iraq afghanistan domestic work as well site cleanups nuclear facilities he attends the cutter conferencethats how i know all this has a very professional security detail around him was that sarcasm or cynicism exmilitary all of them is that so unusual yes as a matter of fact it is excops is more typical bigcity cops new york chicago miami those are the guys these guys hire theyve got the résumé and they maintain good contacts an effective security detail needs access to other law enforcement hiring military discharges gives you brawn but no brains in terms of connections discounting the pentagon knowing someone in the pentagon doesnt tell you who you can trust in the nypd to get your guy across town safely but nothing bad roger i mean does he have a reputation as a ladies man a drinker a gambler not that ive heard no but hes in that upper echelon of power brokers and from what ive learned they all dip their toes in that water whether theyre known for it or not thats a little harsh dont you think over here he said she crossed the room and studied where he was pointing four pushpins framed an empty space on the wall three more pushpins were on the floor theyd missed those pins the first time around something neither mentioned but both were thinking fiona readied her camera changing some settings something was pinned up here a photo maybe or a calendar or he reached out and gently moved a red pushpin tilting it a small triangle of torn paper swung down from where it was stabbed by the pin there was a light green border on the white paper along with a series of numbers money she said if i had to guess id say maybe a map a topo map dont you have to guess she asked as little as possible he answered those numbers on it will help us identify it the cabin was constructed of threesided logs with the milled face on the interior walt pointed out three distinct pinholes at the center of the four others which to him represented corners he told her he wanted a lot of coverage on these including a way to reconstruct it to scale he pocketed the torn corner of paper protecting it in an evidence bag and left her to work they were thirty minutes into it when walt stomped his foot down onto the area rug in the small bathroom his ear had picked up a difference in sound and it did so again his thumping brought a curious fiona he peeled back the area rug which was tacked on one end but loose on the other it covered a hatch that had a recessed handle carved out of the top he pulled out the beretta for good measure signaled fiona to step back and yanked it open his penlight led the way as he climbed down into the dark he found a light switch and a compact fluorescent glowed it was a small square space eight feet by eight feettwo sheets of plywood on each wall it had been dug into the earth but was built only with wood not concrete mark had installed the equipment for solar power down here an inverter a battery bank there was a frenchmade instanthotwater device an air pressure tank and a composting toilet that smelled of peat moss and two lawn chairs a portable radio fivegallon jugs of spring water a variety of freezedried foods a camp stove two sleeping bagsthough not enough room to unroll them steep ladder steps led down ending near the battery bank fiona clicked off several shots by lying down on the floor above a safe room she asked looks that way not originally of course but hed made it into one check out the bolt he said indicating the open hatch she photographed the three large steel bolts on the underside of the hatch making note of the steel plating that had been installed on not just the hatch but across most of the ceiling of the room jesus she said built for an invasion francine could have been down here walt said noticing a partially eaten protein bar when fiona asked when tommy and i arrived i never had time to look around tommy was shot and the shooter and we both took off shit francine could have been down here the whole time we dont know that i fucked up he said your deputy was shot she was making excuses for him and he didnt like that its pretty crowded down here let me get out and then why dont you take pictures of everything you can everything cover it im going to alert the challis deputies to be looking for a set of tracks leaving the area if francine was here shes gone now shes had several hours head start but why would she take off fiona asked its bulletproof its not soundproof its conceivable she heard her husband go down heard someone take him away can you imagine that then we arrive more shooting id have taken off too god she said work it like the crime scene it is he instructed as he climbed out of the space she was lying on her stomach on the floor above as walt climbed the ladder when they were facetoface walt paused and for a moment they both just stared hillabrand does have a reputation he said in more of a whisper hes supposedly a good guy someone who doesnt throw his weight around and who gives back to the community which is more than you can say for most of the people up there in his income bracket the semper group does billions a year okay she said thanks her breath smelled sweet like chocolate leaving his cherokee for brandon to use walt rode with fiona the long drive through stanley and back over galena pass forced the memory of randy akers broken corpse back on him as they passed the turnout where the tire tracks had been found twice he caught himself falling asleep but woke up despite fionas encouraging him to rest she dropped him at his house lisa had been with the girls since the close of school nikki had a runny nose emily a stomachache walt promised lisa a bonus for her overtimea false promise they both knew but his intention seemed to mean a great deal to her the clock on mark akers abduction was running the blood on the darts needle could be used to confirm blood type but walt wasnt waiting the sled had carried weight that was enough for him lisa agreed to drop the twins off with myra on her way home theyd spend the night there he battled his guilt hed fought like hell for joint custody but with no legal opinion yet returned he proved his own worst enemy it would appear he had little to offer the girls beyond an unreliable schedule and multiple handoffs to a variety of caregivers not the most stable environment if hed caught gail treating them this way hed have brought it as evidence against her she might do the same to him he had to work out a balance he had just come out of a hot shower when he heard the crunch of breaking glass at the back of the house it didnt sound like a window more like a lightbulb on the back porch still dripping wet he slipped into some workout pants grabbed the beretta and headed stealthily through the house working his way quickly to the kitchen he sneaked a look out onto the back porch surprised to see the light working then cut quickly to the door and yanked it open keeping himself shielded behind the doorjamb with the gun now in both hands he broke outside for a better look immediately hopping to his left when his right foot took a shard of broken glass footsteps in the snow walt hadnt shoveled the back path since the storm and hed had no reason to be back there he pulled the shard from the ball of his foot and headed down into the snow in his bare feet he couldnt take the cold for more than a couple of seconds but it gave him a chance to follow the tracks with his eyes out into a stand of aspen that separated him from his neighbors house a silhouette flickered there tucked into the trees hey walt called out whoever it was took off at a run walt made it about ten yards in that direction before his frozen feet stopped him a short adult or someone young he returned to the porch and studied the broken glass there it was thin glass smashed around a cylindrical plug of milky ice he avoided it returned inside and came back out dressed for the cold had his visitor dropped it stepped on it he had returned wearing a pair of evidence gloves collected the pieces of glass into a paper bag the plug of ice went into a ziploc handling the tight curve of the pieces he tried to fit them together in his minds eyes a test tube mark aker he thought how long had it been out there had it arrived frozen or had it frozen on its own had the freezing of the contents broken the glass and then someone had stepped on it or had his visitor just now crushed it accidentally most important what was its significance mark the lack of any note or instruction confused him had his visitor been interrupted and a ransom note gone undelivered his cell phone rang from inside the house and he ran to answer it the hospital lab the blood recovered from the dart a dart carrying a barbiturate cocktail typically reserved for bull elephants had come back a match for mark akers o positive adding to the labs confusion was the fact that the chemical composition of the darts drug matched another theyd processed earlier in the day that of the patient kira tulivich wednesday by one pm wednesday walt was beginning to work the evidence the first was the result of randy akers blood workup out of boise it confirmed both medetomidine and ketamine the same doping agents used on kira tulivich and mark aker the second was the broken glass and plug of icenow meltedthat hed had one of his men hand deliver to the boise lab its contents might suggest whod left it he suspected it was a gift from mark aker but with little to back that up he hoped for the labs clarification the third piece of evidence was the torn triangle of paper found stabbed into the wall in marks cabin nancy entered his office and unrolled a topographical map across the mounds of paperwork piled on his desk this was in part a comment on the neatness of his desk took no time at all she said the librarian recognized it immediately by the shade of green shes a hiker uses topos all the time sent me over to the elephants perch and it was the same thing there only this time because of the number printed on it they pulled the exact map we matched the torn corner to it mark had a topographical map of the pahsimeroi valley hanging on his cabin wall correct the map did not include his cabins location which intrigued walt it covered the valley forty miles to the southeast he turned the map right side up putting what would have been the torn piece into the lowerright corner get fiona he instructed nancy tell her i need the reconstruction of the cabin wall shell know what that means by two pm fiona and walt had overlaid the topo map already pinned to corkboard with the photographic enlargements all done to scale seven eightbyten printouts had been taped together to form a whole these were fitted over the map using the torn corner piece and the three other corner pushpin marks as references with the map now fully covered by highresolution shots of mark akers cabin wallthe coarse texture and yellow color of roughsawn timberit looked as if theyd removed a piece of the wall and had brought it with them it was the three black dots like flyspecks that interested walt he doublechecked the alignment of the photos over the map allowing for the fact that three other corner pins might be off by a quarter inch or so it looked like a good job fiona eyed it proudly you realize the map went on the wall not the other way around shouldnt we put the wall behind the map yeah but i want to use the holes that were in the wall to mark our map we saw three pushpins on the floor what if they were marking certain spots walt withdrew a pushpin from the side of the corkboard and answered her by carefully poking the pins needle through each of the three black specks he then removed the photographs leaving the map with three new pinholes in it fiona went quiet as she watched him work he crossed to a computer and called up a mapping website that included hybrid images of maps overlaid onto satellite imagery a few clicks later he had zoomed in on the pahsimeroi valley with small circular green dots each the product of a pivot irrigation systema huge wheeled sprinkler arm that irrigated a quarter square mile of ground these identified working ranches he then crossreferenced the two maps and used the cursor on the computer to give him latitude and longitude for each of the pin markings he wrote down the three locations knowing they held significance for mark aker it was possible that aker had visited them either professionally or otherwise howd you do that she asked you just saw me no i mean howd it occur to you to do that its what i do he answered three pinpricks in a log wall are you kidding me three ranches he said standing and studying the topo map a vet he reminded the discovery that aker had pinpointed the ranches intrigued walt as a vet the man did plenty of house calls without marking them on maps hed been told of marks secretive ways over the past month of marks spending extra time up at the cabin but no one knew hed actually been at the cabin he could have easily been over in the pahsimeroi he opened the door to the incident room and called out loudly for tommy brandon startling fiona with the sharpness of his voice brandon appeared his left arm in a sling it was the first the two had seen each other since the shooting other deputies would have taken a weeks leave but walt had received no such request on his desk and knew brandon would give him no excuse to be put on leave you okay walt asked fine want to take a ride where to randy aker was shot with a ketamine cocktail before he dove off those rocks he was wearing his brothers jackethis brothers scent now come to find out mark was drugged by the same cocktail and he was interested in three ranches over in the pahsimeroi he marked them on a topo map he had pinned to his cabin wall whoever took mark probably took the map as well count me in brandon said before he got out of the building walt was grabbed by the officer on duty and introduced to a gorgeous woman from the denver office of the cdc lynda bezel was in her early thirties and wore a dark blue suit it wasnt a look typically seen in hailey idaho the sun valley look was patagonia and eddie bauer faded jeans hiking boots and clinging tops she had a creamy complexion and pale eyes that opened wide as she spoke this might be better discussed in confidence she said she had a raspy bedroom voice and the coy smile that went along with it she sat in walts intentionally uncomfortable visitors chair she crossed her legs with a whisper of panty hose ive come here as a courtesy bezel began comfortable with taking the lead daniel cutter is on probation as we understand it because hes in the system i thought it only right to pay you a visit and let you know i intend to question him later today walt had a history with danny cutter that went back several years patrick cutter dannys older brother now ran a billiondollar cellular company danny whom walt liked better than his farmoresuccessful brother had a prior arrest and conviction on drug charges hed spent time in a federal minimum security facility before returning to ketchum just in time to be caught up in a murder investigationthe valleys only murder in six years he was a womanizer a hardpartying boy who had cleaned up his act and as part of his attempt to reestablish himself had founded a bottledwater company called trilogy springs based in ketchum concerning he asked we were contacted by a salt lake city hospital two of mr cutters employees have taken ill their condition is listed as serious doctors have not been able to stabilize them im here to interview mr cutter about his companys role if any in these illnesses and to question him about his actions we have a full inspection team on the way to the trilogy springs bottling facility near mackay idaho what actions it has come to our attention that mr cutter may have flown the two employees in a private jet to salt lake city while possibly denying them medical care locally you think he tasked those two down to salt lake to avoid being found out that doesnt sound like danny listen salt lake s the better health care all our life flights go to boise or salt lake bezel jotted down something into a small notebook she looked comfortable in the chair maybe she was into yoga she looked it you said you came to me as a courtesy walt said somewhat suspiciously exactly is there a probation violation he traveled with the employees out of state i assume that was with your knowledge and permission he was getting the idea now beneath the superfeminine façade was a bulldog im not his probation officer but as a felon hes required to notify your office if he intends to travel out of state is he not he is did he do that in person or by phone walt felt cornered he wasnt going to lie for danny cutter but he didnt like the idea of the cdc playing babysitter i could check with his po would you please the point is if he entered this facilityyour officestheres the possibility of contagion the illness is contagious there are two patients with similar symptoms tests are being conducted doctors have not yet identified the illness weve asked both mr cutter and his assistant to keep themselves isolated prior to my arrival my job is to track their movements since their contact with the individuals in question weve also notified the pilots as well as employees at the fixed base operation that serviced the plane he read between the lines are you saying this is somehow terrorist related hed had the recent warning from homeland concerning activity by the samakinn was trilogy contaminated intentionally we dont know what weve got much less how cutters employees might have contracted it but with your permission wed like to pass out tags to everyone employed here she produced what looked like a car air freshener a round disc in a cheap plastic frame divided into six wedges of differentcolored paper it dangled from her fingers like a christmas ornament and wed like both physical swabs of the environment and a few blood samples jesus your deputies and staff come in contact with the public should any one of these indicators change colors no matter how subtle we need to hear about it walt knew from recent training that such indicators had been proven to help field investigators narrow down searches and limit exposure he had a box of similar tags in a cupboard in the incident room hed never had use for them sure he said i dont have a problem with that wed appreciate it if every member of your staff i get it said walt interrupting leave them with me ill see to it companies in your county are aware of their obligation under federal guidelines to notify both you and our center in the event of suspected contamination or unexplained illness are they not i would assume so weve spread the word and theres been a lot of literature can you think of any reason daniel cutter would elect not to notify either of us theyre guidelines recommendations not requirements if im not mistaken but youd think with his history this is the first ive heard of it im sure if you ask him hell tell you danny isnt what youd call shy bezel said please instruct your officers to remain alert for flulike symptoms and nosebleeds you make it sound like ebola we dont know what were dealing with bezel said her face suddenly severe her husky voice an octave lower i wouldnt be making any jokes nerves walt said im not real comfortable with biological agents neither are we sheriff bezel said i ts really quite simple the man said over the sound of wood popping and crackling inside a woodstove aker sat tied to a ladderback chair wearing a black hood a syringe and some vials sat in an enamel tray on a game table to his left a dog was curled up by the woodstove the ceiling was vaulted to the cabins roof the scissor trusses exposed the air smelled strongly of coffee and less so of the distinct but foreign odors of pharmaceuticals we need you to write up a report on what you found he continued found where mark aker asked through the fabric of the hood the sheep dont play dumb with me writing a paper requires lab work research patience and a lot of time he said youve done all that i did some its true but i need more time if you release me all im talking about is a discovery of findings im a long way from that its true i have theories if you want me to stop my research i will no questions asked to the contrary i need you to scientifically confirm what i already know you can help me here i want you to publish what youve found not hide it he paused you think im trying to fuck you dont you im not i want you to publish if you want me to do that i will but first you need to drop me off near a hospital and you need to do it real soon if youre going to avoid manslaughter charges im not going to kill you relax this isnt about stopping you from doing your research its about publishing it youre misunderstanding publish what you know and well release you its you whos not understanding asswipe see im an insulindependent diabetic in a couple of hours if not sooner my heart rates going to increase ill start breathing rapidly and ill pass out ill go into shock and if i dont receive medical care ill die as for your report i wont live long enough to write the first paragraph get me to a hospital ill do whatever you want a dark musical score ran through his head it had begun with the mention of diabetes he untied akers feet and wrestled to bring his unwilling body out of the chair aker fell sideways and the chair crashed to the floor aker thrashed and landed a kick to the mans left ear before he was restrained the man unfastened akers belt and pulled his pants down akers left buttock was riddled with circular bruises the result of insulin shots motherfucker the man shouted he snorted and paced the small area angrily i need insulin coats aker said during the ruckus the hood had come off roy coats heard his name spoken he stared at his hostage how in the world r coats right aker said and she would be dimples he said referring to the dog now by the fire the dog had gotten close enough earlier for aker to see down through the opening at his neck and hed recognized her front right paw bitten by a rattlesnake what two years ago you owe me a hundred and eighty bucks for that coats i tend not to forget the customers who dont pay shut the fuck up what are you going to do kill me he said amused im going to die here coats and let me tell you something it wont be pretty youre not going to die youre going to write your report would if i could but i dont think so i dont remember how you got me here i dont even remember how you found me ketamine he asked headache tells me its ketamine but theres not a sound anywhere near us not even planes going over so ive got to think were a long way from anywhere and that doesnt bode well for me challis salmon the pahsimeroi stanley youre never going to get the insulin in time coats paced between the stove and back again his head hanging the fingers of his right hand tugging at whiskers in his beard then he stopped and addressed aker who remained on the floor the islets of langerhans roy coats said aker couldnt conceal his astonishment my mom was type coats explained i know all about acidosis akers focus changed as he took in the cabin walls all floor to ceiling with books hundreds perhaps thousands of them the second coming of ted kaczynski id watch my mouth if i were you coats began searching the stacks for a particular title theres a cow two pigs and some chickens out back im a little old for a petting zoo ill pass last warning about that mouth what exactly do you think youre holding over me coats without insulin im on my way out bovine and pig insulin kept diabetics alive for decades it wasnt until the nineteen fifties that they synthesized it you cannot be serious aker said oh i get it youre frederick banting not ted kaczynski both the pig and the cow have a pancreas and thats all we need coats pulled a book from a shelf returned it and selected another all ive got to do is keep you alive until the next radio check we stay off the airwaves only check in once a day youre the vet you want to live doc youre going to have to earn your supper two mountain passes that would have been available to walt in the summer months were closed by snow for the winter forcing him to travel southeast around the ends of three mountain ranges that pointed like fingers into central idahos vast arid plain he and brandon said little on the twohour drive that took them through carey arco and finally the tiny town of howe which consisted of a church of latterday saints a post office and a general store he drove northeast into the pahsimeroi valley with long subzero winters and only enough surface water to support a dozen ranches the pahsimeroi existed in a time warp virtually unchanged for a thousand years majestic mountains surrounded a valley floor of rabbitweed and sagebrush aspen and cottonwood trees lined its few streams and creeks herds of antelope flashed their white tails like garden rabbits while redtailed hawks sailed effortlessly on the steady winds that made this place so inhospitable to man a twolane road dead straight plowed through a tablecloth of white splitting the valley in two it was as breathtaking a piece of idaho scenery as could be found and walt never grew tired of looking at it you get over here its like another world brandon said my father used to hunt here you dont hunt brandon said as if it had just occurred to him no brandon tracked a handheld gps the topo map unrolled on his lap his actions awkward due to the sling he crosschecked the map with the device occasionally glancing over to the right where he imagined the first of mark akers three pinholed locations you think im nuts coming here walt said did i say anything its all weve got to go on three pinholes in a map maybe its enough brandon said walt gripped the wheel more firmly the tension he was feeling had nothing to do with the snow floor he was driving on there was a time i wanted her back walt said brandon took the opportunity to check the gps and then to look out the window for the umpteenth time if i fire you i look resentful maybe you sue me brandon reached for the door handle i could walk home from here its only a couple hundred miles its the girls im thinking about walt said first and foremost its the girls shit brandon whispered can we stop this you want to fuck my wife thats your business your risk but youre fucking me along with her and you should have thought about that he glanced over at brandon you think i didnt ketchum has an opening for a deputy bellevue maybe the suggestion hung inside the car as it raced up the empty twolane road walt felt insignificant and small my guess is brandon said too loudly acting as if the recent exchange had not happened were not going to get in there because the road wont be plowed itll be plowed walt said he answered brandon s puzzled expression mark visited here he called on a client and in this valley its either cattle or sheep theyll keep the road open in winter in order to feed the satellite map had four or five pivots clustered out there thats a ranch for sure walt having said that an interruption in the plowed bank appeared a quarter mile ahead he slowed the cherokee she complains ill bet walt said about your trailer being so small about your work hours is that why you asked me along sheriff make sure i log in a lot of ot yup brandon winced he hadnt expected the truth he was squirming inside right where walt wanted him did you notify the lemhi sheriff brandon asked i might have forgotten walt said because lemhis a different kind of county you cant throw a stick without hitting someones nephew or cousin its too cozy i dont want to give him a chance to rehearse anything what would he rehearse how would i know then why say that something got randy killed maybe it was the poaching but im not so sure i think it was the coat he was wearing marks coat and now that marks been abducted and weve found the same daterape cocktail in randys blood im guessing randys death was some kind of misfire so its all on mark and whatever he was hiding up in his cabin which means one or all of these ranches are involved no shit what gets a vet in trouble one thing keeps coming to me mad cow thats something any rancher and especially these good old boys out here would make damn sure to keep quiet brandon was no longer paying attention to his gps he was leaning in his seat toward walt hanging on his every word so what theyd be rehearsing walt said is some piece of fiction to provide cover for mark coming out here and tracking their ranches and sticking goddamn pushpins in a map to mark their homesteads something that has nothing to do with whatever was the original reason they called him out here in the first place mad cow its got to be something along those lines something big something that makes the truth too expensive so why go to the trouble of abducting him these old boys are plenty used to the rifle i dont see them getting all sentimental who knows could be they wanted to establish if hed told anyone how far along he was in his findings could still be their plan to kill him he could be dead right now he wished he could take back what hed just said saying such things gave them weight he drove through an open gate in a wire fence and bounced the cherokee across a cattle guard thing rattled to beat hell a pair of steel grain sheds rose from the snow like gray hats to his left he drove past a hundredacre field that was probably kneehigh with alfalfa in the summer black veins of meandering cow trails cut through the deep snow a herd of seventy or eighty angus was wedged tightly into the fields southwest corner their backs to the wind walt directed the cherokee toward the granaries two wood barns and a twostory gray clapboard house with white trim he studied the cows for signs of illness but didnt know what he was looking for they all looked mad to him in the field directly ahead sheep fretted dancing nervously back and forth as walts cherokee drew closer white on white broken by black legs and black heads puppets on unseen strings the thing id never get used to about living on a farm like this brandon said sniffing the air is the stink its usually not so bad in winter walt said ive got to admit thats funky it was a horrid bitter smell sour and permeating it only hit them now as they drove close to the buildings a smell like that brandon said no wonder they called a vet lon bernie met the cherokee with four dogs at his side in his late fifties with a florid complexion and soft gray eyes he wore dirty canvas coveralls a smudged cowboy hat and large rubbercoated gloves his nose carried a curved scar the size of a thumbnail as pink as peptobismol a front tooth had been chipped in a bullriding championship when bernie was nineteen he still wore the belt with the oversized silver buckle to dances at the grange hall on saturday nights after a steak at the loading chute i see a sheriffs car coming i expect it to be ned the rancher said tugging off his glove and offering his calloused hand to both men his voice sounded like a gearbox with broken parts youre a long way from home couple questions is all if youve got the time walt said brandon banged his boots together already cold windchill was pushing the mercury into the single digits aint got nothing but time this time of year lon bernie looked out over walts headthe man was a giant surveying his animals he reminded walt of hoss cartwright walt sensed in him a cautiousness a reluctance it felt for a moment as if the rancher might be considering inviting them inside or to follow him on his chores something flickered in his gray eyes as lon bernie sucked some air through his top teeth be my guest he said walt shot a quick glance over at brandon his deputy stopped banging his boots together mark aker sun valley animal center did some work for you recently lon bernies gray eyes iced over there was no change in his otherwisepleasant expression a fog fled his mouth on each exhale lon bernie a steam engine climbing the hill had a cow down with the bloat the rancher said he didnt seem to feel the cold walt was freezing mel hickenbottom was busy up to challis hes usually the one id call this aker fellow stepped in you cant wait too long with the bloat well thats a good start for us you remember how you paid him lon bernie briefly lost his composure i paid him good ill tell you what its a long drive over here and he charged by the hour how is it my livestock is any of your business anyway sheriff you going to answer me that the vets brother was killed two nights ago now the vets gone missing marks last business brought him over this direction lon bernies face remained expressionless mark doesnt often tend to the bigger animals thats his brothers job seems he made an exception that interests me the appointment book shows it was mel hickenbottom who called the center said your sheep were suffering your sheep not your cattle no mention of bloat could be right lon bernie said without missing a beat coulda been the way you say maybe it was mel handled the bloat and the glitter gulch vet the sheep the nickname for the sun valley area was not new to walt the valleys wealth and glamour offended people like lon bernie and there was nothing to be done about it most of the resentment stemmed from jealousy and ignorance and was therefore undeserved most but not all not by a long shot lon bernie was letting him and brandon know they were outsiders here and therefore unwelcome business or not was it the cattle or the sheep walt asked pointedly i said one of my cattle had the bloat didnt i somethings always sick around here what specifically was wrong with your sheep if id known that lon bernie said i wouldnta needed no vet now would i did you get an answer a diagnosis you ever been around sheep sheriff the rancher looked to his right and the hundreds of thick wool coats milling about dumb as paint you look at em wrong and they take sick or they throw themselves in the irrigation ditch and their coats get too heavy and they drown themselves in two feet of water i leave em to the vets a couple of shots and theyre right as rain i pay my bills on time and thats about all there is to it im not asking for no diagnosis just results the sheep are better now then did mark aker have success with the sheep or was he working on your cattle lon bernies eyes went stone cold a grin twitched at the edges of his cracked lips maybe what happened walt suggested was that mel called mark about the sheep but then when mark got here it turned out mel had misspoken and it was actually the cattle having problems you think i dont know which of my animals is having problems sheriff you got a dog a cat you cant tell the difference not me a head of cattle had the bloat thats all my brother brandon said once had a cow with bloat stuck his swiss army knife in the cow and about the worst smell ive ever smelled came out but that cow stood up five minutes later and went on her way he never even called the vet cattles got three stomachs son depends which one catches the bloat i put a knife to our cow three times doggone pincushion got nothing then i called mel i thought i was the one called your glitter gulch fellow but maybe youre right it could have been mel dont see how it matters mel took care of the bloat mark worked with the sheep walt stated he did not ask hell it has been a month or more sheriff what do i know have you heard of any illness at your neighbors ranches sheep or cattle no sir i have not the mans answer came out much too quickly and sharply hed been expecting that question would you happen to have a bill handy brandon asked could we maybe get a look at it i pay em and i throw em out son its deputy or deputy sheriff not son brandon said making no effort to conceal his contempt the vet hickenbottom would have records might have youd have to ask him we will brandon withdrew his notebook and scribbled in it i dont see what all the fuss is about lon bernie said a mans dead walt reminded thats fuss enough for us the wind picked up at a certain temperature it seemed it couldnt get any colder but it always did lon bernie still didnt seem to feel it ever had any sign of mad cow over this way walt asked hoping for a reaction thats never come down from canada as far as i know and the last time you called upon either vet would have been lon bernie cocked his head toward walt as if he had only one good eye a while he said can you be more specific out here time kinda runs into itself drive a man half mad this time of year maybe more than half cattle bloat from eating too much green grass walt said a month ago we had green grass early winter this year moldy hayll do it too you trying to make a point sheriff cause youre going the long way around the barn to find the door he looked first at walt then at brandon ill tell you what i need i need the truth mr bernie and i dont believe im getting it you calling me a liar sheriff cause over here thats not terribly neighborly listen ive got chores to do he never flinched as he maintained eye contact with walt he turned and walked toward the barns the foul smell had not been apparent while walt and brandon had been out of the vehicle but as they drove away from the ranch it filled the car again complaining brandon rolled down the window that seemed to only make matters worse like burning hair roy coats trudged around behind the cabin along a path shoveled through four feet of snow that created a trench with sixfoothigh walls he avoided the piles of frozen dog excrement as if they were land mines the narrator in his head wouldnt shut up the rebel soldier must learn to improvise if he is to survive the needs of the few give way to the needs of the man faced with the possible death of his hostage hes willing to make a sacrifice coats called the two cows and the pig by their names bess tilda and pinky he didnt think enough of the chickens to name them he had on many occasions launched into rambling diatribes with only these three as his audience hed gone on about the injustices to society brought on by the immigration influenza the disease of poverty eating into society like a cancer he had stood on the milking stool and lectured for ninety minutes at a time his voice carrying over their heads and fading into the thousands of acres of empty wilderness that surrounded his homestead the government had lost its way focused entirely overseas when there was cleaning up to do at home hed chosen the name samakinn carefully never mind that his recruitment had not gone well a spear was needed the romans the croats the uzbeks the hutus all had the right idea ethnic cleansing but it started with being heard being taken seriously the government thought they could silence their voices by denying their acts but once the people heard of what theyd done how powerful they were the samakinns message would be heard supporters would swell their ranks change would be at hand he sought legitimacy nothing less credit where credit was due the doc would make his reportwho didnt believe a doctor he had a long night ahead of him dressing out whichever beast he decided to kill it was a great deal to ask of him the sacrifice had begun as prearranged the daily radio call didnt happen until midnight that meant it would be a while before gearbox could arrive with the insulin he had no choice but to act compounding his resentment the cows gathered on the other side of the fence expecting a feeding pinky was smart enough to wait inside the pen he hadnt realized how difficult this would be like killing a house pet he was willing to see aker or others die for his cause but not one of his stock he considered pinky first he had no great rapport with the sow and considered her a dirty though lovable companion but the size of the pancreas mattered and that quickly took her out of consideration it was either bess or tilda and besss condition demanded it be her he used a can of grain to lure her through the side door of the ramshackle shed at the corner of the paddock the chickens making noise in the coop as if a fox were on the prowl he wanted her as close to the block and tackle as possible knowing hed have to rig some kind of motor or winch to hoist all eight hundred pounds of her he got a harness on her head while she was still standing attached a length of chain to the front ring and secured it to a twoton pickup truck that hadnt run in years she was chewing on the grain the first shed had in a long long time and he knew that for a cow this was as close to heaven as it got so he scratched her on the head between the eyes feeling the hard bone beneath the tough skin dust rose from the blackandwhite hair it had formed a permanent layer on both animals youve been a good girl all these years bess he said his throat tightening your being pregnant is your downfall what can i say no greater honor than to fall a martyr for a cause i ought to know that i expect ill be seeing you soon he stabbed the knife in sharply at the jugular dragged and twisted its blade until she sprayed her eyes pure white as she reeled and cried out leaned his weight into it pulling for her windpipe wanting this over with resentment filled that part of his heart emptied by grief he would see the vet dead for this after hed written the report walt stopped the cherokee beside the closed fence gate he could see the end of a doublewide trailer some outbuildings and curved mounds in the snow about a hundred yards past the gate looks like snowmobiles been running in and out brandon said the track started on the other side of the closed gate and had been beaten down by a good many trips roads are all snow floor walt observed a snowmobiles as good as a car walt leaned on the horn and they waited for some sign of life from the ranch when none was forthcoming they left the cherokee parked where it was and went in on foot as they neared the cabin they saw that the snowmobile track connected with others forming a network of beatendown paths leading to and from various outbuildings walt shouted sheriffs office it wouldnt have surprised either man to be greeted by the wrong end of a shotgun and brandon walked with his good hand resting on the stock of his pistol the cold dry snow squeaked beneath their boots when their knocks on the door went unanswered they checked the neighboring outbuildings one was a working garage the other a storage shed overrun with junk a snowmobile track continued past a granary leading toward the fence line i know you think shes using me to get at you but thats not the way it is brandon said as they trudged through the snow walt stopped and turned to make sure brandon heard him youre my best deputy you think thats coincidence he turned and walked on you two were separated she convinced herself she was a lousy mother she envied how easily the parenting came to me it isnt about you its about the kids shes having second thoughts now shes going to fight for them are you ready for that brandon stopped short and the distance between them grew he had to hurry to catch back up i want to work for you this is where i belong grow up the rancher was a pack rat the mushrooms of snow seen from a distance turned out to be junk dishwashers farm implements tires car parts tractor parts furniture it surrounded every building looming mysteriously out of the snow damn brandon said you notice whats missing walt asked human beings listen the two men stopped absolute silence its quiet enough brandon admitted and then some walt led brandon along one of the snowmobile paths to a fence line the snow out in the pasture was rippled and dented by interconnecting seams not flat and pristine it reminded walt of a brain but there was no recent activity all of the wandering seams connected into a single point down the fence line near yet another outbuilding those lines mark where the snow was trod down by livestock walt said pointing toward the shed then a fresh snow covered them up so wheres the livestock thats the point deputy moved em off the place walt pointed to where all the paths connected his eyes couldnt make out a gate there but he expected to find one id say it was probably to another field but were not hearing them who moves their livestock in winter its a pain walt agreed unless a water line froze or the snow got too dry they might move them to make feeding easier walt started down the fence line through the kneedeep snow what the hell brandon called out hesitating to join him check the trailer again another reason the livestock would be moved is if someone died brandon mulled that over walt kept on walking trudging with difficulty through the snow are you mad at me sheriff for what i said brandon called out shut up and check the trailer yes sir the farther down the fence line he went the tougher it got for walt his legs growing weary from the deep snow sweat ran down his rib cage despite the harsh cold that whipped his face but there was something else he felt an unease brought on by the utter stillness of the place and the growing sensation he and brandon were being watched as he drew closer to the shed he picked out the outline of a feed trough a doublehung gate and a pair of automatic waterers he arrived to the feed trough and saw it was filled with snow suggesting the animals had been moved sometime between the two most recent snowstormsin the last five to six days he studied the sweep of the gate the way it had pushed the prior snowfall ahead of it as it had been opened this too confirmed his time line mark aker had made a twoday trip to his cabin a few days earlier just before the search and rescue that took his brothers life had this ranch been a stop for him during those two days what had he found why had the livestock been moved fighting the deep snow he wrestled open the sheds large door far enough to squeeze through it was dark inside shafts of sunlight appearing as walt kicked up dust from the dirt floor a milking station and some stalls a squeeze chute used to isolate an animal for doctoring or branding he slipped back through the door to the outside he might have missed it had he not visited the shed for only now did he get a good look at the automatic waterers the waterers were clear of snow but dry warmed by a thermostat in winter months with a float valve to control the water level the devices were used to save the rancher from fighting ice and trying to keep his cows drinking walt studied the jerry rigging on each device baling wire had been twisted to hold the float valve up so the bowl wouldnt refill he pulled off his glove and tested the metal bowl it was warm to the touch that explained the snow having not collected on it but not the floats being wired up some kind of problem with the waterers would explain the livestock having been moved a frozen line or intermittent power chicken or the egg had the livestock been moved and then the water turned off or had the water been turned off and then the livestock moved the unexpected visit at his office from the cdc womanwhat was her namereplayed vividly danny cutters employees sick as dogs flown out in a private jetliterally under the radar dannys most recent enterprise was trilogy springs spring water from a source two miles deep maybe it wasnt mad cow after all something to do with the water to his left walt noticed an area that had been blocked from view by the shed walt plodded along ten yards twenty thirty a hundred he climbed a fence where a snowcovered trail led through a gate he was soaked through with sweat now his breathing heavy but there was more to it his nerves all ajangle maybe it resulted from the frank talk with brandon maybe those wounds werent meant to be reopened his thought was interrupted by the sound of animalsa sound so unique and prior to that moment missing as he crested the hill and looked down he saw five hundred sheepa half a bandspread out along the edge of a fogshrouded creek the fence crossed the creek in two places and rose to include another twenty acres on the far side the sheep had been fed hay from the far side of the enclosed pasture some of the hay remained scattered mist rose from five holes in the creek ice each hole roughly chopped open with an ax the rancher had traded more difficult feeding conditions for easier access to water explaining the empty pasture behind him but it drew his attention back to the condition of the water the sheep were now being offered surface water in conditions that likely required grunt labor to keep the icedover water holes open and accessible if a line had frozen in the waterers behind him then it made some sense to move the sheep he retraced his own tracks through the deep snow to the waterers slipped off his gloves began untwisting the wire used to keep the floats up if the waterers were broken then moving the sheep made practical sense but if the waterers worked then why had the rancher chosen laborintensive surface water over automatic waterers that might require an explanation the last twist freed the wire walt released it and watched roy coatss apron and boots were covered in blood as he returned to the cabin sweat running down his face aker was asleep his head slumped forward the rest of him still tied to the ladderback chair his breathing sounded sharp and fast and shallow as coats shut the door aker lifted his head his skin was sallow his eyes bloodshot coats hoisted the freezersized ziploc bag inside it besss unborn calfs pancreas slid around like a dead fish now what he said akers eyes rolled in his head coats crossed the room stifflegged and fast and took mark aker by the chin do not pass out on me ive done my part now you tell me whats next you hear me he raised his voice doc you hear me aker vomited into his own lap coats stepped back grumbling jesus not doing real well aker managed to croak out shit fluids he mumbled coats cut him loose and poured him a glass of water aker gagged it down but he shook his head as he handed the empty glass back to coats from here i dehydrate the vomiting wont allow me to keep the water down im going to lapse into a coma at some point be ready for that youll have to do this on your own coats have some sugar water or juice ready because you probably wont get the dosage right his eyes bobbed you got all that you gotta stay with me doc im trying grind it coats asked indicating the baggie on the table mortar and pestle coffee mugll work handle end of a screwdriver but youll need to boil it first ten minutes do you have any saline contact lens solution thatll work you may need that not much enough to liquefy then get the extract into the syringe i mush it up add the saline how much do i give you coats was already over at the stove he dropped a screwdriver in the kettle of boiling water kept there to throw moisture into the air he located an oversized coffee mug rinsed it with some of the boiling water and put the contents of the baggie in the cup it looked like a piece of liver but was in fact pancreas aker muttered coats returned to him and put his ear by akers trembling lips if i start sweating and shaking this is after the injection then you gave me too much i need the aker vomited pitched forward and passed out coats shook him but it was no use he was unconscious you need what coats screamed at him coats didnt have ten minutes to sterilize the screwdriver he used a pair of barbecue tongs to fish the screwdriver from the boiling water he dried it on a clean dish towel and used the butt end to smash the tissue in the mug in a matter of minutes he had the tissue reduced to a mushy gruel he added a small amount of the contact lens solution and then he tipped the mug and drew the extract into the same syringe originally intended to get aker to cooperate the fluid was a horrible color and consistency he couldnt see how this could do anything but kill someone but aker was on his way out as it was he pulled down akers loose pants and stabbed the syringe into the mans flank and gave him ccs akers reaction was surprisingly quick less than two minutes after the injection he snapped awake lifting his head color had returned to his face he glanced around the cabin interesting he said coats noticed beads of sweat forming on the mans brow youre sweating juice aker said he grabbed the arms of the chair as his limbs began to shake get the juice you moron he shouted the entire chair was shaking now dancing on the floor coats had neglected to have this ready the only juice he had was frozen orange juice he placed the can into the sink and ran water on it but akers chair was going like a paint shaker it tipped over and crashed to the floor coats fumbled with a water glass spooned sugar in it and filled it with water he stirred it up and slopped it out of the glass as he hurried to aker sat aker up and got him drinking the water spilling down his front aker returned to the living and unable to measure his blood sugar took inventory of how he felt five minutes after hed been going like an earthquake he sat calmly in the chair we can expect some secondary problems coats aker said such as the extract will be weak ill need injections every few hours but well have enough for that dosage is obviously going to be the problem there will be warning signs ill know when i need more but the bigger issue will be the allergic reaction to the extract possible infection at the site of the injection thats basically a given the reactions can be anything from some discomfort in the form of a skin rash to something much more severe we wont know until we see them and we will see them youll want to watch me fairly closely and ill do my best to monitor how im feeling tell your guy i need lantus one dose lasts for twentyfour hours until we get the lantus were not out of the woods not yet coats barked out a laugh some spittle escaped onto his beard and he wiped it away something funny about that aker asked doc we are so deep in the woods it would take an army to find us he amused himself a very big army get me a clean shirt aker said testing how much leverage hed gained over his captor mines filthy coats hesitated a moment unsure how to respond but then he crossed to a footlocker by the only bed in the room and dug around in it for a shirt mark aker did not allow his captor to see the smile that slowly formed coats had done as hed asked there was hope yet senator james peavys white hair escaped from beneath his creamcolored beaverfelt stetson his blue steely eyes never leaving walt as he paced the living room of his homesteaded farmhouse he was the fourthgeneration peavy to run the twentythousandacre sheep ranch and he looked the part with his large belt buckle the pressed blue jeans and the pair of tony lamas thats a hell of a question sheriff he said its simple enough senator the man hadnt been a senator for twenty years but respect where respect was due whats your man doing out there peavy asked his back to walt as he faced the window you said he could look around hes walking across my pasture hes an overachiever walt said lets not worry about him we use mark sun valley animal centerexclusively its not as if its unusual for him to pay us a visit its not as if youre answering the question walt pointed out we run nine band of sheep walt thats nine thousand head i have a ranch foreman an overseer for each band its not as if i know every time we call a vet or what the ailment was so you dont know why mark was called thats simple enough walt stood from the couch maybe you could introduce me to your staf f sit down peavy said his voice suddenly too loud for the room he moved to another window still fixated on brandon s activities enough of what mark aker did or did not do for us what difference can it make whats important here is your next election thats what i thought you came here for lets get down to brass tacks what can i do to help youve always been more than generous senator peavy supported sheriffs in at least three counties including blaine i hear you have some real competition this time around in richie dunik wellorganized and i hear youre distracted by this divorce damn sorry to hear about that talk about bad timing walt clamped his open palms between his knees and leaned forward trying to keep from saying something offensive about peavys insensitivity i could arrange for each of my bosses to make contributions walt up to the accepted limit there are ten to twelve who would do this if i asked i dont think im supposed to talk about ways to get around the election laws senator christ do i look like im wearing a wire im making you an offer im trying to help help is always appreciated if you need financial help i can arrange it thats all im saying i need to know what brought mark aker out here i need to identify whatever it was that made your sheep sick who said my sheep were sick dont go jumping to any conclusions walt ill tell you what mark comes out here as much to vaccinate and geld and deliver calves as he does to doctor did you know hed recently made house calls to two of your neighbors should that surprise me theres no paper trail for any of these visits over here his office knows next to nothing about them this from a type a meticulous professional who im told would never have made a trip this distance without billing for it much less three such trips and this interests you because if i could just say something here senator that is that every time i ask you a question or say something about mark akers visits instead of an answer i get a question we both know what a skilled orator you are but frankly youve never treated me the way youre treating me today i find it offensive im sitting over here wondering what the hell is going on peavy abandoned the windows for the time being moving into the center of the room it was a luxurious living room with leather couches a remington sculpture some western landscapes on the wall the hearth was stacked stones covered in a patina of black carbon surrounded by a wiremesh spark screen the hearth had the original wroughtiron hook for warming pots peavy stopped on an enormous sheepskin rug that was covered by a tan pelt of some fourlegged creature that without its head was impossible for walt to identify i heard about randy hes come over here for us as well i assume your questions about mark being that its you asking and youre a long way from home must have something to do with that tragedy i dont know what it is exactly that youre asking me walt marks visits to my neighbors is news to me maybe we all got a bad batch of vaccine or something maybe its something contagious i have yet to hear about i just dont know ill ask my boys and ill get back to you thats the best i can offer cant argue with that im serious about helping out your campaign much appreciated lingering on walts tongue was a question about the quality of the senators water supply he kept that to himself for now peavy stepped closer to shake walts hand he had a firm grip for an older guy and he looked walt in the eye walt sensed he was about to say something as well they shook hands for a little longer than was comfortable if that was supposed to communicate something to walt he missed it gail would be the first to tell anyone who would listen that walts communications skills were lacking peavy opened his mouth once again walt expected him to say something the senator shook his head more of a twitch than anything else and exhaled deeply what walt wanted to ask but his host left him guessing as he ushered walt to the door and saw him off brandon was tromping through the snow making his way back toward the farmhouse he picked up his pace when he saw walt waiting by the cherokee the house was a mile behind them before brandon broke the silence of the cars interior there are five automatic waterers in that field all over by the hay shed in the southwest corner he paused to adjust his arm in the sling which walt thought was more for dramatic effect than anything else not one of ems working not working or not turned on dry and the sames true of three more over by one of the barns i tried to get into that barn to check the stalls but a mexican basically kept me out saying mr jim mr jim meaning peavy i assumed i passed a stop and waste on the way back get this locked the stopandwaste valve was locked walt repeated a stop and waste was a freestanding water spigot that ran yearround youve been in idaho ten times longer than i have sheriff but ive never evernot onceseen one of those locked for one thing thats about the only absolutely guaranteed water in winter in case of fire since those things never freeze the senator skillfully avoided lying walt said his hands gripping the wheel more tightly far in the distance but presumably still on peavys ranch rose a charcoal gray plume of smoke probably ranch hands burning off slash thought walt winter snow made for the safest time to set such fires it looked beautiful in the slanting afternoon light lifting and coiling into the blue sky damn brandon said rolling down his window thats that same funky smell walt sniffed the air and knew brandon was right a sour bitter stench memorable he turned the wheel the car skidded on the snow floor he backed around in a threepoint turn and headed for the fire stopped ten minutes later by an unplowed road brandon consulted the topo map the road they traveled showed on the map as dirt it went unplowed in winter brandon s thick finger traced a second roadalso marked as dirt that accessed that same area from peavys ranch the stench was noticeably stronger there at the end of the road the connection to the fire inevitable though unconfirmed the two men got out of the car and climbed the snowbank walt slipped his hands into his pockets to fight the cold brandon tried to warm the fingers that protruded from the sling a sign on a fence warned private property no hunting no trespassing the senator couldnt keep his eyes off you the whole time you were out in his field what was that about he kept what he told me very controlled but i was much more interested in watching him whats this about sheriff you think its something to do with the water that makes the most sense right makes the most sense walt agreed you think were going to find aker alive i mean we sure as hell better you think hes over here somewhere i havent the slightest you think the senator knows no for whatever reason i doubt that i didnt get any sense of that but hes involved it was a statement he basically offered to singlehandedly pay for my reelection walt said taking his hands out and rubbing them together vigorously hes definitely involved walt turned around and looked back over the vast expanse of the valley stunning in its emptiness a neighbor might see such a fire but hed never smell it not given the distances between ranches theres something connecting the three ranches mark knew what it was and it got him kidnapped got his brother killed he headed back to the car you hungry i could eat a horse brandon said friday are you going to come inside or just sit out there all night walt held the phone pressed to his ear while staring out his front window at fionas subaru during the long silence that followed walt could imagine her backing out and driving away trying to pretend she hadnt been parked out there for nearly twenty minutes nearly two days had passed since the drive to the pahsimeroi with mark aker still missing it might as well have been a month for walt he battled the fatigue of twentyonehour days while trying to maintain a fathers patience for the sake of the girls hed put them to bed after twenty minutes of reading during which hed fallen asleep not them theyd tickled him awake he told them a bear story and then turned off the light he slogged through his daily paperwork and meetings while exhausting every resource in his bid to find mark aker alive predictably the challisled investigation into brandon s shooting had produced nothing if brandon had died up there with their history walt might have been accused of it francine aker had failed to surface the lab was taking its sweet time as always the car arriving at his house and just sitting there had immediately won his attention the midnight visit to his back porch still kept firmly in mind but with the subaru out front identified as fionas hed given her a liberal amount of time before calling her he heard footsteps approach the front door and he put away the phone he greeted her and invited her inside she stood by the open fire warming her backside he studied her body in silhouette against the fire his first unhurried appraisal of her despite all the time theyd worked together only now did he really see her narrow hips athletically lean figure and the muscular curve of her backside sorry she said for sitting out there no charge for parking a pause he added im terrible at jokes the night of the search and rescuerandyi was skiing with roger hillabrand i dont think thats any of my business i was flattered enchanted even no charmed i was charmed i dont doubt it he sent a guy of his out to deliver a message this is after the search and rescue late late im talking about fiona no youve got to listen youve got to help me make sense of this she turned away to face the fire he invited me to some gala event in san francisco he was flying private i was supposed to drop everything and join him you and i were at the hospital the next day exactly i turned him down she moved to her left standing in profile now the reflections of the flames bouncing off her chest and below her chin her face flashed orange so now he tells me he didnt go he canceled the trip because i turned him down at least thats what he told me this while hes inviting me to dinner i still dont see can you just listen the question hurt gail accused him of constantly interrupting please she added a word gail had seldom used im listening he said wishing she would get back in the subaru and leave him the hell alone he invited me over for tea this afternoon tea just so he could ask me out for dinner this guy is a very smooth operator she turned again but not too smooth he gets a phone call after im there less than five minutes theres a phone right there in the living room but of course he takes it somewhere else leaves me to watch the light on the phone glow for the duration after fifteen minutes i ask to be driven home driven he lives halfway up baldy his people drive you up from the bottom of the hill ive got allwheel drive but they wont even let me try it the gate is locked at the bottom so i tell his guy seansean lunnits either he drives me or i walk and he drives me whats interesting is sean doesnt interrupt the boss and tell him im leaving he just drives me down the mountain and thats interesting because she snarled because roger was going to rip his head off when roger found out he let me leave let you you know maybe not are you listening that was another line borrowed from the gail playbook he was beginning to wonder if gail hadnt sent her here to torture him my role in this is he asked oh god im sorry her expression moved through embarrassment to a feverish glance at the door im so sorry i didnt mean to but the reason i had to see you i dont think hes as interested in me as he is in you what my working for you thats ridiculous i wish it were but im not so sure he and i have so little in common i admit that he flirts with me at a wedding im shooting i wanted to think that was for real but im not so sure he takes me that same night skiing down baldyvery romanticbut doesnt make anything like a pass i have to leave him because you call me up to the search and rescue he barely objects and he isnt surprised when i tell him i work parttime for you not surprised at all and another thing i got that wedding at the last minute who waits to hire a wedding photographer until the day before not in this town not in any town just isnt done sean his guy is waiting for me when i get home that nightthis is in a snowstorm dont forget parked outside the fence scares the hell out of me coming up behind on foot says hes there to invite me on the private jet the next morning hello ever heard of cell phones you think a guy like roger hillabrand cant get my cell number checking up on you maybe hillabrand could have been trying to find out if you ditched him for another guy sends his boy to see how many are in your car how many cars in the drive it doesnt spell conspiracy it spells hormones youre pretty you sparkle men go crazy for that hearing this from him clearly caught her off guard sparkle she asked did you say i sparkle she stepped closer laid her hands on his shoulders listen to you her palms felt warm through his uniform she smelled of lilac and cinnamon and for a moment she was everythingall he could smell all he could sense a noise from out on the porch surprised them both he jerked his head in that direction still skittish from the encounter out back a few nights earlier gail her face pressed to the glass and framed by open curtains her expression that of a voyeur caught in the act walt immediately saw the scene from gails point of view the fire burning fionas hands on his shoulders their bodies close gail the most jealous woman hed ever known jealous no matter what almost a matter of pride she hurried off the porch walt ran to the front door and burst outside calling her name the car door thumped shut tire rubber whistled on the ice and then gripped walt charged up the shoveled path shouting her name the car shot back out into the street fishtailing he saw only taillights then as he stood in the middle of the empty street still shouting for her to stop since the split gail hadnt come by the house unannounced not once for her to have done so meant something his awkward talks with brandon came to mind had brandon carried the conversation home had she wanted to weigh in negotiate a truce a neighbor mrs shunt had ventured out onto her porch to see what all the shouting was about the sheriff in full uniform stood in the street without a jacket shouting at a departing car a familiar car the curtains at the fridlers house moved the old bird had been spying on him as well the sheriffs marital problems were well known but this was the first time hed been seen chasing his soontobeex wifes car down the street and shouting at her worse when he turned there was fiona at the open front door partially backlit and actually glowing looking radiant he imagined what gail must have imagined he arrived at the top of the steps wearing the porch light like a crown a harsh shadow cast down on him turning his eye sockets black and hollow he stood there for a second wondering if his actions had looked as childish as they now felt afraid to go inside with her too cold to do anything otherwise that was her fiona asked yeah you think she i mean we werent doing anything the last thing he wanted the last thing he could handle right then was a discussion then his mouth betrayed him she gave me a lecture about not setting the girls against her this despite her bailing on them when they visit her for a nighta rarityits at a friends never at brandon s she has this all worked out as long as its her way and seeing us just now oh boy fiona approached him he held up his hands to stop her advance with the porch light overhead it felt as if they were both on stage acting out some melodrama fiona had no intention of embracing him instead with a panicked look on her face she reached through his defensive pose and grasped the cdc biosensor tag clipped to his uniforms right chest pocket she angled it up and into the porch light so that they both could see it one wedge of the white hexagonseparated by plastic dividers was a distinct lavender on its way to purple youve been exposed to something for a moment walt couldnt get past the gail fiasco exposed to the wrath of an exwife but taking notice of the purple triangle the cold intensified fiona instinctively stepped back contaminated each of the six sections represented a different contaminant he understood what it meant theres this cdc woman might still be in town shell know whats next jesus walt youd better keep back in fact youll need to stay here until its sorted out he paused still processing what it all meant this is not good walt frantically searched his cluttered desktop distinctly remembering being handed a business card hed left fiona at his house awaiting his call the discovery of the triggered biosensor had panicked him an unfamiliar reaction he had no love of hospitals abhorred the early hours of a flu or head cold never mind he felt perfectly normal unable to distinguish fever from panic he began to work himself up the call to brandon had gone unanswered hed left a message for his deputy to check his own biosensor and to quarantine himselfand gailif necessary procedure dictated stringent guidelines walt was stretching those procedures by visiting his office he found the business card at last called the cell number and got voice mail called the business number and was told by recording that dr lynda bezel was out of the office until monday she was likely still in the valleydanny cutters water source and bottling plant were located in the lost river range east of mackay a threehour drive each way this time of year he guessed her investigation would require trips to the plant cutter was walts best shot at finding her more voice mail he felt feverish and sick to his stomach his skin itched his bones ached his head hurt he donned a blue hazmat suit over his clothes in the privacy of his office grateful that given the hour he had to walk by only the duty officer he hurried outside to his cherokee and drove determined to find her driving north took him into money country ketchumsun valley wasnt just rich it was superrich with more per capital wealth concentrated in such a small area than possibly any place in the country he was accustomed to driving past the secondhome estates each the size and look of a country club he arrived at patrick cutters fifteenthousandsquarefoot vacation home in which his younger brother occupied a suite in the eastern wing wearing his impatience and disgust openly on his tormented face patrick cutters estate consisted of five new england barns all authentic timberframe structures disassembled and moved from new hampshire and vermont and reassembled into an interconnected masterpiece it was landscaped even in winter as if it had been standing for thirty years and was surrounded by a privacy fence walt drove up to the closed gate his headlights shining across the heated terracestone driveway the only car he saw parked out front was a blue sedan with boise plates and a rentalcar sticker on the bumper he knew the identity of the renter without running the registration and judging by the lack of interior lights the house looked closed up for the night patrick used the place as a second home spending less than six weeks a year here his younger brother currently called it home walt tried the phone number again elected not to leave a second voice mail and then called in on the gate box danny cutter answered on the fourth ring walt announced himself and asked for dr bezel shes right here danny said we were just reviewing inspection reports ill bet you were danny had a reputation it was a few minutes past ten i need to speak to her he was buzzed through the gate and parked in front of the rental danny cutter answered the door barefoot his polo shirt untucked his hair tousled but it didnt necessarily mean anything danny was a young jack nicholson in training sheriff you look like a housepainter danny quipped come in ill be in my car walt said turning i didnt mean to offend you cutter called after him walt didnt bother answering bezel had put herself together quickly shed thrown on a pantsuit that was either similar to or the same one hed seen her in previously shed pulled her hair back and had even managed to apply lipstick but shed forgotten the perfume and her strong scent revealed far too plainly what danny cutter had been inspecting an awkward embarrassing moment lingered as long as the interior light which finally dimmed and went dark walt reached up and switched it back on shed been too selfabsorbed to notice his paper suit but now she did and some of the red left her face sheriff he unzipped the hazmat suit reached in and picked the biosensor off his chest pocket he handed it to her im supposed to report this jesus she threw open the car door and stood outside in the cold she knocked for walt to put down the passenger window shit sheriff theres protocol involved here procedure what the hell were you thinking that you were the closest expert youre supposed to isolate yourself and call the number you know the drill this is a small community in case you hadnt noticed if a van full of space aliens shows up at my front doorand we both know how the government reacts to these situationsits going to throw this valley into a panic my first and most important job is maintaining the peace not causing riots whats that thing trying to tell me im perfectly willing to do whatevers necessary she left the car and walked over to the light at the front door walt caught sight of cutter inside keeping his eye on developments she turned the biosensor in the light called inside to cutter and he handed her purse to her she made a call on her cell phone walt was thinking hed made the right choiceit was better if the space aliens showed up at patrick cutters isolated mansion than on third avenue south in hailey she returned to the car and climbed into the passenger seat for the first time in about an hour walt felt some relief mild exposure to lowlevel radioisotopes she stated im radioactive seriously if it had been a darker shade thered be reason for concern the tags were modified post nineeleven to be supersensitive that way if a container inspector for instance had had contact with even ultralow levels of radiation it would be detected yours isnt exactly ultralow but its not high you can lose the suit well ask that they run a few tests at the local hospital but youve got nothing to worry about walt leaned back against the headrest and let out an audible exhale she said nothing for a moment must have scared you you think about my being here it became clear shed had no intention of finishing the sentence when walt made no attempt to interrupt her about your being here walt said taking unexpected pleasure in her awkwardness im a big girl i can separate the two im not saying you cant but youre thinking it i know dannys history preliminaries arent in if theres biological contamination at the bottling plant were having a hell of a time finding it much less iding it do you carry one of those he asked referring to his tag in her hand of course did you wear one at the plant yes and nothing walt considered this he had a scenario in his head that he wasnt willing to voice without a lot more proof her tag coming up blank didnt sit well with his theory have you asked danny what he did out at the plant before your arrival meaning what if his brothers private jet happened to have flown in a wet team youre saying he deepcleaned the facility prior to my inspection you sound so shocked thats illegal i doubt that more like it violates some regulation same thing to us maybe so but not really theres protocol i questioned mr cutter he answered me faithfully and to my liking youre not on trial dr bezel and drop the mr cutter crap will you ask again walt said thats all im saying are you telling me my job im telling you your sugar daddy can sweetcoat anything can sweettalk anyone can fasttalk the best of them and i put nothing past him im betting he professionally hosed down his facility before you arrived and that if you had a tape of your q and awhich you dont im guessingthat youd find he never lied to you but failed to tell the truth he paused meet danny cutter dr bezel she blinked repeatedly pursed her lips turned her face toward the house and then trained her rage on walt what is it with you people out here ah come on he dodges a few questions no ones ever done that and at least for an evening hes managed to take your mind off work score two points for danny stop it her lower lip was quivering she looked ready to bite his head off test the plant for lowlevel radioisotopes walt said her neck made a cracking sound she spun it so quickly youre saying you were there at the bottling plant walt considered how to answer this no i wasnt he said and thats the hell of it saturday roy coatss wide shoulders filled up one side of a booth table in the dim recesses of the back corner of the melodee steak house in arco idaho the woman who entered fanning at the smokefilled air had aged fifteen years in the past twelve months since he first recruited her the meth had dragged bags under her oncepretty eyes melted her gums and had turned her skin a pasty gray but she still had the tight body of a thirtysomething she couldnt help the way she walkedand not many men missed it all without an ounce of selfawareness if shed had a face to go with it she wouldnt have been walking into this bar but the small head and pointed chin the turnedin teeth and pixie nose had all suffered under the effects of the meth she wore a mask of melted sallow skin and carried a haze of disrespect like an outofwork whore at a glance youd never have imagined her an atomic physicist evening he said buy you a drink she shrugged roy signaled the waitress a sixtyyearold former rodeo queen with a beer belly without asking he ordered his guest a double vodka on the rocks with a twist of lime himself a draft beer do you have it he asked not yet but it wont be a problem she paused then asked do you have it youre two weeks late so sue me its tricky theyre watching everyone like a hawk you have only yourself to blame for that i need it soon he added yeah and i need it now she leveled her eyes on him jaundice was setting in you gotta take better care of yourself he said caring nothing about her longterm health theyre going to figure you out you dont look so good when anyone asksand it isnt ofteni tell them i cant shake the flu i can handle myself her right hand trembled and she tucked it in her lap they both went quiet as the old cow approached and delivered the drinks she asked if the younger woman wanted a menu and the younger woman laughed she didnt understand the concept of eating not anymore the cow trundled off listen i gotta have a backup plan we lose this chance no ones going to listen i told you i dont know id hate to miss my next delivery he said her hand clasped the glass more tightly turning the skin beneath her unpainted fingernails a bloodless white her face remained impassive as if she said dont push me im on it its not easy she leaned across to him her breath giving lie to the myth that the smell of vodka went undetected its an atomic research facility roy boy what do you expect delivery he said equally softly he despised the nickname despised her weakness despised most everything about her but her body her talking in that husky voice aroused him all those degrees of yours her eyes went off someplace over his head he wondered what was going on in there if she could grasp even a glimpse of her decline at the hands of the meth hed taken her from a lonely bored successful physicist and reduced her to a skeletoneyed addict who showed no remorse over her breaches of security maybe it hadnt been him or his cause but instead the tedium of a professional life that required total secrecy performed in the middle of an enormous desert the government contractor daily bused three thousand specialists just like her in from pocatello nerds with their laptopsa mormon town where the idea of an exciting night out was a decaf latte at starbucks shed walked into a fouryear contract and had burned out within six months shed been waiting for someone like him to come along he passed the paper bag beneath the table collected no money for it if shed thought about that it might have given her pause hed never charged her for the meth he understood the ways of an addict if she wasnt totally behind his cause she was at the very least accustomed to his keeping her high his knuckles brushed her knee under the table her hand met his and she took possession of the bag and with it an eagerness flashed across her otherwisedull yellowing eyes i could take a room at the lazy horse he said you wouldnt have to wait to risk smoking in the car we wouldnt want you to get busted she no longer rode the bus from pocatello shed moved to a doublewide near moore a few miles down the road this to be away from her coworkers thrust into the roaring nightlife of arco idaho population one hundred and fifty the movie theater ran two shows every friday night i think i can make it seven miles down the road roy he wasnt so sure but you wouldnt have to he said not if i took a room what else do you want from me he smiled oh roy what are we going to do with you just about anything you want he said she upended the vodka leaned close to him and whispered again you terrify me whenever we meet i leave shaking a pit in my stomach you scare the piss out of me roy you scare everyone who meets you he heard all that but he barely reacted because she rose and pumped her way back to the exit sign next time he would withhold the meth next time she would pay for that mouth of hers despite the prominent signplease turn off your cell phone this is a no cell phone environmentwalt was on the phone for a good deal of the time his physical was being conducted dr royal mcclure a good friend who sometimes wore the hat of pathologist for blaine county drew his blood and ran him through a variety of tests while walt raised his own blood pressure trying to locate a geiger counter nancy was on the receiving end of his irritation as it became increasingly clear to him that idaho state university owned two such devices but didnt loan them out the states environmental agency used a lab in california and buying a gammascout would cost five hundred dollars after a number of calls back and forth he relented and approved the purchase he asked her to call the idaho state crime lab and confirm that theyd tested the mess of broken glass and ice discovered on his back porch for radioactivity while walt was sitting on the edge of the examination table the paper liner crackling beneath him when he buttoned up his uniform his cell phone rang as he was putting it away mcclure glowered at him bothered walt barked his name when he answered fleming sheriff fleming speaking hold for congressman mcmillian please the line clicked sheriff congressman i dont believe weve met no sir i was speaking with george carliner and your name came up if this is about my suggestion we drop party affiliation as a requirement for its not the congressman interrupted i told the attorney general it was an idea still in its infancy walt said nothing to do with that lets put a pin in that and come back to it another time yes sir im calling about the national law enforcement conference here in washington next week i dont know if youve heard but mel tooley has had to withdraw at the last minute i hadnt heard his wife i think something medical im very sorry to hear that walt liked tooley who was sheriff of ada county one of the fastestgrowing counties in the nation george and i were discussing a replacement youve headed the western regional sheriffs association as i understand it you held two terms as president and you gained highprofile status in that fine work you did involving vice president shaler she hadnt been elected at the time congressman she was a candidate and i really didnt mcmillian cut him off again the point is that george has recommended you to replace mel tooley at the conference to represent the state for us i wish i were asking here waltmay i call you waltbut im not the state needs you i need you the federal government is at the start of a major reorganization of everything from communication to hardware assets for state law enforcement a lot of us want them to keep their hands off we need you there youre respected youre recognizable and george and i think others will listen to you id like you out here by friday my people will work through the talking points with you and youll come out to our home in bethesda for some meetings over the weekend youll hit the ground running monday morning on the hill his head was spinning to be seen on the national stage was certain to open job opportunities it was just the kind of appointment he could see his father arranging for him elizabeth shaler now the vice president had told him she could use him in washington he wondered if this appointment had anything to do with her he wondered if mel tooleys wife was actually ill or if mel had been asked to step aside so that walt could be offered the appointment wheels within wheels can i think about it sir hell no you can pack your bag and you can thank me later one of my guys will be in touch shortly to iron out your itinerary the state picks up the bill for everything sheriff make the necessary arrangements on your end youll hear back from us by the end of the day the line went dead good news mcclure asked walt stared back at him dumbfounded unexpected walt answered honestly unexpected and slightly unbelievable he thought in spite of his accomplishments on a state and regional level there were at least a halfdozen moresenior sheriffs in line for such perks whether mel had dropped out or not the chiefs of boise pocatello coeur dalene and moscow would typically have been considered first should have been considered first someone had gotten to the congressman and had convinced him to put walts name in ahead of others one thing seemed certain it had been carefully orchestrated the more he thought about it the more he knew he couldnt attend the conference worse he saw no easy way out of it mcclure prescribed iodine tablets and wanted a followup exam in two weeks walt thanked him and headed out to the parking lot he called nancy from the cherokee and asked for a list of all financial supporters of both his opponent and congressman mcmillian i was just calling you nancy said the lab called back almost immediately the sample in the broken test tube it came back positive for radiation walt declared as if hed received the call himself whats going on mark aker left me crumbs to follow and i almost missed it a test tube of water instead of just writing me a message why im not sure left it on my back porch someone stepped on it the other night and i heard them and found it i dont know who but now i get the message its contaminated waterradioactive water and i know someone who can clear this up for me as the shuttle escalade arrived at roger hillabrands electronically controlled gate fiona kenshaw checked her face once more in the subarus rearview mirror she saw the face of a traitor shed felt compelled to accept hillabrands invitation to lunch despite her better judgment shed changed clothes three times before settling on blue jeans a tailored cranberry shirt that offset her dark hair and eyes and a black boatneck sweater over it all she wore a sheepskin coat that was her most prized and most expensive garment the attention to her clothing informed her of her desire to impress him which only served to further undermine her disposition as she climbed out of the subaru and headed across the squeaky snow to the black escalade she didnt like herself very much the driversside door opened and sean lunn climbed out though begrudgingly she moved quickly to avoid him opening the door for her there were times such gallantry was a compliment and other times it felt demeaning lunn was not doing this out of respect but because his job required it of him fiona took exception hurrying now ive got it she said lunn didnt put up any fuss immediately returning to his place behind the wheel the suv stood high off the ground she looked down to find the step rail what she saw there knocked the wind out of her mud a grayish brown mud she wondered if she hesitated too long how much of her reaction sean lunn caught had there been a recent thaw had the road they now traveled up to the mountaintop estate been rutted she might have quickly written this off but neither of those was the case more important was the muds distinctive color he was speaking talking to her saying something she wasnt listening her thoughts locked on that mud it was the same color mud theyd found on the dress shoes of the rape victim kira tulivicha sickly unnatural gray there was no mistaking it she had a photographers eye she knew color the way a painter did it might not be the same mud but what if it was do you think he said finishing a sentence im sorry never mind no please it was nothing weather talk i was wondering if itll warm again or if were in for a very early winter looks like winter to me she said am i driving too fast he said noticing her expressiona mixture of shock and contemplationand easing back on the accelerator the private drive twisted and wound its way steeply up the mountain lunn knew it well enough to drive fast some of the turns were indeed terrifying though her mind was elsewhere no no im fine he kept the speed steady i probably shouldnt say this but this your being asked up to lunchis not normal in case youre wondering i cant name the last time mr hillabrand had a woman up to the house for lunch do i look that nervous she asked preoccupied is how id put it its a little unusual she said his home instead of a restaurant but lunn had read her correctly her mind was on the mud and where and how the escalade had picked it up when he dines in town hes constantly interrupted he knows everybody and everybody knows him besides he loves showing off his place you want to score points with him compliment him on the house she wondered if part of lunns job description was to soften up roger hillabrands potential conquests that was suddenly how she felt shed struggled with accepting the invitation what signals was she sending by attending do you suppose the dirt roads will thaw or are they frozen now through winter she tried to sound nothing but curious when he didnt answer right away she lied i ride horses occasionally and the dirt roadslike lower broadford in bellevue are the best stays this cold i dont see anything thawing good point she wondered how many of roger hillabrands employees drove the escalade one of them might have driven the same road or area where the girl had been raped the silence between her and lunn felt increasingly uncomfortable had her question about the thawing roads silenced him or had they simply run out of things to say when the vehicle finally pulled to a stop fiona made a point of dropping her purse as she opened the door as she bent to retrieve it she chipped a chunk of the mud off the rail she slipped it into one of the purses outside pockets as she stood she noticed lunn suddenly looked her way and she wondered if hed seen any of that she tried to cover her excitement by expressing insecurities over having come here lunn said nothing in fact the invitation to lunch had taken a distant backseat to the discovery of the mud all she really wanted now was to get back down the hill and to connect with walt as soon as possible walt you may want a part of this walt was in the middle of a bite of pizza at smokeys on sun valley road his children and their sitter lisa at the table with him he put down the pizza part of what chuck hed recognized the smokers voice on the phone immediately chuck webb director of the sun valley lodges security front desk got an anonymous call that one of our guests might be in need of medical assistance gave us a room number i responded it was danny cutter stoned out of his mind ive called svpd just now a requirement but i know the history of you and mr cutter his probation and all and so im also calling you youre holding cutter im in the room with him can i speak to him hes way out of it walt in and out of consciousness any drugs found what looks like an ounce of a white powder taped under the sink an ounce if it tested positive it would carry twenty years for cutter given his current probation walt felt a pit in his stomach the call to the front desk was it recorded no anonymous yeah afraid for cutter was that it that was the claim but its not right hes more than just stoned hes out of it he paused whats danny cutter doing in my hotel when he lives here in town whos it booked to a john greydon paid cash we cleared the card for five hundred in incidentals i can start a trace on the card whats the condition of the room beds made thats the stink of it i know he has a history of drugs walt but this doesnt feel right yeah okay walt looked into the curiously sad eyes of his children who understood his tone of voice well enough to know what this call meant to them ill be right there he said into the phone trying to think of some new way to say what hed said to his kids too many times before investigations could spiral out of control walt did his best to keep things simple but the more threads that were added the more tangled they became randy aker had been darted and had died possibly because he was mistaken for mark mark had run away been found and then abducted a test tube had been left on his own back porcha water sample that tested positive for lowlevel radiation a cdc investigation had looked into danny cutters bottledwater company now after two years of being clean danny cutter was embroiled in a drug bust and in the middle of it all hed been invited to a conference twentyfive hundred miles away walt found himself giving danny the benefit of the doubt as he approached room on the second floor of the lodge the plush carpet absorbed his footfalls framed blackandwhite photographs of gary cooper clark gable jamie lee curtis and clint eastwood lined both walls sight of the celebrity photographs reminded him of the two worlds he served the obscenely affluent residents of ketchumsun valley and the locals that provided services for them it was a medieval caste system with him in the middle keeping the peace the sun valley lodge was the castle he knocked and a moment later was admitted danny cutter lay on his back on a love seat a pillow under his head his eyes shut there was a white smudge on his upper lip his hair was a mess he wore blue jeans penny loafers and a maroon cashmere sweater webb showed walt the tape job under the sink the baggie was thick with a white substance heroin walt suggested but taped under the sink what is this the rockford files christ walt said taking in the room once again happy hour downstairs yeah macaronis playing he meant joe macarillos jazz trio you called sun valley walt asked be here any minute how much did you tell them walt found himself considering tampering with the evidence and having never done anything close to that in his years in law enforcement he wondered what motivated him he owed danny cutter nothing hed given the man a number of breaks i told them i had a guest needed medical attention that maybe drugs were involved theyll be careful about it wont make a big scene i cant remove those drugs walt stated even if i wanted to no one said you should walt met eyes with webb and stared and stared having not touched his phone walt said my cells got shitty reception in here im going to try the hallway he did not break the eye contact youve helped out guests before yeah covered up an infidelity or two i would imagine thats obstruction webb said glancing into the bathroom walt said nothing still staring i had a call girl describe a scene to me one time webb said this was in portland back when i was on the job she and her pimp would mickey a prospective john get him up to the room and lift his wallet while the pimp hit the atm the girl pinched the johns nose and covered his mouth until he was damnnear suffocated then she put a deep spoon of coke to his nose and released her fingers john gasps for air and takes down a huge hit of coke hes now going to test positive if he involves the police not one of those guys ever fingered her or the pimp they had a nice little thing going and it just kept on going so in case we miss the smudge on his nose they give us the ounce beneath the sink i dont know thats an expensive way to do things why not a dime bag because its got to stick its got to be something we cant ignore and its got to look bigthe way danny cutter does everything what if they covered themselves what if theres video and weve got it wrong that could do us some serious damage walt agreed cameras these daysthe size of a shirt button yeah his prints are going to be on the bag webb said yup hell go down for it yeah i think so too walt said and were supposed to just stand here and let it happen walt shrugged we could be completely wrong but we arent webb leaned his head in the bathroom thing of it is when this doors shut and the lights off in there no cameras going to pick up anything he paused i thought you had a call to make i cant back you up on this walt warned im a big boy go make your call remember chuck if this comes out that dannys culpable he goes away for it so dont get your prints on that bag you hear and keep it somewhere handy i may need it hurry webb said before i lose my nerve roy coats came through the door of the cabin looking like bigfoot he was wrapped in layers of frostcoated clothing his beard and mustache were white with globs of snotty ice his face windburned from what had to have been a long snowmobile ride nice trip mark aker asked have you finished your paper coats hung various pieces of clothing on wall hooks and the backs of chairs in a semicircle around the woodstove the samakinn member who had delivered the insulin and stayed to watch akercoats had called him gearboxhe began dressing for outside with the return of coats gearbox was assigned perimeter patrol havent started it mark aker replied if its to be credible it has to be scientific that takes time gearbox took off coats installed himself on a footstool in front of aker his left elbow up on the rooms only table youre stalling coats said youve got all the insulin you need we brought everything in from your cabin with us so youve got your papers dont push your luck doc theyre searching for me by now i wouldnt be so sure about that there was something about his confidence aker studied him carefully you have contacts in the sheriffs office he waited for even the faintest of signs challis he sighed so its challis is it i didnt say anything coats reminded didnt have to your heartbeat gave you away your interior jugular vein it runs continuous with the sigmoid sinus a barometer to the soul and your soul was disturbed when i mentioned the challis sheriffs office so that much we both know youve got an insider with challis and perhaps they might have ways of knowing what custer or lemhi county is up to but do you think they could possibly know what blaine is up to walt fleming has trained with the fbi did you know that his father invented the first swat team ever you think hes going to let custer or lemhi know what hes doing you think seriously you know the toys hes got available to him all that money down in blaine have you been listening for flyovers roy your boy out there on patrolwhat kind of a heat signature does he throw off when hes out there how about this cabin your snowmobiles you think walt flemings working with satellite images i do how long do you think you can keep this up coats turned ostensibly to adjust his jacket on the back of a ladderback chair to help speed up drying more than anything he didnt want aker reading him like that not only did it creep him out that someone could read his neck but giving anything away cost him he settled back onto the footstool facing his hostage with a calm almost serene face you ever heard of shays rebellion coats asked mark aker stared back his eyes flat you know your american history dont do this aker said this was near the end of the war the revolutionary war the boston merchants pressed the state legislature to levy a tax on all the farmers and they couldnt pay the taxessame as we cant pay em today shays organized an open rebellion put together an army of some eight hundredodd and went after them pitchforks and rifles what they did was against the law and they paid mightily for it but that rebellion is considered the last battle of the revolutionary war because it changed opinion forever the federal and state governments realized they had failed at representing the people the people doc capital p now im not saying we arent breaking the law because we are and im not claiming to be a tree hugger not hardly im more what you might call a militant libertarian that won a bemused smile mark eyed all the books again his opinion of his captor changing hed read about stockholm syndrome had no desire to go there but we did what we did for a reason a purpose our government should not be dictating to other countries about things it doesnt have under control itself plain and simple someones got to show the people whats going on and thats you youre shays thats supposed to justify this he said indicating his own situation shays rebellion was put down eighteen were given death sentences two were actually executed i understand whats in store for me but goddamn it he said raising his voice his intensity lit up the air between them then his face softened im giving you a real chance here all im asking from you doc is to tell the truth im not some raghead holding an ak trying to put words in your mouth thats the beauty of it i dont have to the truth will hang them whether they hang me or not okay aker said coats did a double take he looked aker over like it was someone else sitting in that chair youll write it he said to himself he tried to contain a childlike enthusiasm i said i would and i mean it this time but ive got to ask is any of what you just told me for real all of it coats said proudly thats our heritage doc because ive got a story for you coats leaned in toward aker a little too close a changed man gloating over his victory have you ever heard of akers rebellion mark asked coatss brow knitted at the last second he seemed to anticipate what was coming to understand that mark aker had drawn him into a trap but it was too late now you have the doc moved with the quickness of a snake a sudden heat flashed in coatss thigh followed by a searing pain that bent him over the doc had been concealing a pair of scissors behind his back as coats fell forward with the pain the doc drove both elbows into his back and forced his face against the cast iron of the hot stove the smell of burning hair and blistering skin filled the air as coats sat upright at which point the scissors plunged deeply up and into his left armpit remaining there as the doc let go and grabbed a chair he swung the chair and a lightheaded coats ducked to avoid the blow only to realize too late that he was not the intended target instead the sheet metal stovepipe dislodged with the chairs clanging contact and the small cabin immediately filled with acrid gray smoke the doc snagged coatss winter jacket and threw it on the stove it smoldered only seconds before melting and smoking the doc seized his own jacket from the wall grabbed a flashlight from the windowsill and was out the door coats vomited the skin on his burned face felt as if it were shrinking and tightening on his skull his beard was singed off on that side and in its place branded on his cheek at an awkward angle were the reversed letters sgnitsacvermont castings the embossed name on the stove he dragged himself toward the door his leg wound bleeding badly his arm in pain the doc had known exactly what he was doing both wounds immobilized him he reached the door a blood trail painted behind him hacking unable to breathe for the pain he tried to get to his knees to reach the doorknob but his leg wound wouldnt let him he grabbed hold of the knob only to realize his bulk was blocking the door he collapsed back down to the floor reached for his ankle a revolver in a calf holster fired off three rounds waited debated using the last three decided against it if aker returned coats wanted some rounds left for selfdefense fuck he screamed smoke swirled just above his head he coughed and gagged and forced himself up through insurmountable pain toward the door the doorknob it was gearbox horrified he wretched at the sight of coatss face air coats groaned as he tasted blood at the back of his throat the cold came through the door like a hammer the doc coats mumbled right before he passed out marty walts fouryearold golden banged against the fire screen and sent one of emilys mittens flying the mitten landed on a fresh ember and soon the wet wool began to smolder producing a godawful stink the foul smell brought walt from the kitchen to the twins who knew they werent supposed to play fetch indoors their fathers expression came as a complete surprise not one of anger but curiosity laughing they ran for cover behind the couch but the admonishment never came instead a moment later they overheard him speaking on the phone with lisa and they mistakenly believed his leaving was the punishment for their crime could you possibly come over and get them to bed he asked somethings come up at work the smell brandon asked nursing his arm in the sling from the passenger seat of the cherokee a wool mitten yes at first i was pissed at the girls same old same old but then i recognized that smell i remembered that smell lon bernies ranch remember that stink impossible to forget burning wool walt said thats what the smell was burning wool walt killed the headlights way out on the plowed twolane state road and continued on by the dim glow of a fingernail moon they parked the vehicle a half mile from the driveway leading onto lon bernies ranch and went on foot both sporting day packs sixcell flashlights that doubled as nightsticks and their mm berettas they made quite the pair throwing night shadows in the soft moonlight walt cursed with dna that got him to five foot ten only with boots on had compensated by working the weight room until he was as wide in the chest as he was tall brandon meanwhile shopped the big and tall guys stores now the deputy was onewinged and walking awkwardly because of it they held to the left of the road putting the fence as a screen between them and lon bernies farmhouse does it bother you that we have no authority in this county brandon said his words puffing out from his mouth as gray fog i wouldnt say no authority but it does make things a little tricky tricky if hes up to something hell shoot us like dogs and ask questions later welcome to lemhi county im aware of that walt said oh and this just in he wasnt real thrilled to see us last time in daylight point taken are you trying to get me killed in the line of duty walt didnt dignify that its midnight sheriff couldnt we have walt cut him off if wed come by day all wed have accomplished was to tip him off to our interest in his burn pit hed have snuffed it buried it and it would have froze solid leaving us waiting til april or may to dig for evidence walt tugged on brandon s sheriffs coat pulling him lower as they drew closer to the gate it has to be now when we can get a good look at whatevers in there we owe that to mark when the wind shifted the putrid smell hit them both at the same moment damn brandon said they turned onto the property staying low the burn pit was on the far side of the ranch requiring them to pass the farmhouse and the outbuildings to reach it walt assumed there would be dogsthere were always dogs on ranchesbut that wild game was more likely to wake dogs than humans and so the trick was to move quickly and keep to shadows it was bitterly cold somewhere in the teens each light breeze penetrated and burned their faces ducking they hurried through the dry crunching snow as barking erupted from inside the farmhouse to their right they ran across the plowed driveway and ducked into the deep snow behind a hay swather if lon bernie was awakened by the barking he might think he had a shot at poaching an elk or deer from his bedroom window they waited brandon began to shiver though didnt say a thing finally the dogs stopped their noise walt held brandon there another few minuteslong minutesknowing that bernie could be moving window to window in hopes of spotting some trespassing game then they stood returned to the plowed driveway and moved together toward the far side of a toolshed from there around a granary and from the granary around the far side of the main barn here walt picked up tractor tracksdualiestwo tracks of double tires each pair four feet wide running parallel to the barn and disappearing like train tracks into the dark he and brandon followed these away from the glow of the mercury lamp out into an artificial dusk and finally into the coal black night clouds having moved in to mask the moon the hideous smell growing stronger with every step they never dared use their flashlights for fear of being spotted at times they stopped awaiting a cloud to pass by the moon the surrounding dark so intense the silence so complete that had it not been for his heartbeat in his ears and the stinging cold in his toes walt might have thought hed died it took forever to reach the burn pit nearly an hour had passed since theyd left the cherokee by the side of the road finally the tractor tire tracks gave way to a wide disturbance in the velvet field of snow just as the stink from the pit achieved epic proportions the pit appeared before them as a square black shadow amid the white glaze of snowfall slash had been pushed into a pile on the left side a tangle of dead limbs and detritus stacked well over ten feet high the pit itself had been dug crudely into the brown earth some years before a catchall of burnable waste which to a rancher meant anything from plastic pesticide containers and fertilizer bags to household paper trash and spent gearbox oil walt kneeled and cupping his flashlight to mute its light aimed a diffused beam down into the pit brandon projectilevomited down into the pit staggered and stepped away normally he was a man of a strong constitution but his reaction reflected the horror there an assortment of limbs bodies and heads of dozens of sheep all blackened the burned skin peeling back in leaflike flakes the scabbed unmoving eyes bulging or missing having exploded from the heat fuel had been poured over everything and lit further discoloring the skin and patches of wool and leaving a mass of twisting limbs and burgeoning flesh ripped open by the gases of decomposition to expose frozen pink tears in the carbon wasteland of dead animal the smell was of everything bad in the world excrement burned hair lost life walt dug around in his day pack withdrew the gammascout and a dell laptop that was part of his offices mobile command center jesus brandon said pulling himself together sorry about the hurl sheriff it aint pretty walt said and then some get rope ready brandon slipped his day pack off youre not thinking what i think youre thinking stop thinking so much you cant be serious walt had the gammascout plugged into the laptop the laptop powering up the cord isnt near long enough sheriff ive got to go down there look for a decent hold try that fence post sheriff you dont burn your hoof stock you sell its meat the only reason you wouldnt sell the meat is if the meat is contaminated wholesale slaughter like this come on its the only explanation but weve got to prove somethings going on and youve got one good arm tommy you cant go down in there and you cant pull me out so get that rope tied off and do it quickly he said calmly he lifted his chin indicating the distant ranch we may have company brandon spun around a flickering light appeared in flashes between the outbuildings a powerful flashlight probably the dogs barking walt said when a guy like lon bernies got something to hide he sleeps a lot lighter turn that laptop around so the screen faces away brandon said walt did so his gloves were off his fingers stinging he doubted the screen would show at such a great distance given that they were surrounded by higher walls of moved snow but it was a worthy precaution a rancher out at midnight was not yet cause for alarm it could be anything from a sick animal that needed checking to a freeze patrol making sure all the heaters were working prior to turning in even if lon bernies guilt had gotten the better of him there would be no reason to look beyond the barns and outbuildings a vision flashed in walts imagination the twin chevrons of the massive tire treads that the tractor had imprinted in the snow he and brandon had followed the tracks out here no doubt leaving a trail of boot prints we should keep going he encouraged ropes tied off there was no way for walt to climb down the rope with the laptop in hand so he put it back into the day pack but without fully closing the screen so it would remain running then he lowered himself down the dirt wall and into a piece of semifrozen hell brandon trained the light down on him walt arrived at a muddy layer in the corner of the pit where the pile of carcasses left a gap despite the freezing temperature the smell wafting up from the decomposing carcasses was as bad as anything hed ever experienced he zipped his coat up over his face so that only his eyes showed onearmed the day pack around to where he could dig the laptop out and balancing the laptop on his left forearm like a waiter would a tray handled the gammascout with his right hand he trained the geiger counter on the nearest bloated carcass its digital readout fell well within the range of the acceptable amounts of radiation hed expected to see a much higher reading gagging from the odor he aimed the gammascout up the carcass toward the rotting burned head the bloat had cracked open the animals blackened skin with expansion and this is where the meters numbers edged up slightlythe frozen exposed flesh water walt thought sheriff we got company brandon called down into the pit his hand cupped so tightly over his mouth and nose that walt barely understood him an atv maybe two small headlights walt set the gammascout onto the keyboard and dug around the day pack with his free hand he came out with a hunting knife with a sixinch serrated blade of carbon steel he hesitated only briefly before plunging the tip through the hardened shell of burned skin the bloated carcass spit through the rent and hissed out a gas that made walt retch christ almighty brandon complained the stink quickly reaching him the meters readout jumped significantly this time to dangerous levels light walt called out brandon in monitoring the approaching vehicle had neglected his responsibility now the light caught walt and the sheriff glanced down at the fresh biosensor tag he had clipped to his uniform a day earlier the same wedge was shaded a ghostly purple indicating additional exposure to radioactivity check your tag walt hollered up from the pit shit brandon said a moment later im hot his voice was now overcome by the whine of the atvs motor how close walt shouted a minute maybe less bury the rope in the snow hide yourself in that slash pile hide now tommy thats an order walt felt the same way as his deputy it was not in his nature to hide but for a rancher to burn this many sheepto throw away that kind of moneythe stakes had to be extremely high high enough to kidnap or kill a rancher like lon bernie was likely to shoot first and ask questions later and walt had no great desire to test that theory if lon bernie figured out his burned sheep had been discovered he and brandon might wind up buried along with them walt slapped the laptop shut and zipped it and the gammascout in the day pack he kept the pack in front of him as he curled down into the corner of the pit his head lower than the nearest sheep and huddled there the sound of the atv grew progressively closer and louder like the buzzing of a bee the cold penetrated as he held his head between his legs offering only the back of his jacket to the night sky bernie would have to shine a light and look right down at him in order to see him the atv arrived and quieted its motor idling out of the corner of his eye walt caught the light from the headlights shifting as the driver moved the vehicle to spread the light around the edges of the pit walt believed hed discovered the boot prints behind the barn had followed them out to the pit so now finding no one bernie had to wonder if they were fresh tracks or if a couple of his hands had come out here on foot it was the wrong time of year to go marching around the ranch on foot bernieor whoever was driving the atvwould be trying to reconcile things at last walt heard the dry crunch of footfalls the driver was off the atv and heading toward the pit silence followed walt could picture the man up there studying the pile of bloated carcasses troubled by the sensation that all was not well walt had been there enough times himself trusting his senses more than his reasoning he heard something unexpected a stream of water lon bernie or whoever was up there was urinating into the pitnot a pleasant practice in these temperatures but then walts nose took over not urine but petroleum diesel fuel a shudder rushed through him the driver of the atv had not come looking for them hed come to douse the pit and burn the sheep in the dead of night with the pit dug as deeply as it was the flames would show as no more than a glow at night the rising black smoke not revealing itself to the distant neighbors only a plume would linger by daylight burning trash and debris was a yearround practice on any ranch a little smoke wasnt going to raise eyebrows the atv held a drum of fuel oil it was hand pumped and it showered onto the carcasses none of the fuel fell directly on walt it was concentrated toward the pits center and the heaped carcasses but it came gallon after gallon the stench alone enough to choke him and then minutes later the match the pit lit on fire all of a sudden diesel is a slowburning fuel there was no great explosion or even a whoosh flame simply ran across the pile chasing the spent fuel the heat increased the flesh began to pop walt knew brandon would be anxious might ruin things by leaping to walts rescue but then the atvs motor whirred and grew faint the rope struck walt on his back jesus sheriff the concentration of flames was well away from walt but the heat was intense and the fire was spreading he grabbed on to the rope placed his feet on the wall of the pit and drew himself up and out where brandon offered his one good hand and pulled hard the atvs taillights receded down the access road youre out of your mind brandon said his face aglow in the light of the fire his skin shined from the sweat of anxiety his eyes flashed white wide with anger that he disguised as outrage i would have called for help if id needed it walt said offhandedly jesus how was that possibly worth it sheriff indignant how is that possibly walt patted the day pack it was well worth it tommy he looked back at the burning heap of flesh popping and bubbling he was thinking about mark aker and how much time had passed since his abduction he was thinking that in these temperatures fire connected one person to another one ranch to another one life to another and that somewhere out there mark aker hopefully was near a fire just like he was walts chance of finding and rescuing mark aker came down to efficiency of turning a number on a geiger counter into hard evidence of uncovering an evidence trail that could connect the discolored biosensor to the missing veterinarian he understood where that trail would start and rising to his toes could almost see it in the blanket of darkness that stretched for miles up this nearly uninhabited valley senator james peavys ranch lay just out of view mark aker was surprised by his own strength his legs felt good adrenaline perhaps he walked in the snowmobile track because it was easier going it followed what appeared to be a road given the lack of trees and shrubs not only could he move faster on the track but he was less likely to leave tracks to follow the moon turned the snow lavender he heard shouting behind him coming from the cabin coats and gearbox these first few minutes were critical they wouldnt know where hed gone around back to the shed toward the woodpile or up the snowmobile track theyd search for tracks leading into the woods it wouldnt take them longfive minutes maybe lessto realize he hadnt headed into virgin snow that he must have taken the snowmobile track and then theyd come after him hed hurt coats badly with that burn would coats stay and lick his wounds or join the hunt the answer came immediately as more shouting erupted behind him and the coughing of the snowmobile trying to start rumbled through the woods aker had yet to turn on the flashlight still negotiating by the light of the moon if he left the snowmobile track his prints would give him away but if he stayed he was only minutes from being caught he could try jumping off the track making his first prints in the virgin snow as far off the beaten track as possible but he knew coats to be a professional tracker he had to outsmart him think at the first curve the snowmobile track left the road and weaved through the thick forest of lodgepole pine and aspen no doubt following a shortcut only available in winter months he passed a dozen or more trees before he heard the chainsawlike buzz of the snowmobiles motor catching life theyd be on him in less than a minute he stopped turned his mind counting down the time he was wasting then he saw it a branch the track cut incredibly close to a twisted pine that had once been struck by lightning it was a craggy old tree with a few sparse branches low enough to the ground to reach by jumping aker squatted and leaped but his gloves slid off the only branch close enough to reach he tried again and again but could not grab hold now the snowmobile was crying out well under way he jumped a fourth time and managed to hook his hands and lace his fingers over the branch he walked his feet up the trunk hooked a knee over the branch and struggled up to a sitting position with the adrenaline spent he was far weaker than hed first thought he continued to climb following the trees natural ladder two three four branches up and now looking down he saw only branches he moved himself higher and on the opposite side of the tree from the track he straddled the branch and kept himself against the trunk the snowmobiles headlight winked through the woods as the grind of the motor drew nearer it was traveling slowly and now a second light was revealed a flashlight searching both sides of the track aker caught himself holding his breath as it came into view staying in the track two men gearbox was driving coats straddling the motorcyclestyle seat behind gearbox holding the flashlight the snowmobile purred up the track approaching akers tree the flashlight alternately illuminating the forest on both sides throwing harsh shadows that moved around in a jarring dance it continued past a red taillight now nothing more the sound grew more and more distant a person on foot was no match for a snowmobile it would only take them minutes to realize theyd missed him aker climbed down out of the tree as quickly as humanly possible he landed back on the track and took off for the cabin he tried to run but wasnt up to it it seemed to take forever to reach the camp but it was only minutes but how long until the snowmobile returned inside the cabin nowthe smell of burned hair and flesh a nauseating stinkhe stole a backpack ripped a regional map off the wall and stuffed it and other items into the zippered compartment canned foods matches a church key can opener saltshaker a fork and a kitchen knife he snatched up the syringes from the table and took the vials of insulin and the medication coats had used to subdue him opiates and narcotics a pair of wool socks hanging by the woodstove a wool cap he grabbed a pair of snowshoes from a peg the sound of the snowmobile was suddenly louder closer hed heard the two talk about spotting a cow elk by the salt lick that meant game which meant a game trail to follow out back he briefly risked the flashlight the moon having hidden behind the fastmoving clouds overhead he couldnt find the salt lick the unbroken snow that formed an apron beyond the shed trapped him as neatly as a fence leaving any tracks would give him away and there in the flashlights beam came his answer two woodpiles one for the split logs neatly stacked very high and beyond it a pile of ten or twelve massive tree trunks ready for cutting and splitting small animals had greatly disturbed the snow in and around the logs his tracks wouldnt be easily noticed by daylight they might spot his route but if he hurried he could be far gone by then he struggled up the pile of stacked wood winded and weak he fumbled his way over it and fell to the other side next he took two great leaps in succession and reached the pile of felled trees he clambered over this pile as well the whine of the snowmobile fast approaching in all hed left but two prints in the deep snow between the stacked wood and felled trees both hidden by the woodpile itself he crept under a trees snowladen branches and out to the other side crawled under the branches of the next tree to hide his tracks he was at least twenty yards from the shed now the snowmobiles engine coughed to silence coats shouted fuck this he cant be far aker strapped on the snowshoes his pursuers searched the far side of the cabin first buying him precious time he found a rhythm in a halfspeed run leaning forward slightly to compensate for the added weight of the backpack the adrenaline was back and with it some needed energy he had no compass and no idea where he was but he was no stranger to the outdoors and he knew where he was headed as far away as he could get sunday walt struck the brass knocker sharply against the plate on the front door despite a career of getting used to it he was put off by the grandeur of the farmhouse and generational wealth it represented brandon stomped his boots on the porch trying to feel his feet you sure about this sheriff its almost three in the morning were not driving back over here tomorrow no offense but you dont smell so good walt smacked the door knockera brass cowboy bootagainst the door again standing beneath the porch roof they didnt see a light go on in a secondstory window but the snow behind them lit up from the glow and walt stepped back the door rattled and opened senator james peavy wore a pair of blue jeans with a sweater turned inside out he squinted into the brightness of the porch light his head of wispy white hair was thin on top a fact usually hidden by the ubiquitous stetson sheriff astonishment deputy we need a minute of your time walt said you come in here smelling like that obviously you must said peavy waving them inside come in the parlor could have been from a homesteading museum peavy motioned for them to sit walt wanted to stand but he took a seat on a blue velvet love seat with ruby piping brandon took the end of the piano bench facing into the spacious room sheer curtains hung on the windows of airbubbled imperfect glass peavy remained standing an act that infuriated walt perhaps sensing this the rancher then sat down on the edge of a blueandwhitecrocheted slide rocker he moved gently forward and back so why would lon bernie burn fifty head of sheep and why in the dead of night peavys life in politics mixed with time spent in the great outdoors afforded him a wonderfully expressive face gracious and kind and handsome even half awake he possessed the countenance of a minister and the composure of a therapist you want to talk about lon bernies sheep he said id rather not dance around the issue mark akers life is in play somethings going on here and before i tear the lid off this thing i wanted to give you a chance to break it to me gently so youre here out of thoughtful consideration are you at three in the morning this was a convenient time not for all of us radiation contamination walt said peavy scowled an expression impossible to read as anything but surprise jesus what is that smell help me out here james walt said whats going on this is your party the invitation for me to go to washington that was your doing why because i think youre underrated walt sometimes we control the timing of the events in our lives sometimes not the vice president is eager for you to serve on a national level dont think this was just me you have more friends than youre aware of one of thems dead anothers missing an uneasy silence the piano bench squeaked under brandon s weight you called mark to take care of your sheep weve been over this i thought it was the hay or grain mad cow or something like that come to find out its the water peavy asked to speak with walt privately and walt told brandon to stay where he was he wanted a witness to anything discussed and he said so peavy winced part disgust part concession sheriff if you have a crime to charge me with please do so otherwise senator i understand your concern over mark aker i share it i know nothing about his disappearance do you hear me walt nothing as for your suggestion this other subject i can tell you this there is a good deal of money involved when a rancher loses a head or two of livestock what youre reporting with lon twentyfive fifty head thats not just a backbreaker its a bank breaker thats fortyfive thousand plus the loss of the ewe producing for you probably a hundred grand all told on our margins thats your operation or damn near think about that walt consider that very carefully it isnt entered into lightly youre assuming the invitation to washington somehow benefited me but what if its me or people in high places trying to protect you what if thats how wrong youve got this if theres a crime then youre a victimlon bernies a victim why wont you come forward how can you not come forward the senator arched his brows your explanation not mine then whats yours i dont have one dont need one mark came out to these ranches because of sick sheep he discovered radiation poisoning in the water he kept his work away from his office because he understood the politics he tried to warn me about the politics and youre not listening this cant be you talking senator weve known each other forever i consider us friends walt said if i knew anything about mark aker id help you but i dont the two mens eyes met no one is going to help you im trying to protect you sheriff take the trip to washington protect me walts face was scarlet his voice too loud for the room the lon bernies of this world make their own laws you and i both know a badge doesnt mean much in this valley ironic since weve both served the law ourselves but its different over here you know that if it wasnt for the vehicles it could be a hundred years ago maybe they buy off the local sheriff but im not the local sheriff worth taking note of walt stood took a menacing step toward an unreasonably calm james peavy and caught himself as brandon rose off the piano bench peavy said maybe by finding mark aker you find your answers i dont know but by looking for him you put yourself at risk walt hear me on this hear me good this valley isnt a safe place for you go home keep to your side of the mountains youll find nothing but trouble over here but if youre a victim why not report it walt repeated now exasperated since when can someone intimidate james peavy peavy didnt speak again his expression suggested not resignation but determination which confused walt he walked to the door and opened it for them as cold a night as walt could remember the outside of the envelope bore his name handwritten in a lovely script although walt couldnt actually touch the envelope as it was sealed in thick redtinted plastic biohazard was printed on the front in large letters the desk sergeant explained that the envelopehand delivered to the office by fiona kenshawhad tripped the electronic sniffer used on all incoming mail contaminated he was working on fortyfive minutes of sleep hed showered shaved changed his uniform and had eaten the scrambled eggs lisa prepared for him shed slept on the couch and had let the girls brush her hair and put it into a ponytail so that she looked somewhat disheveled as she washed dishes while walt ate it felt weird having her in the house he hadnt thanked her hadnt said much at all theyd met eyes at one point during the morning confusion just before shed left her eyes had said something about feeling sorry for him while all he felt was impossibly guilty hed driven the girls to school because this was their routine theyd played a word game on the waythe animal gameand walt found himself not wanting to stop maybe just keep driving his eyes on the two faces in his rearview mirror when hed let them out hed run around the car to hug them both girls appeared embarrassed by the gesture though neither complained radiation he asked his desk sergeant no it was indicated as only biohazard she said the machine doesnt get specific if an item alerts for radioactivity it goes in that box they gave us biohazard gets the red bags after the blaine county sheriffs office had received a threatening letter containing a white substance that eventually came back as arsenic but had been believed to be anthrax the feds had required the installation of the sniffera fifteenthousanddollar machine subsidized by the federal governmentand it had been sop ever since to test each piece of mail arriving at the office the letter bearing fionas unmistakable handwriting had been the first ever to trip the sensors and the desk sergeant seemed more excited than frightened by the event you want me to issue a bolo asked the desk sergeant be on lookout im not arresting her walt said she works for us the desk sergeant held her tongue but her eyes reminded him it was procedure to arrest anyone suspected of attempting to contaminate the offices it was also procedure to involve the postal inspectors he answered that look of hers this wasnt sent through the mail it wasnt an intentional contamination and my guess is its one big misunderstanding before we call anyone im going to clear this up and what do i do with this she said lifting the red bag by one corner give it to me he answered accepting the bag walt held a morning meeting with his two lieutenants during which he passed along the daytoday so he could continue working on akers abduction nancy called fiona and when fiona arrived walt led her outside and they walked around the block circumnavigating the former courthouse and city hall a grand threestory brick building built in the late s it now housed the dmv and county records he didnt bother with a jacket it was already in the upper forties the early bite of winter seemed to be mitigating at least at the lower altitudes he produced the red baggie from his coat pocket i didnt want to discuss this in the office but can you please tell me why you left me an envelope that tripped our biosensors you might have warned me she stopped abruptly my letters a biohazard i thought youd given it to me because you knew it was contaminated that it was related to marks work somehow she told him then about being picked up by sean lunn at hillabrands about spotting the dried mud on the escalades step rail about how the unusually pale color had reminded her of the dried mud on the rape victims clothing walt unsealed and opened the plastic bag as she explained its contents he tore open the envelope and saw that it contained both a note and a small amount of a pale brown dirt roger hillabrand the mud was on his car i was going to suggest that you have the lab compare this to what we found on the girls shoes thats certainly available to us rogeror more likely lunndrove that car somewhere near where that girl tulivich kira tulivich he provided had been ohio gulch or triumph walt said the two most likely spots in this valley where youd find contaminants the dump and the old triumph mine but the fact is that kira tulivich was at the wedding at hillabrands youre the witness on that mud on his rails and her shoesodds are its from his house or at least somewhere on his property everythings frozen solid and covered in two feet of snow she reminded him maybe not everything he said you want to help of course can you get yourself invited back up there you want me to spy for you once weve confirmed weve got a match my guys and i can work ohio gulch and triumph and we will but ruling out hillabrand would be the first step in any kind of an investigation you start with the most obvious that she was in those shoes on his property the night she was raped the mud may have absolutely nothing to do with anything other than she attended the reception youre not spying he said putting it in finger quotes youre eliminating him from consideration i attended the reception and i didnt come home with any mud on my shoes im just saying thats where it starts if i come at roger hillabrand with a request to collect evidence there will be a line of attorneys at my door ten deep okay i accept ill spy for you she said its not spying its just looking for some mud he has a pond up there but this would more likely be around a hot tub or along the edge of a heated driveway but contaminated im not saying i have the answers im just telling you where we start im not going to find any mud up there walt its frozen solid the escalades the connection if you ask me rogers guy sean lunn was at the same afterparty the same barthe same somethingas kira was he probably doesnt know it but hes the one who can help you not that he ever would womens intuition dont patronize me walt roger will never allow it hell stick his boy on the private jet and send him to brazil for all eternity rather than get involved with something here that cant possibly do anything but sully his companys name youve gotten to know him i see jealousy doesnt suit you walt felt his face flush was he jealous it struck him that maybe he was she spared him further embarrassment how long for the lab to compare the two dirt samples several weeks i would think its never fast her face sagged but we may not need it he said we already have a sample of the mud from her shoes we took it at the hospital im thinking all we need to do is run that sample through our mail sniffer if it kicks as hazardous thats good enough for me that gives us probable cause we can send it off to the lab but we dont need to wait for specific results fiona nodded ill bring my camera that gives me the added excuse to look all around but it cant be a hot tub its on the escalades step rail it was thrown up onto the car when the car was going at a good clip its got to be a road or a driveway and the only thing that makes sense to me is that the contaminants are salts that keep the ground from freezing like i said thats ohio gulch or triumph were on it maybe it was the repetition or her stating so confidently that it was salts keeping the ground from freezing but standing there he suddenly knew exactly where and with whom to begin this discussion hed nearly had his chance a few nights earlier do not rain walt chanted to himself staring up through the cherokees windshield for an area that saw three hundred sunfilled days a year the skies had picked this particular monday to threaten and it was in the low fortiesthe one time he was out searching for preexisting mud he could remember a time not long ago when the road out to the landfill had been a poorly maintained dirt track leading to a giant unsupervised pit in the ground but now he drove on asphalt all the way out to a series of excavations all surrounded by chainlink fence monitored by an attendant in an entrance booth hey ginny walt said his elbow out the window the cherokee perched on a concrete slab a vehicle scale large enough to weigh tractor trailers walt just need a look around not dumping nothing no maam howre the girls wild more like teenagers every day sorry to hear it hows your mother doing he asked same old same old nothing going to kill her nor should it second cancer in two years but shes still doing her own shopping the way it should be i hope im that strong when im eighty right there with you anything new on mark aker working on it everyone in my department is that what brings you here no im just sightseeing yeah true beauty and the smell is certainly worth a visit an aroma coma may i pass be my guest she tripped a button that lifted the redandwhitestriped barricade and walt drove off the scale and onto dirt the surface was crushed granite like nearly every road in the county rock chips and sand mixed with a good deal of clay the color of coffee with cream he was no great judge considered himself mostly colorblind but the dried mud on kira tulivichs shoes had been a pale pasty brown almost gray the dirt he saw here wasnt close to that color the landfill pits were constantly being dug up covered over and redug bringing every kind of unwanted thing to the surface he drove into a big open field of dirt patches of litter trapped on the surface leading to a sharp edge beyond which a wellgraded ramp carried the big caterpillar tractors and loaders fifty feet down into an organized mass of trash and household debris at the bottom a light drizzle struck his windshield and he cursed aloud in the confines of the car several miles north of ohio gulch walt arrived at the turn for east fork a valley canyon running east of the highway and parallel to a likenamed creek east fork represented the dichotomy of the valley a crossroads where the bluecollar community of triumph situated on an abandoned mine site met the multimilliondollar homes that bordered the creek the mine had been dug and exhausted a hundred years earlier leaving behind vast fields of chemically poisoned gravel and clay tailings so toxic that nothing not a single weed would grow the steppes of tailings each the size of several football fields rose in three successive levels thirty to forty feet high just as east fork road left the affluent neighborhoods behind a hippie community had sprung up in triumph in the late s squatters willing to risk living on the top tier of the toxic mine tailings for thirty years triumph had been listed as among the nations top five most toxic sites on the epas superfund list no cleanup money had ever been allocated despite health warnings the residents stayed as land values escalated the squatter shacks grew to trailers mobile homes and even a log cabin or two the result was a ramshackle assortment of dwellings whose occupants had reputations as eccentrics renegades and in some cases outlaws senator james peavys warning echoed in walts ears though he was much closer to home people made their own laws there were places in this county that a uniform felt more like a bullseye than a designation of authority and triumph was one of them the road rose more steeply on the final approach to triumph remains of ancient mining equipment jutted out of the hill the road ascended to a cluster of dwellings a desolate desperate landscape juxtaposed against stunning views to the west as walt made the drive he noticed that each terraced steppe changed color the lowest was a blackgray clay the middle graygreen the top grayish yellow even half colorblind walt saw the similarity to the dried mud on kira tulivichs shoes he drove through the neighborhood carefully he hadnt been up here in a while and was surprised to see some decentlooking homes interspersed with the trailers wood smoke spewed from stovepipes a few dogs patrolled parked next to a brokendown rv he spotted an old beater subaru that he recognized as taylor crabtrees walts office had impounded the car twice even from a distance he could see discoloring along the side of the car now it added up crabtree a repeat juvie offender his face a battered mess now mud on his car walt parked alongside the subaru the mud was the same grayish yellow as kira tulivichs shoes walt saw his own face in the reflection off the glass of the driver door as he stole a look inside the dark snow tan hid any evidence of fatigue or lines of concern the sunglasses masked his eyes only his cracked lips and stubble beard offered a glimpse into the strain of the past several days walt squinted pushing closer to the glass on the subarus dashboard was a sticker kbs burritos kira tulivich had offered only one seemingly irrelevant piece of information from the examination table kbs walt broke off a chunk of the mud and bagged it then slipped the beretta out of its holster walt ducked down alongside the subaru and tripleclicked the radio com clipped to his uniforms epaulet this signaled to his dispatcher a lowvoice communication he or she was to answer in clicks not voice walt reported his location in a whisper and requested backup using the radio code to signal no lights or sirens he released the mics button and waited two clicks backup was on its way after two minutes passed walt lost patience waiting for backup to arrive he reminded himself that crabtree was just a kid he edged around the car crossed to the rv and put his ear to the door if the kid dived out a window or climbed out a skylight walt would regret not waiting but he hammered on the door just the same crabtree its sheriff fleming open the door please the rv moved and squeaked on its springs crabtree walt called loudly dont be stupid the door swung open keep your hands where i can see them crabtree wore blue jeans and the denim shirt from elbies his hands were stained black from work his hair a rats nest his beatup eyes were filled with contempt and soured with distrust yeah step outside walt said backing up okay now hands against the rv and your butt back walt frisked him good fine he holstered the beretta and asked crabtree to turn around i dont know nothing about any guys trying to get people to join anything its not about that walt said crabtree shrugged do you know a girla young womannamed kira tulivich sure i do the admission surprised walt crabtree was the kind of kid whod deny everything you know her from where school from around you know it started to rain again walt ignored it taylor crabtree checked the sky a couple times shedding more light onto his cutup face know her well nah just know who she is her type and me we dont exactly mix her type you mean shes older or pretty or what rich he said thats the way it is at school us and them you know when was the last time you saw her crabtrees hesitation belied his answer i dont know you know what were going to do taylor were going to put a forensics team from boise on your car you ever seen csi like that they vacuum the car develop prints lift some photograph others theyll be looking for hair and fibers that connect back to kira tulivich that mud on the car all that evidencesome of it you cant even seeis going to bring you down like a ton of bricks you want to get ahead of this now is your chance crabtree wasnt paying attention walt followed his line of sight spotting a couple of pickup trucks coming up east fork road and then in the far distance a cruiser his backup still a mile away walt thought he could use this running out of time here when was the last time you saw kira tulivich crabtree refocused on walts stern face when i seen her i thought it was her but i aint never seen her all dolled up like that the boys eyes drifted back to the advancing patrol car forget about that walt said he radioed the unit to hold off the cruiser pulled to the side of the road just as the two pickups drove out of sight you saw her i said i did didnt i crabtree sounded irritated and more nervous than a few minutes earlier walkingon the side of the road walking what road and i stopped to you know lets assume i dont know walt said she got in but she was fuckedup you knew this how because she was fuckedup shit sheriff fuckedup you dont know fuckedup in what way high real high barely recognized me barely standing up that kind of fuckedup real fuckedup intoxicated no more than that high boozedup yeah but fried you know spaced and i say get in and she gets in like its cool you know with me i mean thats like totally not happening and i say where to and this is like i dont know the middle of the fucking night and she was on which road walt asked crabtree looked as if hed been slapped this road he said pointing east fork headed down toward the highway and you were headed where at that time of night the middle of the night i dont know dont remember smokes i suppose mountain view he said referring to a gas station quick stop okay and once shes in the car you know i see shes all messedup the dress is toast her face looks like shit like shes been beaten real bad her left tit comes out of the dress and she barely notices stuffs it back in and looks over at me with these creepedout dead eyes and now im thinking shes loopy because someone hit her too hard or something like my moms used to getand im no longer asking her where to im booking it for the hospital you took her to the hospital i dropped her there yeah i thought about taking her in you know but what was going to happen to me id be talking to you the way i am right now and no one would believe me just like you dont believe me thats how it is with me thats how it always is so fuck that i just dropped her let her figure it out you came to my house the other night walt said the back door that wasnt me spoken too quickly and with his eyes to the ground were you thinking about telling me about kira the boy had tipped he was bursting to tell all wished for a quiet room other circumstances but crabtree looked at the cruiser again and the light went out of his eyes he fumbled for a cigarette the moment had passed there are a couple things that need to happen now walt said i promise you it wasnt me i didnt do shit to her sheriff you dont have to go down for this but i need more did she say anything to you a name maybe crabtree tightened he took a long drag off the cigarette and the smoke disappeared inside him you look scared taylor real scared of me of the possibility of prison or something else it took crabtree a long time to speak something else a rape conviction puts you in the sex offender database itll follow you the rest of your life people will put posters up on telephone poles near your house theyll cross the street to avoid you crabtree twitched at the mention of rape his eyes narrowing he hadnt known a weight lifted from walt a smile slipped across his face but he wiped it off with the back of his hand blah blah blah crabtree glanced around again either afraid to make eye contact with walt or plotting an escape dont try it walt said what whatever it is youre planning are we going to do this or not he held out his hands to be cuffed work with me taylor crabtree looked walt squarely in the eye fuck you and your posters please walt pleaded do what you gotta do said crabtree the terrain rose up through the tangled forest the dark bark of the trees like burnt offerings against the sparkling sundappled snow a snowmobile whined as it followed a game trail its motor straining its tread spewing ice and elk scat in its wake the irritating sound grew fainter as it was swallowed by the landscape along that same route stood a majestic fir tree battlescarred from a lightning strike forty years earlier it was split from the first longdead limb to its fourfootdiameter base while half the tree had died as a result of the strike new growth extended up the other half with gnarly tightly grouped branches scarred with veins of charcoal running like arrows toward the sky the split gave the trunk a charred inverted v shape that at its base looked like a door to a teepee it was just wide enough for a man to squeeze through which was exactly what mark aker had done hours earlier hed done so without leaving the game path without causing any prints or impressions that might reveal his hiding place forcing his way through the split in the tree hed fallen into the cavity two feet below the snows surface and onto a bed of leaves aker had burrowed down into the leaves using them as both insulation and camouflage he passed the coldest hours of the night drifting in and out of sleep knees to the chest the buzz of the snowmobile woke him steadily approaching like a nagging insect as it tore past his hiding place he realized that at least for now he was safe and though he was regaining strength if he hoped to save his feet from frostbite he would have to get moving soon at some point hed have to leave the game trail for deeper snow even though it would create a path for his captors to follow he waited over fortyfive minutes for the return of the snowmobile sunlight blazing on the very tips of the trees he could partially see through coats had stripped him of his watch but he was guessing it was late morning or early afternoon the horrid machine came back more slowly than it had gone out gearbox no doubt at the controls and paying closer attention attempting to track him aker hoped hed done his job well enough and when the snowmobiles whine grew faint he allowed himself to relax and plan his next move walt was reeling with regret when he turned crabtree over to booking the kid was eighteen now walt could no longer protect his record he ate a muffin to settle his stomach but the lukewarm coffee chaser only added to his discomfort among his many phone messages were several he found impossible to ignore a pair from congressman mcmillian inquiring about walts participation in the national law enforcement conference and another from james peavy he couldnt ignore them he was an elected official he needed both the support of his party and his party leadership especially given that it was an election year mcmillian first nancy asked him lets hold off on that any word from the people out at the inl the possibility of radioactive water had led walt to the obvious call the idaho nuclear laboratory a facility covering nine hundred square miles in the center of the state and containing over thirty active or retired reactors ive called a couple different people out there theyve all refused appointments they were polite enough about it but i get the feeling its not going to happen okay one more time get me the director out there now now walt stood there while nancy made the call she was put on hold several times before she eventually thanked someone and hung up unavailable hell return the call when hes free walt considered the situation the smart move would have been for them to take the meetings and calls and issue a string of denials by refusing him it implied they needed time to coordinate their denials and that seemed to him the most advantageous time to strike get hold of fiona find out if shes available for me later today it may involve night photography so tell her to bring the appropriate gear and tell her to dress warmly should i contact the butte county sheriff and let him know youre coming no call over to sun valley aviation and see if you can get me a time for a tow nancy looked up at him quizzically the glider walt smiled for the first time all day walt and the pilot of the towplane coordinated the release of the glider as the cessna banked slowly to the right diving below and away walt piloted the glider higher and slightly left its noisier than id imagined fiona said from behind him are you okay fine she said i told you i have no problem with small planes walt had flown gliders since his early twenties his interest born out of an envy of eagles and hawks and a budget that couldnt afford renting singleengine airtime the glider suddenly caught an updraft off the base of the hills and gained a hundred feet in a matter of seconds leaving both their stomachs somewhere up on the plexiglas cockpit cover still okay walt asked im getting used to it he saw the towplane now it had come fully around on a line with the arco airstrip about twenty miles ahead as arranged rather than returning to hailey it would wait in arco for them are we high enough fiona shouted to be heard over the roar created by wind over the wings there was no motor just the rush of the glider slicing through the sky im working on it walt worked the glider into a wide spiral climbing into an azure sky carried aloft by thermals generated by the mountain landmass below killer view walt thought to their right the vast central plain of idaho stretched out like a lake of desert sand interrupted occasionally by volcanic cones dormant some ten thousand years so random were these buttes they appeared artificially placed they saw bunkerlike buildings surrounded by tangles of pipes and aprons of parking lot so secret was the work done here so important to national security that the entire area was grayed out on internetaccessed satellite maps not even the topography was properly mappedand it was the terrain and topography that most interested walt rivers and streams flowed out of the mountains roughly west to east for walts theory of contamination to hold up there had to be underground water flowing northwest from the inl hed made a quick study of the massive northern rocky mountain aquifer that stretched from canada all the way to mexico but it too flowed predominantly south and slightly east he wanted a birdseye view to validate or invalidate his theory but the inl airspace was restricted and those restrictions strenuously enforced his decision was to stray over the airspace what he would call a regrettable but unavoidable piloting error he counted on the evening thermals to hold the glider aloft long enough for him to maneuver into position pursuing more altitude he continued the elegant halfmilewide spiral ascent at eleven thousand feet above sea levelsix thousand abovegroundwalt kept the glider shy of an altitude requiring supplemental oxygen everything ready yes good to go i have no idea what theyll do when we enter their airspace but i dont see them shooting us down or anything well thats reassuring get everything you can everything we discussed will do and if we are forced down whatever you do dont surrender your equipment under no circumstances will you take that camera off your neck they will claim all sorts of rights but i think theyll stop short of actually physically removing the camera and if they think otherwise well move it up a level to the attorneys and if the attorneys fail walt said nothing walt she said trying for an answer then it hit her oh goddamn you you wouldnt stoop to something you wouldnt use me like that like what you were the one who told me rogers company semper group is under contract with the government to manage nukes among other things the inl is a semper contract isnt it it is but did you honestly think id call roger for you if you get busted in here is that why you asked me along im your safety valve how selfserving is that it never occurred to me i just need photographs but you didnt need me to take them of course i did youre banking on my relationship with roger to get you out of trouble its despicable youre overreacting he directed the glider toward the alluvial plain the sun bloodred as it edged ever closer to the western horizon i thought youd like it up here a difficult silence followed it was too loud for him to hear her preparing her equipment she said it just so happens that i do walt smiled to himself eased the joystick forward and the glider quickly picked up speed as it dove racing now into the restricted airspace roy coats brought the maul down onehanded splitting the log in a single stroke and sending a shudder of pain through his wounds standing a few feet off to the side gearbox eyed the sharpened edge of the maul as it caught the mottled sunlight i have to meet with her coats spoke cautiously through a clenched jaw any movement of his facial muscles sent white pain down his neck and into the scissor wound in his armpit his unmoving lips resulted in a menacing tone she makes the drop and we dont give a shit about this guy let him freeze out there but i cant count on her making the drop so im not leaving here until i know we have a backup in place that means youve got to find him coats wound up the maul and split another log again in a single stroke as if we havent been trying find him coats repeated he took off his glove and gingerly touched where the stove had branded his cheek there was yellow pus on the tip of his finger he wiped it off on his jeans the burn needed medical attention a primary reason he wanted the vet recaptured hes on foot in a fresh snowfall were on snowmobiles are you fucking kidding me but with the dogs gearbox said we dont slow down waiting for them but bill said fuck billy if the dogs get here they get here but every minute hes out there hes farther away and you know whats worse its worse if he dies out there until i say otherwise we need him im open to suggestions gearbox said he cowered as coats turned slowly the maul swung like a pendulum at his side weve been up and down that track a dozen times gearbox complained the game trails too without the dogs we got nothing fuck the dogs an idea hit him okay coats said his anger briefly subsiding you remember that time we lost the cat over in eastern oregon sure gearbox said nodding were going to do it like that a pattern search all weve gotta do is cross his tracks at some point he cant be far okay gearbox said he didnt sound convinced ive got to keep that meeting with her are you listening if she delivers that drum like i asked within a week theres not one person on this planet wont have heard of the samakinn theyve got what ten thousand of those drums stored out there twenty all containing lowlevel waste coats said making finger quotes in the air you think theyre going to miss one itll be the first time its ever been done shit that kind of thing doesnt make news it makes history he couldnt stop the grin from finding its way onto his face but this time the accompanying agony was well worth it mark akers best chance to outrun his pursuers was to find a river someplace he wouldnt leave behind tracks or a scent to follow he used the trees effectively dodging under the umbrella of green branches that reduced the accumulated snowfall to a dusting he would cut across the base of a tree dragging a sprig behind him and erasing his tracks as he went when the trees were positioned closely enough together he could make it fifty yards or more without tracks to follow but eventually he was faced with deep snow again forcing him to reveal his route in summertime he would have been nearly impossible to follow he wouldnt have been battling the elements and he would have had an abundant source of water and food as it was he was sweating cold hungry and thirsty and still trying to hold off using any of what hed stolen from the cabin for as long as humanly possible then came the sound hed been outrunning all day the distant whine of the snowmobile it wasnt that they were close it was their determination that ate away at his confidence what he saw next intrigued him a low inverted semicircle amid a rock escarpment fifty yards to his right the formation began low and grew into a collar that wrapped around a small hill seeing the rocks rise out of the snow and that small semicircle of dark in particular gave him another idea if he could reach the windblown rocks hed leave no trail to follow he spent fifteen minutes creating a fake route south to the edge of a copse of trees before carefully backtracking and returning to where hed started then he worked his way below a cornice where the snow was only an inch or two deep again dragging an evergreen limb behind him and brushing his tracks away the effect was outstanding there was no way to tell hed headed toward the rocks he climbed through the escarpment the farther he made it the more confident he was that hed created an effective diversion he approached the dark inverted curve just above the surface of the snow cautiously the vet in him having identified the cave from a distance he crept quietly to the opening stuck his nose to the hole and sniffed the air excited by the dank sour smell he searched the backpack for the concoction coats had used to subdue him and liberally charged the syringe with the syringe in his left hand he shined the flashlight through the hole daring to stick his head inside he trained the light from side to side working progressively deeper into the narrow hole picking up the sharp lines in the frozen mud immediately knowing hed guessed correctly what he was about to attempt was suicidaland few knew that better than a vetbut his choice had been made and he wasnt going to turn away from it he carefully dug into the snow blocking the hole removing as little as possible not wanting to draw attention to the hole or the small cave it now revealed he pushed the pack through and followed twisting and moving his body to delicately slip between the gap hed widened the stench increased exponentially he was on his knees now his head tucked down the space was small the air thick enough to gag him a combination of rancid bacon grease and scat still holding the syringe he put his left hand over the flashlights lens to soften its beam he ran the diffused light across the caves wall holding to where the mud floor rose to meet it even after two decades of working with animals of every kind his heart fluttered as he discerned the bears coarse brown hair it was a big black perhaps six hundred pounds curled into an enormous mound of slowly rising and falling fur its head was tucked beneath its front paws like earmuffs the paws themselves were the size of a kids baseball mitt ending in mudcaked curled black threeinch claws hibernation was not unconsciousness a bears heart rate drops from fifty to ten beats a minute during hibernation yet the animal retains its senses and can awakenthough slowlyif threatened by now the bear had smelled him was aware of the intruder aker had from two to eight minutes no more than ten before the bear would rise to defend his den hed misjudged the dose significantly not figuring on such a large animal he scrambled with the pack to fill the syringe with an additional ccs emptying the vial all or nothing the bears paws slipped off his head and his sad eyes popped open awake but barely conscious still the ferocity in those eyes terrified even someone as comfortable around animals as aker the scratch marks in the frozen mud and on the rock were warning enough he had to squat and finally lie down in the caves tight confines in order to reach the animal one of the bears legs twitched its eyes blinked open wider it was late fall the animal wasnt yet fully settled into the metabolism that would carry him through the long winter he was coming awake far more quickly than aker had anticipated a giant paw lunged out though awkwardly and with dull reflexes aker tucked into a ball rolled and plunged the needle deep into the thick fur coat he depressed the plunger emptying the syringe he left it stuck in the animal rolling away toward the mouth of the small cave the bear blinked behind heavy eyelids its front leg twitched the massive paw clawing the air where aker had just lain several long minutes passed aker not knowing if his plan had worked the bear blinked once again before his eyes eased closed a hibernating bear maintains a body temperature of over eighty degrees fahrenheit aker rolled and he pushed his back up against the mass of the sleeping animal within a matter of seconds his back began to warm then his legs soon his whole body responded shaking at first then steadying as the cold was gradually overcome the drugs would keep the bear out for several hours in a state of hibernation despite its enormous body mass it might remain unconscious for a day or more for the first time since his escape aker felt almost safe he doubted the cave would be discovered by coats or gearbox the chance to rest would strengthen him though the cave was foulsmelling hed found both shelter and a heat source he could remain here for at least four hours possibly longer at first he fought off sleep focusing his attention instead on the mouth of the cave and listening for the sound of the snowmobile encouraged as he was he knew his survival ultimately relied upon walt flemings efforts to find him if some form of help didnt arrive soon aker would be forced back into the elements back into the hunt where the odds were against him a flight of migrating sandhill cranes approached off the gliders right side a ballet of slowly beating wings and outstretched necks easily mistaken for geese or swans from a distance but seen closer they were too elegant for the former and too large for the latter they moved as a black arrow an undulating wave like a single organism against a backdrop of a onceroyalblue sky now flaming out in resignation to a setting sun walt pointed out the formation to his passenger appreciating her hand then tapping him on the shoulder in acknowledgment secretly enjoying the brief contact she seemed to understand this was not a moment to raise ones voice above the roar of the wings he liked her all the more for it the v drew nearer as if drawn by curiosity or mistaking the glider for one of their own the cranes flew close enough that walt could briefly make out not only the delicacy of their individual feathers rustled by the steady wind of their efforts but the beady stares of their unflinching eyes they passed and like a curtain opening revealed not the expanse of the desert below simmering in the blush of dusk but the menacing insectlike form of a military helicopter obscured until that moment startled by the sight fiona jumped in her seat bumping her head against the plexiglas canopy it was a jetassisted chopperwhat walt thought of as a gunner shipcapable of both tremendous speed and aerial agility both men in the cockpit looked like insects as well as the copilot pointed to the bulbous black headphones mounted over his air force helmet walt had purposely changed radio frequencies to avoid being contacted by air traffic control and ordered out of the restricted airspace prior to fiona taking the pictures he had forced their hand necessitating the scrambling of an intercept but he acknowledged the request with a gesture and quickly reset his radio he checked in with atc announced himself and was told to immediately switch to yet another frequency where he could communicate directly with the helicopter pilot the anticipated warning was issued with authority walt had violated federal airspace he would land the glider at the arcobutte county airport a tiny strip where the towplane now waited he could expect to be boarded and detained the standard boarded line brought a grin to his face the gliders cockpit barely fit its two passengers no one would be boarding his aircraft but the mention of detention was more significant he planned to withhold his trump cardhis status as law enforcementuntil reaching the ground but the carefully worded caution implied the government would exercise its right to search theyre going to look at your equipment walt shouted back to fiona if they find weve been spying instead of joyriding well be in some serious trouble i dont want that for either of us youd better erase anything of the inl site keep the landscapes we need to justify the gear how long do we have theyre escorting us i need to land right away but how long five ten minutes ill need to come around for the wind theyre not going to shoot us out of the sky or anything why can you make it more like ten how long does it take to erase some photographs i would have thought she interrupted walt i got some terrific shots of that construction site id hate to lose them ten minutes earlier theyd flown over an area of excavation busy with large earthmoving machinery the hole being dug alongside one of the bunkerlike buildings the area was a beehive of activity especially given the late hour past seven pm the overtime work suggested an intriguing urgency hed circled the excavation possibly putting him onto radar fiona had run off dozens of shots including some of the pahsimeroi valley to the northwest walt wanted time to study the shots but not at the expense of arrest not worth it theyre stored on an sd chip the things the size of a fingernail you really think theyre going to search us that thoroughly i could put it in my bra or something they are not going to stripsearch us when walt failed to respond she added are they this is the us military who knows what theyll do but if they find that chip especially hidden on you we would be in the deep stuff these people dont mess around she was quiet for a moment as she considered their options what if i encrypted them i can passwordprotect the camera childs play for them besides the more we look like were trying to hide something the more heat were going to draw we dont need that erase them ill buy you the ten minutes and if i can save them im telling you its just not worth the risk theyll find them not if i email them before i erase them my phones a pda walt it takes the same sd chip as the camera you buy me enough time and i can switch out chips and email at least a couple of the shots theyll be in cyberspace by the time we land keep your eye out for a cell tower if you see one try to stay close i can do this for the next ten minutes walt juggled stalling the air patrols increasingly heated demands he land the glider with fionas runon narration of her progress she switched out the chips and had started emailing out the photographs but the transmission speed of the photographsall largegraphic fileswas incredibly slow over her mobile phone walt landed the glider a little harda little out of practicecausing fiona to yelp from behind him he rode the momentum off the strips lone runway and onto the first of three ramps the helicopter set down just ahead of them so close that the wind from the blades pushed the glider around like a toy driving it back several feet and nearly damaging the tail the chopper pilot killed the engine and as the blades slowed two white suvs with federal decals on their doors sped out to meet them where are we walt called back to fiona i need more time she called out anxiously forget it just erase them the chips out of the camera theres nothing to erase but i cant erase them off the phone until theyre done sending and its taking forever a uniformed officer pounded on the plexiglas pocket the phone walt instructed her as he bent down low to make it appear he was busy shutting down the glider open up the officer hollered theyll focus on the camera not the phone walt said softly enough that the officer wouldnt hear him through the cockpit dome they will when they see theres no chip in it she countered wait ive got a spare okay okay buy me thirty seconds she then bent over to where in the tight space her back screened her hands and the camera from view the officer pounded again ten seconds she pleaded walt slid open the small triangular air vent on the side of the dome and moved his lips closer shes feeling a little airsick my passenger needs a moment open this aircraft or im instructed to break it open for you just let her get her sea legs would you walt pleaded im okay she announced sitting up and waving at the officer she leaned forward her chin on walts shoulder and whispered hotly the phone is still sending purse he said covering his lips as if itching his nose walt unlocked the cockpit releases and the officer instructed them to climb out of the plane if caught walt thought his badge would bail them out but seeing how serious these guys were he wondered if hed dragged fiona into something he would soon wish he hadnt she busied herself collecting her gear please dont touch anything maam well get your belongings for you you most certainly will not fiona protested he was the one flying the thing it was his idea for a sunset sightseeing date why i agreed i have no idea some date i felt nauseated enough and then you people came along who are you people you were flying in restricted airspace the officer said matteroffactly he pointed to her headphones did you hear our communication with the pilot all he told me she said distraughtly still clinging to her purse and camera bag was that we were being forced down and the funny thing is i probably should be thanking you i think you just saved me the trip back to sun valley put the bags down please maam leave them there its my camera she protested well want a look at that he said walt do something youre the sheriff the officer whipped around his head to take in walt who then introduced himself blaine county sheriff walt added proffering his id wallet the officer examined the wallet his eyes flashing between his two subjects are you over here on business sheriff the officer asked no just an evening flight trying to impress a woman you really go all out fiona said what do you do for the second date even the officer cracked a smile he wiped it off quickly were going to want to talk to you he informed walt both of you he said then looked at fiona if it all checks out im sure youve got nothing to worry about fiona cracked open her purse may i make a call she said reaching the phone before the officer could move to stop her its all to remain in place he said holding out an open palm fiona shot a sideways glance at walt she turned the face of the mobile device so that walt could see it his view of the colorful menu led him to believe the photographs had completed sending cant i call someone to come get me she asked the officer walt understood then the photographs had sent but she hadnt had time to erase them off the chip the evidence remained in her hand apparently not walt answered and i think they want your phone as she handed it to the officer she managed one more look in walts directiona serious look one of deep concern he took this as confirmation of his suspicions the photographs were still on the phones memory chip maybe theyll let you call once we get to wherever theyre taking us walt suggested the officer didnt contradict him who said theyre taking us anywhere fiona complained all he said is they want to talk to us people like this walt said people like me we always take you somewhere when we want to talk to you looking at walt fiercely she said tell me this was all cooked up to impress me tell me this is your screwedup attempt at a joke she then looked at the officer as if he might confess to the conspiracy the officer said afraid not as far as dates go fiona said to walt settling into her role a little too easily he thought this one really sucks the gliders radios are fully functioning did you know that walts interviewer a man who introduced himself as russell amish was an unshapely man in his midforties who spoke his vowels in a nasal tone and carried a liverish blemish on the side of his neck like an abscessed high school hickey a man who had once been physically strong hed gone soft like fruit left in the bowl too long his black eyes revealed a contempt for walts badge walt had met other wannabes private security employees who feigned authority wishing their threats meant something this guy wanted to play the fed when in fact he was merely contracted to semper which in turn was contracted to the government he wasnt powerlessfar from itbut walts position trumped his and both men knew it he and fiona had been separated immediately put into separate cars and driven out to a nondescript onestory cinderblock building that carried an american flag out front it was part of a small cluster of buildings surrounded by a vast expanse of desert other buildings looked like parking garages they might have been entrances to underground tunnels or storage facilities or served any number of other purposes nuclear testing was a world walt knew nothing about i believe we call that pilot error walt said taking a look around the briefing room acoustical ceiling video surveillance in two corners a vinyltopped table that held a cassette recorder i dont know much about gliders sheriff except that while theyre dependent on wind and air currents to maintain altitude the wind does not determine direction of flight we were blown off course walt said at right about ten thousand feet we were caught up in winds out of the north that drove us into your airspace you must have had me on radar check my flight pattern i was beating upwind ever since trying to work my way back to the highway he paused searching the mans eyes to see if hed checked the radar when you fly a sailplane mr amish you like having a strip of pavement in sight despite the beautiful view your restricted airspace offers ill take the safety net of a flat stretch of pavement under me any day you were or were not on official business was not im out of uniform mr amish im coming out of a marriage which im sure youre able to confirm and he said lowering his voice i was trying to get into something new if you catch my meaning i was going for the wow factor top gun meets national geographic if i hadnt made her sick if you guys hadnt interfered i might have had a chance i doubt it said amish not your chances but the story he shifted some papers guys like him did that just as a matter of habit youre a long way from home mr fleming not so far as the crow flies your towplane pilot reports you requested a release over craters of the moon you strayed quite far from that release point have you ever seen the park from the air the huge flows of lava like somebody spilled black ink and it froze in place you want to impress a woman mr amish show her craters at sunset land in arco buy her a steak at the melodee and have the towplane waiting to fly you home knocks their socks off and if youre lucky other pieces of clothing as well amish fought back a grin for a moment walt allowed himself to believe he was regaining some credibility but it was a grin of satisfaction as it turned out not one of agreement ms kenshaw is your departments contracted photographer sheriff she boarded your romantic escapade with two camera bodies five lenses a light meter and a variety of filters and oh infrared capability you flew into our airspace and stayed off com for twentyseven minutes before being forced down by the air national guard the only photographs on her camera are of what appears to be an assaulta young woman badly beaten and some colorful clothing a prom a wedding theyre dated less than a week ago so what youre telling me is you brought her up on this date to photograph the sunset and she got what so caught up in your smooth talking that she forgot to shoot any photographs youd have to ask her we are walt wondered if she could possibly hold up under the scrutiny and realized he should have created a story for them both to stick to amish likely knew of his attempts to reach the director by phone even so proof was proof no matter what amish believed he could not prove intent the gliders not much different than a parasail youve never had parasailers over your airspace wed rather work with you than against you amish said were all on the same side here ill take that to mean you dont want me calling the vice president about it walt said im aware of your relationship with vice president shaler im aware of your service record youre something of a hero sheriff i get that doesnt make my job any easier youre retired military walt said thats a burn wound on your neckchemical maybe desert storm im guessing there were compounds used in that war that few of us ever heard about werent there you dont strike me as military intelligence mr amish you have field experience im pretty sure marines maybe there was a flicker in the mans eyes that was his tell an eversoslight lifting of the eyelids that walt guessed hed worked hard to control your boss worked under george the first when he headed up langley your bosss boss im talking about roger hillabrand he was a marine wasnt he a big player in desert storm hired his men to work for him once he entered the private sector and formed the semper group so youre long on loyalty short on questions we can spend three or four hours in here and all im going to do is lose my chance at ms kenshaw these are tricky waters because your bosss boss has a personal relationship with ms kenshawand if he had anything to do with our grounding if any phone calls were exchanged this is going to look personal mixing business with pleasure using his power to derail any attempt at a date i thought i could take off the uniform fly her up over craters and make a good impression maybe score a few points but maybe hillabrand thought different this could be embarrassing you called in the air national guard mr amish over a woman why dont you release us and let me try to salvage what i can of an evening gone horribly wrong and well both forget all about this your glider will be impounded until further notice our people will take it apartpiece by piece if we have toin order to determine there were no cameras hidden in it i can only assume you think youre doing good sheriff but we both know that dogooders typically do more harm than good i was out on a date i was trying for some romance you want to arrest me for that guilty as charged amishs eyelids flared again his jaw clenched as he fought to keep his mouth shut but walt egged him on with a shiteating grin intended to make the man feel as small as possible interrogations could go both directions this facility is under constant surveillance amish said proudly we are watchedhe pointed to the two cameras in the room recorded scrutinized and investigated we are held accountable to six different federal departments we report to the nrc the nuclear regulatory commission i know its easy to see a place like the inl as a conspiracy in progress given the materials we work with and the secretive nature of the research conducted here onsite protests and demonstrations remind us of this on a regular basis we offer up a fine target for the greens but this lab lit the first city in the world with atomicpowered light the nuclear submarine engine was developed and tested at this facility critical situations like three mile island were successfully resolved because we had a working facility in which to simulate repairs this place matters and if you work here you cant pick your nose without a senate subcommittee hearing about it we are not a rogue facility no matter what people like sheriff walt fleming think there is nothing here thats going to help you with this murder investigation of yours he answered walts expression read the pages sheriff walt wanted to take a swing at the guy more out of frustration than anger but it wasnt going to happen amishs confidence was disconcerting there was a knock on the door followed by the arrival of a man who leaned into amishs ear amish said youll go home tonight but were not done here well report this violation to some of those six departments and im sure youll be hearing from more than one of them this was a stupid stunt to pull sheriff youve fooled no one if he was being sent home tonight then they hadnt found the photographs he waited another hour to be released and around nine pm was led outside to a vehicle that drove him and fiona back to the arco airport where the towplane waited they didnt speak while in the car and under escort after having been dropped off the shuttle vehicle then leaving the airstrip walt turned to her so her lips pursed she tugged the strap of her camera bag higher onto her shoulder i made the call you know emailing the photos you mean yeah that was incredibly fast think the other call she said how do you think we got off so easily hillabrand she nodded spitefully but they didnt have us on anything walt protested why drag hillabrand into this if they were going to release us anyway let me get this right youre mad at me for getting us out of there im not mad at you but they had no evidence they had us locked up in interrogation rooms they had my phone my phone not yours all the photographs were on my phone besides dont give me that its why you brought me along right we established that earlier its not why walt countered i hadnt even thought about hillabrand until you brought him up thats not true she said it is i asked you along because i needed photographs shot if we hadnt been forced down id have gone in there on foot tonight to that construction work but listen i never once considered using your relationship with hillabrand to my advantageour advantage your mention of it actually amused me fiona you dont know me very well if youd think id do such a thing there is no relationship with roger just fyi id say that pretty much just came to an end tonight i felt like a teenager calling daddy who knows what he thought ten minutes later we were released you can thank me later she hurried off toward the towplane where the pilot was standing by walt packed in with her behind the pilot and they sat pressed shoulder to shoulder for the short thirtyminute flight she never said a word to him he tried twice to break the silence but failed at the fbo in sun valley she marched to her parked subaru climbed in and drove off without looking back walt arrived home depressed and wondering if the inl would take legal action hillabrand being dragged into it complicated matters he parked the cherokee out front as he almost always did despite a garage around back he liked the police cruiser being seen sitting in front of the house he hurried up to the front porch concernedbut not overly soby the front porch light being off and the rest of the house being so dark he always encouraged lisa to keep several lights on he managed to key open the door in the dark and flip on the lights lisa he hissed softly the couch was empty he usually found her dozing there at this hour shed probably fallen asleep next to one of the twins while reading a bedtime story lisa he repeated more loudly his chest tightened he hurried through the house carefully opening emilys bedroom door first empty then nikkis empty he checked the face of his cell phone eleven messages he had assumed them all to be work related consumed with the events of the evening hed planned to answer them once he got home he tried the master bedroom dark and empty he had the phone to his ear now the first of the messages replaying with no way to skip messages he was forced to endure the mundane while anticipating the worst finally he heard lisas voice bordering on hysterical walt it was gail she was i dont know ive never seen her like that she said you two had an agreement about no women i thought she meant me i tried to reason but she just stormed right past me saying how she was the mother the girls are fine she has them please call me i didnt know what to do walt i didnt know what to do he threw the phone it skipped off the diningroom table and hit the window and broke the glass walt hurried to the door he knew exactly what to do get his children back he caught himself on the threshold reconsidering the girls had had enough for one night gail wouldnt have taken them to brandon sthat was indeed the agreement he stepped back inside slammed the front door shut and locked it switched off the light so he didnt have to see how empty it was without them he heard the sounds of his own labored breathing he extracted a single truth from the depths of his depression theyd crossed a barrier arriving at a finality to the truce that had been maintained for far too long the hailey library had been a supermarket in its former life walt came here often enough with the twins but he still couldnt shake the memory he expected to smell fresh coffee and doughnuts instead he passed the front desk and a table displaying new arrivals there was an end cap on the nearest stack devoted entirely to hemingway walt wished the fame and lore of hemingway could have been attributed to the work of the great writer when hed lived in the valley but instead most of the fame of the place came from the fact hed died here being known as a place where a famous writer ate the wrong end of a shotgun was nothing but trouble for the county sheriff others had come here for like purpose not so great to be the trendy suicide locale hed never paid any attention to the librarys conference room it held an oval table that sat ten with just enough room behind each chair to slip past there was a pulldown whiteboard at the end of the room carrying notes written in pink marker that appeared to have something to do with a book sale fundraiser he didnt appreciate being made to wait but danny cutter had sounded frantic on the phone and walt made it a point to tread lightly with the billionaires and their families and so he waited five minutes melted into ten finally the door opened danny cutter had that tanned outdoorsy thing working for him he wore blue jeans a pressed white shirt and an orvis outdoor coat black fabric with a brown leather collar and trim sorry i made you wait he said shaking hands with walt only after hed locked the conferenceroom door and twisted the blinds closed i thought if someone followed me they wouldnt see you entering after me and that just felt better someones following you cutter shook his head with a look of disgust who knows sit walt said cutter took the chair next to walt and spoke quietly you know about the charges at the hotel the violation of my parole chuck webb said you knew about it said it could have been worsemuch worseand that i had you to thank for that wouldnt know what hes talking about walt said stonefaced someone called it in to the sun valley police said i was drunk or stoned or both so i ended up under suspicion and they required a blood test because of the parole and i had coke in my systemcoke i have no memory of doing i might add and that puts me in violation chuck told me most of this walt allowed i didnt know the blood workup was back none of this matters to you i know but the blowback that followed is what counts what kind of blowback walt asked he was feeling edgy all of a sudden like the room was too small cutter glanced nervously toward the locked door he lowered his voice forcing walt to concentrate on his every word i shouldnt tell you this i know that you of all people damned if i do damned if i dont but the thing is they warned me if i violate the nda i signed im shit up the creek the way my probation reads youre supposed to be informed of any possible violations so im taking a big chance sheriff thats my point a very big chance slow down please you signed a nondisclosure agreement ive been bought off fifty thousand dollars plus all legitimate expenses arising from the contamination i was told that if i accepted the money the parole violation would eventually be dropped that trinity could return to production in as little as two weeks and that id be reimbursed for lost inventory and gross revenue for the period in question all i do is show them our books for the past three months and theyll average my revenue stream walt couldnt help but remember the stench of the burning sheep and peavys reminder of the loss of money that any mass grave would mean for the rancher who offered you this no idea a call to my cell phone a private number i tried to trace it i even called my brotherhe owns the cell company after all dead end a hoax walt proposed the next day five grand was in my checking accountmy personal checking account not my company account i checked with the bank the deposit was cash made through an atm totally untraceable he glanced back at the door again second phone call said the five grand was just to prove the offer was for real the terms what did they want from you theyll provide a script for me im to stick to the script and the cdc dr bezels report will apparently support whatever it is im supposed to say walt attempted to process all that hed been told who could control the cdc like that why me danny why you he blurted out laughing and grimacing at the same time im already in violation of my parolethis coke thingwhich incidentally was a total frame job im not saying i expect you to believe that but the way it happened i believe it walt said interrupting tell me about the payoff ive told you everything two calls sign the nda the five grand up front it all goes away who can promise such a thing walt blurted out my thoughts exactly what did you tell them i signed are you kidding me you know the hit im going to take my inventory destroyed my line shut down im not insured for this kind of thing who is i was sunk i mean totally screwed and then this phone call fifty k on top of costs and they made it clear that if business is off for a while because of this theyll take care of me but why tell me walt repeated ive got to be breaking a dozen laws right i had a chance to think about it and i came to you as sweet as this deal is if it means another twenty months in prison ill pass thank you very much its nothing my office would have anything to do with beyond the parole violation but thats the point its a clear violation of my parole right doing anything like this enlisting in a coverup yeah that would be federal time but its apparent that whoever is making the offer has a long reach it could be genuine and how do i say this he paused you arent the only one to receive such an offer they came after you me no now it was walt glancing toward the door he stood and peeked out the blinds no one with his back to cutter he said whats important to focus on here danny is that whoever is making the offer is the same person or persons who set you up for the coke i know that and this just escalates things doesnt it i mean after this theyll have you on accepting a bribe avoiding a cdc investigationany number of charges if they want thats why im here sheriff did they frame me on the coke thing just to make sure id take this offer or am i being set up now to take a bigger fall someones coming after me and im screwed either way i dont have the answers id rather go bankrupt than return to that damn facility but you agreed to take the money yeah but its only the five grand so far and ive come to you to cut a deal buyers remorse i dont care about the money ive told you everything honestly i have i will keep the money in escrow not spend a cent of it ill wear a wire allow you to tap my phones whatever you want i do not want to get on the wrong side of this now i understand ive already done that he added quickly but this is my attempt to fix it if these people can deliver then im no use to you walt admitted theyve got to be government dont they i mean who can make such promises or big business walt said speaking what he was thinking never a good call cutter leaned back in his chair you know who it is he said unable to conceal his surprise i dont you have an idea i imagine you do too walt said but i dont government as ive said a private firm no matter how big cant guarantee legal charges dropped who in the government cares about my company staying in business this guy promised my probation violation would be expunged the nda gave no hint of who was behind it i dont have any idea honestly i think were done here danny for both our sakes done im not done i appreciate the information as to the offer theres nothing i can do without warrants and if i seek a warrant and it gets back to whoever is making you this offer thats not good for anyone he thought a moment working the corners id like to hear from you if they make contact if you go the informer route its done through the us attorneys office i could help with that but if we go to the wrong guy my guess is the offer will be pulled and youll be back in a federal facility the coke charge was about discrediting you danny theyve laid the necessary groundwork so that whatever you say in public can be quickly written off as a desperate man making cheap allegations its been very carefully thought out yeah cutter said sarcastically lets admire their work i didnt mean it like that since when is the government that smart walt cracked a smile he stood up from the chair and said good luck danny i came to you in good faith sheriff you cant just walk ive got problems of my own danny i have no choice but to walk you waited too long i needed to be brought in before you signed the nda and agreed to take the money cutter looked devastated walt scribbled out a name andy hamiltons in the us attorneys office in seattle andy cant be bought he passed the name to cutter use my name thanks sheriff tread lightly danny and dont speak a word of this to dr bezel i dont see how but she may be part of this cutter looked as if walt had hit him do we even know if shes actually with the cdc walt asked i never checked her credentials sweet jesus trust no one danny walt said his voice continued inside his head not even me may be im not explaining it right john borton was a big bearish man with red hair wide eyes and an unexpectedly kind and soft ministers voice hed started out as water master for the water district inspecting headgates on irrigation canals reporting violations and locking flows at levels where they belonged then hed served as an inspector for the states adjudication processthe redistribution of stream and river water to private landownersthat had taken five years and nearly cost a few lives now he was the water master for the central district and as such ruled like a feudal lord over milliondollar ranches and their centuryold legal rights to tap into and drain both the surface waters as well as the underground aquifer that flowed for thousands of miles from british columbia to mexico his office was small even by government standards the water district was housed in a building that also leased space to the nature conservancy walt and borton were leaning on a worktable that held fionas aerial photographs a satellite image of central idaho and a topographical map of a fiftysquaremile region surrounding craters of the moon and reaching to the pahsimeroi valley think of it as an eddy borton said just like in open water but in this case it happens to be underground youve got this tremendous flow of water sometimes thousands of feet below the surface moving like a river north to south huge volume it pushes up quite close to the surface for much of the route but we know it always seeks the path of least resistance as well as the lowest spot it can find this range he said indicating a spur of mountains that pushed toward the alluvial plain and the desert that housed the idaho nuclear laboratory acts as a barrier just like a levee or breakwater but you said the flow of the water is north to south walt reminded and the elevation of the pahsimeroi is higher than the desert my interest is whether water could get from here he said indicating the desert to here he pointed to the center of the pahsimeroi valley and logically thats impossible how can water run uphill borton dragged the satellite image closer but some rivers flow to the north in the northern hemisphere dont they and so do some aquifers in this case its the result of a subterranean fault and a promontory he pointed out a mountain spine on the satellite image this looks like a weather map but these gray swirls are actually the underground waterpart of the northern rocky mountain intermontane basins systemthat exists thousands of feet below the surface and is one small part of a freshwater source that stretches from canada all the way to mexico the big lost river disappears completely under the desert here and doesnt resurface for hundreds of miles but the force of that downward pressure has the same effect as a narrowing river increased speed that pushes a great quantity of water west and around this underground promontory the flow is further restricted by faults on both sides and with nowhere to go it flows north for nearly seventy miles until most of it is absorbed into the more porous strata of the upper pahsimeroi for security reasons the satellite image had grayed out the surface topography of an area that included the inl but walt pulled fionas photograph alongside the image and visually compared the two the long feathered flow that was the rogue branch of the aquifer curled and turned directly beneath the area where he and fiona had spotted the afterhours earthmoving equipment for a moment he just stared this help any borton asked made uncomfortable by the long silence walt looked up at the man then back to the various pictures does the water in the aquifer ever reach the surface of the pahsimeroi valley s floor is it part of the groundwater thats a much bigger question borton said running his stubby finger across the satellite image because theres a constant surface flow north to southall the winter melt slowly finding its way down through sediment and into the valleys but that water can prove itself seasonal and intermittent as we know and the reason this gets more complicated is that some of the ranchers have drilled very deep wells those deeper wells eight hundred to as much as ten thousand feet are directly tapping into the aquifer not the surface water it presents a particularly difficult issue for us do we know the locations of those deeper wells walt asked we would have a list of at least some of them in the state because theyve been the subject of adjudication not once had borton asked what any of this was about though walt sensed his curiosity how hard would it be for me to get hold of that list walt asked its a public record borton returned quickly having anticipated the request i dont have those documents here but the state water board should have copies that helps i do happen to have computer access borton said with a twinkle in his eye and a printer but any data that proved useful to you would have to eventually be sourced elsewhere it didnt come from me walt understood borton glanced around the quiet office wait right here he said when walts attempts to reach gail failed he resisted using the power of his office to find her knowing any such personal use would be held against him instead he sought out his divorce attorney jan wygle in an attempt to get his daughters returned as he sat in the officers reception an npr report out of boise caught his attention today the state senates environmental impact committee will hear public comments on the semper groups management of the idaho nuclear laboratory conditions of sempers contract with the federal and state governments require semiannual review of health and safety issues in the workplace semper took over management of the nuclear facility from the troubled general industries two years ago and was instrumental in the fiftysquaremile facilitys third name change in just six years more now from our capitol correspondent lisa laird the reporter continued the story reminding listeners of the controversial shipments of overseas nuclear waste to the inl said to be for temporary storage much of the japanese and korean lowlevel waste had been held in drums above ground in central idaho for nearly a decade semper was said to be in negotiations to extend the program by accepting russian lowlevel waste walts ears pricked up when hillabrands name was mentioned he was to be the committees chief witness testifying at three pm a public forum he faced a twohour drive or a thirtyminute flight his first phone call was not to nancy nor to barge levy who he hoped might fly him over to boise now that his own pilots license had been suspended it was instead to danny cutter his request caused cutter to invoke a moments silence on the other end you want what cutter had asked you heard me right walt answered i dont know if thats possible find a way walt told the man both our futures may depend upon it walt arrived at the statehouse in boise wearing a crisp heavily starched uniform his shoes and belt polished to gleaming his hardware sparkling it was threetwenty by the time he slipped through the door of the hearing room where a dais held five state senators four men and a woman the rooms interior was a magnificent throwback to the grand statehouses of the nineteenth century aged mahogany and walnut panels a marble floor and brass chandeliers roger hillabrand sat at a long table front and center with his back to the main doors the fabric of his suit shining he took no notice of walts entrance the same could not be said for james peavy the dignifiedlooking rancher sat on the aisle in the fifth row of bench seating he wore his trademark stetson a blue blazer and a white oxford he glowered at walt there was no mistaking that look he shook his head faintly like a reminder of his prior warning and his eyes tracked walt as he found a seat most of the hearing centered on the proposed expansion of the socalled temporary storage of offshore lowlevel nuclear waste and when the hearing was thrown open to public comment the room became hostile toward hillabrand at last the chairman relieved hillabrand by stating that the floor was closed to questions regarding that particular issue and the room emptied quickly there were fewer than ten people in attendance when the chairman opened the floor to any other questions for mr hillabrand and sempers management of the inl an environmentalist beat walt to the microphone asking what hillabrand intended to do about a high fence that was interfering with the winter movements of an established elk herd hillabrand turned around to address the questioner and in doing so spotted walt there was a pronounced hitch to his movement like a film having been cut and spliced back together a minute later walt stood at the aisle microphone and introduced himself to the committee all of whom hed met on other occasions he carried copies of maps photographs and a time line of his own investigation to the dais then offered hillabrand copies the committee chair fingered the documents and then leaned into his microphone sheriff fleming mr hillabrand comes here in good faith he is not on trial im aware of that walt said into the mic this is a hearing were just getting mr hillabrands semiannual report and his appraisal of the condition of the facility and where its going over the next six months yes if you have a public comment then i do senator walt turned slightly to address hillabrand the witness is under oath he volunteered an oath at the start of his report the senator answered it is by no means binding or legal be that as it may i would hope it counts for something he looked directly at the witness mr hillabrand would you please view the photograph labeled b and answer this question photo b depicted the aerial view of the massive earthmovers working alongside one of the newer inl buildings are you aware of any current threats to health including any spills leaks or mishandling of nuclear waste at the inl recent or not there were not enough people in attendance to throw a murmur around the room but clearly the question caught everyone on the committee by surprise i will answer the question hillabrand replied confidently but first i would ask if the committee is aware of your having been detained by inl security just last night sheriff and if this questioning of yours is being done at the hand of politics in an attempt to salvage the damage last nights incident will have upon your current reelection campaign sheriff the chairman asked this has nothing to do with politics mr chairman walt never took his eyes off hillabrand whose bittenback smile bordered on arrogance i have a followup question or two if mr hillabrand only will answer the first the chairman seemed intent to not allow this to be a duel between walt and hillabrand the committee would like to set the record straight as to your detention did this in fact take place it did yes sir my glider was accidentally blown off course and intercepted by inl security we were forced to land questioned by inl security and later released without charges hillabrand snorted into the microphone without permission from the chairman he waved the photograph high in the air and said carrying him conveniently over our facility i see i feel it important to inform this committee that the existence of this photograph is a violation of federal law and that the viewing of this photograph will likely require investigation the statement surprised walt hillabrand had just thrown fiona under the bus walt had hoped that fionas involvement with hillabrand might mitigate how seriously he intended to prosecute the photography the committee turned in on itself for internal discussion indiscernible whispering floated through the room as the steam radiators popped and clanked walt felt desperate to at least get his first question answered though it now seemed obvious that hillabrand was willing to lie you said you would answer the question walt reminded im unaware of any spills or leaks or any health threats posed by our operations at the inl have you or any of your employees walt asked him had contact with or offered payments to lon bernie james peavy or daniel cutter in exchange for their silence their participation in a coverup concerning contamination of groundwater in the pahsimeroi valley this question sent the committee into gasps and further consultation harsh glances at both hillabrand and walt someone left the room behind walt and within seconds a dozen spectators hurried inside including a few reporters judging by their busy notepads the chairman took notice of the arrival of the press cupped his mouth and went back to whispering to his panel members sheriff fleming the chairman finally said while this committee respects and applauds your service in law enforcement in the great state of idaho we do not feel that this is the proper forum for your line of questioning isnt this a hearing on environmental impact walt asked it is my position mr chairman is that the inl under mr hillabrands governance has contaminated an eddy in the northern rocky mountain intermontane basins system the deep groundwater beneath the pahsimeroi i have personally witnessed the burning of over fifty head of sheep what rancher would dispose of his sheep by fire mr chairman bucksenator oozeryou run sheep have you ever burned any buck oozer shook his head no i also have medical records for two employees of trilogy springs bottling who were admitted to a hospital in salt lake city and after extensive testing were determined to be suffering from radiation poisoning you can see on this map walt said stepping toward the dais the relative proximity of ask the sheriff hillabrand said raising his voice and interrupting if hes an expert in radiation poisoning if he has ever heard of radon an underground source of radiation known to riddle the sediments of central idaho radon does exist mr hillabrand and has existed for thousands of yearsmillions i suppose but it doesnt just turn itself on these ranchers have had no problems until very recently now theres sickness all around that region if there has been depredation of livestock and sickness in employees of bottling companies hillabrand said to the chairman dont you think wed have heard about it before now is a county sheriff our best source for such accusations are you an expert on such matters mr fleming he turned around theres james peavy right back there why doesnt the chairman ask the honorable senator peavy if his livestock is suffering from radiation contamination peavy stood the chairman looked bewildered he mumbled its not in our purview to treat this like a trial mr hillabrand sheriff fleming its a hearing your complaint is noted sheriff fleming and it will be looked into sit down please senator peavy peavy sat but his apparent willingness to testify registered with the committee the chairman asked are there any other comments from hes paid off senator peavy walt said just as hes tried to pay off daniel cutter to remain silent about the sickness out at his bottling plant the gallery stirred im sorry mr chairman but taking note of my complaint is not enough there are lives at stake here the accusations are baseless hillabrand said totally and utterly baseless sheriff fleming the chairman said please sit down walt held his ground baseless mr hillabrand suddenly it was just the two of them in the room completely walt held up a finger to buy himself a moment and returned to his seat finally the chairman said loud enough to be heard im not done walt said digging into his briefcase mr hillabrand he threw something toward hillabrand who reached out and caught it onehanded a twentyounce bottle of trilogy water identified as part of a twoweek run all of which has subsequently been held off the market quarantined because of possible contamination since youre so sure the aquifer has not been poisoned by a leak at the inl have a glass of water convince me hillabrand looked at the bottle at walt and then at the dais a reporter in the back stood up and shot a photograph of hillabrand holding the bottle when hillabrand next met eyes with walt his own had hardened he broke the seal on the cap and poured himself a glass dont drink that walt said running toward the witness table it really is from the quarantined run that is contam but hillabrand put the glass to his mouth and began to drink walt knocked the glass out of his hand it shattered on the floor in front of the dais hillabrand brushed spilled water off his tailored suit are you crazy walt asked hillabrand loud enough for everyone to hear whyd you drink it i took readings on lon bernies sheep theyre so hot they should glow in the dark i have an expert on the aquifer confirming theres an eddy that passes directly under the inl and then turns north into the pahsimeroi it is over if youre right about any of this would i risk this hillabrand upended the plastic water bottle and chugged walt fought him and managed to get it out of his hand walt recognized sean lunn from fionas description as lunn rushed the table hillabrand waved the man off walt threw the water bottle to the floor where it spun discharging its contents thats good enough for me the chairman said youre done sheriff in fact this hearing is over our next public hearing will be in approximately three months time good day walt and hillabrand both breathing hard from their struggle over the bottle were locked in a staring contest why an exasperated walt said to hillabrand you know what that did to cutters employees i know you know hillabrand steadied his breathing bucks office he whispered ten minutes hillabrand stood still brushing water off his suit thank you mr chairman lunn waited alongside like a welltrained dog you think you can bribe me too walt said just as softly hillabrand stopped brushing and glared at him hopefully hillabrand said buck oozers office smelled pleasantly of pipe tobacco a wide partners desk sat between two flags with a credenza pushed up against the only wall with windows sunlight spilling over the tall leather chair and flooding the desktop oozer was nowhere to be seen only hillabrand and lunn occupied the office as walt entered im going to ask sean to check you for a wire hillabrand said the hell you are or we cannot do this hillabrand said im not wearing a wire then you wont mind also sean will take your briefcase cell phone radio and portfolio in the hall with him walt studied him deciding it did him no good to fight he didnt happen to be wearing or carrying a wire he took off his belt which held everything from a gun to a pair of handcuffs and a flashlight eased it to the floor and raised his hands lunn ran an airport wand around him asked him to remove his watch and then pronounced him clean hillabrand gave a nod and lunn carried walts briefcase and portfolio out of the room lunn pulled the door shut with a convincing click hillabrand stood with his back to the flickering gas fireplace for several minutes neither man spoke where to start hillabrand began id settle for something resembling the truth walt answered he carried his heavy belt over to a chair and placed it on the seat the two men remained standing its pretty cut and dried for you isnt it i suppose it is walt said still seething over hillabrands manipulation of the hearing you drank that water he still couldnt believe it you knew it was contaminated and yet you drank it it occurred to me you might be bluffing i wasnt i forced myself to vomit just now hillabrand confessed hopefully that helps and if it doesnt if youre contaminated the man shrugged it struck walt as oddly arrogant as if what made two people sick could have no effect on him you cant hide this forever walt said im not going to be the only one to figure this out have it all figured out do you pretty close i suspect another government contractor raking in the millions in fees and covering up his mistakes as fast as he can backfill something pretty close to that yes let me clarify some things hillabrand said the death of the vet randy aker not us his brother going missing not us i wish i could believe that you will i dont think so no you might want to sit down im fine did you really see fifty head of sheep burning hillabrand asked yes you were sloppy me i dont think so its the damn ranchers over there you want a glimpse of america a hundred years ago drive two hours east of hailey jesus what we have to put up with must be a real hardship read that hillabrand said pointing to oozers desk where a fax was positioned to face walt the hairs on his arms and neck rose as he identified the federal government letterhead its an nda yes a federal nondisclosure agreement said hillabrand airtight theyll take your firstborn if you so much as think about what youre about to hear thats right its worth careful consideration walt read the opening paragraph im not signing this i cant use whatever you tell me who said id tell you anything hillabrand countered walt looked between the man and the document on the desk its dated today it was faxed here about five minutes ago you work fast youre kind of forcing my hand sheriff id just as soon the hearing had stayed on the train shipments walt thought he understood there are no shipments from russia he speculated hillabrand didnt answer he didnt have to you created thatthe new shipmentsto keep that hearing where you wanted it well off the recent events up there i signed one of those hillabrand said indicating the document i cant go any further unless you join the club im not a big one for clubs walt said the last thing i joined was costco just the same why would i ever agree to sign this walt asked i have ninetynine percent of this in the bag i dont need this to know the truth your precious truth hillabrand shifted in front of the fire and so i can tell you everything i know about your missing friend walt felt his face flush but signing this prevents me from acting upon it no i dont think that will be the case i can almost promise youll be able to use that information but one thing ties to the next and there you have it i dont have anything but you will some will be prosecutable some wont let me guess which part wont walt said i understand how its in your nature to be suspicious rightly so im not asking you to be someone you cant be and im not even asking you to trust me because i believe at this stage thats beyond your instincts am i right you think i wouldnt sign this even if it would mean saving mark aker walt asked rhetorically you think im toosuspicious proud whatever distrustful is the word i think im certainly that its not that i can help you with aker not really but i believe it might help you to know what wasnt done who isnt behind it because sometimes that can lead one in the right direction as an investigator you must understand that better than most yes we call that misinformation walt said sarcastically but its not you see once you sign that nda i wont have to lie to you any longer it was difficult for walt to see hillabrand as the victim of the government the way hillabrand wanted him to the portrayal seemed unlikely and insincere he wanted to believe he could find the truth on his ownthat he already had most of itbut the truth could take time and mark aker had all but run out of it he pulled a pen out of his pocket and signed the document hand it to me please hillabrand said taking no chances walt might try to destroy it burn it in the fireplace once he had the truth hillabrand carefully folded the document and slipped it into his suit coats inside pocket he then stared at walt and walt stared back it wasnt a spill he said and it wasnt my companys money you paid off the ranchers to cover their losses the same way danny cutter was made a similar offer my company made those arrangements but the money comes from the taxpayers if not a spill what leakage seepage or what youre still so determined to see me in a particular light you cant quite wrap your mind around it can you what if im considered innocent until proven guilty that would be a novelty he was right walt had seen semper and hillabrand in particular as the perpetrators hed had little choice but to do so the inl directors rebuffs had been the icing on the cake but now the existence of the nda made itself felt perhaps no one had agreed to meet with him because theyd been bound by the same contract sabotage walt mumbled stunned by the way the events suddenly looked so different when considered in this light a domestic terrorist attack hillabrand said his voice low his words carefully chosen not a bunch of crazy muslims a bunch of crazy rednecks walt felt a sickening dread in his belly the samakinn walt recalled the alert that had been sent youve heard of them only recently they targeted a wellsecured facility with the remnants of fortytwo reactors spread over an area the size of manhattan hillabrand said they attacked an outlying building and caused a rupture thankfully small but its still radioactive material we think it was accomplished by four people maybe less this comes at a time when this administration is in backchannel negotiations with pakistan north korea and iran on their nuclear policies were trying to dictate policy in order to control world safety the last thing this administration needs is to be seen as a government that cant secure its own fissionable material when the breach was discovered the administration informed us this would not go public any blowback would be covered by them thankfully it happened in a mostly uninhabited area the substrata contamination flowed north into the pahsimeroi it wasnt until the livestock became ill that we even understood the degree of the sabotage weve been working around the clock to repair the damage ever since thankfully the few ranchers affected are patriots they signed the same nda that you did took some money for their troubles and kept their mouths shut two things we didnt see coming mark aker and trilogy water walt said we should have known about trilogy that was a horrible oversight on our part we didnt even know that bottling facility existed very stupid of us the ranchers had contacted the vets before you got to them aker saw how sick the livestock was he was in the midst of trying to help when we had to ask the ranchers to turn him away they made excuses that theyd switched to a local vet and that might have stuck if the local vet had been made to play along but aker must have run into him or followed up with him and the lie was exposed and aker came looking but then randy aker was your doing walt said my people say no perhaps to protect me but they say it wasnt us our best guess is that it has something to do with the samakinn they left a note long since in the hands of the fbi a rambling manifesto about the wrongs of the country they want their message heard you know the drill and by covering up any news of the leak the sabotage he corrected youve pissed them off a dozen miscreants dont dictate how this country is run they called some newspapers to make their claim we fielded some calls as a result we denied any mishap as did the administration no harm no foul another group of wackos making unsubstantiated claims no damaging articles ever ran the samakinn blogged about the spill on the internet but without any kind of proof which is where i come in walt said why should i believe any of this an nda isnt proof of anything no its not he paused i thought you might go there he walked over to the office door and opened it murmuring to someone on the other side a young woman entered and glanced at walt as she crossed behind the senators desk she spoke on the phone for several minutes while working the senators computer walt and hillabrand waited in silence when the aide spoke walt thought it was to him but it was in fact to the computer are we ready she said were good on this end a voice returned hillabrand moved to the door and waited for the aide who motioned for walt to take the chair she said you dont have to do anything just sit walt moved around the desk to see the face of a twentysomething man on the screen sheriff fleming yes walt said sliding into the comfortable chair stand by for vice president shaler the man vacated the screen walt saw only a set of drapes and some framed photographs the ski mountain in the nearest photo was all too familiar to him walt glanced over at hillabrand who stood half out the door hopefully youll believe her ill be waiting just outside he pulled the door shut walt she had sneaked onto the screen while walt had been distracted with hillabrand how great to see you she exclaimed madame vice president enough of that walt its liz and you know better you look well i am thank you and you you look tired i know your time must be limited i was just speaking to roger hillabrand he said you might clarify some of this everything i presume roger has told you is accurate walt we were attacked and weve had to play hardball to protect current negotiations its important for you to know that both houses have been briefed through committee there is no coverup taking place it may take twentyfive years and the freedom of information act for any but a handful of people to know about this incident but thats how the game has to be played sometimes they tried to frame danny cutter on a drug charge walt said is that protocol i cant speak to specifics i have heard that in certain instances pressure points were determined and taken advantage of in order to ensure full cooperation they have to make absolutely sure that everyone will sign the nda and cooperate fully they cant risk anything short of that if a witness hesitates there has to be backup some of this behavior is despicable and i apologize for that ive expressed my displeasure at some of the tactics used my wife my children walt suddenly saw gails intrusion differently what about them never mind tell me please its unrelated it may not be walt she said please tell me he briefly explained gails claiming the girls for herselfthis after leaving the marriage because she felt overwhelmed by motherhood it hadnt added up until just this moment im wondering if she didnt get an anonymous phone call implying some kind of failure on my part im wondering if there wasnt some behindthescenes look at my divorce papers walt i would never condone such a thing i want you to know that the president and i are briefed regularly about the situation out there but certainly havent heard all the details nothing about what you claim happened to danny cutter and most definitely nothing to do with you i can and will make some calls a thing like this walt said the sabotage it cant be contained not once its in the water you know that right do you mean the news of the event or the contamination itself both as to the contamination it was minimal theres a tremendous volume of water were dealing with levels are well off of where they were two and three weeks ago another two weeks were told and were in the clear she pursed her lips as her attention was drawn offscreen as to the spread of information we believe it can be contained has to be contained we need your cooperation your assistance in seeing that happens i signed the nda liz im not going to risk a stay in leavenworth i wont say anything its more than that its mark aker we need to extract him before hes forced to publish something that could be damaging publish maybe roger didnt tell you everything what the samakinn seek most is notoriety credibility they believe credibility comes through verification confirmation the sabotage was effective scientific proof walt said like a veterinarians report on the sheep the sabotage is under investigation the samakinn must have had inside help rogers people have been working twentyfourseven with the bureau attempting to turn up the mole our information is that the bureau has surveillance in place they are ready to strike we both know what happens to mark aker if hes anywhere near them when that strike occurs i need whatever intels available walt said sitting forward in the chair im not privy to the details its too far out of my area of operations but you said yourself mark has to be extracted theres a genuine fear of ruby ridge here walt its one of the things holding the bureau back if they make this into a standoff the samakinn win the press coverage they so desperately seek its a nowin for us and thats got all of us looking at alternatives but if mark akers out of the equation theres a lot more leeway theres still time for you to help us fix this i have nothing walt said i cant do anything without something to work with work with roger cooperate with him walt hes not the enemy thats the purpose of this call to try to bring you two closer together his people have their suspicions suspects maybe between the two of you walt had focused on hillabrand as a suspect for too long to now reverse himself and make him an ally just the suggestion of working with him turned walts stomach the man had pursued fiona possibly in order to monitor walt hed denied knowledge of randy akers death which seemed unlikely worming inside him was the realization of how misplaced his suspicions had been how biased hed been against hillabrands big money how eagerly hed labeled semper the corporate villain the ranchers as easily compromised accomplices senator peavy had tried to steer him toward washington had repeatedly said how he was trying to help walt and walt had reacted negatively immediately distrusting the man perhaps the plan had been for shaler to seek him out in person and explain the events it all played out so differently now listen liz shaler said ive got to go but i want you to think about everything ive said follow your instincts on this walt ive always trusted your instincts thank you but he was questioning his instincts and her praise only drove home that point we need to pool our resources find this group and extract mark aker nothing short of that is acceptable agreed even over a webcam there was a look to liz shalers eyes that would haunt him a fierce determination that flirted too close to fear a takenoprisoners defiance that mixed with the terror that any mention of radioactivity brought she seemed to be telling him without words that if mark had to be sacrificed for the greater good then that was what was going to happen roy coats lived with the pain the doc had stolen all the serious meds aspirin hardly helped he felt his best when sitting quietly by the woodstove the brand name of which was reversed on his cheek in angry blisters the wound in his leg left him a cripple it was a caked spongy mass of scab and infection his armpit wound was less of a concern it hurt far less but if he tried to venture outside into the biting cold his face lit up in pain he waitedimpatient hurting badly and foul of moodready to tear the head off the next thing that came through the door the required knock on the cabin door won his attention he grunted loudly admitting whoever it was the burns infection kept him from speaking much he could move his lips enough to get a few words out but that was it the doorknob turned and newbs poked his head through then stepped inside cautiously bout time coats said donny newbury was twentythree but looked thirty due to the width of his round face and the thick scrub of a beard that he wore he ducked his head coming through the door and filled the cabin with his wide shoulders and barrel chest i brought shilo newbury said he eyed coats warily and stayed close to the door a collar and the radio gear fresh batteries like you said if youd told me in time i coulda brought something for your face and all coats grunted he took everything that had happened to him as a test what about lakely not happening newbury said tensing in case it provoked something unexpected from coats he went to the melodee like you said to meet that scientist girl for you to make the deal and get the drum of waste and all but it was fuckedup roy i kept watch like you said from my pickup he was in there too long you know he was going to drop the stuff and get her keys or whatever and make the switch but it was fuckedup the thing is he shoulda checked the makes in the parking lot doesnt take a fucking genius to spot the suvs at the melodee are you kidding me pickups and maybe an old caddie or two but spanking brandnew suvs get to the point coats said painfully feds i could see the flashes in the window fucking serious firefight couldnt have lasted that long unless lakely had gotten himself hunkered down he put up a good fight when it was over the ambulance arrived only one ambulance there in arco so two of the body bags went in the back of a pickup three in all lakely one of em because he never walked out or nothing but shit roy he gave em hell ill tell you that and there was plenty of wounded on top of the other three for coats the room wouldnt stop spinning blood thumped at his temples and rang in his ears and he thought his head might explode the drum he muttered through clenched teeth a fiftyfivegallon drum of contaminated waste enough for a dirty bomb his dirty bomb enough to make the world take notice hed have had the front page of every newspaper in the world the samakinn would have been heard but now hed lost the drum hed lost lakely the girl newbury shook his head hed lost the girl but just because i didnt see her come out dont mean nothing the feds had the girl how much did she know about him how much had he revealed in his lameass attempts at conversation most important of all had she seen his truck did she know about his truck if shed seen his plates he was done gone theyd be on him like flies on shit it was all down to the doc again they had to find him you and gearbox split up gearboxll take shilo you take the old road we need the doc they both heard the approach of the snowmobile a moment later came the knock on the door huh coats grunted gearbox entered looking half frozen newbsll fill you in coats said you find the doc and you bring him back here hes gonna write that letter we can still pull this off he glanced down at his swollen leg maybe the doc could help with the leg he could hardly move the thing without the scab cracking open he needed some stitches if the doc hadnt stabbed him it would have been him in the body bag instead of lakely everything happens for a reason what the fuck are you looking at he managed to say find the doc and bring him back here then he caught sight of himself in the windows reflection and understood why newbs had been staring so intently the blisters had torn open spewing a yellow fluid down his cheek it looked as if his face was melting off walt went through the jails perimeter door shoulder first following the shiny spot beneath the combover belonging to his deputy jimmy magna who everyone called magnum the fortyfiveyearold county jail suffered from poor design its security doors were like hatches on a submarine at twentyeight inches wide they were so narrow that the stretcher carrying taylor crabtree had to be angled to fit through the young man was missing a couple of front teeth and his dislocated right shoulder was in a sling otherwise hed been lucky inmates didnt look kindly on those accused of molesting girls young enough to be their daughters you okay walt asked crabtree as the stretcher was maneuvered through a second doorway hed have done anything to reverse the beating the boy had taken hed warned his jailers that crabtree was at risk and was pissed at the obvious neglect that had occurred i want out of here crabtree said through a swollen cheek well figure something out were going to get you to the hospital first maybe a dentist walt was eager to question the boy further to look for a possible link to sean lunn and a way to pressure hillabrand but the injuries came first he had to hold himself back from in any way delaying crabtrees medical care im not going back in there the boy said its not how it works walt said well get you isolated somehow please the boy said it was more than a word it was an apology a confession something he hadnt spoken to anyone in years the plea revealed a contrite taylor crabtree walt had hoped remorse existed somewhere inside the boy he understood the importance of the moment if walt delayed the medical care and crabtree later filed a grievance walt would face review but he sensed an opportunity when we get him out walt instructed his deputies unstrap him lets get him into the sit room and put some ice on that lip have the ambulance stand by i dont need an ambulance crabtree complained procedures walt explained youre in the system now there are ways we have to do this fuck the system thats how you got in here walt said but its not how you get out the situation room smelled of sweat coffee and doughnuts just as an athlete recognized the particular smell of locker rooms any cop could identify the combination crabtree sat nursing his mouth with a baggie of ice this is not supposed to happen in my jail walt said what if i change my mind and decide to talk to you i could tell you it would make a difference depending on what you had to say but honestly taylor i dont want to lie to you i dont know what if anything will help your situation right now youve built a long sheet a judge is going to review all that youll be seen as one of those kids that cant turn the corner and get your act together but i can ask elbie i believe you and ill be happy to speak on your behalf but the system is fairly unforgiving if we could get you back into the alternative school and if you stayed there no more stupid stuff maybe a judge would be more lenient can you ask mr levy if i can try again if he takes you back at the school whats to say youll toe the line ask elbie im reliable im never late i dont cheat on lunchtime or anything ill speak to barge crabtree nodded holding the ice gingerly i lied about kira he threw it out there before you dig yourself in any deeper walt said let me tell you a couple things i know first you didnt pick up kira tulivich on the side of the road second i know she was in your car and that you dropped her at the hospital as youve said third that bruising on your faceits still faintly therewasnt kiras doing and it wasnt a snowboarding accident there are no indications she resisted crabtrees eyes widened with surprise or maybe it was concern that he had little to offer walt now we have no evidence connecting kira to your trailer we found no drugs in your trailer it seems unlikely youre the one who doped her so what happened to her and where it happened remain a mystery to me but i now know why it happened and i think theres a possibility i know at least one of the parties involved so whatever you do taylor dont lie to me because ill likely know youre lying and thats not going to help anything he paused giving the boy a few seconds and if you dont say anything thats okay too better to not say anything than to try to slip something past me you get that the boy nodded so should i call the ambulance guys in he shook his head youre afraid walt could see it on the boys face of what retaliation by who only crabtrees eyes moved a quick surgical strike locking onto walt who crabtree didnt answer its natural for a young man in your situation to gravitate toward a group a gang are you in with the mexicans he coughed up a laugh oh sure walt said the next thing that came into his head the samakinn crabtrees face froze i want you to think very carefully crab walt said feeling a rapport developing association with the samakinn is not in itself a crime participating in certain activities may be but if you get in front you dont fucking get it do you im afraid not help me out crab i want to get it shit the bruises the ones you already had when i saw you at elbies did kira give you that face i did not do anything to kira and you did not get those bruises snowboarding i rescued her his eyes unflinching and bloodshot glared at him youve got it backwards sheriff im the one that saved her okay from them coats and the other guy he broke the eye contact he lives up there you know triumph coats does he and his dogs fucking dogs never stop barking but is anybody going to complain about it no way roy coats walt said coats was one of the last true mountain men left in the area a tracker some said illegal tracker hed been accused more than once of using collared dogs to track down mountain lions for anonymous clients walt rolled around the rumors surrounding randy aker and poaching coats fish and game had tried to bring charges against coats several years back he hadnt heard the name since then i saw him take kira out of a dog crate back of his pickup this was really late at night snowing bad and hes got her in a dog crate walt looked around he longed for a tape recorder and yet didnt want to put crabtree off his statement pulling a notepad from his shirt pocket he said im going to write some of this down crabtree nodded he dragged her inside how close is his place to yours walts nephew kevin had taught him well about when a teen shifted into avoidance mode crabtrees eyes went to a cigarette burn on the edge of the table his shoulders folded forward walts impatience and his lack of sleep almost got the better of him he nearly marched around the conference table and took crabtree by the shirt and shook some sense into him but hed learned selfcontrol a long time ago had learned to make these interrogationsconfrontationsless personal crabtree wanted to improve both his current situation and his future walt could play the catalyst if he could get his own frustration out of the way can you see his house from your mobile home walt asked his voice calm and collected im not saying anything taylorhelp yourself out here you can do this its the right thing to do forget about you for a minute think about kira youre helping kira you want to help kira right the look on his face showed anger and frustration walt knew all about both what walt said i cant tell you you have to tell me but i cant okay how about this we start the clock right now anything you tell me for the next five minutes is off the record it never happened i never heard it thats a cop game you ever seen law and order i know all about cop games four minutes walt said looking at his watch no tricks i give you my word crabtree looked walt up and down something about walts promise resonated coats isnt there much he hunts with the dogs i think maybe has some other place not there much at all but the dogs a lot of them stick around and theres this girl watches the place for him takes care of the dogs smokinghot this girl he dared a glance at walt who tried to convey no opinion in his expression crabtree was apparently going to leave it there a goodlooking girl walt said asked me to take care of the dogs for her one time her mother got real sick and she couldnt stick around i said sure and she gave me a key again he paused again it seemed as if he wasnt going to continue a key to coatss place correct crabtree said and you helped her out by feeding the dogs does this connect with kira taylor im a little short on time i put a pair of webcams in there his head was hung in shame walts heart raced in his chest he looked around for a glass of water there wasnt one inside the house his cabin yeah walts jaw dropped he sucked up his surprise cleared his throat and tried to sound as normal as possible but inside he was both churning over the invasion of privacy and jumping at the thought that taylor crabtree might have witnessed the assault depending on if he ever found mark aker depending on his condition proving the abduction could be difficult but a witness to a sexual assault a rape tried and convicted in blaine county could put coats away for most of his adult life it would be a poor tradeoff but one that walt would be happy to have in his back pocket taylor i understand that your concern here is prosecution over the existence of the webcams its a legitimate concern given your being expelled from the alternative school for the same offense if we charged you a judge wouldnt like that at all but i can guarantee youguarantee taylor that that will not be the case here if you witnessed what i think you witnessed those charges will never be filed not only that but others will be lessened or eliminated but most of all i need you to be honest do you get that absolutely honest the slightest embellishment will hurt everything the boy nodded i have hours of dvds he said of the girl in the shower dressing undressing in bed she had a boyfriend who you know he came over a lot when she was there and they you know you recorded it walt said his voice shaking slightly he couldnt hold himself back the assault taylor crab did you record the assault i didnt burn it if thats what you mean im not exactly what youd call a techie its on my hard drive ive got like fifteen hours on my hard drive fifteen hours including the assault walt made it a statement crabtree nodded clearly ashamed how do you think i got in there to get her you think i was going to take on those guys walt noted the plural but they took a break jesus the things they did to her poor kira but i got her out of there and into my car and i was in such a fucking hurry i planted my face into the car door as i opened it i was carrying her bashed my face into the door he reached up and touched it it fucked me up bad was me who needed the emergency room drove like mad got her to the hospital they never figured it out that it was me helped her yesterday when you came by i wasnt afraid of your cop car the pickup trucks walt remembered them the kid nodded again i keep expecting a knock on the door and someone crushing my head in coats is fucking out of his mind hell kill me he figures out it was me all i want is those cameras out of there theyre still in there get it hes gonna find them at some point and then im like totally fucked i can probably help you there walt said his head spinning from the information the night of the assault coats had company yeah a black escalade the guys in his late thirties pretty buffed out dresses well the boy looked stunned how could you know that its my job taylor walt said and then mumbled to himself its my job why am i being made to watch this fiona asked standing alongside walt in the sheriffs office command center the door was shut and locked the televisions sound turned down low so that kira tulivichs agony remained contained within those walls im sorry walt said but youre my photography expert they should be hung no castrated with a kitchen knife then pulled limb from limb drawn and quartered and even that would be too good for them on the screen coats and an unidentified male took turns violating kira tulivich the horror played out in the grainy blackandwhite of taylor crabtrees webcam his computer having been confiscated from the rv he used as shelter you may be able to spot a frame we could enlarge or something to give us a better look at the second man its not that at all is it she said accusingly what is it with you walt always having hidden agendas never admitting them why dont you just come out and say you think its sean lunn is that what you think oh give me a break is it thats what i think yes does anything i see here confirm it make me absolutely certain no but you wont even speak his name i cant walt said winning a surprised look from her you need me as a witness she speculated i need to identify the second man yes that could prove extremely helpful so you dont mention his name because if you did it could be construed later that you led the witness something like that im sorry she ran her fingers through her hair and tilted her head back she had an elegant neck long and regal i confuse the professional with the personal dont i its easy to do so why dont you she asked tulivich was held in place by coats she let out a horrible scream fiona looked away well if anything will put you off sex this will i want them both to pay for this fiona not just coats coatsim going to take care of coats do you have him no know where he is no we do know the bureau had a confrontation with a man believed to be a member of the samakinnan extremist group part ted kaczynski part aryan nation a second suspect a woman is in custody shes a meth addict and is proving difficult to deal with we have a description of a man thats close enough to coats to do the trick its all very fluid she dared to look at the screen again jesus i cant take any more of this that poor girl walt had not taken his eyes off the screen yeah how bout there he asked he used the keyboards space bar to stop the video used the mouse to back up the footage is that a mirror on the wall is that his face in the mirror its too grainy she said youll never get anything this is incredibly low resolution walt really poor even with enhancement youre going to need a shot thats very strong they watched another thirty seconds fiona needing to look away repeatedly wait she said walt paused the video fiona leaned forward and pointed not at the mans face but the pants crumpled at his knees look the back belt loop its ripped attached at the top but not the bottom walt craned forward how did you ever see that i was trying not to look at what was going on he played a short segment repeatedly sure enough the belt loop flapped loose it was seen only briefly but there it was on video walt said its not enough to win a warrant i cant say because of that its sean lunn i need to see sean lunn in those pants that would give me probable cause for a wider search its not much even at that but youre going to search the cabin arent you awaiting a warrant the judge is golfing down in twin falls its still warm enough down there to keep the courses open one of my guyswere working on a phoner warrant am i coming along thats the third reason youre here and why i asked you to bring your gear im still mad at you you know she said this proudly i know roger hasnt called i may have been wrong about him walt said it came out as a confession which was not the way he meant it your timing could be better im a work in progress fiona i dont have any of it figured out but losing mark like this i know it all has to do more with friendship than we think more than i understand at least its whats important at the end of the day right i need to find him dead or alive i need to know i dont understand exactly i screw up a lot of stuff but i intend to keep working on my friendships starting with you at some point i dont want you mad at me she glared a hostile unforgiving look that showed walt just how far he had to go okay he said i get it you know why i really hate you she whispered i didnt even know you did its because i cant stay mad at you she pushed her chair back youd better turn that off because im leaving the room standing by the door she dug around in her purse and came up with a business card sean lunn she said waving it the night he was trying to talk me onto the corporate jet said to call if i needed anything so ill call him the thing about men they pretty much wear the same thing all the time what do you want to bet he shows up in those same pants youd do that walt asked i thought you said its all about friendship she questioned i thought you hated me youre not a very good detective sheriff im sorry to have to tell you the warrant was called in from the tenth green by judge dan alban within twentyfive minutes walt had six of his eight available deputies in strategic positions surrounding coatss house including a sharpshooter positioned up a hill among the ruins of the defunct mine this kind of deployment wreaked havoc on his department as it left only two onduty deputies to patrol a county roughly the area of rhode island the house was situated so that its detached onecar garage blocked it from view of the other houses and abandoned rvs scattered around the sterile wasteland of pale gray mine tailings it stood off on its own out of sight surrounded by an abnormally high postandrail fence topped with a single strand of taut razor wire the front gate carried two inauspicious signs beware of dog and no soliciting walt and his deputy bill noland led the way as they pushed through the gate and approached the house at a run noland who was in his late twenties carried a fourfoot stun stick for use on the dogs if necessary walt carried a flash and bang a whitephosphorus stun grenade both men also had their berettas out and at the ready behind them came two more men one carrying the ram a threefoot seventypound steel maul capable of disintegrating most doors walt tried the doorknob locked the ram took out the hardware and the door swung open walt tossed the grenade inside and his team turned their backs the flash and bang would momentarily blind deafen and typically physically stun anyone within the confined space where it detonated his team charged through the door led by noland walt brought up the rear the space was smalla living area a bathroom and a single bedroom it all looked familiar to walt from the webcam video clear his men announced as they inspected the closets and rooms they moved on to stunbomb a crawl space the hatch for which was found cut into the floor in the bedroom closet it too proved to be empty by the time his men reconvened in the central living area walt had the two webcams in a pouch on the inside of his windbreaker well get that door closed as best as possible bring in fiona and forensics well watch the roadboth directionsand keep the house under roundtheclock surveillance questions sheriff it was noland calling from the galley kitchen walt faced the refrigerator where a number of postcards bill reminders and handscrawled notes had been attached with various pieces of a magnetic poetry set energy and persistence conquer all things its benjamin franklin walt said consumed by the subtext roy coats was a determined man not that noland said he pointed to a photocopied collage of snapshots handwritten at the bottom it read thanks for the guiding happy huntingralph the center picture showed three men with rifles in their hands standing in front of a rustic cabin the cabin was small with an outbuilding on the right in the photo walt picked coats out immediately recognizing him both from the drivers license photo hed pulled and by the fact he was the biggest among the three a burly man with a full beard who looked as if he hadnt showered for weeks the rifle he held was smaller than those held by the others a modifieda dart rifle walt guessed the smallgauge rifle walt had heard on two separate occasions losing a friend both times the center photograph was surrounded by five other snapshots three of which featured the cabin or what appeared to be its outbuildings in each of the three the landscape rose in the background and in two of these the background was jagged mountains plainsight search walt told his deputy i want any other photographs of this cabin we can find he tapped the collage i want property tax records for every county in the state starting with ours and working out through connecting counties crosschecked for anything owned by coats get on the horn and get that started its damn good work noland yes sir noland hurried off a slight spring to his step walt studied each of the photos carefully when combined they presented about threequarters of a panorama but it was the two that showed the distant mountains that most captivated him his index finger traced the line of the peaks against the cobalt blue sky there were ranges he knew the look of by heart though admittedly only from one or two angles typically from a road or similar perspective put him on the opposite side of the same range and he wouldnt recognize it it didnt come as a surprise that he couldnt identify this particular range though it was certainly a frustration again walt traced the silhouetted line in each of the photos where the mountains met the sky maps walt called out a little too loudly for the small space he stood and addressed his small team i want any maps any photos were abandoning plainsight search i want everyone wearing gloves we toss the place but neatly gentlemen carefully and put back everything the way you find it he caught himself holding his breath as he watched his men take to the search a little too eagerly as always coats stood in the center of the middle photograph walt didnt like to think that chance played a role in his work hed spent too much time in continuing education seminars field exercises and classrooms to put much credence in the flip of a coin or happenstance but more than that it was the issue of control hed been trained to control the investigation not to allow the investigation to control him so as he entered the womens side of his decrepit jailtwo cells on the northeast corner of the small cellblockand found taylor crabtree engaged in a video game he fought to accept that a possible solution to this investigation could just materialize out of thin air a local film star had donated his sons outdated playstation and a dozen games for the entertainment of the inmates crabtree was engaged in combat with guns blazing a pair of headphones over his ears walt could hear the dull zing and pop of explosions through the headphones he caught a glimpse of the screen a small computer monitor it showed a landscape like afghanistan rugged high desert it showed a distant mountain range angular against a bombflashing sky the thing was that landscape looked impossibly familiar not all that different than many parts of idaho walt grabbed the cell bars with either hand he knew how to find coatss cabin the command center s scarred oval conference table held four computers including the one confiscated from crabtrees rv walt studied the intent faces of the four boys at the keyboards crabtree walts nephew kevin a boy of sixteen named wilder and one other jason jason and wilder had been recruited from the alternative school by crabtree he knew them to be serious gamers as he passed kevin walt ruffled his hair and patted him on the back the idea had come to walt as hed witnessed crabtree at the playstation the afghan mountain ridges slipping past the boys were all currently using the satellite imaging software google earth in an attempt to reconcile the distinct ridges seen in the refrigeratorcollage photographs with the true idahoan landscape the boys experts with either a joystick or mouse could place themselves into googles virtual landscape tipping the horizon zooming in or out and even spinning a full three hundred and sixty degrees around a single point while attempting to match the skyline in the photos to the satellite imagery with thousands of mountain peaks to compare this task might have proved interminable but crabtree had further contributed with a simple observation four of the peaks were snowtopped three of the four photos were time and datestamped as was the postcard itself a phone call to the forest service followed by a second call to the national interagency fire center in boise which tracked snow cover put the elevation of the snow line at nine thousand feet on the day the snapshots had been taken nearly a year earlier walts staff had narrowed the candidates by marking all mountain peaks over nine thousand feet on a topographic map they narrowed it further by colorcoding any ranges that contained three such adjacent peaks within a twentymile radius now with twentyone circles drawn on the map in overlapping rings the boys were working the computers using google earth trying to match horizon for horizonthe photographs to the computer screens it would have taken walts deputies hours to understand and control the google software the boys were at it in minutes he walked around the table watching over the boys shoulders to the untrained eye the images moved quickly it felt as if he were flying down to ground level and spinning around eyes wide open more than once walt wanted to tell the kids to slow down but their eyes worked differently than his their motor control tied to the mouse or joystick where he saw a blur they saw distinct images forty minutes into the experiment crabtree used a look to call walt to his side the boy raised his finger to the screen pointing out several peaks then he pointed to the same peaks on the enlargements of the photographs from the collage uhhuh walt said noting the similarities excitement rose in his chest but he said nothing more there had been five false alarms prior to this these shacks crabtree said indicating objects in two of the photographs are here and here he pointed to the screen helping walt to spot the small geometrical shapes created by roofs mostly hidden beneath the abundance of conifers two triangles a piece of a rectangle they looked like little more than shadows walt would never have seen them and these shots crabtree continued look to me like they were taken back here theres a field about a quarter mile behind the cabin this creek is on one side walts nephew kevin was out of his chair also looking over crabtrees shoulder he picked up a coordinate and then quickly found the same location on his screen walt stood between the boys watching the two screens fill with images kevins locked onto a view that perfectly matched one of the snapshots while crabtree obtained a perspective where the computerrealized mountain peaks on the computer matched point for point with those in the photograph write down the coordinates walt said he leaned into crabtree and whispered dont look now but you just bought yourself a free pass by two pm walt had notified the fbi that he was leading an exploratory team into a remote area of the challis national forest he did this out of necessity he needed the bureaus assistance in arranging air support and he hoped to gain political backing for his decision to hold back the information about the raid from the challis sheriff as he feared there was a mole in that office the timing of this announcement was critical he made it far enough in advance of the operation to allow the bureau to feel included but not enough time for the bureaus direct participation having recruited a team of eighteen by cherrypicking the various police and sheriff departments in the valley he had assembled a formidable group but the final decision of who was to accompany him on the lead attack had yet to be made the eighteen did not fit well around the command centers table half of the men were standing walt directed the groups attention to a powerpoint presentation put together by nancy our challenge he said now halfway into his briefing is accessibility and therefore timing there are no roads within six miles of the cabin in the summer there must be trails but that doesnt help us you either know your way in or you dont given the probability of a hostage and the physical layout of the terrainnote the surrounding hillstheres no easy way to advance assets on the ground without risking being seen or heard and therefore putting the hostage at risk for this reason we will divide into three groupsalpha bravo deltaand take a different approach snowmobiles can be heard nearly two miles off in the backcountry as many of you know helicopters well beyond that for this reason and because we anticipate sentries teams will abandon the snowmobiles in these three locations he said pointing to the screen and snowshoe in from there along these routes the leaders will have gps coordinates to follow these routes are through difficult terrain but take the teams away from the most likely routes used to access the compound we expect those routes may be under guard or even tripwired i and one other will be flying in in a glider just ahead of you in an effort to secure the hostage in advance of a possible firefight so the feds gave it back walt didnt catch whod said that a halfdozen heads hung to mask snickers my glider happens to have been confiscated yes he allowed but luke walens stepped up and offered his now if you dont mind ill continue the briefing the heads came up and a sense of mirth filled the room he didnt mind it coming at his expense he thought they might pay more attention now we will land here in this open field and proceed on foot northnorthwest toward the cabin if possible using infrared i will have identified the number and position of warm bodies down there providing intel that should aid your advance radio traffic will be limited just remember at least two hopefully three of us are friendlies well bring a vest for the hostage but do me a favor and verify your targets a nervous chuckle passed around the room the individual team leaders will brief you on your groups route and your role in the operation some of you are perimeter control some a strike force and some are holding back for extrication theres a shock and awe component to this that i want you to all be aware of once our attack has begun at least one helicopter possibly two will secure the airspace above the compound theyre there to help get us out but my hope here is also to confuse and intimidate the enemy our teams need to be braced for that we dont want anyone made jumpy or triggerhappy by the noise and chaos that follows questions walt fielded a dozen routine questions it was to be a night raid some of the team would be wearing night vision equipment others would not and the mixture made clarification important he appreciated the nervousness and tension that filled the room better that than overconfidence he still had to pick his partner for the attack together they would attempt to reach the cabin and rescue mark aker or at least position themselves to do so ahead of the main assault it gave mark the best chance of survival and hopefully would preempt his being used as a bargaining chip walt scanned the group for the right person then through the glass he saw tommy brandon enter the building and approach reception brandon who had likely aided gail in the abduction of his daughters he was wearing street clothes not his uniform hed removed the sling walt excused himself from the team turning it over to his deputy and met brandon in the foyer for a long moment the two just stared at each other it wasnt my idea brandon said i want them back walt said i think she knows that brandon hesitated look i want to help on this walt took a deep breath what about the arm brandon showed he had range of motion though it clearly hurt him to move it im fine he said good enough at least i want to be part of this she had no right walt said did you drive her i had nothing to do with it and im supposed to believe that we talked about it if thats what you mean i told her to talk to a lawyer she didnt want to hear that she was all freakedout about you having a girl in there you know how she is he looked the man over tommy brandon the deputy he wanted in the glider with him tommy brandon his wifes lover a man he wanted nothing to do with how are you in small planes i hate em good get dressed fiona kenshaw had been greeted with suspicion as she arrived at the tulivichs front door someonefrom the hospital perhapshad leaked to the local press that the sheriff had interviewed their daughter kira in connection with the mark aker disappearance and so the family had put up with several unwanted visitors over the past week fionas county employee id which she carried in order to enter and photograph crime scenes put off those suspicions and granted her access a few minutes later she was on a leather couch in front of a log fire awaiting kira the girl looked sheepish and shy but not at all bruised or damaged the daterape cocktail had blocked her memory of the assault she explained though she still ached all over leaving her feeling like she was inhabiting some other girls body there were some followup doctor visits yet to come and counseling had been recommended though she couldnt figure out why she would get counseling for something about which she had absolutely no memory but for all her claim to remember nothing kira had a sullen look her eyes distant i wont stay long fiona said and i should be clear that im not here in any official capacity i wanted to see how youre doing and to wish you well and the sheriff wanted me to pass along that as it turns out youve played an important role in a very highlevel investigation seriously she feigned interest small change i know but i thought you might want to hear that something good came out of what happened something good for other people you mean delivered with an icecold assertion i know its not much what am i supposed to say happy to do my part her mother entered the room trying to appear hospitablea failed effort ive got it mom kira snapped wed rather talk alone the mother pursed her lips and retreated the exchange sent shivers through fiona a victim was like a pebble in a pond fiona realized the ripples traveled out a great distance kira whispered to fiona i cant brush my teeth without one of them hovering over me its like im on suicide watch or something you probably are fiona thought you actually came here to try to make me feel good about what happened kira said incredulously of course not nothing like that i came to give you these she said handing kira five photographs from the wedding the girl flipped through them a smile flickered across her face quickly wiped away by a realization ancient history she mumbled she blinked repeatedly its weird i remember this like it was a year ago thats someplace to start biting her lip kira studied the photos more slowly this one of the bouquet i didnt take that one i threw it in no charge thats you yes i dont remember you there i was working not exactly dressed for the occasion as you can see you caught it technically no but thats how the umpire ruled another smile small victories can i keep these of course theyre for you thank you she made a point of meeting fionas eyes theres one other thing im not sure im allowed to tell you this but thats never stopped me before she winced and its really none of my business i should say that right off the top but your family is obviously of some means and well its one of those things i feel compelled to do you know have you ever felt that way despite your better judgment kira nodded good fiona collected her thoughts theres a boy named taylor crabtree that loser you know him i see him around i dont know him well thats the point i guess hes the one who rescued you she watched this sink in from the cabin hes who drove you to the hospital that dork the same but why how he saw you abducted he was able to get you out no one knows this by the way he might be hurt or even killed if word got out so im trusting you on this kira nodded i understand i promise she looked around the room in an effort to avoid fiona i just dont get it taylor crabtree hes had a rough time of it lousy family scene tough conditions has found his way into a lot of trouble i know all about it a friend of mine was at the alternative school with him he works at elbies down in hailey youre thinking some kind of reward arent you maybe not quite that obvious a letter from your father would do a lot a job thats better than changing tires something to give him a leg up then again maybe its not appropriate i felt obliged to let you know about his role in it maybe i shouldnt have lets leave it at that i am not writing a thankyou note you do or dont do whatever you feel is appropriate he actually got me out of wherever they had me he did and youre sure it wasnt him that we are fiona answered alone yes taylor crabtree the word hero is tossed around a lot the real heroes are often the most unlikely he saved my life we dont know that oh my god anyway i should be going its good to see you up and around you did this just because you felt sorry for him i did it because i had to because guys like taylor crabtree are often seriously misunderstood and i know my attitude toward him changed a lot when i heard what he did i had formed a pretty strong impression of him because of a previous situation the webcam stuff no before that actually and this being a small town and all a person like you could help turn opinion aroundamong his friends i mean not now of course but maybe when its all over when will it be over fiona said nothing for me kira said it feels like itll never be over its early yet but honestly thats the kind of thing a counselor can help a lot with youd know all about it would you kira said sharply fiona waited until the girl dared to meet her eyes it took a long minute then she said equally firmly i was in a very destructive relationship before i moved here i went through some of what you went through but without the drugs i came here today in part because no one ever came to me no one ever knew what was going on what was happening i needed someone to talk to but i was too scared i thought it would change peoples opinion of me lose me my friends ruin everything and then one day i realized i was ruined beyond anything mere opinion could change and i took action i promised myself that if i ever even thought someone was going through what i went through i would intervene i would do something i dont know exactly why i came here you dont need me but maybe i need you i needed to tell you it gets better a little better day by day kira was crying now her head hanging her hair falling forward you feel it was somehow your fault a way you acted something you wore that you asked for it but thats bullshit and im here to tell you that you have to push those voices from your head kira was sobbing now i feel so dirty talk to someone kira its so much better if you talk to someone the head bobbed fiona breathed differently kira was the first person with whom shed shared any of this it came as a huge relief and terrified her at the same time some secrets were more dangerous than others you waited to tell me kira said why why didnt you just tell me this first im still scared of him of the truth of men dont think you can do this by yourself memory or no memory you can get better faster if you let someone in fiona stood will you come back if you want me to kira looked up her eyes wet i think id like that fiona forced a smile me too be seeing you then briefly walt was without concern sitting in the pilots seat of the glider had this effect on him gave him a sense of quiet and peace but then a flurry of radio traffic brought him back first brandon complaining about the updrafts then the pilot of the towplane doublechecking the release point as both pilots attempted to measure winds aloft by checking their heading against their actual track over land walt asked to be hauled farther north he was cautioned against this delay by the tow pilot daylight was bleeding out of the sky forming a gray haze below and making what promised to be a challenging landing all the more difficult walt wanted the straightest approach possible he consulted a handheld aviation gps premarked with the latlong identified by crabtree he had one shot at the snowfield a half mile behind the compound it would be an ugly landing at best if he missed the field entirely there would be no second chances it was all trees and mountains past that one fielda jewel of flat in a narrow valley situated between the tall spines of two ranges he hadnt told brandon any of this only that they were using the glider to approach silently eighteen deputized men were by now waiting on the far side of two different passes some of whom had begun to advance on foot the rest would follow by snowmobile on walts command the logistics of the strike were as complex as they were dangerous a week of preparation would have been preferable to a matter of hours i think im going to barf brandon said from the seat behind theres a bag in the seat pocket just remember to remove the oxygen mask walt smiled some things were worth the wait his radio crackled and a male voice called out his tail numbers walt confirmed the man introduced himself as a friend from the east reminding walt that they were on an open radio frequency that could be monitored by pilots and ground stations alike fbi walt thought we have confirmed heat signatures the voice said walt processed the information the fbi had tasked a satellite capable of infrared and had obtained a heat signature from the compound it was active not shuttered for the winter people were down there three bogies the voice said good odds walt thought roger that walt said thanks was that what i think it was a distraught brandon inquired were going in walt said he eased the joystick forward and the nose of the glider tilted almost imperceptibly he had one chance at a landing in the dark in the mountains when i say brace for impact walt schooled lean forward and clutch your chest to your thighs dont attempt to look out or sit up until weve come to a complete stop its going to be a hard landing why does that not sound promising brandon interrupted himself with another spout of vomiting were going in walt said the annoying and alltoo familiar sound of a snowmobile roused mark aker from a deep and unintended sleep even as he drew himself from his slumber he could tell the vehicle was moving toward him not away his back was to the hibernating bear the cave no longer smelled bad to him which informed him hed been there a long time and had slept much longer than hed intended the bear had wedged itself into the caves extreme recess with little space between the rock root and caked mud that it was backed up against mark lay in front of the bear facing the mouth of the cave his watch face had lost its luminescence he had no idea what time it was but was guessing evening he was hungry and thirsty and had to relieve himself but didnt dare move for fear of disturbing the bear the experience of cozying up to a hibernating bear might have once been a grad school dream of his now it seemed surreal he wouldnt have believed such a story if hed heard it himself and yet here he was dogs barking the snowmobile had gone silent what he heard now sent a chill through him for he knew roy coats owned and trained hunting dogs scent dogs dogs that could follow a mountain lioness for miles daysinto the wilderness the handler tracked and followed the dogs by radio collar to the prey which was typically pinned up a tree mark was now convinced that he was the prey he was the one pinned the barking grew louder and more ferocious the dogs were on a scenthis scent more than likely and whereas a human being on a snowmobile might not make anything of a dark shadow that turned out to be a cave entrance the dogs would follow their noses straight to it mark had been around animals all his adult life as a vet in idaho hed seen cases that would have never made it into medical school textbooks and would not have been believed if they had he was more exposed to animals in the wild or the results of confrontations with such animals than an average vet and because of this he could foresee the events of the next few minutes they played out before his eyes on the darkened walls of the cave as if a projector were running and he didnt like what he saw as if reading his thoughts the bear stirred as the barking drew closer mark had a decision to make and neither choice was viable if he stayed where he was the bear would shred him when coming awake if he fled the dogs would either tear him to pieces or tree him but if he could climb over the bear getting away from the animals keen sense of smell then the noise and the scent of the dogs might hold the waking bears attention the hungover animal would be far from alert as it awakened bears did not see well with the bear facing the mouth of the cave mark thought it just might work what the animal first saw and heard as it awakened would become its focus the barking incredibly close now lifted the hairs on the nape of marks neck the dogs were charging up the hill coming right for him the glider was too low but there was nothing to do about it now with no source of thrust only the wind and its forward momentum kept it aloft the lower he flew the darker it got hed circled once above the narrow field just to the north of the small frozen river spiraling down toward the treetops over a sea of graygreen spires accented by the white carpet at their feet it felt as if a cloak had been thrown over the narrow valley the sun had left here hours before and where the sky still glowed a pale blue the earth beneath it was giving up on twilight there was no such thing as a missed approach no second chances at a landing he got one chance and this was it as he reached the near side of the field walt eased the joystick back lifting the nose while avoiding a complete stall for a moment the glider seemed to stand still its tail actually brushing the very tops of the tall pines what was that brandon panicked as the sound of the contact reverberated through the frail frame walts focus remained on the field before him a gray wash of indiscernible length its surface impossible to read if he judged this wrong the beauty of the glider landing in snow was that theres no superstructure supporting the wheels a glider lands on a very small nosewheel recessed in the frame and an even smaller wheel below the tail meaning it is well streamlined for a landing in snow brace yourself he called out walt held the nose up as long as possible then eased the glider down into the snow with a lunge that rapped both their heads against the plexiglas dome his feet automatically pushed both pedals forward attempting to brake but it was his right hand on the joystick controlling the flaps that served that purpose snow streamed over the nose blinding him the right wing struck something turning the glider sharply the glider bounced and groaned and barely slowed walt convinced its light frame would come apart it submarined and then jumped up actually lifting fully off the snow before smashing back down and finally grinding to a stop you okay walt said shit shit shit brandon managed from behind him walt shut down the electronics he had no idea how theyd ever get the glider out of there but that was the least of his worries he popped open the dome checked his gps and handsignaled brandon toward the far side of the field brandon gave him a thumbsup and climbed out the two men separated without a word walt dug into his pack for the night vision headset though not fond of the technology he appreciated the results he could see far more clearly and much farther the electronic landscape black and an eerie green but vivid for now he wore the contraption not thrilled with the way it limited peripheral vision it took him a moment to distinguish what he heard not coyote not wolf but a dogs barking maybe two well away to his leftsouth quite possibly across the river then another sound snowmobile had his own guys jumped the gun and raided the cabin ahead of his signal if mark aker was indeed out there his life had just been put in great jeopardy then a second thought flashed through his mind had roy coats somehow seen the glider or been warned in advance of the raid trudging on snowshoes walt hurried in the general direction of the cabin ignoring the barking for now if mark was being held in the cabin then the existence of the snowmobile meant one less man to guard mark he would cut around to the east of the compound leaving brandon to approach from the northwest careful not to fall he picked up his pace believing time was suddenly in his favor brandon moved cautiously the landscape ahead of him green and black through the night vision goggles a slight glow of greenish white in the sky ahead suggested the cabinthe exhaust from a woodstove more than likely but judging distance accurately was difficult and though hed trained with the goggles he had no idea if that glow was a hundred feet away or five hundred yards worse the forest was immature a victim of a massive forest fire a decade earlier resulting in a mixture of towering dead tree trunks and a dense undergrowth of twentyfoot pines bramble and piles of decomposing slash from the earlier fire finding a way through it was challenging due to the thick undergrowth had it not been for the gps brandon would have lost his way instead he found himself forced to take a long way around to the cabin because of a spine of rocky hill that separated the cabin from the field where theyd landed the glider his trailing leg felt the tension though too late the snowshoe had caught on something looking down he saw the trip wire pull free and go slack he quickly took five long strides and dove into the snow covering his head expecting an antipersonnel mine to blow he waited for a count of five then ten no explosion so the trip wire was a perimeter warning device hed just officially entered the compound and now due to his stupidity they knew he was here he placed his glove to his throat and squeezed initiating radio contact with the sheriff i tripped a wire he said the radios were digital there was no way any communication between the task force would be intercepted roger that the sheriffs voice calm and collected ive got some highlights at tree level three hundred yards northnortheast of my position the sheriff said confirming hed seen them too northnorthwest for me he said checking the gps so weve got good angles find some high ground or some place defensible let them come to you stay in radio com if you hear them coming let me know ill create a diversion and bring in backup keep em guessing roger that no heroics out brandon said he felt lousy for tripping that wire the sheriff might feel obligated now to bring in the others their arrival would make akers situation all the more tenuous the purpose of brandon and walt advancing the raid was to capitalize on the element of surprise they had to squeeze the cabin from two directions to be effective there was no way he was letting up his end he wasnt one to go against orders but he did so now knowing full well the sheriff wasnt going to wait he wasnt going to let him go in there alone the prey returns the narrators voice said inside the head of roy coats as he saw the led flash on the wallmounted box indicating a perimeter breach a hunters patience is his greatest asset he wanted this to be fun he leaned forward and grabbed for the walkietalkie his leg stung and he worried hed busted open the scab again the damn thing wouldnt stop bleeding newbs area threes been tripped looks like the docs coming back home for some reprovisioning im on it newbs reported let me know when you have him starved and dehydrated the prey returns to camp driven by the uncanny will to survive having foraged for nearly two days he sees the camp as his only hope and reluctantly returns to his keeper but the hunter is aware of the return his patience has paid off he will be only too happy to welcome him back for all his study all the reading hed done mark aker was shocked to witness firsthand how a beareven a drugged bearcould come out of hibernation so quickly as the bear sat up aker slipped farther down behind it so that had the creature lay back down it would have crushed him the bear fixed its attention on the mouth of the cave and the barking just beyond a dog had reached the entrance jutting its snarling snout in and out of the cave teeth glaring while held back by the caves pungent odors the dogs persuasive survival instincts the blinding darkness prevented aker from actually seeing the bear glance back toward him but there was a moments hesitation followed by the sound of the animals sniffing when aker knew hed been found out the bear had definitely smelled him but distracted by the dogs ferocity had turned in that direction then light caught the top of the cavea flashlightsilhouetting the massive bear as it charged and swiped the dog yipped and howled the beam of the flashlight wavered shit he heard a man shout also incredibly close a single gunshot rang out followed by the mans sickening wail as the bear lunged farther from the cave another cry more desperate coats or gearbox had followed the dog too closely had approached the cave too quickly had been stunned to discover a bear instead of the escaped veterinarian as the bear broke out of the cave aker followed closely the mangearbox judging by his sizehad dropped the flashlight it was bloodcovered the bear was lumbering off in the direction of the road far faster than his simple movement implied but too drugged or wounded to pursue with much enthusiasm the dog was gored at the neck lying in the snow the blood surrounding the fallen flashlight was not the dogs the quantity of spilled blood implied the bear had gotten a fair piece of gearbox as well weak with fatigue and hunger and stiff from his lack of movement aker picked up the flashlight and trained it on the dog then in the direction of the noises the bear was still in pursuit of gearbox who was himself surprisingly fast and able on snowshoes if aker had any chance to get away it was now the bear might have been wounded by the gunshot but if so it had only made it more angry aker looked down at the wounded dog again and found himself unable to leave it there to bleed out and die he bent down hoisted the dog over his shoulders and holding the animals legs around his neck made his way through the closeset rocks knowing the terrain would discourage the bear from following all the bear wanted was some sleep in a moment the snow would get too deep for just his boots twenty yards from the cave he realized he had no snowshoes but he was not about to turn back the bear would return at some point the drugs contributing to its bad temper for now he wanted to put as much distance between himself and the cave as possible he heard the sound of a snowmobiles engine turn over again and then it caught and roared like a motorcycle he switched off his flashlight not wanting to reveal his location the headlight from the snowmobile swept through the woods and illuminated the side of the hill aker stood stone still the snowmobile made a half circle and then accelerated into the darkness its engines highpitched whine receding along with it walt came upon the snowmobile track at nearly the same instant he heard the single report of a powerful rifle adrenaline charged his system the way only gunfire can his hand went to his pistol as he moved in the direction of the sound a pair of lights flared in his goggles a good distance away he could not put together what was going on but hoped brandon was not the target of that report his fears were settled by brandon s voice in his ear your twenty brandon s voice said on a snowmobile track still north of the cabin the gunfire was several hundred yards northeast of me ive got a possible heat signature from the snowmobile hold your position yeah walt knew that tone your twenty i didnt exactly hold position i should be closing in on the cabin shortly those were orders i wasnt going to hang you out to dry sheriff besides i had to shut down any chance of a getaway we reviewed all this stuff that was prior to the trip wire it is what it is was that shot thrown at you doubtful not at me hear this deputy hold your position ill get back to you out walt saw a second hotter flare of light through the goggles and when coupled immediately with the sound of a snowmobile starting he understood what had to be done he jumped off the track threw his pack on the ground and unclipped the eightyfoot climbing rope from it the rope was gray with a red twist which required him to bury it after tossing a decent length across the track he moved fluidly and efficiently living for such moments for he was briefly free of all else no thought entered his mind that didnt directly have to do with stopping the snowmobile it was its own weird kind of ballet police work a combination of efficiency and purpose walt secured the bulk end of the climbing rope to a tree punched the slack rope down into the soft snow as he crossed the track and reached the other side charged with excitement the engine sound told him the snowmobile was quickly approaching he would have one chance he took a full wrap around the thick tree trunk with the loose end of the climbing rope drew in the slack to where the rope barely lifted out of the snow impression a few feet from the tree trunk the snowmobiles headlight glanced the surrounding branches as if setting them all afire walt could barely breathe his mouth had gone dry his eyes stung he carefully lifted the night vision goggles so the headlight wouldnt blind him it took several seconds for his vision to adjust and in those several seconds the snowmobile raced closer there was little time to think this through hed acted on instinct alone he made one last adjustment to the loop of rope around the tree hed rather catch the driver than the vehicle the white light filtered down through the branches and onto the dull bark of the tree trunks as the whine of the twocylinder engine grew progressively louder there it was weaving through the forested obstacle course a single blinding headlight walt couldnt make out the driver or the snowmobile only its penetrating bright light and then it was upon him all at once as if it had jumped a hundred feet ahead he waited waited then pulled hard on the trailing end of rope hand over hand the rope popped out and lifted from where hed buried it in the snow and formed a taut slanting line leading from the opposite tree across the track and directly to walt it struck the snowmobiles plexiglas screen was lifted higher by the contact and caught the driver in the throat the snowmobile shot out into the woods as its driver did a full backflip landing on his head he punched through the tracks packed snow buried up to the middle of his chest walt drew his weapon and hurried to the man he pulled him from the snow only to find his neck broken his head at an unnatural angle more surprising was the quantity of sticky blood it wasnt until walt found his flashlight that he saw the lacerationscougar bearacross the mans shoulder and chest deep gashes the flesh of his chest ripped from his ribs how hed managed to drive a snowmobile in that condition not only impressed walt but warned him coats and his posse were tough walt caught up to the snowmobile inspected it righted it dug it out of a snowbank and used its engine to help lift it back to the track he climbed on called out on his radio so brandon could hear im on the snowmobile please copy im riding the snowmobile into the compound he waited for the acknowledgment waited some more brandon copy brandon no reply alpha walt called out over the airwaves alpha came a male voice he identified as andy cargill give me five minutes if i havent checked in contact beta and delta and begin your advance on the compound the team leader acknowledged now all that stood between walt and the compound were a few hundred yards of snow brandon picked up a white glow of a heat signature in his goggles and ducked behind a tree human not elk or deer close fifty yards or less the shape was coming straight for him moving with a surprising quickness given the deep snow brandon quietly slipped the m assault rifle in front of him he set the trigger to fire in threeround bursts and touched his chest subconsciously to remind himself the vest was in place his heart sped out of control and while he was hungry for a firefight he was also terrified aker a male voice cried out from across the field brandon couldnt believe the man had called out ive got the wrong end of a thirtyaughtsix aimed at that tree youre hiding behind the sheriffs voice interrupted and brandon yanked out the earpiece i know youre there and you know youre there so why dont you come out and show yourself id really rather not shoot you but i will if i have to weve got food and water and the cabins warm i know youre there and i know what you want so what do you say mark aker had escaped it was the only explanation the information so surprised brandon that he gasped then tried to process what the hell was going on im not showing myself until you do aker and if you dont come out from back there right now then im going to have to make you and id rather not do that brandon considered his options for the moment he retained the element of surprise the longer he dragged this out the worse his position but was the man wearing night vision goggles if so hed spot brandon s weapon and start firing was he too wearing a vest how good a shot was he how powerful was the flashlight he must be carrying he tried to lose the snowshoes but he was strapped into them and they werent coming off hed have to bend over to unstrap them and that would mean exposing himself beyond the protection of the tree unless he turned his back to the tree to lessen his profile he quickly swatted and loosened the straps of both snowshoes and stepped out he had to make himself shorter by sinking into the snowhe had six inches on mark aker he slipped the m around his back so that only its strap would show with his feet on firm ground he had a practiced move a perfected movea sudden twistthat could throw the rifle around his body and into his grip but in snow and with bulky clothing in the way he wasnt sure he could pull it off he stuffed the gloves into his pockets wearing only thin liners his hands were shaking either from the cold or from nerves he had to regain control adrenaline had gotten the better of him aker dont be stupid called out the voice closer the man had moved nearer twenty thirty yards away brandon guessed then well beyond the man the distant whine of a snowmobile it took a second or two to determine it was drawing closer water brandon croaked at the man he was ready now he had only to step out into the clear and yet every aspect of his training forbade him from doing so i told you the voice answered we got water and food warmth a woodstove hot coffee all you got to do is show yourself come on knowing he might get popped brandon took a deep breath and stepped out from behind the tree walt steered the snowmobile to follow the existing track passing a pair of trees where the trip wire had been taken down and pulled to the side an extension of the same perimeter warning system that brandon claimed to have tripped passing this point he crossed into the enemy camp driving onehanded his other hand held the m hidden behind the snowmobiles front panel he slowed the track curved to the right and rose to meet what was likely a dirt road in the summer this road showed much more travel than the track hed just been on reminding him how outnumbered he likely was bracing the weapon at his side barrel out and ready he slowed even more as he caught sight of a cabin in his headlight behind it two possibly more outbuildings smoke rose from a stovepipe in the roof three windowstwo in front one on the sidebled a pale yellow light hed so prepared himself for a conflict that he nearly fired on what turned out to be nothing more than a shadow cast by his own headlight he stopped and shut off the snowmobile and spun a full circle as he climbed off fully expecting to see a muzzle flash he shook off his nerves as he realized that the snowmobiles return must have been expected it was the only explanation he could come up with to explain the lack of a reception he darted off into shadow the only light the pale wash from the cabin he crept closer the night vision goggles raised onto his forehead eyes flickering in every direction he singleclicked his radio com his earpiece sounded with three distinct clicks silence then four clicks walt tried again a single click silence followed by three and then four clicks two clicks was brandon still not reporting three and four were alpha and beta brandon was awol injured captured or dead he ducked low and crept forward in a long strong shadow cast by a wall of the cabin he reached near enough to see a window shade was not just pulled down but sealedwith velcroto the sill and jamb it was a patch job and a small amount of light escaped the effort accounting for the dim yellow glow he forced himself to breathe he didnt want to attempt taking the cabin without brandon without some backup but brandon s silence necessitated action with his back to the cabinpossibly only a matter of inches away from mark akerwalt slipped quietly toward the front wondering what would come next roy coats attempted to sort out the events of the past few minutes his mind racing he had little to go on beyond a single gunshot and minutes later the tripping of the perimeter wire had he checked with gearbox after hearing that gunshot he couldnt remember his brain had just about lost its wheels the pain too great he squinted and tried to recall what had happened he remembered speaking with newbs about the perimeter wire and just now the snowmobilethat would be gearboxhad returned to camp there was a loud uninterrupted ticking going on in his head the top of his mouth itched he had to relieve himself had he talked to gearbox or not he picked up the walkietalkie and called out for his man waited no answer came why such a long time between the return of the snowmobile and gearbox knocking on the door gearbox coats shouted loudly enough for his voice to carry through the walls get your ass in here and explain his command was cut off by the sputter of semiautomatic weapons fire two hundred yards coats processed the most important part of that information semiautomatic their aks had been customized by rupert folkes in jerome to be singleshot and full automatic they werent rigged as semiautomatics at the same moment the doorknob turned without knocking his guys were trained to show him the respect of announcing themselves coats snatched the off the table and delivered three rounds into the cabin door before the damn pistol jammed pissed off at the selfloads he hurled the gun across the room at the door before instantly regretting his action he looked around for another weapon the smell of cordite filled his nostrils blood trickled from the broken scab as he stood painfully from the chair another quick burst of semiautomatic fire the camp was under attack one of brandons alltime favorite movie scenes was in indiana jones where harrison ford faced with a swordwielding egyptian simply ignores the flamboyant swordplay pulls out his sidearm and shoots him stepping out from behind the tree hands in the air he waited for the man shouting at him to show himself once he did so brandon gave it all of about five seconds before lunging to his left with a hip check the momentum from which carried the m around his body and straight into his open hands he squeezed off a semiautomatic burstthree roundsand watched the guys kneecaps explode the guy went down like a folding chair his weapon flying out of his hands and catching on a branch stump sticking out from the trunk of the tree hed used as shelter the gun strap caught under his chin and snapped his head back as he fell so that he bobbed like a puppet his obliterated knees folded so that he looked like both legs had been crudely amputated the gun then disengaged from the branch stump and the man fell facefirst into the snow which swallowed him like seafoam brandon saw all this dimly in the haze of a partial moon knowing enough to make for cover as the rifle dropped down into the snow and on top of the man brandon dove the fallen man fired at him brandon returned two more quick bursts and got lucky a piece of the mans head took off like a frightened bird the dead guy his skull open sat up on the injured knees waved his hands frantically like a drowning man searching for a rope then fell forward again before brandon could get off another shot brandon came to standing in the lee of a wide fir lowered the night vision goggles and confirmed the kill ugly his hands were trembling he felt frightfully cold all of a sudden just then he heard three pops from the direction of the compound fortyfive magnum it wasnt the sheriffs gun walt lay flat on his back his chest hot with searing pain two of the three shots had scored the third had narrowly missed so close to his left ear that hed heard its whistle keeping the gun aimed at the cabin door he wiggled off his left glove and felt for his chest his fingers worming into a hole in the kevlar vest where the bullet was still warm the other was embedded in his radio the pain when he breathed was unrelenting due to a cracked rib and it took him a moment to fully understandto believehe wasnt on his way out then he rolled and pushed himself up to standing knowing what it felt like to be hit by a bus keeping the thicker logs that formed the cabin wall between himself and the shooter he ducked and twisted the doorknob and threw the door open sheriff he announced where the hell was brandon now in the very far distance came the mosquito buzz of approaching snowmobiles both teams were converging on the compound from a mile out walt struggled for breath every movement caused blinding pain he stood banged off the door throwing it fully open to make sure no one was hiding behind it and then pushed himself into the doorway fell to his knees and rocked forward his gun gripped in both hands clear the was on the floor to his right he grabbed it ejected the magazine and tossed both halves out the door into the snow he used the furniture as screens flipping the only table and hiding behind it then working past the woodstove to the only doorway trying to draw a deep breath and then regretting it for the agony it caused he turned the doorknob tested the door swung it open a bunk room two bunk beds meeting in the near corner no closets clothes on hooks on the wall clear open window the blind undulating in waves still in motion walt poked his head out the window then quickly back inside right left clear he followed out the window a confusion of tracks in the snow but one line of tracks called to him above all others leading directly to a shed fifteen yards behind the cabin the right leg was wounded and trailing badly dragging behind the left leg doing all the work walt thought this explained why the shootercoatshad not rushed the cabins front door to finish the kill walt pulled down the night vision goggles and the landscape before him came alive in monochromatic green and black but it was as if someone had turned on a searchlight he could see not only the shed and the corral next to it but well beyond to a stack of chopped wood his weapon extended his arm braced and steadied he punched his way through the thick snow toward the shed the beat of his heart painful in his bruised chest where was mark did they have him in the shed had coats moved toward his bargaining chip a sound from behind turned him he dropped to one knee swung the gun around and took aim the figure stood over six feet tall with shoulders as wide as a truck walt blinked and he eased his finger off the trigger a bear a big bear raised onto its hind legs ten fifteen yards even through the goggles walt saw the foaming saliva spilling from its mouth an angry bear a mad bear and then the dark spot on its shoulder a wounded bear he could try to kill the bear though it would take most of the contents of his magazine and the bear would likely maul him before actually succumbing it took a perfect heart shot to drop a bear walt had heard stories of direct hits to the skull that glanced off without effect he turned and ran for the shed he didnt need a rearview mirror to know the bear was following at a gallop he blew through the shed door and slammed it shut turning and once again dropping to one knee the eerie black and green played out through the goggles depicting a garage and slaughterhouse in one it was cluttered with tools and sacks tires and lumber an enormous dead cow hung from a block and tackle its long black tongue swollen and drooping toward a dirt floor where a slimy mass of afterbirth and a fetal calf lay cut open and splayed the smell was suffocatingnot even the cold could freeze out death the entire wall shook behind him as the bear collided past the hanging cow was an old tractor or truck on blocks reduced to a steel skeleton and surrounded by parts he heard the wheeze of his own painful breathing and then another crash as the bear bid for entry the thing hit the door so hard that a shovel fell from the wall and clanged into some fuel canisters then silence the front half of the rectangular shed was clear meaning if coats was in here he was hiding back amid the remains of the tractor walt stood and moved carefully forward keeping his back to the wall staying as close to it as possible without getting his feet caught in the tangle of clutter several seconds had passed without an effort from the bear but walt found himself stealing glances in that direction where the door hardware was now splintered and partially torn from the jamb he crept a few more paces forward in the churchlike silence glass shattered behind him walt turned in the spray and squeezed off two shots expecting to see coats but it was the bears giant mitt that swiped at him through the broken window five grotesque claws tearing through walts shoulder and into his muscle walt fell into the dead cow starting it swinging slipped in the slime on the floor and scrambled quickly to his feet by the time he did there was no sign of the bear only two splintered holes in the log wall where his wild shots had landed the chain holding the swinging dead cow creaked like a clock slowly winding down he briefly lifted the goggles wishing he could do without them but the difference was astonishing the shed held only a faint glow of moonlight back in the world of green and black he moved cautiously toward the tractor stepping toward the center of the room to avoid a pile of clutter he stood there panting from the rush of the bear attack his shoulder throbbing working the goggles left to right searching out the hidden recesses and hiding places while anticipating a surprise attack behind him the swinging cow slowly twisted and spun as its metronomic ticktocking wound down unseen by walt the crude knife slice running down the center of the gutted animal twitched open and a human hand slipped out then another this one bearing a bloodied meat hook the gap widened to reveal the feverish face of roy coats walt heard the icy crack of the cow carcass opening and spun the meat hook sank into his right hand his gun dropped his body followed the sinking weight of the hook as he screamed the goggles bounced off his head he crashed onto the dirt floor his bruised chest sending shock waves of pain racing through his body coats struggled to free the hook but it had penetrated the meat of walts hand and did not come loose the two men were briefly connected by the hook coats unwilling to let it go walt unable to shake it loose walt on his knees punched out with his left hand and hit something spongy the man wailed and released the meat hook walt grabbed hold of the hook gritted his teeth and pulled it free with his left hand he sank the hook into coatss chest just as the man raised his head his left arm was not nearly as strong or coordinated as his right and though the hook hit coats it did little more than graze him walt punched the mans leg in the same spot again and then kicked up as coats craned forward he caught the mans chin and heard the cracking of teeth coats somehow had the hook now he swung out at walt who scrambled backone swipe twonarrowly missing him walt collided with a pile of junk and here came the hook again he blocked it with a length of pipe seized from the pile the hook came free walt smashed the pipe into the mans ankle and coats screamed again the shack shook it sounded like an earthquake walt saw the gun five feet to his left he dove for it coats threw a knee into walts face stumbled forward and inadvertently kicked the gun away it disappeared in the darkness into a pile of debris along the wall walt scrambled to his knees swinging the pipe and connecting again then he pulled himself to his feet coats backed up away from the pipe his right leg dragging awkwardly walt staggered forward barely conscious his right arm and hand useless coats snagged a fallen shovel and swung it madly into walts left side the blow knocked walt into the hanging cow and he spun to fend off the next attack the shovel glanced off the frozen cadaver the door broke from its hinges and crashed to the floorfirst a rectangle of moonlight which was then blotted out by the massive presence that filled it the bear charged the first thing it saw roy coats the shovel was lifted high but fell to the floor handle first the blow never delivered walt heard the tear of clothing followed quickly by the bubbling slobber of coats attempting to cry out but his cheek was no longer part of his face and his left eye was missing walt knew better than to run for the door he didnt want the bear substituting him for his present target hands on the cow he realized where to hide and pulled himself into the frozen womb the sounds of terror continuing in a relentless stream until roy coats was silenced forever and the bear wandered off and out as fifteen of the backup deputies searched for mark aker he stumbled into camp of his own accord walts wounds were being tended to in the cabin as word arrived sheriff brandon said from the doorway in a voice so urgent that walt jumped up as one of his team attended his hand brandon led walt around to the side of the cabin and whispered he was just standing there mark aker was in fact standing between the shed and the woodpile in two feet of snow an animal draped over his shoulders and held by its feet around his neck a dog walt saw on closer inspection i approached brandon informed him but he stepped back saying your name over and over hes in shock or worse mark walt called out its me sheriff walt fleming aker called out again as if he hadnt heard he took another step back your flashlight walt said to brandon shine it on me as the light struck walt revealing a scarred and battered man aker started walking toward him walt held a hand out stopping brandon from meeting him mark was clearly in shock or had hypothermia skittish and unpredictable aker fell to his knees a few feet from walt at least that was what walt thought in fact aker had only gone to his knees to unload the dog with the dog now in his arms he stood with difficulty and passed it to brandon he turned and faced walt what took you so long the cabins warm we have a medic walt motioned toward the cabin coats dead you found the test tube aker was moving toward the cabin now brandon stood there holding the dog wondering what to do with it i could have used a note along with it walt said needed to buy myself time his voice was distant walt realized they were losing him as they led him inside the cabin aker began to shiver uncontrollably in waves that bordered on seizures the medic began an iv as they undressed him and wrapped him in wool blankets forty minutes later he and walt were life flighted out and flown to boise for medical attention aker slipped into unconsciousness on the way and could not be revived he remained in a coma for three days when miraculouslyor so the doctors saidhe sat up fully alert walt never left the mans bedside running his office and writing reports from room it wasnt until aker regained consciousness that they were finally able to contact his family all of whom had been holed up in a holiday inn in ogden utah on akers orders they might have arrived sooner had the press gotten hold of the story but not a sentence had beenor would bewritten about the events of the past weeks a task force of federal agencies had descended upon all concerned to debrief walt and his team requiring their signatures on nondisclosure agreements the rights of a few for the good of the many walt thought a cover story was invented for mark aker that involved his familys desire for privacy and his fathers fictional heart condition the efficiency and thoroughness of the government surprised everyone involved even danny cutter had been silenced by its efforts not an easy task three weeks later the first rumors began to circulate around the valley walt declined comment but knew the stories had helped with his reelection on a wintry halloween night in hailey limping and unable to use his right hand he accompanied gail escorting the girls as they went house to house in town while the girls waited in line at a busy house gail spoke to him for the first time since hello if you want them back of course i do walt said he knew it would come to this gail had never been comfortable as a mother the excuses would follow next i may have overreacted she said the girls returned displaying their goodies emily got a chocolate bunny she was especially proud of walt wondered if it was left over from easter and wanted a look at it they walked as a family down the street to the next house walt marveling how uncomfortable he felt in gails company the girls hurried to the next door i dont like who youve become he said i know i dont want the divorce to screw up the girls i seem to screw them up without even trying why i cant do this i have no idea she looked across the street where there was nothing to see but it kept her face averted quite a pair he said we arent a pair she corrected then she apologized they need us both he said we need to work this out i dont know what you want me to say id rather we work it out than the lawyers i dont want lawyers deciding whats right for the girls gail didnt say anything saved again by the arrival of the girls the trickortreating continued for another fortyfive minutes snippets of conversation passed between them but none with any content the mention of lawyers had broken the spell or theyd simply run out of things to say over a decade spent together and they couldnt find five minutes of things to talk about the girls looked anxiously at walt then followed their mother to her car but she stopped them withdrawing a small overnight bag and handing it to walt emilys eyes brightened nikki took her fathers hand gail stared dully at the three of them forced a grimace of a smile and kissing the girls climbed behind the wheel when walt got home he put the girls to bed taking extra time to read to them wishing he didnt have to turn off the light returning to his own bedroom he stopped and looked around he emptied her closet set four black garbage bags of clothes out on the back porch but that barely scratched the surface he took off his wedding ring and put it in a drawer with some cuff links he never used he drank two beers in front of the television and fell asleep in the chair the drive up to hillabrands mountaintop estate reminded walt again of the mans power and position of the enormous wealth in sun valley and how carefully one had to tread he was greeted by an aide and shown inside exceptionally aware that sean lunn was nowhere to be seen hillabrand met him in the living room with its panoramic views of ketchum and sun valley hed lost his tan replaced by a gray pallor you look better than id have expected walt lied looks can be deceiving ive seen the worst of it it was only the one glass after all im told my liver will scar and ill pay for it later in life for now they say im recovering though it doesnt feel like it i was wrong to put you in that position thats what i came to say yes you were so its done yes it is thats all i had walt turned to leave hillabrand stopped him you ignored james peavys warning why was that i dont know i guess it egged me on more than discouraged me it led to the discovery of the sheep pit im trained as an investigator what can i say people like coats we cant let five or ten people have that kind of effect on our country that has nothing to do with democracy its vile and wrong where does warning innocent people about contaminated water come into play walt asked i know you dont believe it but we had that pretty well under control if you tested it now you wouldnt find a trace of that spill in the aquifer we were buying time trilogy springs that was an oversight a costly oversight a mistake that cost us dearly i dont have any excuses for it i thought i had you walt admitted it never for a minute occurred to me the inl could possibly be the victim the real victims were the ranchers hillabrand said they were willing to stay quiet to benefit their country they were willing to stay quiet because you paid them to walt said and theres the rub hows that you and a couple of others in washington convinced yourselves that what you were doing was for the good of the country yes and your point walt hesitated and looked around the sumptuous room with its stunning views what makes you any different than them the samakinn werent they doing the exact same thing hillabrand began to speak but bit back his words then he said but were the good guys walt slipped the dvd out of his pocket and placed it down are you so sure i want you to watch this i want you to look real closely at the guy with coats the guy doing the girl ill expect sean lunn to turn himself in to me within twentyfour hours if he doesnt then its a manhunt and i will personally see that this entire story gets into the papers nda or no nda ill take my chances hillabrand handled the dvd flipping it over he looked into walts fierce expression okay he said ill look at it walt thought about that a man with enough power to make a suspect simply walk through his office door coats worked for lunn walt said lunn hired him to take down mark aker and find out what mark knew when that went bad they targeted marks assistant walt pointed to the dvd as if hillabrand could see poor kira tulivich at some point coats turned against him seeing mark as an asset to his own cause but dont you see what that means hillabrands face went red his neck veins bulging no sheriff what does it mean if coats worked for lunn then he worked for you walt said it was your money hillabrand rolled his eyes trying to dodge the accusation if sean lunn did as you say it was without my knowledge he went rogue he probably thought he could earn points with me by handling this himself it happens i would never condone such methods not ever that may or may not be true walt said the courts will sort it out but given the events exactly how does that make you the good guys he turned and left hillabrand in the living room in the middle of his private panorama the indicting dvd pinched between his fingers she agreed to meet on her terms she chose a bench on the snowcovered bike path overlooking a turn in the big wood river behind them the traffic on highway hummed a little loudly for the picturesque setting they sat shoulder to shoulder closer than hed expected some mallards came and went on the river below their wings etching vs on the darkly moving water hate me he asked this isnt seventh grade walt for some of us it still is i there are things i visited kira and it brought up some stuff i wasnt using you and your relationship with hillabrand i know what you thought but it wasnt true when you mentioned it it made some sense but that wasnt how it was to begin with i want us to be able to work together of course his voice cracked belying his attempts to keep his feelings out of this her words sounded so final thank you what about a dinner sometime he added quickly if it was seventh grade it would have been a movie or an icecream cone at least give me some credit being your photographer is good i like the work a lot are you seeing someone she watched a great blue heron fly the length of the river until it was nothing but a speck there was someone she said before i moved here two nearly three years ago now it wasnt good i ran away by coming here all it took was talking to kira to remind me which is a long way of saying a cup of coffee sure a movie maybe but not dinner not for a long time not with you not with anyone a persons got to move on remind me of that after your divorce is final he drew in a breath of sharp cold air out of bounds she said that was awful of me im so sorry thats just it you see i dont even know myself when you get to know you he said youll find you like you a lot he added i do some wounds heal from the outside in and some from the inside out who said that walt asked i just did a fly fisherman came around the corner of the river in his waders he worked the far snowcovered bank his casts a thing of beauty freaks walt said arent we all she asked yeah i suppose so they talked for a while about the confiscation of her photographs and computer and how she still had the images from the glider on an sd card in her camera they weighed the rights of the individual versus the rights of a democracy and argued semantics for a while it was the arguing that made walt feel better there was comfort in disagreement so none of this ever happened she said after a long bout of silence thats what i hear he added only i didnt hear it from you she smiled he warmed up a little the fisherman caught something they heard his cheer well up the ridge where they sat the fisherman extracted the catch from his net and turned it loose back into the river catch and release walt said i guess now i understand it a little bit better than i did before before what she asked then she gave him a look exactly he said note the governments inl experimental nuclear facility has existed in central idaho under a variety of names for the past fifty years the atomic submarine engine was developed there as was the worlds first nucleargenerated electricity there is a cold fusion experimental lab active today at the facility over two dozen reactors have been opened and closed over the years no civilians know exactly how many reactors remain operational or how the decommissioned reactors rate in terms of safety requirements
