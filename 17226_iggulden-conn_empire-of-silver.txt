empire of silver conn iggulden prologue he trudged through a landscape of gers like grubby shells on the shore of some ancient sea poverty was all around him in the yellowing felt patched and repaired endlessly over generations scrawny kid goats and sheep ran bleating around his feet as he approached his home batu stumbled over the animals cursing as water slopped from the heavy buckets he could smell pungent urine in the air a sourness that had been missing from the breeze over the river batu frowned to himself at the thought of the day he had spent digging a toilet pit for his mother he had been as excited as a child when he showed the results of his labour she had merely shrugged saying she was too old to go so far in the night when good ground was all around her she was thirtysix years old already broken by sickness and the years passing her teeth had rotted in her lower jaw and she walked like a woman twice her age bent over and limping yet she was still strong enough to slap him on the rare occasions batu mentioned his father the last time had been just that morning before he began the trek to the river at the door of her ger he eased the buckets down and rubbed his sore hands listening inside he could hear her humming some old song from her youth and he smiled her anger would have vanished as quickly as always he was not afraid of her in the last year he had grown in height and strength to the point where he could have stopped every blow but he did not he bore them without understanding her bitterness he knew he could have held her hands but he did not want to see her weep or worse to see her beg or barter a skin of airag to ease her misery he hated those times when she used the drink to hammer herself into oblivion she told him then that he had his fathers face and that she could not bear to look at him there had been many days when he had cleaned her himself her arms flopping over his back her flat breasts against his chest as he used a cloth and bucket to scrub the filth from her skin he had sworn many times he would never touch airag himself her example made even the smell of it hard on his stomach when its sweetness was combined with vomit sweat and urine it made him retch batu looked up when he heard the horses grateful for anything that would keep him outside a little longer the group of riders was small by the standards of a tuman barely twenty horsemen to a boy brought up on the edges of the camp it was a glorious sight for a morning a different world the warriors rode with very straight backs and from a distance they seemed to radiate strength and authority batu envied them even as he ached to be one of their number like any other boy of the gers he knew that their red and black armour meant they were ogedais own guard the elite warriors of the tumans stories of their battles were sung or chanted on feast days as well as darker tales of betrayal and blood batu winced at the thought his father featured in some of those which prompted sidelong glances at his mother and her bastard son batu hawked and spat on the ground at his feet he could still remember when his mothers ger had been of the finest white felt and gifts had arrived almost daily he supposed she had once been beautiful her skin fresh with youth where now it was seamed and coarse those had been different days before his father had betrayed the khan and been butchered for it like a lamb in the snow jochi he spat again at the word the name if his father had bent to the will of the great khan batu thought he might have been one of the warriors in red and black riding tall among the filthy gers instead he was forgotten and his mother wept whenever he talked of joining a tuman almost all the young men of his age had joined except for those with injuries or defects of birth his friend zan was one a mixblood chin who had been born with a sightless white eye no oneeyed man could ever be an archer and the warriors had turned him away with kicks and laughter telling him to tend his flocks batu had drunk airag for the first time with him that night and been sick for two days the recruiters had not come for him either not with the betrayers blood running in his veins batu had seen them out looking for strong lads but when their gaze passed over him they shrugged and turned away he was as tall and strong as his father had been but they did not want him with a shock batu realised the riders were not passing through he watched as they stopped to speak to one of his mothers neighbours and he took a sharp breath in amazement as the old man pointed in batus direction the horsemen trotted towards him and he stood rooted watching as they came closer he found he did not know what to do with his hands and folded them over his chest twice before letting them dangle from inside the ger he heard his mother calling some question but he did not reply he could not he had seen the man riding at the head of the group there were no pictures in the poor gers though one or two chin paintings had found their way into the homes of the wealthiest families yet batu had seen his fathers brother once on a feast day years before he had crept up close peering between warriors for a sight of the great khan ogedai and jochi had been with genghis then and time had not faded the bright memory among the most bittersweet in all his young years it had been a glimpse of the life he might have had before his father threw it all away for some petty squabble batu did not even understand ogedai rode bareheaded in armour lacquered shining black he wore his hair in the chin style as a heavy rope falling from a topknot on a bare shaved scalp batu drank in every detail of the man as his mothers voice called plaintively again from inside he could see that the great khans son was looking directly at him and speaking but batu was tonguetied dumb the yellow eyes were bright up close and he was lost in the realisation that he was staring at his uncle by blood is he slowwitted one of the warriors said batu shut his open mouth my lord ogedai is speaking to you boy are you deaf batu found himself flushing with great heat he shook his head suddenly irritated to have such men ride up to his mothers ger what would they think of the patched walls the smell the flies in the air it was humiliating and his shock turned quickly to anger even then he did not reply men like these had killed his father his mother said the life of a ragged son would mean little to them have you no voice at all ogedai said he was smiling at something and batu responded crookedly i have he said he saw one of the warriors reach down but he did not expect a blow and he staggered a step as a mailed glove connected with the side of his head i have my lord the warrior said without heat batu shrugged as he straightened up his ear was burning but hed known worse i have a voice my lord he said doing his best to remember the warriors face ogedai discussed him as if he wasnt present it wasnt just a story then i can see my brother in his face and hes already as tall as my father how old are you boy batu stood very still trying to collect himself some part of him had always wondered if his mother had been exaggerating his fathers position to have it confirmed so casually was more than he could take in fifteen years he said he saw the warrior begin to lean forward again and added my lord quickly the warrior leaned back in his saddle and nodded to him complacently ogedai frowned youre old to be starting out training should begin at seven or eight at the latest if youre ever to draw a good bow he saw batus confusion and smiled pleased to be able to do such a thing still i will be watching you report to general jebe tomorrow he has his camp about a hundred miles to the north near a village by a cliff you can find it i have no horse my lord batu said ogedai glanced at the warrior who had struck him and the man raised his eyes to heaven before dismounting he passed the reins into batus hands can you ride at least the warrior said batu was awed as he took the reins and patted the muscular neck he had never touched an animal as fine yes yes i can ride good this mare is not your horse understand she will carry you to your post but then you will take some old swayback and return her to me i dont know your name batu said alkhun boy ask anyone in karakorum and theyll know me the city batu asked he had heard of the stone thing rising from the soil on the back of a million workers but until then he had not believed it more a camp than a city at the moment though that is changing alkhun confirmed you can send the horse by the way station riders but tell them to go easy with her ill take any whip marks out of your hide oh and welcome to the army boy my lord ogedai has plans for you dont disappoint him part one ad chapter one the air swirled with marble dust that glittered as it caught the evening sun ogedais heart was full as he guided his horse down the main thoroughfare taking in every sight and sound around him there was a sense of urgency in the cacophony of hammer blows and shouted orders the mongol tumans had gathered outside the city his generals his people had been summoned there to see what two years of labour had created a city in a wilderness with the orkhon river tamed and bent to his will ogedai reined in for a moment to watch a group of workmen unload a cart nervous under his gaze the labourers used ropes pulleys and sheer numbers to manoeuvre blocks of white marble onto low sledges that could be dragged into the workshops each milky block was subtly veined in a light blue that pleased ogedai he owned the quarry that had birthed the stones hundreds of miles to the east just one of a thousand purchases he had made in the last years there was no doubt he had been extravagant spending gold and silver as if it had no value he smiled at the thought wondering what his father would have made of the white city rising in the wilderness genghis had despised the anthills of humanity but these were not the ancient stones and teeming streets of an enemy this was new and it belonged to the nation there had never been a treasury like the one he had inherited amassed from the wealth of china and khwarezm yet never spent by its khan with the tribute from yenking alone ogedai could have sheathed every new home in white marble or even jade if he had wanted he had built a monument to his father on the plains as well as a place where he himself could be khan he had built a palace with a tower that rose above the city like a white sword so that all men could see the nation had come far from simple gers and herds for his gold a million men had come to work they had crossed plains and deserts with just a few animals and tools coming from as far off as chin lands or the cities of samarkand bukhara and kabul masons and carpenters from koryo had made the journey called to the west by rumours of a new city being built on a river of coins bulgars brought stocks of rare clays charcoal and hardwood in great caravans from their forests the city filled with traders builders potters foodsellers thieves and scoundrels farmers scenting a profit brought their carts for days of travel all for the strings of metal coins ogedai gave them gold and silver from the earth melted and shaped in return they gave him a city and he did not find it a bad bargain for the present they were the colourful crowds of his city speaking a hundred tongues and cooking a thousand different foods and spices some of them would be allowed to stay but he was not building it for them ogedai saw greenhanded dyers flatten themselves against the walls their red turbans dipping in respect his guards cleared the way ahead so the son of genghis could ride almost in a dream he had made this place from the camp of gers his father had known he had made it real in stone it still amazed him he had not paid for women to travel with his workers but they had come with their husbands and fathers he had wondered for a time how he would establish the businesses every city needed to thrive but traders had approached his chancellor offering horses or more silver to lease new properties the city was more than a simple collection of houses already it had a vitality of its own far beyond his control yet not completely a quirk in the plans had created an area of small alleyways in the south of his city criminal gangs had begun to flourish there until ogedai heard he had ordered eight hundred buildings torn down the whole area redesigned and rebuilt his own guard had supervised the hangings the street fell quiet as he passed the labourers and their masters bowing their heads as they saw the man who held the power of life and death and gold over all of them ogedai took a deep breath of the dusty air enjoying the taste of it on his tongue and the thought that he was literally breathing in his creation ahead he could see the towers of his palace crowned in a dome of gold beaten thinner than the paper of his scribes it raised his spirits to see it like sunlight trapped and held in his city the street widened as it grew before him its stone gutters polished that section had been finished months before and the bustling crowds of labourers fell behind as ogedai trotted on he could not help glancing at the boundary walls that had so confused his chin architects and labourers even from the low vantage point of a saddle there were moments when he could see over them to the green plains beyond the walls of yenking had not saved that city from fire or siege he knew his walls were the warriors of the khan the tribes who had brought a chin emperor to his knees and razed a shahs cities already ogedai loved his creation from the vast expanse of the central training ground to the redtiled roofs the paved gutters the temples and churches and mosques and markets and homes by the thousand most still empty and waiting for life scraps of blue cloth fluttered in the plains wind on every corner a tribute to the sky father above them all in the south green foothills and mountains stretched far away and the air was warm with dust as ogedai rejoiced in karakorum the twilight was deepening into a soft gloom as ogedai handed his reins to a servant and strode up the steps to his palace before he entered he looked back once more at the city straining to be born he could smell freshturned earth and over it the fried food of the workmen on the evening air he had not planned the herds of livestock in corrals beyond the walls or the squawking chickens sold on every corner he thought of the wool market that had sprung up by the western gate he should not have expected trade to halt simply because the city was unfinished he had chosen a spot on an ancient traders road to give it life and life had begun pouring in while whole streets whole districts were still piles of lumber tile and stone as he looked into the setting sun he smiled at the cooking fires on the plains surrounding the city his people waited there for him his armies would be fed on rich mutton dripping fat from the summer grass it reminded him of his own hunger and he moistened his lips as he passed through a stone gate the equal of anything in a chin city in the echoing hall beyond he paused for a moment at his most extravagant gesture a tree of solid silver stretched gracefully up to the arched ceiling the centre point open to the sky like the ger of any herdsman it had taken the silversmiths of samarkand almost a year to cast and polish but it served his purpose whoever entered his palace would see it and be staggered at the wealth it represented some would see an emblem for the silver people the mongol tribes who had become a nation those with more wisdom would see that the mongols cared so little for silver that they used it as a casting metal ogedai let his hand slide down the bole of the tree feeling the metal chill his fingers the spreading branches reached out in a parody of life gleaming like a white birch in moonlight ogedai nodded to himself he stretched his back as lamps were lit by slaves and servants all around him throwing black shadows and making the evening seem suddenly darker outside he heard hurrying footsteps and saw his manservant barasaghur approaching ogedai winced at the mans keen expression and the bundle of papers under his arm after i have eaten baras it has been a long day very well my lord but you have a visitor your uncle shall i tell him to wait on your pleasure ogedai paused in the act of unbuckling his sword belt all three of his uncles had come to the plains around karakorum at his order gathering their tumans in great camps he had forbidden them all from entering the city and he wondered who would have disobeyed him he suspected it would be khasar who regarded orders and laws as tools for other men rather than himself who is it baras ogedai asked quietly lord temuge master i have sent servants to tend him but he has been waiting now for a long time barasaghur made a gesture to indicate a sweep of the sun in the sky and ogedai pursed his lips in irritation his fathers brother would be well aware of the nuances of hospitality simply by arriving when ogedai was not there to greet him he had created an obligation ogedai assumed it was deliberate a man like temuge was too subtle not to grasp the slightest advantage yet the order had gone out for the generals and princes to remain on the plains ogedai sighed for two years he had readied karakorum to be the jewel in an empire his had been a splendid isolation and he had manoeuvred to keep it so his enemies and friends always off balance he had known it could not last for ever he steeled himself as he walked after barasaghur to the first and most sumptuous of his audience rooms have wine brought to me immediately baras and food something simple such as the warriors are eating on the plain your will my lord his servant said without listening his thoughts on the meeting to come the footsteps of the two men were loud in the silent halls clicking and echoing back to them ogedai did not glance at the painted scenes that usually gave him so much pleasure he and barasaghur walked under the best work of islamic artists and it was only towards the end that ogedai looked up at a blaze of colour smiling to himself at the image of genghis leading a charge at the badgers mouth pass the artist had asked a fortune for a years work but ogedai had doubled his price when he saw it his father still lived on those walls as well as in his memory there was no art of painting in the tribes he knew and such things could still make him gasp and stand in awe with temuge waiting however ogedai barely nodded to his fathers image before he was sweeping into the room the years had not been kind to his fathers brother temuge had once been as fat as a feasting calf but then lost the weight rapidly so that his throat sagged into flaps of skin and he looked far older than his years ogedai looked at his uncle coldly as he rose from a silkcovered chair to greet him it was an effort to be courteous to a man who represented the end of his time apart he had no illusions the nation waited impatiently for him and temuge was just the first to breach his defences you are looking well ogedai temuge said he came forward as if he might embrace his nephew and ogedai struggled with a spasm of irritation he turned away to baras letting his uncle drop his rising arms unseen wine and food baras will you stand there staring like a sheep my lord barasaghur replied bowing immediately i will have a scribe sent to you to record the meeting he left at a run and both men could hear the slaves sandals clattering into the distance temuge frowned delicately this is not a formal visit ogedai for scribes and records you are here as my uncle then not because the tribes have selected you to approach me not because my scholar uncle is the one man whom all the factions trust enough to speak to me temuge flushed at the tone and the accuracy of the remarks he had to assume ogedai had as many spies in the great camps as he had himself that was one thing the nation had learned from the chin he tried to judge his nephews mood but it was no easy task ogedai had not even offered him salt tea temuge swallowed drily as he tried to interpret the level of censure and irritation in the younger man you know the armies talk of nothing else ogedai temuge took a deep breath to steady his nerves under ogedais pale yellow eyes he could not shake the idea that he was reporting to some echo of genghis his nephew was softer in body than the great khan but there was a coldness in him that unnerved temuge sweat broke out on his forehead for two years you have ignored your fathers empire temuge began do you think that is what i have done ogedai interrupted temuge stared at him what else am i to think you left the families and tumans in the field then built a city while they herded sheep for two years ogedai he lowered his voice almost to a whisper there are some who say your mind has broken with grief for your father ogedai smiled bitterly to himself even the mention of his father was like tearing the scab off a wound he knew every one of the rumours he had started some of them himself to keep his enemies jumping at shadows yet he was the chosen heir of genghis the first khan of the nation the warriors had almost deified his father and ogedai was certain he had nothing to fear from mere gossip in the camps his relatives were a different matter the door swung open to reveal barasaghur and a dozen chin servants in moments they had surrounded the two men placing bronze cups and food on crisp white cloth before them ogedai gestured for his uncle to sit crosslegged on the tiled floor watching with interest as the older mans knees creaked and made him wince barasaghur sent the servants away and then served tea to temuge who accepted the bowl in relief with his right hand sipping as formally as he would have in any ger of the plains ogedai watched eagerly as red wine gurgled into his own cup he emptied it quickly and held it out before barasaghur could move away ogedai saw his uncles gaze flicker over the scribe barasaghur had summoned standing in a respectful attitude against the wall he knew temuge understood the power of the written word as well as anyone it had been he who had collected the stories of genghis and the founding of a nation ogedai owned one of the first volumes copied carefully and bound in hardwearing goatskin it was among his most prized possessions yet there were times when a man preferred not to be recorded give us privacy baras ogedai said leave the jug but take your scribe with you his manservant was too well trained to hesitate and it was but moments until the two men were alone once again ogedai drained his cup and belched why have you come to me tonight uncle in a month you can enter karakorum freely with thousands of our people for a feast and a festival they will talk of for years temuge studied the younger man before him the unlined face looked weary and stern ogedai had chosen a strange burden for himself with this city temuge knew there were only a handful of men in the camps who cared more than a bronze coin for karakorum to the mongol generals who had known genghis it was a colossal conceit of white marble and chin design temuge wished he could tell the young man how much he loved the creation without it seeming like greasy flattery yet he did love it it was the city he had once dreamed of building a place of wide streets and courtyards and even a library with thousands of clean oak shelves lying empty for the treasures they would one day hold you are not a fool ogedai temuge said it was not by chance that your father chose you over older brothers ogedai looked up sharply and temuge nodded to him at times i wonder if you are a strategist like general tsubodai for two years the nation has been without a leader without a path yet there has been no civil war no struggle between princes perhaps they saw my personal tuman riding among them my scribes and spies ogedai replied softly there were always men in red and black watching them for treachery temuge snorted it was not fear but confusion that held them they could not see your plan so they did nothing you are your fathers heir but you did not call them to take the oath no one understands it so they wait and watch they still wait to see what you will do next temuge saw ogedais mouth twitch as if he wanted to smile he longed to know his nephews mind but with this new generation who knew how they thought you have built your city on the plains ogedai the armies have gathered at your call but now they are here and many of them have seen this glorious place for the first time do you expect them simply to bend the knee and give their oath because you are your fathers son he has other surviving sons ogedai have you considered them at all ogedai smiled at his uncle amused at the way the man seemed to be trying to pierce his secrets with his gaze there was one he would not find no matter how closely he peered he felt the wine spread its glow inside him easing his pain like a caress if that was my intention uncle to win two years of peace for myself and build a city well i have done it have i not perhaps that is all i wanted temuge spread his hands you do not trust me he said genuine hurt in his voice ogedai chuckled as much as i trust anyone i promise you a clever answer temuge said coldly well you are a clever man its what you deserve ogedai snapped all the lightness had gone from his manner as he leaned forward imperceptibly his uncle eased himself back at the new moon ogedai went on i will take the khans oath of every officer and prince of the blood in the nation i do not have to explain myself uncle they will bend the knee to me not because i am my fathers son but because i am my fathers chosen heir and the leader of the nation he caught himself as if he was about to say too much and temuge watched a shutter drop over his emotions here was one son who had learned the cold face early you did not tell me why you came to me tonight uncle ogedai went on temuge let out a sigh knowing the moment had slipped away i came to make sure you understood the danger ogedai you are frightening me ogedai said with a smile temuge flushed i am not threatening you where can this terrible danger spring from then in my city of cities you mock me though i travelled here to help you and to see this thing you have built it is beautiful is it not ogedai said it is wonderful temuge said with such transparent honesty that ogedai looked more thoughtfully at his uncle in truth ogedai said i have been considering the need for a man to oversee my library here to collect scrolls from all corners of the world until men of learning everywhere know the name of karakorum it is a foolish dream perhaps temuge hesitated the idea was thrilling to him but he was suspicious are you still mocking me he said softly ogedai shrugged only when you blow like an old sheep with your warnings will you tell me to watch my food for poison i wonder he saw temuges face grow mottled as his peevishness resurfaced and he smiled it is a real offer any other man in the tribes can herd sheep and goats only you could herd scholars i think you will make karakorum famous i want it to be known from sea to sea if you set such a value on my wits then ogedai temuge said you will listen to me this once ogedai sighed speak then uncle if you feel you must he said for two years the world has waited for you no one has dared to move a soldier for fear they would be the first example you made even the chin and the sung have been quiet they have been like deer who smell a tiger somewhere close that has come to an end you have summoned the armies of the nation and a month from now if you live you will be khan if i live ogedai said where are your guards now ogedai you have called them back and no one feels their suspicious eyes riding through the camps did you think it would be easy if you fell from a roof tonight and broke your head on all this stone who would be khan at the new moon my brother chagatai has the best claim ogedai said lightly unless my son guyuk is allowed to live tolui too is in the line of my father he has sons grown strong mongke and kublai arikboke and hulegu in time they could all be khans he smiled amused at something temuge could not see the seed of genghis is strong it seems we all have sons but we still look to tsubodai whoever has my fathers unbeatable general will carry the army dont you think without him it would be civil war is that all those with power i have not mentioned my grandmother her teeth and eyes are gone now but she can still be fearsome when roused temuge stared at him i hope your actions are not as careless as your words double your personal guard at least ogedai ogedai nodded he didnt bother to mention that the ornate walls concealed watching men two different crossbows were centred on temuges chest at that very moment it would take only a particular gesture with ogedais hand for his uncle to be ripped from life i have heard you i will consider what you have said perhaps you should not take on the role in my library and university until the new moon has come and gone if i do not survive it my successor may not have such an interest in karakorum he saw the words sink in and knew that at least one of the men of power would be working to keep him alive all men had a price but it was almost never gold i must sleep now uncle ogedai said every day is full of plans and work he paused in the moment of rising and went on i will tell you this much i have not been deaf or blind these last years my fathers nation has ceased to conquer for a time but what of that the nation has been fed on milk and blood ready to be sent out into the world with fresh strength and i have built my city do not fear for me uncle i know everything i need to know of the generals and their loyalties he came to his feet with the suppleness of youth while his uncle had to accept his outstretched hand and winced as his knees cracked aloud i think your father would be proud of you ogedai temuge said to his surprise ogedai chuckled i doubt it i have taken jochis bastard son and made him a prince and a minghaan officer i will raise batu further still to honour my brothers memory genghis would never forgive me for that he smiled at the thought and he would not have loved my karakorum of that i am certain he called for barasaghur to lead temuge out of the dark city back to the stifling air of treachery and suspicion that was so thick in the great camps ogedai picked up his jug and cup filling the goblet once again as he walked to a stone balcony and looked out at the moonlit streets there was a breeze blowing cooling his skin as he stood there with his eyes shut his heart ached in his chest and he gripped his arm as the pain spread he felt fresh sweat break out as his veins throbbed and pulsed at frightening speed soaring for moments until he felt dizzy he reached out blindly and held the stone sill breathing slowly and deeply until the weakness left him and his heart beat slowly once again a great pressure released in his head and the flashing lights dwindled to mere points shadows that only he could see he looked up at the cold stars his expression bitter below his feet another chamber had been cut from the stones at times when the pains came with a force that left him trembling and weak he had not expected even to finish it yet he had his tomb was ready and he still lived cup by cup he emptied the jug until his senses swam how long do i have left he whispered drunkenly to himself is it days now or years he imagined he talked to the spirit of his father and waved the cup as he spoke spilling some wine i was at peace father at peace when i thought my time was at an end what did i care for your generals and theirpetty struggles yet my city has risen and the nation has come and i am still here what do i do now he listened for an answer in the darkness but there was nothing chapter two tolui stroked his wifes damp hair idly as he lay back and watched his four sons whoop and splash in the waters of the orkhon the sun was warm as they lay there and only the presence of his guards nearby prevented complete relaxation tolui grimaced at the thought there was no peace to be had in the camp with every man wondering whether he was a supporter of chagatai or ogedai or the generals or perhaps one who would inform for any of them at times he wished his two older brothers would settle it somewhere quiet so that he could enjoy being alive on such a day with a beautiful woman in his arms and four healthy sons pleading to be allowed to swim over a waterfall he had forbidden it once but he saw that kublai had dared mongke once again and the two of them were creeping closer and closer to the bank where a goat path led up to the source of the roaring river tolui watched from under halfclosed lids as the two older boys glanced guiltily at their parents hoping they were asleep in the warm sun arikboke and hulegu were in on it of course their bony boys frames almost shaking with excitement do you see them sorhatani murmured tolui smiled i am halftempted to let them try it they swim like otters both of them it was still a new skill to tribes raised on grassy plains for those who learned to ride before they could speak the rivers were the source of life for the herds or an obstacle when they were swollen in floods only recently had they become a source of pleasure to the children of the tribe you wont be the one who has to soothe their wounds when they take the skin off their backs sorhatani said relaxing into him or splint their bones yet she said nothing as mongke suddenly darted for the track his naked body gleaming kublai shot a last sharp look at his parents but neither moved and in an instant he was off as well tolui and sorhatani both sat up as soon as the boys were out of sight they exchanged a private look of amusement as arikboke and hulegu craned to see the top of the plunging falls above i dont know who is worse mongke or kublai sorhatani said pulling a grass stalk and chewing the end he chuckled and they both said kublai together mongke reminds me of my father tolui said a little wistfully he fears nothing sorhatani snorted softly then you will remember what your father once said when he had to choose between two men to lead a thousand i was there woman tolui said his mind leaping to her point he said ussutai feared nothing and felt no hunger or thirst that was why he was unfit to command your father was wise a man needs to feel a little fear tolui if only to have the pride of conquering it a wild shout made them both look up as mongke came over the falls yelling in excitement as he managed a crude dive and plunged into the pool at its foot the drop was little more than ten feet but to a boy of eleven it must have been terrifying tolui relaxed and chuckled as he saw his oldest son surface blowing and gasping his teeth very white against his sunbrowned skin arikboke and hulegu cheered their voices high as they looked up again for kublai he came over backwards in a tumble of limbs moving so fast that he left the torrent of water and fell through empty air tolui winced at the flat smack that carried clearly across the water he watched as the other three looked for him calling and pointing to each other sorhatani felt her husbands arms tense as he prepared to leap up but then kublai surfaced roaring his entire body was flushed red on one side and he limped as he climbed out but they could see he was panting with exhilaration ill have to beat some sense into them tolui said his wife shrugged ill get them dressed and send them to you he nodded only halfaware that he had waited for her approval to punish the boys sorhatani smiled at him as he walked away he was a good man she thought not perhaps the strongest of his brothers nor the most ruthless but in all other ways the best of the sons of genghis as she stood and gathered the clothes her sons had left on every bush around them she recalled the one man who had made her afraid in her life she cherished the memory of the time when genghis had looked on her as a woman rather than just the wife of one of his sons it had been on the shore of a lake thousands of miles away in a different land she had seen the khans eyes brighten at her youth and beauty just for an instant she had smiled at him then terrified and awed now there was a man she murmured to herself shaking her head with a smile khasar stood on the wooden base of the cart leaning back against the white felt of the khans ger it was twice as wide and half as high again as the homes of their people and genghis had used it for meeting his generals ogedai had never claimed the enormous construction so heavy that the cart had to be pulled by six oxen after the death of the great khan it had sat empty for months before khasar made it his own as yet no one had dared to dispute his right to it khasar smelled the fried marmot meat kachiun had brought for the midday meal lets eat outside its too fine a day to sit in the gloom he said as well as the steaming platter kachiun carried a fat skin of airag which he tossed to his brother where are the others he said placing the platter on the edge of the boards and sitting with his legs swinging khasar shrugged jebe said he would be here i sent a messenger to jelme and tsubodai theyll come or they wont its up to them kachiun blew air from his lips in irritation he should have passed on the messages himself to be sure his brother didnt forget or use the wrong words there was no point in berating the man who was digging his fingers into the pile of steaming scraps khasar didnt change and it was both infuriating and comforting at times hes nearly finished that city of his khasar said chewing strangelooking place with those low walls i could ride right over them i think that is his point kachiun replied he took a pouch of unleavened bread from another pot waving his hand to clear the steam as he filled it with meat khasar looked baffled and kachiun sighed we are the walls brother he wants people to see that he does not have to hide behind stones like the chin do you understand the tumans of our army are the walls clever khasar said munching but hell build walls eventually you watch give him a year or two and hell be adding stones cities make you afraid kachiun stared at his brother wondering if he had managed a bit of real wisdom khasar noticed his sudden interest and grinned youve seen it if a man has gold he lives with the terror that someone will take it away from him so he builds walls around it then everyone knows where the gold is so they come and take it thats the way it always goes brother fools and gold together i never know if you think like a child or a very wise man kachiun said filling another pouch and chewing khasar tried to say wise man around a large mouthful and choked so that kachiun had to pound him on his back they had been friends for a very long time khasar wiped tears from his eyes and took a deep breath and a swig of airag from the bulging skin hell need walls at the new moon i should think automatically kachiun looked to see if anyone could overhear them they were surrounded by empty grass with just their two ponies grazing nearby beyond them warriors were busy in the sun preparing for the great competition ogedai had promised there would be prizes of grey horses and armour for wrestlers and archers even for those who won foot races across the plains everywhere they looked men were training in groups but there was no one loitering too close kachiun relaxed you have heard something nothing but only a fool would expect the oathtaking to go without a hitch ogedais not a fool and hes not a coward he faced me when i was running wild after he hesitated and his eyes grew distant and cold for a moment after genghis died he took another swig of the harsh spirit if hed taken the oaths immediately not a man in the tribes would have dared raise a hand to him but now kachiun nodded grimly now chagatai has come into his strength and half the nation wonders why he isnt going to be khan there will be blood brother one way or another khasar replied i just hope ogedai knows when to be forgiving and when to cut throats he has us kachiun said that is why i wanted to meet here to discuss our plans for seeing him safe as khan i havent been summoned to his white city for my advice kachiun have you you dont know whether he trusts us more than anyone else why should he you could be khan if you wanted you were genghis heir while his sons grew khasar saw his brothers irritation the camp was full of such talk and both men were tired of it but khasar just shrugged better you than chagatai anyway have you seen him out running with his bondsmen so young so virile he leaned over the edge of the cart and spat deliberately on the ground kachiun smiled jealous brother not of him though i do miss being young sometimes now some part of me is always aching old wounds old knees that time when you completely failed to stop me getting speared in my shoulder it all hurts it is better than the alternative kachiun said khasar snorted they looked round as jebe approached with tsubodai both of genghis generals were in their prime and kachiun and khasar shared a glance of private humour at the way they came striding confidently across the summer grass tea in the pot meat in the bowl khasar said without ceremony as they climbed the steps up to the old khans ger we are discussing how to keep ogedai alive long enough for him to carry the white tails the symbol of the united tribes still fluttered above his head horsetails that had once been a riot of tribal colours until genghis had bleached them pale and made them one no one had dared to remove the symbol of power any more than they had queried khasars use of the cart tsubodai made himself comfortable on the wooden edge his feet dangling as he dug into the meat and bread he was aware that both kachiun and khasar were waiting for what he would say he did not enjoy the attention and he ate slowly and cleared his throat with airag in the silence jebe leaned back against the felt wall and looked at the city in the distance a white haze in the warm air he could see the golden dome of ogedais palace and it struck him that it resembled a yellow eye staring out of the city i have been approached jebe said tsubodai stopped chewing and khasar put down the skin of airag as he was about to drink jebe shrugged we knew one of us would be sooner or later it was a stranger to me wearing no marks of rank sent by chagatai kachiun said jebe nodded who else but no names were mentioned they do not trust me it was just a light touch to see which way i would jump tsubodai grimaced you jumped here in full view of the tribes no doubt they are watching you now what of it jebe said bridling i was loyal to genghis do i demand to be known by my birth name as zurgadai i carry the name genghis gave me and i am loyal to the son he named as heir what do i care who sees me talking with his generals tsubodai sighed and put aside the final piece of his meal we know who is most likely to disrupt the oathtaking we do not know how they will do it or how many men will support them if you had come to me quietly jebe i would have told you to agree to anything they say and learn their plans who wants to go creeping about in the dark tsubodai khasar said scornfully he looked to his brother for support but kachiun shook his head tsubodai is right brother this isnt just a matter of showing we support ogedai and all rightthinking men following us i wish it was there was never a khan of the nation before genghis so there are no laws for how he passes on his power the khan makes the laws khasar replied i didnt see anyone complaining when he made us all take an oath to ogedai as heir even chagatai got down on his knees for that because his choice was to fall flat or die tsubodai said now genghis is gone and the men around chagatai are whispering in his ear they are saying the only reason he was not heir was his struggle with his brother jochi but jochi is dead he paused for a moment thinking of the blood that had splashed on snow his face was utterly blank and they could not read him there are no traditions to tell us how to act tsubodai went on wearily yes genghis chose his heir but his mind was clouded with anger over jochi it was not so many years ago that he favoured chagatai over all his brothers the nation talks of nothing else at times i think chagatai could press his claim openly and become khan he could walk right up to ogedai with a sword and fully half the army would not stop him the other half would tear him to shreds khasar said and in a stroke we would have a civil war that would break the nation in two everything genghis built all our strength wasted on an internal struggle how long would it be then before the chin rose against us or the arabs if that is the future i would rather see chagatai take the horsetail banner today tsubodai held up his hand as they began to protest that is not a traitor speaking do not think it have i not shown that i followed genghis even when everything in me cried out that he was wrong i will not fail his memory i will see ogedai as khan on my word once again he thought of a young man who had believed his promise of safe passage tsubodai knew his word was worthless where it had once been iron it was an old grief but on some days he bled as if he had just been cut you had me worried khasar said tsubodai did not smile he was younger than both the brothers but they waited patiently for him to speak he was the great general the master who could plan any attack on any terrain and somehow snatch victory with tsubodai they knew ogedai had a chance kachiun frowned at the thought you should look to your own safety as well tsubodai you are too valuable to lose tsubodai sighed to hear such words while i sit by the ger of my khan yes i will be careful i am an obstacle to the one we all fear you should be sure that your guards are men you trust with your life who cannot be bribed or threatened without them coming to you if a mans wife and children go missing will you still trust him to watch you as you sleep that is an ugly thought jebe said with a wince you truly think we are at that point on such a day i can hardly believe in knives in every shadow if ogedai becomes khan tsubodai went on he could have chagatai killed or simply rule well or badly for forty years chagatai will not wait jebe he will try to arrange a death an accident or he will try to take it by force i cannot see him sitting idly by while his life and ambition is decided by others not the man i know somehow the sun seemed less bright after such cold words where is jelme jebe asked he told me he would be here tsubodai rubbed the back of his neck making it crack he had not slept well for many weeks though he would not mention it to these men jelme is loyal dont worry about him he muttered some of the other men frowned loyal to which son of genghis jebe said there is no clear path in this and if we do not find one the nation could be torn apart then we should kill chagatai khasar said the others grew still and he grinned at them i am too old to be guarding my words he said with a shrug why should he have it all his own way why should i check my personal guards to be sure no one has turned them against me we could end this today and ogedai would be khan at the new moon with no threat of war he saw their cold expressions and spat once again i wont dip my head at your disapproval so dont expect it if you prefer to watch your backs for a month and make secret clever plans that is up to you i could cut right through it and see an end what do you think genghis would say if he were one of us here hed walk right in and cut chagatais throat he might tsubodai admitted who knew better than most how ruthless the khan had been if chagatai was a fool i would agree with you if there could be surprise yes it could work id ask you to test it but youd get yourself killed instead take my word on this chagatai is ready for such a move any group of armed men approaching his tuman is met with bristling weapons and warriors ready to charge he plans murder every day so he fears it as well between us we command enough men to get to him khasar said though less confidently perhaps if only his ten thousand responded we could still reach him but i think it has already gone further than that whatever game ogedai has been playing he has given his brother two years to whisper and make promises without a khans shadow all of us were forced to rule the lands around us to act as if we were the only voice that mattered i found i enjoyed it did you not feel the same tsubodai glanced around at the others and shook his head the nation is falling apart into tribes of tumans bound not by blood but by the generals who lead them no we will not attack chagatai my purpose is to prevent civil war not to be the spark that sets it off khasar had lost his keen look as tsubodai spoke subsiding with an irritated expression then we are back to keeping ogedai alive he said more than that tsubodai replied we are back to keeping enough of a nation intact for him to have something to rule as khan i hope you did not expect me to have an answer on a single day khasar we could win here and see ogedai with the horsetails yet watch as chagatai takes away half the army and half the nation how long would it be then before two khans and their armies were facing each other on a field of war you have made it clear tsubodai kachiun said but we cant just sit and wait for disaster no tsubodai said very well i know enough to trust you jelme is not here because he is meeting two of the generals who may be loyal to chagatai i will know more when i have exchanged messages with him i cannot meet him again and yes khasar this is the sort of secret game you despise the stakes are too high to make a false step perhaps you are right khasar said thoughtfully tsubodai shot a sharp glance at the older man i will also need your word khasar he said on what your word not to act on your own it is true that chagatai runs every day though he does not go far from his warriors there is a small chance you could arrange archers in place to take him from cover but if you failed you would ruin everything your brother worked for everything that cost the lives of so many of those you loved the entire nation would go up in flames khasar khasar gaped at the general who seemed to be reading his very thoughts his guilty expression was there for all to see as he forced the cold face before he could reply tsubodai spoke again your word khasar we want the same thing but i cannot plan around you without knowing what you will do you have it khasar said grimly tsubodai nodded as if it was a minor point in a discussion i will keep you all informed we cannot meet often with the number of spies in the camp so we will send trusted messengers write nothing down and never use the name of chagatai again not after today call him the broken lance if you must speak of him know that we will find a way through tsubodai rose smoothly to his feet and thanked khasar for his hospitality i must leave now to find out what they promised jelme in return for his support he bowed his head and climbed lithely down the steps making khasar and kachiun feel old just to watch be grateful for one thing kachiun said softly watching the general stride away if he wanted to be khan it would be even harder chapter three ogedai stood in shadows at the base of the ramp that led to light and air above the great oval was finished at last the smell of wood paint and varnish strong in the air around him it was easy to imagine the athletes of his people walking out to the roar of thirty thousand men and women ogedai saw it all in his mind and he realised he was feeling better than he had for many days the chin healer had spoken much about the dangers of foxglove powder but ogedai only knew that it eased the constant ache in his chest two days before a sharp pain had driven him to his knees in his private apartments he grimaced at the remembered pressure like being trapped in a small space and unable to open his lungs to air a pinch of the dark powder mixed in red wine had brought release like ropes snapping around his chest he walked with death he was certain of it but it was still two steps behind the builders were leaving the great stadium in their thousands though ogedai barely looked at the river of exhausted faces passing him he knew they had worked all night so he would be satisfied and that was only right he wondered how they felt about the emperor of the chin kneeling to his father if genghis had been forced to such a shame ogedai doubted he could be so calm so accepting genghis had told him that the chin had no concept of nation their ruling elite talked of empires and emperors but the peasants could not stand high enough to see so far instead they found smaller loyalties to cities and local men ogedai nodded to himself it was not so long since the tribes of his people had done the same his father had dragged them all into a new era and many of them still did not understand the breadth of his vision most of the crowd stared at the ground as they walked past terrified of attracting his notice ogedais heart began to beat faster as he saw a different reaction in some of those approaching him he felt the need to walk out of the shadows into light and had to strangle the urge his chest ached but there was none of the terrible weariness that usually dogged him no matter how much he slept instead his senses were alive he could smell and hear everything around him from the garliclaced food of the workmen to the whispered voices the world seemed to strain and then burst leaving him almost dazed ahead of him were men who stared and then deliberately turned away their reaction marking them out like a raised flag ogedai saw no signal but almost as one they drew knives from their clothing short hacking blades of the sort carpenters used to trim posts the crowd began to swirl as more and more people realised what was happening voices cried out hoarsely but ogedai remained very still the centre of the growing storm he had locked eyes with the closest of the men as he shoved his way past others his blade held high ogedai watched the man approach slowly he opened his arms wide then wider his outstretched hands buffeted by the fleeing crowd the attacker shouted something a wild sound lost in the clamour ogedai showed his teeth as the man was struck from the side his body crumpling away from the armoured guard who had hit him as his guards trampled and slaughtered the men in the shadowy tunnel ogedai slowly lowered his arms watching coldly they left two alive as he had ordered clubbing them down with sword hilts until their faces were swollen masks the rest were killed like goats in just moments the first officer stood before him his chest heaving and his pale face spattered with filth lord are you well the man said a study of confusion ogedai turned his gaze away from the soldiers still thumping at the dead flesh of men who had dared to attack their master why would you think otherwise huran i am unharmed you have done your work huran bowed his head and almost turned away but he could not my lord there was no need for this we have followed these men for two days i have searched their lodgings myself and there has never been a moment in karakorum when i did not have eyes on them we could have taken them without any risk to you he was clearly struggling to find the right words but ogedai felt lighter and stronger than he had in too long his mood was mellow as he replied say what you have to say huran you will not offend me he had released the man from any need to guard his speech and he watched the tension and stiffness vanish i live i work to protect you lord huran said on the day you die i die i have sworn it but i cannot protect you if you areif you are in love with death lord if you want to die under ogedais cool gaze huran stumbled over the last words and fell silent put your fears to rest huran you have served me since i was a boy i took risks then did i not like any other lad who thinks he will live for ever huran nodded you did but you would not have stood with your arms wide then not with a killer running at you i saw it lord but i did not understand it ogedai smiled as if instructing a child perhaps it was his closeness to eternity in those moments but he felt almost lightheaded i do not want to die i promise you huran but i am not afraid of it not at all i held open my arms because in that moment i did not care can you understand that no lord huran said ogedai sighed wrinkling his nose at the smell of blood and excrement in the tunnel the air is foul here he said walk out with me he skirted the heaped bodies many had been killed by accident in the fray simple workmen trying to get out of the darkness he would have some payment made to their families he thought huran stayed at his side as the light brightened and ogedais gaze fell on the completed arena his mood soared higher at the sight of the tiered seating thousands upon thousands of benches stretching into the distance after the bloodshed at the entrance it had emptied at astonishing speed so that ogedai could hear the song of a bird in the distance clear and sweet he was tempted to call across the space to see if his voice would echo thirty thousand of his people could sit and watch races and wrestling and the archery wall it would be glorious a spot on his face itched and he rubbed it raising a reddened finger before his eyes someone elses blood here huran in this place i will be khan i will take the oath from my people huran nodded stiffly and ogedai smiled at him knowing his loyalty was absolute yet he did not mention the weakness of the heart that could take his life at any moment he did not tell huran that he woke each morning with sharp relief that he had survived the night to see one more dawn nor how he stayed awake later and later each evening in case that day was his last the wine and the foxglove powder had brought him relief but he knew every day every breath was a blessing how could he fear a killer when he was always in deaths shadow it was amusing and he chuckled until he felt the ache in his chest again he considered taking a pinch of the powder under his tongue huran would not dare ask about it there are three days until the new moon huran you have kept me alive until now have you not how many attacks have you thwarted seven lord huran said softly ogedai looked sharply at him i know of only five including today how do you make seven my man in the kitchens stopped a poisoning this morning lord and i had three warriors of your brother murdered in a brawl you were not certain that they were here to kill me no lord not certain huran admitted he had left one alive and worked on him for part of the morning earning nothing but screaming and insults for his trouble you have been rash huran ogedai said without regret we have planned for such attacks my food is tasted my servants are handpicked my city is under siege from the sheer number of spies and warriors pretending to be simple painters and carpenters yet i have opened karakorum and people are still flooding in i have three chin lords staying in my own palace and two christian monks who have taken a vow of poverty so bed down in the straw of my royal stables the oathtaking will bean interesting time huran he sighed at the soldiers grim worry if all we have done is not enough perhaps i am not meant to survive the sky father loves a good game huran perhaps i will be taken from you despite all your efforts not while i live lord i will call you khan the man spoke with such assurance that ogedai smiled and clapped him on the shoulder escort me back to the palace then huran i must resume my duties after this small amusement i have kept orlok tsubodai waiting long enough i think tsubodai had left his armour in the palace rooms he had been given every warrior in the tribes knew that genghis had once approached an enemy without weapons then used a scale of his armour to cut the mans throat instead tsubodai wore a light deel robe over leggings and sandals they had been laid out for him clean and new of the best materials such luxury in those rooms ogedai had borrowed from every culture they had encountered in conquest it made tsubodai uncomfortable to see it though he could not find words for his discomfort worse was the bustle and hurry of the palace corridors packed with people all intent on errands and work he did not understand he had not realised there were so many involved in the oathtaking there were guards at every corner and alcove but with so many strange faces tsubodai felt a constant itch of worry he preferred open spaces the day had half gone when he grabbed a servant running past him making the man yelp in surprise it seemed ogedai had been busy with some task in the city but he knew tsubodai was waiting tsubodai could not leave without giving insult so he stood in a silent audience room his impatience growing harder to mask as the hours fled the room was empty though tsubodai still felt crawling eyes on him as he strolled to a window and looked over the new city and beyond to the tumans on the plains the sun was setting throwing long lines of gold and shadow on the ground and streets below ogedai had chosen the site well with the mountains to the south and the nearby river wide and strong tsubodai had ridden along part of the canal ogedai had built to bring water into the city it was astonishing until you considered that a million men had worked for almost two years with enough gold and silver anything was possible tsubodai wondered if ogedai would survive to enjoy it he had lost track of time when he heard voices approaching tsubodai watched closely as ogedais guards entered and took positions he felt their gaze pass over him and then settle as the only possible threat in the room ogedai came last his face puffier and far paler than tsubodai remembered it was hard not to remember genghis in those yellow eyes and tsubodai bowed deeply ogedai returned the bow before taking a seat on a wooden bench under the window the wood was polished and golden and he let his hands enjoy the feel of it as he glanced out at karakorum he closed his eyes for a moment as the setting sun cast a last glimpse of gold into the high room he had no love for tsubodai for all he needed him if the general had refused genghis most brutal order ogedais older brother jochi would have been khan long since if tsubodai had stayed his hand disobeyed just once there would be no crisis of leadership heading towards them threatening to destroy them all thank you for waiting i hope my servants have made you comfortable he asked at last tsubodai frowned at the question he had expected the rituals of ger courtesy but ogedais face was open and visibly weary of course lord i need very little he paused as footsteps sounded outside the doors and ogedai rose as new guards entered followed by tolui and his wife sorhatani you are welcome in my home brother ogedai said but i did not expect your beautiful wife to attend me he turned to sorhatani smoothly your children are well they are my lord i brought only mongke and kublai i do not doubt they are causing trouble for your men at this very moment ogedai frowned delicately he had asked for tolui to come to the palace for his own safety he knew of at least two plots that sought to dispose of the younger brother but he had expected to explain in private he glanced at tolui and saw his brothers gaze rise and drop for a moment sorhatani was hard to refuse in anything your other sons they are not with you ogedai said to his brother i have sent them to a cousin he is taking a fishing trip out west for a few months they will miss the oathtaking but i will have them make it good when they return ah ogedai said understanding one pair of sons would survive no matter what happened he wondered if it had been sorhatani who had changed his order for the whole family to appear at the palace perhaps she was right to be less than trusting in such bleak times i have no doubt general tsubodai is bursting with news and dire warnings brother ogedai said you may return to your rooms sorhatani thank you for taking a moment to visit me the dismissal could not be refused and she bowed stiffly ogedai noticed the furious glance she shot at tolui as she turned the gates swung open again and the three men were left alone with eight guards along the walls ogedai gestured to a table and they sat all warier than he could once have believed possible losing patience with it all ogedai clinked cups together and filled each one pushing them towards his guests they reached for them at the same time knowing that to hesitate would show they feared poison ogedai did not give them long emptying his own in three quick gulps you two i trust he said bluntly licking his lips tolui i have stopped one attempt to kill you or your sons tolui narrowed his eyes a fraction growing tense my spies have heard of one other but i do not know who it is and i am out of time i can deal with those who seek my death but i must ask that you stay in the palace i cannot protect you otherwise until i am khan is it so bad then tolui asked astonished he had known the camp was in turmoil but to hear of open attacks had shaken him he wished that sorhatani were there to hear it he would only have to repeat it all later ogedai turned to tsubodai the general sat in simple clothes but he radiated authority ogedai wondered for a moment if it was simply reputation it was difficult not to look on tsubodai with awe if you knew what he had achieved in his life the army owed their success to him as much as to genghis yet for ogedai it was harder not to look on him with hatred he locked it away as he had for more than two years he still needed this man you are loyal tsubodai he said softly to my fathers will at least from your hand i have word of this broken lance each day he hesitated struggling for calm part of him wanted to leave tsubodai outside karakorum on the plains to ignore the strategist his father had valued over all others yet only a fool would waste such a talent even then challenged openly tsubodai had not confirmed he was the source of the messengers who appeared at the palace though ogedai was almost certain i serve lord tsubodai said you had my oath as heir i have not wavered in that for an instant ogedais anger rose in him like a white spike in his head this was the man who had cut jochis throat in the snow sitting there and talking of his oath ogedai took a deep breath tsubodai was too valuable to waste he had to be managed thrown off balance my brother jochi heard your promises did he not he said softly to his pleasure the colour fled from the generals face tsubodai remembered every detail of the meeting with jochi in the northern snows the son of genghis had exchanged his life for his men and their families jochi had known he was going to die but he had expected a chance to speak again to his father tsubodai was too much of a man to quibble over the rights and wrongs of it it felt like a betrayal then and it still did he nodded jerkily i killed him lord it was wrong and i live with it you broke your word tsubodai ogedai pressed leaning across the table his cup fell with a metallic clang and tsubodai reached out and set it upright he would not take less than his full share of blame he could not i did tsubodai replied his eyes blazing with anger or shame then redeem your honour ogedai roared slamming his fists into the table all three cups crashed over spilling wine in a red flood the guards drew swords and tsubodai came to his feet in a jerk half expecting to be attacked he found himself staring down at ogedai still seated the general knelt as suddenly as he had risen ogedai had not known how the death of his brother had troubled tsubodai the general and his father had kept all that between them it was a revelation and he needed time to think about what it meant he spoke instinctively using the mans own chains to bind him redeem your word general by keeping another son of genghis alive long enough to be khan my brothers spirit would not want to see his family torn and abandoned my fathers spirit would not make it so tsubodai and find peace after that i do not care what happens but you will be among the first to take the oath that would be fitting ogedais chest hurt and he could feel sour sweat under his arms and on his brow a great lethargy settled across his shoulders as his heart thumped slower and slower reducing him to dizzy exhaustion he had not slept well for weeks and the constant fear of death was wearing him to a shadow until only his will remained he had shocked those present with his sudden rage but at times he could barely control his temper he had lived under a great weight for too long and sometimes he simply could not remain calm he would be khan if even for just a day his voice was slurred as he spoke both tsubodai and tolui watched him with worried expressions stay here tonight both of you ogedai said there is nowhere safer on the plains or in the city tolui nodded immediately already ensconced in his suite of rooms tsubodai hesitated failing to understand this son of genghis or what drove him he could sense a subtle sadness in ogedai a loneliness for all he was surrounded by a great host tsubodai knew he could serve better on the plains any real threat would come from there from the tuman of chagatai yet he bowed his head to the man who would be khan at sunset of the following day ogedai rubbed his eyes for a moment feeling the dizziness clear he could not tell them that he expected chagatai to be khan after him only the spirits knew how long he had left but he had built his city he had left a mark on the plains and he would be khan in darkness ogedai awoke he was sweating in the warm night and he turned over in bed feeling his wife stir beside him he was drifting back into sleep when he heard a rattle of running footsteps in the distance he came alert instantly raising his head and listening until his neck ached who would be running at such an hour some servant he closed his eyes again and then heard a faint knock at the outer door of his rooms ogedai swore softly and shook his wife by the shoulder get dressed torogene something is happening in recent days huran had begun the habit of sleeping outside the rooms with his back to the outer door the officer knew better than to disturb his master without good reason the knock sounded again as ogedai belted a deel robe he closed the double door on his wife and crossed the outer room padding barefoot past the chin tables and couches there was no moon above the city and the rooms were dark it was easy to imagine assassins in every shadow and ogedai lifted a sword from where it hung on the wall in silence he removed the scabbard and listened at the door somewhere far away he heard a distant scream and he jerked back huran he said through the heavy oak he heard the relief in the mans voice my lord it is safe to open the door huran said ogedai threw back a heavy bolt and lifted an iron bar that anchored the door to the stone wall in his nervous state he had not noticed that the corridor cast no threads of light through the cracks it was darker out there than in his rooms where dim starlight gleamed through the windows huran came in quickly stepping past ogedai to check the rooms behind him tolui ushered in sorhatani and his two eldest sons wrapped in light robes over their sleeping clothes what is happening here ogedai hissed using anger to cover his spreading panic the guards on our door went away tolui said grimly if i hadnt heard them leave i dont know what would have happened ogedai tightened his grip on the sword taking comfort from the weight of it he turned at a spill of light from the inner doorway his wife silhouetted against the lamplight be still torogene i will attend to this he said to his irritation she came out anyway her night robe clutched around her i went to the nearest guardroom tolui went on he glanced at his sons who stood watching in openmouthed excitement they were all dead brother huran grimaced as he peered out into the dark corridors i hate to lock us in my lord but this is the strongest door in the palace you will be safe here tonight ogedai was torn between outrage and caution he knew every stone of the vast building around them he had watched each one cut and shaped and polished and fitted into place yet all his halls all his power and influence would be reduced to just a few rooms when the door closed keep it open as long as you can he said surely there were more of his guards on their way how could such an attempt have slipped past him somewhere nearby they heard more running footsteps the echoes clattering from all directions huran put his shoulder to the door from the blackness a figure loomed suddenly and huran struck with his sword blade grunting as it slid off scaled armour put that away huran a voice came slipping into the room in the dim light ogedai breathed in relief tsubodai what is happening outside the general said nothing he dropped his sword on the stone floor and helped huran bar the door before taking up the blade once again the corridors are full of men theyre searching every room he said if it were not for the fact that they have never been inside your palace before they would be here already how did you get past huran demanded tsubodai scowled in angry memory some of them recognised me but the common warriors have not yet been told to cut me down for all they know i am part of the plot ogedai sagged as he stared round at the small group who had run to his rooms where is my son guyuk he said my daughters tsubodai shook his head i did not see them lord but there is every chance they are safe you are the target tonight no one else tolui winced as he understood he turned to his wife then i have brought you and my sons to the most dangerous place sorhatani reached out to touch his cheek nowhere is safe tonight she said softly they could all hear voices and running feet coming closer outside the city the tumans of the nation slept on oblivious to the threat chapter four kachiun walked his pony across the churned grass of the encampment listening to the sounds of the nation all around him despite the stillness of the night he did not ride alone thirty of his personal bondsmen went with him alert for any attack no one travelled alone in the camps any more not with the new moon almost upon them lamps and mutton fat torches spat and fluttered at every intersection of paths revealing dark groups of warriors watching him as he passed he could hardly believe the current level of suspicion and tension in the camps at three points he was challenged by guards as he approached khasars ger in the night breeze two lamps cast writhing yellow shadows at his feet even as khasar came yawning out onto the cart kachiun could see bows drawn and sighted on him we need to talk brother he said khasar stretched groaning tonight yes tonight kachiun snapped he didnt want to say more with so many listeners nearby for once khasar sensed his mood and nodded without any more argument kachiun watched as his brother whistled softly men in full armour walked in from the outer darkness hands near their swords they ignored kachiun and walked to their general standing close by his feet and looking up at him for orders khasar crouched and murmured to them kachiun mastered his impatience until the men bowed their heads and moved away one of them brought khasars current mount a gelding near black in colour that whickered and kicked out as they saddled it bring your bondsmen brother kachiun said to him khasar peered at him in the dim light seeing the strain in kachiuns face he shrugged and gestured to the officers nearby another forty warriors trotted to his side long woken from sleep by the presence of armed men near their master it seemed that even khasar was taking no chances on those nights while they waited for the new moon dawn was still hours away but with the camp in such a state the movement of so many men woke everyone they passed voices called out around them and somewhere a child began wailing grimfaced kachiun trotted his mount beside his brother silent as they headed towards karakorum torches lit the gates in dim gold that night the walls were pale grey shadows in the darkness but the western gate gleamed oak and iron and clearly shut khasar frowned leaning forward in his saddle to strain his eyes i havent seen it closed before he said over his shoulder without thought he dug in his heels and increased his pace the warriors around him matched him so smoothly it could have been a battlefield manoeuvre the noises of the camp the calling voices all were lost in the thump of hooves the breath of horses the jingle of metal and harness the western gate of karakorum grew before them khasar could now see ranks of men facing outwards as if challenging him this is why i woke you kachiun replied both men were brothers to the great khan uncles to the next they were generals of proven authority their names known to every warrior who fought for the nation when they reached the gate a visible ripple ran through the ranks of men there vanishing into the darkness the bondsmen halted around their masters hands on sword hilts on both sides the men were strung as tightly as their bows kachiun and khasar glanced at each other then dismounted they stood on dusty ground the grass long since worn away by traffic through the gate both men felt the sullen gaze of those who faced them the men at the gate bore no marks of rank no flags or banners to identify them for kachiun and khasar it was as if they looked upon the raiders of their youth with no allegiance to the nation you know me khasar roared suddenly over their heads who dares to stand in my way the closest men jerked under a voice that could carry across battlefields but they did not respond or move i see no signs of tuman or minghaan in your ranks i see no flags just dogmeat wanderers with no master he paused and glared at them i am general khasar borjigin of the wolves of the nation under the great khan you will answer to me tonight some of the men shuffled nervously in the lamplight but they did not flinch from his gaze khasar guessed the best part of three hundred men had been sent to close the gate and no doubt it was the same on the other four walls of karakorum the bondsmen snarling at his back were outnumbered but they were the best swordsmen and archers he and kachiun could field at a word from either of them they would attack khasar looked at kachiun once again controlling his anger at the dumb insolence of the warriors facing them his hand dropped to his sword hilt in unmistakable signal kachiun held his gaze for a moment and the warriors on both sides tensed for bloodshed almost imperceptibly kachiun moved his head a fingers width left and right khasar frowned showing his teeth in frustration for an instant he leaned in to the closest of those before the gate breathing into his face i say you are tribeless wanderers without marks of rank or blood khasar said dont leave your posts while i am gone i am going to ride into the city over your bodies the man was sweating and he blinked at the growling voice too close to his neck khasar remounted and he and kachiun swung away from the pools of light and the promise of death as soon as they were clear kachiun edged his mare over and tapped a hand to his brothers shoulder it has to be the broken lance ogedai is in the city and someone does not want us riding to his aid tonight khasar nodded his heart still hammering it had been years since he had seen such a show of rebellion from warriors of his people he was raging his face flushed my ten thousand will answer the insult he snapped where is tsubodai i have not seen him since he went to ogedai today kachiun replied you are senior send runners to his tuman and to jebe with them or without them i am going into that city kachiun the brothers and their bondsmen split up riding different paths that would bring forty thousand men back to the gates of karakorum for a time the noises on the other side of the door died almost to nothing with silent gestures tsubodai and tolui lifted a heavy couch grunting with the effort it took both of them to shove it across the entrance are there any other ways in tsubodai murmured ogedai shook his head then hesitated there are windows in my sleeping chamber but they open onto a sheer wall tsubodai cursed under his breath the first rule of battle was to choose the ground the second was to know the ground both had been taken from him he looked around at the shadowy gathering judging their mood mongke and kublai were wideeyed and thrilled to be part of an adventure neither realised the danger they were in sorhatani returned his gaze steadily under that silent stare he took a long knife from his boot and passed it into her hands a wall wont stop them tonight he said to ogedai pressing his ear to the door they fell silent as he strained to hear then jumped at a crash that made tsubodai leap back a thin trail of plaster dust curled down from the ceiling and ogedai winced to see it the corridor is narrow outside ogedai muttered almost to himself they dont have room to run at it that is good are there weapons here tsubodai asked ogedai nodded he was his fathers son ill show you he said beckoning tsubodai turned to huran and found the senior man ready at the door another crash sounded and voices rose in anger outside get a lamp lit tsubodai ordered we dont need to stay in the dark sorhatani set about the task as tsubodai strode through to the inner rooms he bowed formally to ogedais wife torogene she had lost her sleepy look and smoothed down her hair with water from a shallow bowl placed there ready for the morning tsubodai was pleased that neither she nor sorhatani seemed to be panicking through here ogedai said ahead of him tsubodai entered the sleeping chamber and nodded in appreciation a small lamp still glowed there and he saw the wolfshead sword of genghis on the wall above the bed a bow gleamed on the opposite side each layer of horn and birch and sinew polished to a rich colour do you have arrows for it tsubodai asked bending the hooks open with his thumbs and hefting the weapon ogedai smiled at the generals evident pleasure it is not a decoration general of course i have arrows he replied a chest produced a quiver of thirty shafts each the product of a master fletcher and still bright with oil he tossed it to tsubodai outside the crashing went on whoever it was had brought up hammers for the task and even the floor trembled with the blows tsubodai crossed to the windows set high in the outer wall like the ones in the outer room they were barred in iron tsubodai could not help thinking how he would break in if he were attacking the rooms though they were solid enough they had not been designed to withstand a determined enemy that enemy was never meant to get close enough or to have time to hammer out the bars before ogedais guards cut them to pieces cover the lamp for a moment tsubodai said i do not want to be visible to an archer outside he pulled a wooden chest to the window and crouched on it then rose suddenly to the barred space ducking back just as quickly theres no one in sight lord but the wall to the courtyard below is barely the height of two men they will come here if they can find it but first theyll try the door ogedai said grimly tsubodai nodded have your wife wait here perhaps ready to call if she hears anything tsubodai was trying to defer to ogedais authority but his impatience showed with every thump from the corridor outside very well general ogedai hesitated fear and anger mingling swelling in him he had not built his city to be torn screaming from life he had lived with death for so long that it was almost a shock to feel such a powerful desire to live to avenge he dared not ask tsubodai if they could hold the rooms he could see the answer in the mans eyes it is strange that you are present for the death of another of genghis sons dont you think he said tsubodai stiffened he turned back and ogedai saw no weakness in his black stare i carry many sins lord tsubodai said but this is not the time to talk about old ones if we survive you may ask whatever you need to know ogedai began to reply bitterness welling up in him a new sound made them both whip round and run an iron hinge had cracked and the wood of the outer door splintered a panel yawning open the lamplight from the room spilled out into the darker corridor illuminating sweating faces at the door huran speared his blade into them so that one at least fell back with a cry of pain the stars had moved partway across the sky by the time khasar roused his tuman he rode at the head in full armour his sword drawn and held low by his right thigh in formation behind him were ten groups of a thousand each with their minghaan officers each thousand had its jaguns of a hundred men led by officers bearing a silver plaque even they had their structures ten groups of ten with equipment to raise a ger between them and food and tools to survive and fight genghis and tsubodai had created the system and khasar hadnt given it a thought when he issued just one order to his quiriltai his quartermaster the tuman of ten thousand had formed on the plain men running to their horses in what looked like chaos before the ranks coalesced and they were ready ahead lay karakorum khasars outriders reported other tumans on the move all around him no one in the nation slept now to the smallest child they knew this was the night of crisis so long feared khasar had his naccara drummers sound a rhythm dozens of unarmed boys on camels whose sole task was to inspire fear in an enemy with a rolling thunder he heard it answered ahead and on the left as other tumans took up a warning and a challenge khasar swallowed drily looking for kachiuns men ahead he had the feeling that events were slipping from his control but he could do nothing else his path had been set when men at the gate had dared to refuse a general of the nation he knew they were chagatais but the arrogant prince had sent them out without his unit markings to do his work like assassins in the night khasar could not ignore such a threat to his authority to all the stages of authority that he represented down to the youngest drummer on a swaybacked beast he dared not think of his nephew ogedai trapped in his own city he could only react and force his way in hoping there would be someone still alive to save kachiun joined him with jebes bearskin tuman and tsubodais ten thousand khasar breathed in relief as he saw the banners stretching away into the dark a sea of horses and flags tsubodais warriors knew their general was in the city they had not disputed kachiuns right to order them in his place like a mountain slowly falling the vast array of four tumans drew close to the western gate of karakorum khasar and kachiun rode forward hiding their impatience there was no need for bloodshed even then the men at the gate remained still their weapons sheathed whatever their orders had been they knew that to draw a blade was to invite instant destruction no man wanted to be first the tableau held with just the snorting of horses and fluttering banners then out of the darkness rode a new group of men their passage lit with burning torches held by bannermen so that in an instant every man there knew that chagatai had arrived kachiun could have ordered khasar to block genghis son and had his own tumans cut a way into the city he felt the weight of the decision hang on him time running slowly as his pulse raced he was not a man to hesitate but he was not at war this was not the desert of khwarezm or the walls of a chin city he let the moment pass and as it went he clutched at it desperately almost throwing away his life when it was too late chagatai rode in like a khan his bondsmen surrounding him in square formation some of the men at the gate went sprawling as horses knocked them down but he did not look round his gaze was fixed firmly on the two older generals his fathers brothers and the only men who mattered in the camp that night he and his horse were armoured and the air was cold enough for kachiun to see plumes of mist from man and beast alike chagatai wore an iron helmet with a horsesmane crest whipping through the air as he came in he was no longer the boy they had known and both men tensed under his flat stare khasar made a hissing sound under his breath signalling his anger to his brother they knew chagatai was there to prevent them entering karakorum they were not yet sure how far he would go to keep them outside it is late to be training your men chagatai khasar snapped his voice loud they were separated by less than fifty paces closer than he had been allowed to the man in a month khasar ached to reach for his bow though the armour would likely save his target and then there would be a bloodletting on a scale unseen since they had destroyed the xi xia the prince shrugged as he sat his horse smiling with cold confidence i am not training uncle i am riding to see who threatens the peace of the camp in darkness i find it is my own uncles moving armies in the night what am i to make of it eh he laughed and the men around him showed their teeth though their hands never left the bows swords and lances with which they fairly bristled be careful chagatai khasar said the princes expression went hard at the words no uncle i will not be careful when armies ride through my land return to your ger your wives and children tell your men to go back to theirs you have no business here tonight khasar took a breath to roar an order and kachiun shouted before he unleashed the tumans you have no authority over us chagatai your men are outnumbered but there is no need for blood to be spilled we will enter the city tonight now stand aside and there will be no strife between us chagatais horse sensed his surging emotions and he had to turn it on the spot to stay in position sawing its mouth with the reins they could read the triumph on his face and privately both men despaired for ogedai in the city you misjudge me uncle chagatai shouted making sure he was heard by as many ears as possible you are the ones trying to force your way into karakorum for all i know you are planning bloody murder in the city a coup with my brothers head as the prize i have come to stop you entering to keep the peace he sneered at their surprise his face savage as he waited for the arrows to fly kachiun heard movement on his right and jerked in the saddle to see vast ranks of men moving into position around him their officers lit with torches he could not judge the numbers in the starlight but his heart sank as he saw the banners of those loyal to chagatai the two sides glowered at each other roughly equal but chagatai had done enough and he knew it kachiun and khasar could not begin a civil war in the shadow of karakorum kachiun looked east for the first signs of dawn but the sky was dark and ogedai was on his own chapter five down huran tsubodai snapped he notched an arrow on the string as he ran huran dropped flat below the hole in the door and tsubodai sent a shaft hissing through into the darkness beyond he was rewarded by a choking cry as he drew and loosed again the distance was no more than ten paces any warrior of the tribes could have hit the gap even under pressure as soon as tsubodai shot the second arrow he dropped to one knee and rolled out of the way before he had stopped moving a shaft buzzed into the room going almost too fast to see it struck behind tsubodai with a loud thump quivering in the wooden floor huran had taken up a position with his back flat to the door his head turned towards the hole he was rewarded as a hand darted through fingers scrabbling for the locking bar below huran swung his sword horizontally cutting through meat and bone and almost jamming the blade into the wood the hand and part of the forearm dropped to the ground and an unearthly screaming sounded before it too was choked off perhaps those outside had led the man away to be tended or killed him themselves tsubodai nodded to huran as their eyes met regardless of rank they were the two most capable warriors in the room able to remain calm and think even when the smell of blood was thick tsubodai turned to ogedai we need a second position lord the man who would be khan was standing with his fathers wolfshead sword drawn breathing too shallowly and looking paler than tsubodai had seen him before tsubodai frowned to himself as ogedai didnt respond he spoke louder using his voice to snap the younger man out of his trance if the door goes they will rush us ogedai you understand we need a second place a line of retreat huran and i will stay by this door but you must get the boys and women back to the inner rooms and block the door as best you can ogedai turned his head slowly dragging his eyes away from the dark hole that seemed to vomit forth the hatred of those behind it you expect me to burrow myself away to gain a few more heartbeats of life with my own children being hunted somewhere out there i would rather die here on my feet and facing my enemies he meant it tsubodai saw but ogedais gaze drifted over sorhatani and her two sons for a moment he locked eyes with his younger brother tolui ogedai wilted under the stares of the family very well tsubodai but i will return here tolui bring your wife and sons and help me block up the inner door take the bow with you tsubodai said yanking the quiver from his shoulders and tossing it to ogedai the group of five moved back carefully always aware of the line of sight for an archer in the halls outside they knew a bowman was waiting in the darkness and they knew the patience of their people used to hunting marmots on the plains the archers field of vision formed a cone that crossed the outer room down the centre without warning ogedai darted across the space and sorhatani rolled coming smoothly to her feet like a dancer no arrow came as they reached a safe spot and turned tolui stood on the other side he had found a place in the shelter of a heavy beam with his sons his face stiff with fear for them i will go last lads understand he told them mongke nodded immediately but kublai shook his head you are the largest and the slowest he said his voice quavering let me go last tolui considered if the archer was waiting with an arrow on the string and the bow half bent he could loose a shot in an eyeblink almost without aiming any of the men there would have wagered on the archer over them the crashing at the door had stopped as if the men outside were waiting perhaps they were out of the corner of his eye he saw ogedais wife torogene beckoning to him it was just a few feet across a room but it had become a chasm tolui took a deep slow breath calming himself and thinking of his father genghis had told him about breath how men will hold theirs when they are frightened or take a sudden breath before they launch an attack it was a sign to watch for in an enemy in yourself it was a tool to manage fear he took another slow breath and his hammering heart eased slightly in his chest tolui smiled at kublais nervous defiance do as youre told boy im quicker than you think he laid a hand on each sons shoulder and whispered go together ready now both boys sprinted across the innocentlooking space an arrow flashed through the gap passing behind kublais back he fell sprawling and sorhatani dragged him clear hugging him to her in desperate relief she turned with her sons to look at tolui who nodded to them sweat beading his brow he had married a woman of aching beauty and he smiled at her fierce expression like a mother wolf with her cubs the archer was clearly ready and they had been lucky he cursed himself for not following immediately before the archer could notch another shaft he had lost the moment and perhaps his life as a result he looked around for some sort of shield a table or even a thick cloth to spoil the mans aim the corridor was still silent as the attackers let their bowman work tolui took another slow breath readying his muscles to spring across the gap and dreading the thought of a shaft tearing into him smashing him off his feet in front of his family tsubodai sorhatani called the general glanced back at her catching her beseeching gaze and understanding he had nothing to block the hole for the time they needed his gaze fell on the single lamp he hated the thought of plunging the room into darkness once again but there was nothing else he swept it up flinging it through the hole from the side of the door the crash sent tolui safely across the gap to his family and tsubodai heard the thump of an arrow released into the door itself the aim ruined kublai cheered the act and mongke joined him for a few moments the room remained lit by the flaming oil on the other side but the men there stamped the flames out and they were left in blackness once again far deeper than before there was still no sign of dawn the furious crashing resumed and splinters flew as the door groaned in its frame tolui worked quickly at the entrance to the inner room the door there had none of the strength of the outer one it would not delay the attackers beyond the first few moments instead tolui kicked out the delicate hinges and began to make a barricade across the doorway as he worked he gripped his sons by the neck in quick affection then sent them scurrying into ogedais sleeping chamber to gather anything they could lift he saw torogene murmuring to them and they relaxed as she directed them both young men were used to their mothers commands and torogene was a large woman motherly and brisk in her manner there was another small lamp there torogene handed it out to sorhatani who placed it so that some of its light reached tsubodai it made huge shadows in the rooms great dark figures that leapt and danced dwarfing them all they worked in grim concentration tsubodai and huran knew they would have just moments to retreat when the outer door gave way the couch braced against it would be no more than a nuisance to the attackers as they poured in behind them sorhatani and tolui built their barricade without speaking jittery from fear and lack of sleep the boys brought them wood panelling bedclothes even a heavy pedestal that had to be dragged over the floor leaving a long scar it would not hold against determined men even young kublai understood that or saw it in his parents bleak expressions when their pitiful collection of debris was in place they stood behind it with ogedai and torogene panting and waiting sorhatani rested one hand on kublais shoulder holding tsubodais long knife in the other she wished desperately for more light terrified of being killed in the gloom overwhelmed by struggling bloody bodies she could not consider losing kublai and mongke it was as if she stood on the edge of a high cliff and to look at them was to step off and drop she heard toluis long slow breaths and copied him breathing through her nose it helped a little in the dark as the outer door cracked suddenly down its length and the men outside grunted and howled in anticipation tsubodai and huran were both wary of the archer on the other side of the door each man had to judge when the blows against the rapidly splintering wood would obstruct the hidden man then strike a blow into the faces in the dark the attackers were pressing knowing they were near to getting in at last more than one fell back with a cry from a sword blade licking out like a fang and withdrawing before the archer could see through his own people someone out there was dying noisily and huran was panting he was in awe of the ice general fighting at his side tsubodai could have been at a training bout for all the emotion his face showed yet they could not hold the door both men tensed as a low panel broke into splinters half the door remained cracked and loose crouching men came struggling under the locking bar and both huran and tsubodai stood their ground plunging their blades into exposed necks blood splashed them both as they refused to yield though the archer had moved and sent a shaft that spun huran around winding him he knew his ribs had broken every breath was agony as if his lungs inflated against a shard of glass but he could not even check the wound to see if his armour had saved him more men were kicking at the bar loosening its bolts in the wall when that finally gave way the two warriors would be swallowed in the flood huran gasped hoarsely as he continued to strike out seeking bare necks and arms beyond the hole he saw blades jabbing at him and felt blows on his shoulders and legs he could taste iron bitterness in his mouth and his arms seemed slower as he swung and swung each breath burning him with its sweetness and heat he fell then thinking he must have slipped in someones blood huran saw the iron bar spring out the room seemed lighter somehow as if the wolfs dawn had come at last huran gasped as someone trod on his outstretched hand breaking bones but the pain was fleeting he was dead before tsubodai had turned at bay to face the men who roared into that room wild with release and hungry to do their work the stalemate at the gates had become chagatais triumph he had enjoyed his uncles expressions as jelme brought a tuman up to his side toluis tuman had matched him on the other side its men straining at the leash with knowledge that their lord and his family were trapped in the city perhaps already dead one by one all the generals of the nation brought their men to the city walls stretching away into the darkness more than a hundred thousand warriors stood ready to fight if they had to but there was no battle heat in them while their commanders sat and stared coldly at each other jochis son batu had declared for kachiun and khasar he was barely seventeen years old but his thousand men followed his lead and he rode with his head high he was a prince of the nation despite his youth and his fathers fate ogedai had seen to that promoting him as genghis would never have done even so batu had chosen to stand against the most powerful man in the tribes kachiun sent a runner to him to thank him for the gesture in tsubodais absence kachiuns mind was running faster than his peaceful look suggested he thought jelme was still loyal to ogedai though chagatai had accepted him it was no small thing to have perhaps a sixth of an enemys army ready to turn against him at a crucial point yet the sides were too evenly matched kachiun had a vision of the army falling in on itself until there were just hundreds left alive then dozens then just one or two what then of the great dream genghis had given them he at least would never have countenanced such a waste of life and strength not among their own people the wolf dawn showed in the east the faint greying of the land before the sun rose above the horizon the light spread over the host gathered by karakorum illuminating the faces of the generals and their men so that there was no need for torches even then they did not move and chagatai sat and chatted with his bondsmen barking out laughter as he enjoyed the new day and everything it would bring when the first thin line of gold appeared in the east chagatais second in command clapped him on the back and the men around him cheered the sound was quickly taken up by the other tumans on his side those with khasar and kachiun sat in sullen and thoughtful silence it did not take a mind like tsubodais to interpret chagatais pleasure kachiun watched with narrow eyes as chagatais men began to dismount so that they could kneel to him as khan he pursed his mouth in rising fury he had to stop it before it became a wave across all the tumans and chagatai was made khan on a wave of oaths before ogedais fate was even known kachiun moved his horse forward holding up a hand to the men who would have followed him khasar too came forward so that they rode alone through the ranks of men towards chagatai their nephew was ready from the first step they took in his direction as he had been all night chagatai drew his sword in unmistakable threat but he still smiled as he gestured to his bondsmen to let them through the rising sun lit the host of warriors their armour glimmered like a sea of iron fish scaled and dangerous it is a new day chagatai kachiun said i will see your brother ogedai now you will open the city chagatai glanced once more at the dawn and nodded to himself i have done my duty uncle i have protected his city from those who might have run riot inside on the eve of the oathtaking come ride with me to my brothers palace i must be certain he is safe he grinned as he spoke the last words and kachiun looked away rather than see he watched the gates begin to open laying the empty streets of karakorum bare before them tsubodai was no longer a young man but he wore full armour and he had been a soldier longer than most of the attackers had been alive as they came in a welter of limbs and blades he darted six steps away from the door without warning he spun and lunged taking the closest man to him through the throat two more brought their blades down in reaction hacking wildly at his scaled armour and leaving bright marks in the tarnish tsubodais mind was perfectly clear faster than their movements he had expected to retreat immediately but the hurried blows showed him their weariness and desperation he struck again reversing his blade for a pull stroke that jerked the steel across a mans forehead opening a flap so that he was blinded with blood it was a mistake two men grabbed hold of tsubodais right arm another kicked his legs away and he fell with a crash on the ground tsubodai exploded into a frenzy he lashed out in all directions using his armour as a weapon and always moving making himself harder to hit the metal plates on his leg opened a gash in someones thigh and then he heard roaring and still more men poured into the room more than it could hold tsubodai struggled on desperately knowing he had lost and ogedai had lost chagatai would be khan he tasted his own blood in the back of his throat as bitter as his rage at the barricade ogedai and tolui waited shoulder to shoulder sorhatani stood with the bow unable to shoot while tsubodai still lived when he went down she sent two shafts between her husband and his brother her arms were nowhere near strong enough for a full draw but one of the arrows checked a man in his rush while the other ricocheted away into the ceiling ogedai stepped in front of her as she struggled to notch a third with shaking fingers the view beyond the barricade was blocked with grasping hands and blades and bloody faces she did not understand what was happening at first she flinched at a roar as more men came into the outer room some of those struggling with ogedai and tolui turned at the sound and then they were yanked back sorhatani saw a sword appear through the throat of a man facing her as if he had grown a long and bloody tongue he fell jerking and the view was suddenly clear ogedai and tolui panted like dogs in the sun in the other room a group of armoured men were finishing off the attackers with quick efficient blows jebe stood there and at first he ignored the survivors even ogedai he had seen tsubodai on the ground and knelt at his side just as the general struggled to his knees tsubodai was shaking his head dazed and gashed but alive jebe rose and saluted ogedai with his sword i am pleased to see you well my lord he said smiling how are you here ogedai snapped his blood still surging with anger and fear your uncles sent me lord with forty bondsmen we had to kill a lot of men to reach you tolui clapped his brother on the back in delight before he turned and embraced sorhatani kublai and mongke punched each other on the shoulders and mockscuffled until kublai was in mongkes headlock tsubodai general ogedai said he watched as tsubodais glazed eyes cleared a warrior put out his hand to steady the general and tsubodai batted it away irritably still shaken by how close he had come to death at the feet of the attackers when tsubodai got to his feet jebe turned to him as if reporting the broken lance closed the gates of the city all the tumans are outside on the plain it may be war yet how then did you get inside my city ogedai demanded he looked for huran and remembered with a pang of loss that the man had given his life at the first door we climbed the walls my lord jebe said general kachiun sent us before he rode to try and force his way in he saw ogedais look of surprise and shrugged they are not so very high my lord the rooms were lighter ogedai realised dawn had come to karakorum and the day promised to be fine with a start he remembered this was the day of the oathtaking he blinked trying to put his thoughts in some sort of order to see a way through after such a night that there even was an after was more than he had expected in the last moments he felt dazed lost in events beyond his control in the corridor outside running footsteps could be heard a messenger came pelting into the room and skidded to a halt shocked by the mass of dead flesh and the collection of blades levelled at him the room stank of opened bowels and urine thick and choking in the enclosed space report jebe said recognising the scout the young man steadied himself the gates have reopened general i ran all the way but there is an armed force coming of course there is tsubodai said his deep voice startling everyone there they all looked to him and ogedai felt a surge of relief that he was there everyone who was outside the walls last night will be coming here to see who survives he turned to ogedai then my lord we have just moments you must be clean and changed when they see you this room must be sealed it will keep for today at least ogedai nodded gratefully and tsubodai snapped quick orders jebe went first leaving six men to form a guard for the one who would be khan ogedai and torogene followed with tolui and his family close behind as they hurried down a long corridor ogedai saw that toluis hand kept drifting to his wife or his sons as he strode still hardly able to believe they were all safe the children ogedai torogene said he glanced at her and saw that her face was pale and drawn with worry he put his arm around her shoulders and both of them took comfort from the other looking over her head ogedai could see no one who knew the palace well where was his servant barasaghur he addressed jebe as the closest man general i must know if my son guyuk survived the night my daughters also have one of your men find their quarters ask a servant bring me the news as quickly as you can and find my chancellor yao shu and barasaghur get them moving see who still lives your will my lord jebe said quickly bowing his head ogedai seemed almost manic his mood hard to read it was more than the excitement that can come after a battle when life courses more strongly in the veins ogedai rushed on his wife and guards struggling to keep up somewhere ahead he could hear marching feet and he darted down another corridor away from the sound he needed fresh clothes and to wash the blood and filth off him he needed time to think kachiun had become cold and pale as they rode through the streets approaching ogedais palace there seemed to be bodies everywhere with pools of darkening blood staining the polished stone gutters not all of them bore the marks of ogedais guard tuman others wore dark deels or armour rubbed with lampblack dull and greasy in the dawn light the night had been bloody and kachiun dreaded what he would see in the palace itself chagatai rode lightly shaking his head at such destruction until khasar considered cutting his throat and wiping the expression off his face the presence of three of chagatais bondsmen kept his hand from his sword hilt they did not stare at the dead their eyes were only for the two men riding with their lord the man who would be khan before the end of the day the streets were silent if any workers had left their homes after the clashes and screams of the night the sight of so many bodies had sent them scurrying back to bar the doors the six horsemen made their way to the steps leading up to the palace doors dead men lay splayed on the pale marble their blood in patterns along the veins of stone chagatai did not dismount but urged his pony up the steps clicking his tongue as it trod gingerly past the corpses the main door to the first courtyard stood open and there was no one to challenge his right to enter crows called to each other and there were hawks and vultures already overhead drawn by the scent of death on the breeze kachiun and khasar looked at each other in grim surmise as they passed under a bar of shadow into the yard beyond the tree of silver shone there in the dawn beautiful and lifeless the generals could read the patterns of dead well enough there had been no fixed battle with lines of men cut down instead the bodies lay randomly killed from behind or taken by shafts they never saw they could almost sense the defenders surprise as men dressed in shadows had appeared and killed cutting through them before anyone could organise a defence in the silence chagatai was rapt as he dismounted at last his pony was skittish with the smell of blood and he made a point of tying the reins securely to a post i begin to fear for my brother chagatai said khasar tensed and one of the bondsmen raised a hand to him reminding him of their presence the man was grinning enjoying his masters show you need not fear came a voice making them all jump chagatai spun instantly his sword leaping out of its scabbard in one movement his bondsmen were barely slower ready for any attack tsubodai stood there under an arch of carved limestone he wore no armour and the morning breeze had not dried the patches of sweat on his silk tunic a strip of cloth bound his left forearm and chagatai could see a smear of blood seeping through it tsubodais face was weary but strong and his eyes were terrible as they met those of the man responsible for the death and destruction all around them chagatai opened his mouth to demand some explanation but tsubodai went on my lord ogedai is waiting for you in his audience hall he bids you welcome in his home he guarantees your safety he spoke the last words as if they stuck in his throat chagatai looked away from the rage he saw in the general for an instant his shoulders sagged as he understood his defeat he had gambled it all on a single night he did not look up at the slight sound of boots on stone above his head as archers appeared he bit his lower lip and nodded to himself even so he was his fathers son he stood straight and sheathed his sword with the care of ritual no trace of his shock or disappointment showed on his face as he smiled wryly at tsubodai thank the spirits he has survived chagatai said take me to him general chapter six chagatais bondsmen remained in the courtyard they would have fought if he had asked them instead he clapped one of them on the shoulder and shook his head before striding into the cloister behind tsubodai chagatai did not look back as his men were surrounded by warriors of ogedai and beaten to the ground when one of them cried out chagatai set his jaw disappointed the man could not die quietly for the honour of his master khasar and kachiun followed in silence they watched chagatai fall in beside tsubodai neither man looking at the other at the audience chamber guards were all around and chagatai merely shrugged and gave up his sword the door was of polished copper redgold in the morning light chagatai expected to enter but the guard officer tapped him on the armour and stood back waiting chagatai grimaced but he removed his long scaled jacket and thigh pieces as well as the heavy gloves and arm protectors it was not long before he stood in just his jerkin leggings and boots it might have diminished another man to be so stripped but chagatai had been training for the festival for many months wrestling running and shooting hundreds of arrows each day he was in superb physical condition and he made most of those around him look smaller and weaker than they were not so tsubodai none of the guards dared to come close to that man as he stood and silently dared chagatai to protest though tsubodai remained still it was the stillness of a snake or a sapling bent and ready to spring back finally chagatai faced the guard officer with one eyebrow raised he endured being patted down but he had no hidden weapons and the door swung open he walked in alone as it closed behind him he heard khasar begin to argue as he was held back chagatai was pleased tsubodai and his uncles would not be witnesses he had gambled and lost but there was no shame in it no humiliation ogedai had gathered loyal men to him just as chagatai had his brothers generals had proved more resourceful than his own as it had been the night before one brother would still be khan and the other chagatai grinned suddenly as he saw ogedai at the far end of the hall sitting on a throne of white stone inlaid with patterns of gold it was an impressive sight as it was intended to be as he walked closer chagatai saw ogedais hair was damp loose and black on his shoulders a purple mark on his cheek was the only visible proof of the night before despite the grandeur of the throne his brother wore a simple grey deel over leggings and a tunic with no more decoration than any herder of the plains i am glad to see you well brother chagatai said ogedai tensed as chagatai walked smoothly towards him his steps echoing let us not play games he replied i have survived your attacks i will be khan at sunset today chagatai nodded still smiling no games then but you know the strange thing is i spoke the truth part of me was dreading finding you killed ridiculous yes he chuckled amused at the complexity of his own emotions family was a peculiar thing still i did what i thought best i have no regrets or apologies i think father would have enjoyed the risks i took he bowed his head youll forgive me if i dont congratulate you on your triumph ogedai relaxed subtly he had spent years thinking of chagatai as an arrogant idiot he had almost missed him growing into a man used to responsibility and power as chagatai came to stand before him ogedais guards stepped out and commanded him to kneel he ignored them remaining on his feet and looking around the room with an interested expression it was a huge space to a warrior more used to the gers of the plains the morning light flooded in from a window overlooking the city one of the guards turned to ogedai for permission and chagatai smiled slightly with any other prisoner the man would have struck him down or even hamstrung him to make him kneel the hesitation acknowledged chagatais power even as they sought to humble him ogedai could almost admire his brothers careless courage no he could admire it even after such a night the shadow of genghis hung over them both and perhaps it always would neither they nor tolui could ever match their fathers achievement by any standard they were lesser souls and had been from the moment they were born yet they had to live and grow and become men skilful in their crafts they had to thrive in that shadow or let it smother them no one else understood ogedais life as chagatai did not even their brother tolui he wondered again if he was making the right decision but in that too he had to be strong a man could waste his life worrying that was all too clear sometimes you simply had to choose and shrug however it came out knowing that you could not have done more with the bones you were given ogedai faced his brother and wished one last time that he could know how long he had to live everything depended on it his son did not have the ruthless will to inherit if ogedai died that very day guyuk would not follow in the line of their father the line of genghis it would pass to the man standing before him ogedai searched for calm though his heart thumped and pattered in his chest spreading a constant ache until it became like a blade between his ribs he had not slept and he knew he ran the risk of collapse in dealing with chagatai that morning he had drunk a jug of red wine to steady his nerves and used a pinch of the foxglove powder he could still taste the bitterness on his tongue and his head ached as if it was being slowly crushed for all he knew he might rule as khan for just days before his heart gave out and burst in his chest if that was his fate and he had killed chagatai the nation would tear itself apart in civil war tolui was not strong enough to hold them together neither he nor ogedais son had gathered loyal generals to protect them through such an upheaval power would triumph over blood in that struggle the man who stood before him his tension hidden was perhaps the best hope for the nation more chagatai was the one genghis would have chosen if their brother jochi had never been born ogedai felt his damp hair itch and he rubbed it unconsciously the guards still looked to him but he would not let them beat chagatai to his knees not that day though part of him yearned to see it you are safe here brother he said i have given my word and your word is iron chagatai murmured almost automatically both of them recalled their fathers beliefs and honoured them the great khans shadow clung to them like a cloak the shared memories made chagatai look up and frown suddenly at a loss he had expected to be killed but ogedai seemed troubled rather than triumphant or even vengeful he watched with interest as ogedai turned to his guard officer clear the room what i have to say is for my brother alone the man began to move but ogedai stopped him with a raised hand no bring orlok tsubodai as well your will my lord the officer replied bowing deeply in just moments the guards along the walls were marching to the great copper doors tsubodai came in at their call outside khasar could be heard still arguing with the officers before the door swung shut leaving the three men alone in the echoing space ogedai rose from the throne and stepped down so that he was at chagatais level he crossed to a small table and poured himself a cup of airag from a jug drinking deeply and wincing as it stung ulcers in his mouth chagatai glanced at tsubodai only to find the man glaring at him like an enemy he winked at the general and looked away ogedai took a slow breath and his voice shook at the strain of saying what he had kept hidden for so long i am my fathers heir chagatai not you or tolui or kachiun or jochis son or any of the generals as the sun sets today i will accept the oath of the nation he paused and neither chagatai nor tsubodai interrupted as the silence stretched ogedai looked out of the tall window enjoying the sight of his city though it was quiet and frightened after such a night there is a world outside the one we know he said softly with cultures and races and armies who have never heard of us yes and cities greater than yenking and karakorum to survive to grow we must remain strong we must conquer new lands so that our army is always fed always moving to stop is to die chagatai i know this chagatai said i am not a fool ogedai smiled wearily no if you were a fool i would have had you killed in the courtyard with your bondsmen then why am i still alive chagatai said he tried to keep his tone casual but this was the question that had burnt him ever since he saw tsubodai in the courtyard of the palace because i may not live to see the nation grow chagatai ogedai said at last because my heart is weak and i could die at any moment the two men facing him stared as if struck ogedai couldnt bear to wait for their questions almost with relief he went on the words spilling out i remain alive with the help of bitter chin powders but i have no way of knowing how long i have left i wanted just to see my city finished and to be khan here i am still alive though i live in pain why was i not told this before chagatai said slowly stunned by the implications he knew the answer before ogedai replied and nodded as his brother spoke would you have given me two years to build a city a tomb no you would have challenged me as soon as you heard instead i have made karakorum and i will be khan i think father would have appreciated the risks i took brother chagatai shook his head as things he had puzzled over began to fall together then why he began you said you are no fool chagatai think it through as i have done a thousand times i am my fathers heir but my heart is weak and i could fall at any moment who would lead the nation then i would chagatai said softly it was a hard truth that ogedais son would not live to inherit but neither man looked away from the other chagatai began to appreciate something of what ogedai had gone through in the years since their fathers death how long have you known of the weakness he asked ogedai shrugged ive had twinges as long as i can remember but it has grown worse in the last few years there have beenmore serious pains without the chin powders i do not think i have much time wait chagatai said frowning you say i am safe you will let me leave with this information i dont understand it was tsubodai who replied and he too stared at ogedai as if seeing him for the first time if you died chagatai if you were killed as you deserve for the attacks last night who would keep the nation whole when the khan falls tsubodais face twisted into a furious sneer it seems you will be rewarded for your failures my lord that is why you too had to hear this tsubodai ogedai said you must put aside your anger my brother will be khan after me and you will be his first general he too is a son of genghis the bloodline of the man you gave oath to serve chagatai struggled to take in what he had heard you expect me to wait then to be quiet and peaceful while i wait for you to die how do i know this is not some ruse something dreamed up by tsubodai because i could kill you now ogedai snapped his temper fraying visibly i still could chagatai why else would i offer you your life after last night i speak from a position of strength brother not failure that is how you should judge my words reluctantly chagatai nodded he needed time to think and he knew he was not going to be given that luxury i have made promises to those who have supported me he said i cannot simply live the life of a herder while i wait it would be a living death unworthy of a warrior he paused for a moment thinking quickly unless you make me your heir publicly then i will have the respect of my generals that i will not do ogedai said immediately if i die in the next few months you will be khan whether i have made you heir or not if i survive longer i will not deny the chance to my son you must take your chances with him as he must with you then you offer me nothing chagatai replied raising his voice almost to a shout what sort of a deal is this based on empty promises why even tell me if you die soon yes i will be khan but i will not spend my life waiting for a messenger who might never come no man would after the attacks last night you had to be told if i let it pass if i just sent you back to your tuman you would see only weakness how long before you or another challenged me then yet i am not leaving you with nothing chagatai far from it my task is to expand the lands we have conquered to make the nation safe to thrive and grow by doing so to our brother tolui i will give the homeland though i will keep karakorum as my own city he took a deep breath seeing the light of anticipation and greed in his brothers eyes you will take khwarezm as the centre of your lands with the cities of samarkand bukhara and kabul i will give to you a khanate two thousand miles across from the amu darya river to the altai mountains you and your descendants will rule there though you will pay tribute to me and to mine my lord tsubodai began appalled chagatai chuckled derisively let him speak general this is a matter for family not for you ogedai shook his head i have planned this for almost two years tsubodai my challenge is to put aside the rage i feel for the attacks on my family and make the right choices even now he raised his head to stare at chagatai and his brother felt the surging emotions in his gaze my son and daughters survived chagatai did you know that if they had been killed by your warriors i would be watching you slowroasted at this moment and listening to you scream some things i will not bear in the name of my fathers empire his vision he paused but chagatai said nothing ogedai nodded satisfied he had been understood you have a position of strength brother ogedai said you have generals loyal to you while i have a vast empire that must be administered and controlled by able men after today i will be the gurkhan the leader of nations i will take your oath and honour mine to you and your descendants the chin showed us how to rule many lands chagatai with tribute flowing back to the capital you have not forgotten what happened to that capital chagatai asked ogedais eyes glinted dangerously i have not brother do not think that one day you will lead an army into karakorum our fathers blood runs in my veins as much as it does in yours if you ever come to me holding a sword it will be against the khan and the nation will answer i will destroy you then with your wives and children your servants and followers do not forget chagatai that i survived the night our fathers luck is mine his spirit watches over me yet i am offering you an empire greater than anything outside the lands of the chin where i will rot chagatai said you would have me lock myself in a pretty palace surrounded by women and gold he struggled for something suitably appallingchairs and crowns ogedai smiled slightly to see his brothers horror at such a prospect no he said you will raise an army for me there one i may call on an army of the west as tolui will create an army of the hearth and i will gather one of the east the world has grown too large for one army of the nation my brother you will ride where i tell you to ride conquer where i tell you to conquer the world is yours if you can put aside the base part of you that tells you to rule it all that you may not have now give me an answer and your oath your word is iron brother and i will take it or i can just kill you now chagatai nodded overcome with the sudden shift from fatalistic numbness to new hope and new suspicions what oath will you accept he said at last and ogedai knew he had won he held out the wolfshead sword that genghis had worn swear with your hand on this sword swear by our fathers spirit and honour that you will never raise a hand in anger against me that you will accept me as gurkhan and be a loyal vassal as khan of your own lands and peoples whatever else happens is the will of the sky father but on that you can make an oath i will respect there will be many others today chagatai be the first the nation knew that chagatai had gambled for the horsetails throwing his men at the city of karakorum when ogedai and his officers rode around the city that morning in a show of strength they saw that the attempt had failed yet somehow chagatai too rode proudly as he rejoined his tuman outside the city he sent his bondsmen to collect the corpses and carry them far beyond karakorum out of sight in just a short time only rusty marks were left on the streets the dead as well hidden as the plans and stratagems of great men the warriors of the nation shrugged and continued to prepare for the festival and the great games that would begin that day for kachiun and khasar it was enough for the moment to know ogedai had survived the games would go ahead and there would be time to think of the future once he was made khan tumans that had faced each other in anger the night before sent teams of bowmen to the archery wall outside karakorum for those men the battles of princes were a different world they were pleased their own generals had survived more pleased that the games had not been called off tens of thousands gathered to watch the first event of the day no one wanted to miss the early rounds especially as the final would be seen by only thirty thousand in the centre of the city temuge had organised the paper tokens that gained entry to that final enclosure they had been changing hands for horses and gold for days before the event while ogedai had fought for his life women children and the elderly were quietly sitting in darkness where they could watch the greatest skills of their people demonstrated even the game of thrones had come second place to that desire the archery wall loomed above the east gate of karakorum bright in the rising sun it had been built over the previous days a massive construction of wood and iron that could hold more than a hundred small shields each no larger than a mans head around it a thousand iron stoves added smoke to the air cooking a feast for those who watched the smell of fried mutton and wild onions was strong around the camp and the knowledge that civil war had been as close as a breath the night before did not diminish their appetites or still the ready laughter as the wrestlers practised with friends on the dry grass it was a good day with the sun strong on their backs as the nation prepared to celebrate a new khan chapter seven khasar stood with nine of his tumans best archers waiting for his turn he had to struggle to find the calm he needed and he took long slow breaths while he held up each of the four arrows he had been given in theory they were all identical products of the best fletcher in the tribes even so khasar had rejected the first three he had been handed it was nerves in part but he had not slept and he knew the day would be hard as it caught up with him he was already sweating more than usual as his body complained and ached the only consolation was that every other archer had been awake as well yet the young ones were brightfaced and cheerful as they saw the grey pallor of more senior men for them it was a day of great potential a better chance than they could have hoped to win recognition and temuges precious medals of gold silver and bronze each stamped with the face of ogedai while he waited khasar wondered what chagatai would have done if he had been successful no doubt the heavy discs would have been quietly taken away and lost khasar shook his head to clear it knowing chagatai he would have used them anyway the man felt no embarrassment about small things in that at least he was the true son of his father the festival would last for three days though ogedai would be khan at sunset on the first khasar had already seen temuge running himself ragged trying to organise the events so that all those who qualified to compete could do so temuge had complained to khasar about the difficulties saying something about archers who were also riding in the horse races and runners who were wrestling khasar had waved him away rather than listen to the tedious detail he supposed someone had to organise it all but it did not sound like a warriors work it was well suited to his scholarly brother who could use a bow hardly better than a child step forward bearskin tuman the judge called khasar looked up from his thoughts to watch the competition jebe was a talented archer his very name meant arrow and had been given to him after a shot that brought down genghis own horse the word was that his men would be in the final khasar noted that jebe did not seem to be suffering after the nights exertions though he had fought through the night to save ogedai khasar felt a twinge of envy remembering when he too could have ridden all night and still fought the following day without rest or food beyond a few gulps of airag blood and milk still he knew he had not wasted the good times with genghis he had conquered nations and made a chin emperor kneel it had been the proudest moment of his life but he could have wished for a few more years of uncaring strength without the painful clicking of his hip as he rode or the sore knee or even the small hard lumps under his shoulder where a lance tip had broken off years before he rubbed at the spot absently as jebe and his nine toed the line a hundred paces from the archery wall at that distance the targets looked tiny jebe laughed at something and clapped one of his men on the back khasar watched as the general bent and slowreleased his bow a few times limbering up his shoulders around them thousands of warriors women and children had gathered to watch growing still and silent as the team waited for the breeze to die the wind dropped to nothing seeming to intensify the sun on khasars skin the wall had been placed so the archers cast long shadows but their aim was not spoiled by light in their eyes temuge had planned such tiny details ready jebe said without turning his head his men stood on either side of him one arrow on the string and three on the ground before them there were no marks for style only accuracy but khasar knew jebe would make it as silky smooth as he could as a matter of pride begin the judge called khasar watched closely as the team breathed out together drawing at the same time and loosing just before they took the next breath ten arrows soared out curving slightly as blurs in the air before they thumped home on the wall more judges ran out and held up flags to show the hits their voices carried in the silent air calling uukhai for every shot in the centre of the target it was a good start ten flags jebe grinned at his men and they loosed again as soon as the judges were clear to go on to the next round they had to hit only thirtythree shields with forty arrows they made it look easy hitting a perfect thirty and only missing two on the last shot for a score of thirtyeight the crowd cheered and khasar glowered at jebe as he passed back through the other competitors the sun was hot but they were alive khasar did not understand why ogedai had let chagatai live it would not have been his choice but he was no longer one of the inner circle around the khan as he had been with genghis he shrugged to himself at the thought tsubodai or kachiun would know they always did someone would tell him khasar had seen chagatai just before he joined the archers the younger man had been leaning on a wooden corral watching the wrestlers prepare with a few of his bondsmen there had been no visible tension in chagatai and it was only then that khasar had begun to relax ogedai seemed to have won through to some sort of peace at least for a time khasar put such things out of his mind an old skill one way or another it was going to be a good day by the low white walls of karakorum forty riders waited for the signal to begin their animals had been groomed and their hooves oiled in the days leading to the festival each rider had his own secret diet for his mount guaranteed by his family to produce the longdistance stamina that the animal would need batu ran his fingers through his ponys mane a nervous habit that he repeated every few moments ogedai would be watching he was almost certain his uncle had overseen all aspects of his training with the tumans giving his officers a free hand to work him bloody and then force him to study each battle and tactic in the nations history he ached as he had ached almost constantly for more than two years it showed in the new muscle on his shoulders and the dark circles under his eyes it had not been in vain no sooner had he mastered a task or a post than he was moved again on the order of ogedai the race that day was a respite of sorts from his training batu had tied his own hair back in a club so that it would not whip his face and irritate him during the race he had a chance he knew that he was older than the other boys a man grown though he had his fathers whiplean frame the extra weight would count over the distance yet his pony was truly strong it had shown its speed and endurance as a colt and at two years of age it was bursting with energy as fit and ready as its rider he looked to where his second in command turned a small pale mare on the spot he met batus eyes for a second and nodded zans blind white eye gleamed at him reflecting his excitement zan had been batus friend when only his mother knew the shame of his birth when she still hid the disgrace of the name zan too had grown up with vicious dislike beaten and tormented by those pureblood boys who mocked his golden skin and delicate chin features batu thought of him almost as a brother thin and fierce with enough hatred for both of them some of the tumans had supplied teams of riders batu hoped zan alone would be enough to make a difference if he had learned anything from his fathers fate it was to win no matter how you did it it was not important if someone else was hurt or killed if you won you would be forgiven anything you could be taken from a stinking ger and forced through the ranks until a thousand men followed your orders as if they came from the khan himself blood and talent the nation was built on both as the judge stepped up to the mark another rider crossed batus line as if struggling with his mount batu kicked forward instantly using his strength to shove the boy away it was settan of the uriankhai of course tsubodais old tribe had been a thorn in his side ever since their valiant general returned to genghis with batus fathers head in a sack he had met their silent dislike a hundred times since ogedai had raised him not that they were open in their disdain or their transparent loyalty to their own blood genghis had outlawed the ties of tribe for his new nation but batu could smile at the thought of his grandfathers arrogance as if anything mattered but blood perhaps that was what his father jochi had forgotten when he rebelled and stole away batus birthright it was ironic that the uriankhai still chose to visit the sins of the father on his son jochi had not known that his tumble with a virgin produced a boy as an unmarried girl batus mother had no claim on jochi she had been scorned by her own family forced to live on the edges she had rejoiced when jochi became an outcast the traitor general to be hunted down and killed then she had heard that the great khan had decreed all bastard children were to be legitimate batu still remembered the night she realised all she had lost drinking herself into a stupor then gashing weakly at her wrists with a cooking knife he had washed and bound the wounds himself no one in the world hated the memory of jochi like his son in comparison to that seething white flame the uriankhai were simply moths that would be burnt by it batu watched out of the corner of his eye as the judge began to unfurl a long flag of yellow silk his fathers men had all left wives and children behind in the camp of genghis zan was one of those abandoned children some had returned with tsubodai but zans father had died somewhere far away his body lost on strange ground it was one more thing for which batu could not forgive his fathers memory he nodded to himself it was a good thing he had enemies in the group of riders he fed on their dislike adding to it so that he could suck strength from their jibes and taunts their sly blows and tricks he thought once again of the human shit he had found in his feedbags that dawn and it was like a draught of black airag in his blood that was why he would win the race he rode with hatred and it gave him a power they could only imagine the judge raised the flag batu felt his ponys haunches bunch as he rocked back ready to explode forward the flag whipped down a streamer of gold in the morning sun batu kicked and in a heartbeat he was galloping he did not take the lead though he was almost sure he could have made them watch his back all the way round the city instead he settled down to a steady pace midway down the group six times around karakorum was fortyeight miles no sprint but a test of stamina the horses had been bred for it and they could last the distance the skill would come in the manoeuvres of the boys and men on their backs batu felt his confidence swell he was a minghaan officer he was seventeen years old and he could ride all day one thousand and twentyfour men of the nation raised their right arms to the crowd as they prepared for the first massive round of wrestling the first day would weed out the injured and the older men or simply the ones who were unlucky there were no second chances and with ten rounds to survive the final two days would depend in part on those who came through the first with the fewest injuries the warriors had their favourites and for days there had been a stream of them strolling by the training fields assessing the strengths and weaknesses looking for those worth a bet and those who would not last through the gruelling trial none of the generals had entered for this part of the festival they were too dignified to allow themselves to be thrown and broken by younger men even so the first wrestling bout had been delayed so that khasar and jebe could take part in the archery competition khasar was a huge fan of the wrestling and sponsored the man no warrior wanted to meet in the first rounds baabgai the bear was of chin stock though he had the compact build of a mongol wrestler he beamed toothlessly at the crowd and they cheered his name herds of the best ponies had been wagered on him but ten rounds or an injury could wear him down even a stone could be cracked with enough blows khasar and jebe both went through their first round then jogged with their teams across the summer grass to where the wrestlers waited patiently in the sun the air tasted like metal and smelled of oil and sweat the clashes and bloodshed of the night before were deliberately forgotten the archers knelt on mats of white felt laying their precious bows carefully beside them already unstrung and wrapped in wool and leather ho baabgai khasar called grinning at the bulky man he had found and trained baabgai had the mindless strength of an ox and seemed to feel no pain in all his previous bouts he had never shown the slightest discomfort and it was that stolid quality that most intimidated his opponents they could not see a way to hurt the fool khasar knew some of the wrestlers called him the empty one for his low intelligence but baabgai took no offence at anything he just smiled and threw them over the horizon khasar waited patiently through a song of beginning the rough voices of the wrestlers swelled as they vowed to stand firm in the earth and to remain friends whether they were victor or vanquished there would be other songs in later rounds khasar preferred those and he barely listened as he looked across the plains ogedai was in karakorum no doubt being washed oiled and preened the nation was already drinking hard and if khasar hadnt been taking part in the archery rounds he would have joined them he watched as baabgai took his first hold the big man was not blisteringly fast but once an opponent came within reach of his hands once he found a grip that was it baabgais fingers were short and fleshy his hands always looking as if they had swollen badly but khasar had felt their strength and wagered heavily on him baabgais first bout ended as he wrenched his opponents shoulder grabbing the wrist and then throwing his weight onto the arm the crowd cheered and beat drums and gongs in appreciation baabgai smiled at them toothless as a huge baby khasar could not help chuckling at the simple pleasure in the wrestler it would be a fine day batu did not cry out as a whip lashed him across the cheek he could feel the welt rise and his skin became as hot and angry as he was himself the race had begun well enough and he had moved into the first six by the second lap of the city the ground was harder and drier than he expected which favoured some horses more than others as they took the same path for the third lap dust whitened their skin and dried the spit in their mouths to a gritty paste thirst grew steadily in the sun until the weaker ones gasped like birds batu ducked as the whip came again a strip of oiled leather it was one of the uriankhai he saw to his right a dusty boy small and light on the back of a powerful stallion through gritty eyes batu saw the animal was strong and the boy full of malevolent enjoyment as he drew back his arm to lash him once more even over the closepacked thunder of hooves batu heard one of the others laugh and felt fury engulf him they did not command men as he did what did he care for the blood of the uriankhai except to see it splashed in the dust he looked to zan who raced close by his friend was ready to aid him but batu shook his head watching the uriankhai boy all the time when the whip came again batu simply raised his arm so the thong wrapped around his wrist he closed his hand on a length of it the boy gaped but it was too late batu yanked hard using all his weight and strength and heaving his own mount away in the same moment the stirrups almost saved the boy for an instant one leg flailed but then he went down under the hooves and his mount whinnied and bucked almost unseating another rider who shouted angrily batu did not look back he hoped the fall had killed the little bastard they had stopped laughing at the front he noticed five uriankhai riders had entered the race for twoyearolds though they came from two tumans they rode instinctively as a group batu had brought them together somehow with his challenge with his dislike settan of the uriankhai led them he was tall and lithe with soft eyes that watered in the wind and a tail of hair that hung down his back he and his friends exchanged glances as they passed the western gate of karakorum for a fourth time sixteen miles to go and the horses mouths were white with foam their skins dark and rimed with sweat batu and zan moved up to challenge for the lead he could see the uriankhai riders looking back at him he made sure he showed only the cold face as he drew closer and closer behind the leading group thirty other ponies stretched out like a long tail already falling behind khasar was still smiling as he walked back to the archery wall where the judges and crowds waited impatiently for him he ignored their stares as he strode to the line and strung his bow as a brother to genghis and one of the founders of the nation he really couldnt care less if he annoyed the senior men or spoiled temuges beautiful organisation jebes ten had already taken their shots for the second round and the general stood relaxed revealing his confidence khasar frowned at the younger man though this seemed to make jebe chuckle khasar steadied himself knowing he would pass his mood to his own group of archers no one in the archery rounds was weak or a poor shot not a single man there doubted he could win on the right day there was always an element of luck if the breeze shifted just as you loosed or a muscle cramped but the main test was of nerves khasar had seen it many times men who could stand against a line of screaming arabs without a qualm found their hands sweating as they walked up to the line in silence somehow they could not take a full breath as if their chest had swelled to block their throats knowing that was part of the secret of conquering it khasar took long slow breaths ignoring the crowd and letting his own men settle themselves and grow calm the forty targets on the wall even seemed to grow a fraction an illusion he had seen before he looked over his men and found them tense but steady remember lads he murmured every one is a virgin sweet and willing some of his men chuckled rolling their heads on their shoulders to ease the last tension that might spoil their aim khasar grinned to himself weary or not old or not he was going to give jebe a good run he could feel it ready he called to the judges he looked at the high banner on the archery wall the wind had risen to a steady blow from the northeast he adjusted his stance slightly one hundred paces a shot he had made a thousand times a hundred thousand one more long slow breath begin the judge said curtly khasar notched his first shaft to the string and sent it soaring to the line of shields he had marked as his own he waited until he was sure it had struck home then he turned and glanced at jebe raising his eyebrows jebe laughed at the challenge and turned away the line of pounding sweating ponies had lengthened like beads on a cord stretching a mile around the walls of karakorum three of the uriankhai still led the field with two stocky boys almost herding settan towards the finish batu and zan were within reach of them and the group of five had opened a gap on the rest of the riders it would be decided between them and their mounts were snorting to clear their mouths and nostrils spraying mucus and foaming sweat the walls were lined with watching warriors as well as thousands of chin workers for them the day was also a celebration the end of two years of labour with their purses full of coins batu was blind to the watchers to everything except settan and his two companions the dry ground rose as a cloud of dust so that it would be hard to see what he was about to do he felt in his pockets and removed two smooth stones river pebbles that felt right in his hand he and zan had discussed knives or barbing his whip but such wounds would be public some of the judges would not approve even so zan had offered to gash settans neck he hated the taller uriankhai boy who took such pride in tsubodais achievements batu had refused the offer so that he would not lose his friend to vengeance a stone could always have been thrown up from the hooves as they raced even if settan saw what he and zan were doing he would not dare to complain it would seem like whingeing and the warriors would laugh at him as they began the last lap batu fondled the stones past the racing horses he could see wrestlers like brightly coloured birds against the grass beyond them was the archery wall his people were out on the plains and he was among them riding hard it was a good feeling he squeezed with his knees and his mount responded though it was heaving for breath batu moved up and zan followed closely the uriankhai were not sleeping and they moved to block him from settans horse batu smiled at the closest boy and moved his mouth as if he was shouting something all the while he brought his mount closer the boy stared at him and batu grinned pointing vigorously at something ahead he watched in delight as the boy finally leaned closer to hear whatever it was batu was shouting into the wind batu swung the stone hard and connected with the side of his head the boy vanished almost instantly under the hooves just a rolling dusty strip behind them batu took his place as the riderless horse ran ahead settan looked back and stared to see him so close they were caked in dust their hair and skin a dirty white but settans gaze was bright with fear batu held his eyes drinking in strength the other uriankhai boy swerved his mount between them crashing his leg into batu so that he was almost unseated for thumping heartbeats batu had to cling on to the mane as his feet lost the stirrups and he endured blows with a whip that came in a wild frenzy striking his mount as often as himself batu kicked out instinctively and connected with the boys chest it gave him a moment to regain his seat he had dropped one stone but he had another as the uriankhai boy turned back to face him batu threw it hard and yelled to see the stone crack into his nose rocking him and sending bright red blood over the pale dust like a river bursting the boy fell back and batu and zan were alone with settan with two miles still to ride as soon as he saw what was happening settan went all out to open a gap it was his only chance all the horses were at the end of their endurance and with a cry of rage zan began to drift back there was nothing he could do though he threw his stones with furious strength managing to hit settans mount on the haunches with one while the other disappeared in the dust batu cursed under his breath he could not let settan leave him behind he kicked and whipped his horse until they drew level and then batu went half a length ahead he felt strong though his lungs were full of dust that he would cough up for days to come the final corner was in sight and batu knew he could win yet he had known from the beginning that winning would not be enough for him tsubodai would be on the walls batu was certain with one of his uriankhai so close to the finishing line the general would no doubt be cheering him on batu wiped his eyes clearing them of gritty dust he had no love for his fathers memory it did not change his hatred for the general who had cut jochis throat perhaps ogedai would be there too watching the young man he had raised batu allowed settan to cut inside him as they rushed towards the corner the edge of the wall was marked by a marble post decorated with a stone wolf judging it all finely batu let settan come up beside him almost head to head for the finish line he saw settan grin as he scented a chance to go through as they reached the corner batu wrenched his reins to the right and slammed settan against the post the impact was colossal both horse and rider stopped almost dead as the uriankhai boys leg shattered and he screamed batu rode on smiling he did not look back as the high sound faded behind him as he crossed the line he wished his father could have lived to see it to take pride in him his eyes were wet with tears and he scrubbed at them blinking furiously and telling himself it was just the wind and the dust chapter eight as the sun sank towards the horizon ogedai breathed out slowly there had been times when he thought he would not live to stand in his city on this day his hair was oiled and tied into a club on his neck his deel was simple and dark blue without ornament or pretension he wore it belted over leggings and herders soft boots of sheepskin tied with thongs he touched his fathers sword at his waist taking comfort from it at the same time he felt a spasm of irritation at the choices his father had left him if jochi had become khan it would have established a line of the first born instead the great khan had made ogedai his heir the third of four sons in the shadow of that man ogedais own line might wither he could not expect the nation simply to accept his eldest son guyuk as khan after him more than twenty others had a blood claim from genghis and chagatai was just one of the more dangerous ogedai feared for his son in such a tangle of thorns and teeth yet guyuk had survived so far and perhaps that showed the sky fathers approval of him ogedai took a slow breath i am ready barasaghur he told his servant stand back now he strode forward into a swelling sea of noise onto a balcony of polished oak his drummers thundered his arrival and the warriors of his guard tuman roared and beat their armour making a clash of sound that could be heard across the city ogedai smiled acknowledging the crowd as he took his seat overlooking the vast amphitheatre his wife torogene sat down beside him with barasaghur fussing over the folds of her chin dress unseen by the watching masses ogedai reached out she took his hand and squeezed it they had survived two years of intrigue poison attempts on their lives and finally open insurrection ogedais face and body were stiff and battered from his exertions but he was in one piece as the crowd waited patiently the wrestlers who had survived the first two bouts came to take their places in the centre ground below ogedai two hundred and fiftysix men formed up in pairs ready for their last struggle that day bets flashed around the rows of seats from shouted instructions to wooden tokens or even chin printed money and coins it was possible to bet on any aspect of the competition and the entire nation followed the sport the weak and injured the ageing and unlucky had already been weeded out those who remained were the strongest and fastest in a nation which revered martial skill above all else it was his fathers nation and creation his fathers vision of a people horse and warrior sword and bow together ogedai turned in his seat as guyuk stepped onto the balcony he felt his heart contract in the pride and sadness he always felt on seeing the young man guyuk was tall and handsome fit to command a thousand perhaps even a tuman in peacetime beyond that he had no spark of tactical awareness or the subtle touch with his men that would have had them following him into flames he was in all ways an unremarkable officer and he had not yet taken a single wife as if continuing the khans own line meant nothing to him the fact that he resembled genghis in face and eyes only made his weaknesses harder to bear for his father there were times when ogedai could not understand his son at all guyuk bowed elegantly to his parents and took his seat staring out in wonder at the massed crowd he had known little of the struggle in the palace he had barricaded himself into a room with two friends and some servants but no one had come to that part of the palace apparently they had drunk themselves into a stupor despite ogedais relief at seeing him alive it summed his son up that no one had considered him worth killing temuge rushed by the rear of the balcony almost hidden from view by a swarm of his runners and scribes ogedai heard him snapping out orders in his waspish voice and allowed himself a grin as he remembered the conversation with his uncle weeks before despite the old fools fears ogedai had won through he reminded himself to offer the libraries of karakorum to temuge once again as soon as the festival was over in the great oval the twilight began the slow summer drift to grey because of the low city walls the huge structure could be seen from the sea of grass outside it would not be long before a thousand torches were lit making a shape of light that all the nation could witness from the plains ogedai looked forward to the moment the visible signal that he was khan it also meant karakorum was finished at last barring the bloodstains that waited for rain perhaps that too was fitting far below temuge signalled the wrestling judges after a short song to the earth mother the judges blew horns and the men crashed together their hands and legs moving swiftly to take and break grips for some it was over in an instant as with baabgais opponent for others the match became a test of stamina as they heaved and sweated long red marks appearing on their skin ogedai looked down on the field of athletes he knew temuge had planned the events to the last detail he wondered idly if his uncle would manage the whole festival without flaws his people were warriors and shepherds to the last man and woman not sheep never sheep still it was interesting to see the final pair collapsed with legs kicking to a roar and a howl from the crowd a hundred and twentyeight men were victors and they stood flushed and pleased before the nation they bowed to ogedai on the balcony and he got to his feet and raised his sword hand to them showing his pleasure more horns sounded great chin tubes of brass and bronze that droned notes across the field the wrestlers retired at a jog and the heavy gate swung open revealing the main street of the city beyond ogedai squinted to see just as thirty thousand others did their best to catch a glimpse in the distance came a group of runners barechested in the summer heat they had run three laps of the city some twentyfour miles before entering the western gate and heading for the centre ground ogedai leaned out as far as he could to see them and for once guyuk took an interest craning forward with him his face alight with excitement ogedai glanced at him and wondered if he had wagered some huge sum the mongol people were not longdistance runners as a rule they had the stamina but not the build as temuge had explained it some of them limped visibly as they came closer before trying to hide their weakness as the noise surged around them ogedai nodded to himself when he saw that chagatai led them his brother ran smoothly a head taller than most of the other men it was true ogedai feared him even hated his arrogance yet he could not disguise his pride at seeing his own brother leading the way into the amphitheatre pounding up the dusty track to the centre chagatai even began to pull away from the rest but then a small wiry warrior moved up to challenge him forcing a sprint when they had nothing left as they drew level ogedai felt his own heart tremble his breath coming faster come on brother he whispered at his side torogene frowned her hands on the oak bar gripping it she had no interest in the man who had nearly killed her husband she could happily have seen chagatai burst his heart in front of the crowd yet she felt her husbands excitement and she loved ogedai more than anything in the world chagatai threw himself forward at the last crossing the line no more than a heads length before the challenger both men were close to collapse and chagatai struggled visibly for breath his chest heaving he did not rest his hands on his knees ogedai felt a twinge of nostalgia as he remembered his fathers words on the subject if an opponent sees you clinging to your knees he will think you are beaten it was a hard voice to escape as they moved on with the years leaving genghis behind out of a sense of decency guyuk could not cheer his uncle but his skin glowed with a light perspiration ogedai grinned at him pleased to see his son enthralled for once he hoped he had won his bet at least ogedai remained on his feet as the horns sounded once more spilling a note across tens of thousands he closed his eyes for an instant breathing long and slow the crowd fell silent ogedai raised his head as his brasslunged herald bellowed out the words at last you are here to confirm ogedai son of temujin who was genghis as khan of the nation he stands before you as the heir chosen by the great khan is there any other who will challenge for the right to lead if there had been silence before this one had the stillness of death as every man and woman froze not even daring to breathe as they waited guyuk stood back and for a moment raised his hand to touch ogedais shoulder before letting it fall without his father knowing thousands of eyes turned towards chagatai as he stood on the dusty ground with his chest heaving streaked in sweat he too looked up at ogedai on the balcony of oak and his face was strangely proud the moment passed and the release of breath was like a summer breeze followed by a ripple of laughter as people were amused at their own tension and tight expressions ogedai stepped forward so that they could all see him the amphitheatre had been influenced by drawings made by christian monks from rome who had come to karakorum as they had promised it seemed to magnify sound so that his voice flew to every ear he drew the wolfshead sword and held up the blade i make my own oath before you as khan i will protect the people so that we grow strong we have had too many years of peace let the world fear what will come next they cheered his words and in the enclosed bowl the sound was immense almost rocking ogedai back where he stood he could feel it on his skin like a physical force he raised the sword again and they quieted slowly reluctantly down in the field he thought he saw his brother nod to him family was indeed a strange thing now i will take your oath he shouted to his people the herald took up the chant under one khan we are a nation the words crashed back at ogedai and he gripped the sword tighter wondering if the band of pressure on his face was his fathers spirit he heart thumped slower and slower until he thought he could feel every beat the herald called once more to complete the oath and they replied i offer you gers horses salt and blood in all honour ogedai closed his eyes his chest was shuddering and his head felt swollen and strange a sharp pain made him almost stumble as his right arm buckled suddenly weak part of him expected it to end then when he opened his eyes he was still alive more he was khan of the nation in the line of genghis his vision cleared slowly and he took a deep breath of the summer air feeling himself tremble in reaction he felt the thirty thousand faces turned to him and as his strength returned he raised his arms suddenly in joy the sound that followed almost deafened him it was echoed by the rest of the nation who waited outside the city they heard and they responded seeing the torches lit for the new khan that night ogedai walked through the corridors of his palace with guyuk strolling at his side after the excitement of the day neither man could sleep ogedai had found his son throwing bones with his guards and summoned him for company it was a rare gesture from father to son but on that night ogedai was at peace with the world somehow weariness could not touch him though he could hardly remember when he had last slept the bruise on his face had grown colourful it had been masked for the oathtaking with pale powder but ogedai did not know he had streaked it when he scratched his skin the corridors became cloisters that opened out onto the palace gardens still and quiet the moon was dim behind clouds and only the paths could be seen as if they walked pale threads through the dark i would prefer to go with you father to the chin lands guyuk said ogedai shook his head that is the old world guyuk a task begun before you were born i am sending you out with tsubodai you will see new lands with him you will make me proud i do not doubt it you are not proud now guyuk asked he had not meant to ask the question but it was rare for him to be alone with his father and he spoke his thoughts aloud to his distress ogedai did not answer immediately of course but that is a fathers pride guyuk if you intend to follow me as khan you must lead warriors in battle you must make them see you are not as they are do you understand no i dont guyuk replied i have done everything you have asked of me i have led my tuman for years you saw the bearskin we brought back i carried it into the city on a lance and the workers cheered me ogedai had heard every detail he struggled to recall the words of his own father on the subject listen to me it is not enough to lead a pack of young men in a hunt as if it is some great triumph i have seen them with you likedogs puppies you told me to choose my officers to raise them by my own hand guyuk replied there was a sulky tone to his voice and ogedai found himself growing angry he had seen the beauty of the young men guyuk had chosen he could not put words to his unease but his sons companions did not impress him you will not lead the nation with songs and drunken revels my son guyuk came to a sudden halt and ogedai turned to face him you will lecture me on drinking guyuk said didnt you tell me once that an officer must be able to match his men that i should develop a taste for it ogedai winced as he recalled the words i did not know then that you would spend days in your revels taking men from their training i was trying to make you a warrior not a drunken fool well you must have failed then if that is what i am guyuk snapped he would have left but ogedai took him by the arm i did not fail guyuk when have i criticised you have i complained that you have not given me an heir i have not i have said nothing you are the image of my father is it any surprise that i look for some spark of him in you guyuk pulled away from him in the darkness and ogedai heard his breathing grow harsh i am my own man guyuk said at last i am not some weaker branch of the line of genghis or you you look for him in me well stop it you will not find him here guyuk ogedai began again i will go with tsubodai because he is riding as far away from karakorum as anyone his son replied perhaps when i return you will find something to like in me the young man stalked off over the shining paths while ogedai struggled with his temper he had tried to impart a little advice and somehow the conversation had slipped from his control on such a night it was a bitter draught to take before sleep it was another two days of feasting and triumphs before ogedai summoned his most senior men to the palace they sat with bloodshot eyes most of them still sweating from too much meat airag and rice wine considering them ogedai saw they were almost a council of the sort the chin lords used to rule their lands yet the final word was always with the khan it could be no other way he looked down the table past chagatai tsubodai and his uncles to batu who had won in the horse races batu still glowed with the news that he would lead ten thousand and ogedai smiled and nodded to him he had placed good men in the new tuman experienced warriors who would be able to guide batu as he learned ogedai had done his best to honour jochis memory to right the sins of genghis and tsubodai in face and gesture the young man bore a strong resemblance to jochi in his youth in a moment or a glance ogedai could almost forget his brother had died years before it hurt him every time it happened across from batu sat guyuk staring fixedly into space ogedai had not broken through the cool reserve his son had adopted since their words in the garden even as they sat at the table ogedai could not help wishing guyuk had half the fire of jochis boy perhaps batu felt he had to prove himself but he sat as a mongol warrior silent and watchful filled with pride and confidence ogedai saw no sign that batu was intimidated in that company even among renowned leaders such as chagatai tsubodai jebe and jelme the blood of genghis ran in many of the men there and in their sons and daughters it was a fruitful line and a strong one his son would learn to be a man on the great trek ogedai was certain it was a good beginning we have grown beyond the tribes my father knew beyond a single encampment drifting across the plains ogedai paused and smiled we are too many now to graze in one place he used words that tribal leaders had used for thousands of years for when it came time to move on some of them nodded automatically and chagatai thumped his fist on the table in approval not all my fathers dreams will come true though he dreamed of eagles he would approve of my brother chagatai ruling as khan in khwarezm ogedai would have gone on but jelme reached out and clapped chagatai on the back setting off a chorus of approval for the son of genghis tsubodai inclined his head in silence but even he did not stand apart from it when the noise died down ogedai spoke again he would approve of the sacred homeland in the hands of my brother tolui it was tsubodai who reached out and gripped the shoulder of the younger man shaking him slightly to show his pleasure tolui beamed he had known what was coming but the reality of it brought joy to him had fallen the mountains where their people had roamed for thousands of years the sweet grass plains where their grandfather yesugei had been born sorhatani and his sons would be happy there safe and strong and you brother chagatai said where will you rest your head here in karakorum ogedai replied easily this is my capital though i will not rest here yet for two years i have sent out men and women to learn about the world i have welcomed scholars of islam and priests of the christ i know now of cities where the slaves walk barebreasted and gold is as common as clay he smiled to himself at the images in his mind but then his expression became stern his eyes sought out guyuk and held his gaze as he spoke those who cannot conquer must bend the knee they must find strength or serve those of us who have you are my generals i will send you out my hunting dogs my wolves with iron teeth when a city closes its gates in fear you will destroy it when they make roads and walls you will cut them pull down the stones when a man raises a sword or bow against your men you will hang him from a tree keep karakorum in your minds as you go this white city is the heart of the nation but you are the right arm the burning brand find me new lands gentlemen cut a new path let their women weep a sea of tears and i will drink it all part two ad he who controls the heartland controls the world chapter nine the palace gardens of karakorum were still young the chin gardeners had done their best but some of the plants and trees would take decades to reach their full growth despite its youth it was a place of beauty yao shu listened to the rush of water running through the grounds and smiled to himself marvelling once again at the sheer complexity of souls for a son of genghis to commission such a garden was nothing short of a miracle it was a blaze of subtle colours and variety impossible but there it was whenever he thought he understood a man he would find some contradiction lazy men could work themselves to death kind ones could be cruel cruel ones could redeem their lives each day could be different from all the ones that had gone before it each man different not just from others but from the tumbling pieces of himself stretching back into the past and women yao shu paused to stare up through branches to where a lark sang sweetly at the thought of the complexity of women he laughed aloud the bird leapt and vanished calling its panic all the way women were even worse yao shu knew he was a fine judge of character more so than many men why else would ogedai have trusted him with such authority in his absence yet talking to a woman like sorhatani was like staring into an abyss just about anything could be looking back at you sometimes it was a kitten playful and adorable at other times it was a tigress with a bloody mouth and claws toluis wife had that quicksilver quality she was utterly fearless but if he made her laugh she could giggle as helplessly as a girl yao shu glowered to himself sorhatani had allowed him to teach her sons to read and write even to share his buddhist philosophy though she was herself christian despite her own faith she could be utterly pragmatic about her sons as she prepared them for the future he shook his head as he crested a rise in the park at that point in the gardens the architect had indulged a whim building the hill high enough for a walker to see over the garden walls karakorum lay all around him but his thoughts were not with the city he affected the air of a scholar wandering through the gardens without a thought for the world outside yet he was aware of every rustling leaf around him and his eyes missed nothing he had spotted two of sorhatanis sons hulegu was in a young ginkgo tree over to his right obviously unaware that the fanshaped leaves quivered delicately with his breathing arikboke should not have worn red in a garden with few red blossoms yao shu had located him almost immediately the khans chancellor moved through the gardens at the centre of the young hunters always aware of them as they shifted their positions to keep him in sight he would have enjoyed it more if hed been able to complete the triangle with kublai he was the true threat yao shu walked always in balance gripping the earth through his sandals his hands were loose ready to intercept whatever came at him it was perhaps not the behaviour of a good buddhist to take delight in his reflexes but yao shu knew it would also be a lesson for the boys a reminder that they did not yet know everything if he could locate kublai the only one of them with a bow with the garden less than five years old there were only a few large trees all of them fastgrowing willows and poplars one of them stretched across the path ahead of him and yao shu sensed the danger in the spot when he was still far off it was not just that it was suitable for an ambush there was a silence about it a lack of butterflies and movement yao shu smiled the boys had gaped at him when he suggested the game but a man had to move to draw and shoot a bow to get in range they had to ambush him or reveal their presence with movement it was not so hard to outwit the sons of tolui kublai exploded out of the bush his right arm coming back in the classic archers pull yao shu dropped and rolled off the path something was wrong he knew it even as he moved he heard no arrow no slap of a bowstring instead of rising as he had intended he tucked in his shoulder and rolled back to his original position kublai was still visible covered in leaves and grinning there was no bow in his hands yao shu opened his mouth to speak and heard a low whistle behind him another man would have turned but he dropped again skittering off the path and into a jerking run towards the source of the sound hulegu was smiling down the length of the single arrow yao shu had given them that sunny afternoon the buddhist monk skidded to a stop the boy had fast hands he knew too fast maybe still there would be a moment that was clever yao shu said hulegus eyes began to crinkle as his smile broadened moving smoothly without a jerk yao shu stepped close and snatched the arrow off the string hulegu released instinctively and for an instant yao shu thought he had it completely clear then his hand jumped as if it had been kicked by a horse and he spun away the string of woven hide had struck his knuckles jerking the arrow almost out of his grip yao shus fingers ached and he hoped he had not broken one he did not show the boy his pain as he held out the arrow and hulegu took it from him with a shocked expression it had all happened in a heartbeat almost too fast to see that was good getting kublai to give you the bow yao shu said it was his idea hulegu said a little defensively he said you would be watching for his green jacket and ignoring my blue hulegu held the arrow gingerly as if he could not believe what he had just witnessed kublai came up beside them and touched it almost reverently you took it from the string kublai said thats impossible yao shu frowned at such sloppy thinking and clasped his hands behind his back to the boys he was the picture of relaxation the pain in his right hand was still growing he was sure by then that he had cracked a bone perhaps snapped it cleanly in truth it had been a vain move there were a hundred ways he could have removed the threat from hulegu as soon as he was in range a simple nerve block to the elbow would have made him drop the bow yao shu repressed a sigh vanity had always been his weakness speed is not everything he said we practise slowly until you move well until your body has been trained to react without thought but then when you unleash you must move as quickly as you can it gives you force and power it makes you hard to block hard even to see the strongest enemy can be defeated with speed and you are all young and of good stock your grandfather was like a striking snake until the day he died you have that in you if you train hard hulegu and kublai looked at each other as arikboke joined them his face flushed and cheerful he had not seen the khans chancellor snatch an arrow right off the string of a drawn bow return to your studies my young lords yao shu said i will leave you now to hear reports of the khan and your father and mongke hulegu said he will smash our enemies he told me and mongke yao shu agreed with a chuckle he was pleased to see the flicker of disappointment in their faces as they realised their time with him was over for a moment yao shu contemplated kublai genghis would have been proud of his grandsons mongke had grown strong avoiding the ravages of disease and injury he would be a warrior to trust a general to follow yet it was kublai who impressed his tutors most whose mind leapt on an idea and tore it to pieces before it could breathe of course it had been kublai who suggested the switch with the bow it was a simple trick but it had almost worked yao shu bowed to the young men and turned away he smiled as he left them on the paths hearing the whispers as kublai and hulegu described again what they had seen his hand had begun to swell yao shu realised he would have to soak and bind it as he reached the edge of the gardens yao shu repressed a groan at the sight of the men waiting for him almost a dozen scribes and messengers were craning for their first sight of ogedais chancellor sweating in the morning sunlight they were his senior men in turn they commanded many others almost another army of ink and paper it amused yao shu to think of them as his minghaan officers between them they controlled the administration of a vast and expanding area from taxes to import licences and even public works such as the new toll bridges ogedais uncle temuge had wanted the post but the khan had given it to the buddhist monk who had accompanied genghis on almost all his victories and trained his brothers and sons with varying degrees of success temuge had been given the libraries of karakorum and his demands for funds were increasing yao shu knew temuge would be one of those trying to reach him that day the chancellor had six layers of men between supplicants and himself but genghis own brother could usually browbeat them into obedience yao shu reached the group and began fielding their questions snapping answers and making the quick decisions that were the reason ogedai had chosen him he needed no notes or scribes to aid his memory he had found he could retain huge amounts of information and put it all together as he needed it it was through his work that the mongol lands were becoming settled though he used chin scholars as his bureaucracy slowly but surely he was bringing a civilising influence to the mongol court genghis would have hated it but then he would have hated the very idea of karakorum yao shu smiled to himself as the questions came to an end and the group went scurrying back to their work genghis had conquered from a horse but a khan could not rule from a horse ogedai seemed to understand that as his father would never have done yao shu entered the palace alone walking towards his offices more serious decisions waited for him there the treasury was supplying armour weapons food and cloth to three armies and dwindling by the day because of it even the immense sums genghis had amassed would not last for ever though he had a year or two yet before the treasury ran dry of gold and silver by then though the taxes would surely have increased from a trickle to a goodsized river he saw sorhatani walking with two of her maidservants and had a moment to appreciate her before she noticed him her posture marked her out a woman who walked like an empress and always had it made her seem much taller than she really was four sons she had borne and yet she still walked lithely her oiled skin gleaming with health as he stared the women laughed at something their voices light in the cool corridors her husband and eldest son campaigned with the khan thousands of miles to the east by all accounts they were doing well yao shu thought of a report he had read that morning that boasted of enemies piled like rotten logs he sighed to himself at the thought mongol reports tended to lack a sense of subtle understatement sorhatani saw him and yao shu bowed deeply and then endured her taking his hands in both of hers as she insisted on doing whenever they met she did not notice the heat in the broken finger have my boys been working hard for you chancellor she asked he smiled briefly as she released his hands he was still young enough to feel the force of her beauty and he resisted as best he could they are satisfactory my lady he said formally i took them into the gardens for exercise i understand you are to leave the city i should see the lands my husband has been given i can barely remember them from my childhood she smiled distantly i would like to see where genghis and his brothers ran as boys it is a beautiful land yao shu admitted though harsh you will have forgotten the winters there sorhatani shuddered slightly no the cold is one thing i do remember pray for warm weather chancellor and what about my husband my son do you have news of them yao shu replied more carefully to the innocentsounding question i have heard of no misfortunes mistress the khans tumans have secured a tract of land almost to the borders of the sung territory in the south i think they will return in a year perhaps two that is good to hear yao shu i pray for the khans safety yao shu responded though he knew it amused her to goad him on their religions his safety will not be affected by prayers sorhatani as im sure you know you do not pray chancellor she asked in mock amazement yao shu sighed she made him feel old somehow whenever she was in this mood i do not ask for anything except more understanding sorhatani in meditation i merely listen and god what does he say when you listen the buddha said gripped by fear men go to the sacred mountains and sacred groves sacred trees and shrines i am not afraid of death my lady i need no god to comfort me in my fear then i will pray for you too chancellor that you find peace yao shu raised his eyes but he bowed to her again aware that her maids were watching with amused interest you are very kind he murmured her eyes were twinkling he saw his day would be full of a thousand details he had the khans army to supply in the chin lands another in khwarezm under chagatai and a third under tsubodai ready to strike further into the north and west than the mongol nation had ever ventured before yet he knew he would spend much of the day thinking of the ten things he should have said to sorhatani it was simply infuriating ogedai had not brought the war to suzhou the city lay beyond the sung border on the banks of the yangtze river even if it had not been in sung territory it was a place of extraordinary beauty and he could not see it destroyed two tumans rested outside the city walls while only a jagun of a hundred accompanied the khan as ogedai walked with two guards through an enclosure of ponds and trees he felt at peace he wondered if the gardens in karakorum would ever equal such a beautifully planned wilderness he tried not to show his wistful envy to the sung administrator who trotted nervously at his side ogedai had thought karakorum a model of the new world but suzhous position against a great lake its ancient streets and buildings made his capital look rough unfinished by the centuries he smiled at the thought of his fathers response to such inequity it would have amused genghis to take their creation and leave it as smoking rubble his personal comment on the vanities of man ogedai wondered if yao shu had come from a place like suzhou he had never asked the monk but it was easy to imagine men like him walking the perfectly clean streets tolui and mongke had gone to the market square looking for gifts for sorhatani they had just a dozen warriors with them but there was no sense of threat in the town ogedai had passed word to his men that there would be no rape or destruction the penalty for disobeying his edict was clear and suzhou remained terrified but untouched the khans morning had been filled with wonders from the municipal store of black firepowder where the workers all wore soft slippers to the astonishment of a watermill and huge looms producing cloth yet they were not his reason for taking his tumans into sung territory the small city had storehouses of silk and every one of his warriors wore a shirt of that material it was the only weave capable of trapping an arrow as it twisted into the flesh in its own way it was more valuable than armour ogedai could not guess how many lives it had saved unfortunately his men knew its value and few of them ever took off the silk shirts to wash them the smell of rotting silk was part of the miasma that hung around the tumans and as the cloth crusted with salt and sweat it lost its pliability he needed the entire output of suzhou and other places like it destroying the fields of ancient white mulberry bushes that fed the grubs would end production for ever perhaps his father would have burnt them ogedai could not he had spent part of the morning viewing the vats where the grubs were boiled in their cocoons before being unravelled such things were true wonders the workers had not stopped as he passed pausing only to chew the latest grub as they revealed it to the air no one went hungry in the silk sheds of suzhou the khan had not bothered to learn the name of the little man bobbing and sweating at his side struggling to keep up as ogedai toured the water gardens the sung administrator chattered like a frightened bird when he was asked a question at least they could communicate ogedai had yao shu to thank for that and years spent learning the language his time in the water gardens would be brief he knew his tumans were restless among such prosperity for all their discipline there would be problems if he kept them near the city for long he had noticed the men of suzhou had the sense to remove their women from sight but there were always temptations one thousand bolts of silk a year ogedai said suzhou can produce that much yes yes lord high weight good colour and lustre dyed well without spotting or tangled threads the administrator nodded miserably as he spoke whatever happened he suspected he was ruined the mongol armies would go and the emperors soldiers would arrive to ask him why he had brokered trade deals with an enemy of their master he wanted nothing more than to find a quiet place in the gardens write his last poem and open a vein ogedai saw the mans eyes were glassy and assumed he was terrified he made a gesture with his hand and his guard stepped forward and took the administrator by the throat the glassy look vanished but ogedai continued talking as if nothing had happened let him go are you listening now your masters your emperor are not your concern i control the north and they will trade with me eventually ogedais chest was hurting him and he walked with a cup of red wine in his hand constantly refilled with the foxglove powder it eased the ache though his senses swam he drained the cup and held it out the second guard stepped forward instantly with a halffull skin of the wine ogedai cursed as he spilled some of the dark liquid on the cuff of his sleeve i will send my scribes to your house at noon he said he had to speak slowly and firmly so as not to slur his words but the little man did not seem to notice they will work out the details i will pay in good silver do you understand noon not tonight or days from now the administrator nodded he would be dead by noon it did not matter what he agreed with this strange man and his ugly way of speaking the smell alone of the mongols took his breath away it was not just rotten silk and mutton fat but the dense odour of men who had never grown used to washing their skins in the far north where the air was dry in the south they sweated and stank the administrator was not surprised their khan enjoyed the gardens with the pools and the stream it was one of the coolest spots in suzhou something in the mans manner caught ogedais attention and he stopped on a stone bridge over a stream lilies floated serenely on the surface their roots disappearing into the black water i have dealt with chin lords and traders for many years ogedai said holding his cup over the water and watching the reflection below his mirror soul looked back at him kin to the shadow soul that dogged his steps in sunlight its face looked puffy he saw but he drained the cup anyway and held it for another in an action that had become as natural as breathing the ache in his chest subsided yet again and he rubbed idly at a spot on his sternum do you understand they lie and delay and make lists but they do not act they are very good at delays i am very good at getting what i want must i make clear to you what will happen if you do not complete my contracts by today i understand master the man replied it was there again some glint in his eyes that made ogedai unsure the little man had somehow moved beyond fear his eyes were darkening as if he cared for nothing that too ogedai had seen before and he began to raise his hand to have the man slapped awake the administrator jerked back and ogedai laughed spilling more wine some of it fell into the water like drops of blood there is no escape from me not even in death he knew he was slurring by then but he felt good and his heart was just a distant thumping pressure if you take your own life before the agreements are finished i will have suzhou destroyed each brick removed from its companion then shattered in fire what is not wet will burn administrator do you understand heh what is not wet will burn he saw the spark of resistance die in the mans eyes replaced by fatalism ogedai nodded it was hard to govern a people who could calmly choose death as a response to aggression it was one of many things he admired about them but he did not have the patience that day from past experience he knew he had to make the choice to die result in such grief that they could only live and continue to serve him run and make your preparations administrator i will enjoy this little garden for a while longer he watched as the man scurried away to do his bidding his guards would hold back the messengers that came constantly to him at least until he was ready to leave the stone under his bare forearms was very cool he drained the cup once again his fingers clumsy in the late afternoon twenty thousand warriors mounted up outside suzhou with ogedai and tolui ogedais elite guard made up half his forces named men with a bow and sword seven thousand of his tuman rode black horses and wore black armour with red facings many of the grizzled warriors had served with genghis and they deserved their reputation for ferocity the remaining three thousand were his night and day guards who rode horses of pale brown or piebald and wore more common armour baabgai the wrestler had joined them the personal gift of khasar to his khan with the sole exception of the wrestling champion they were men selected for intelligence as well as force it was genghis who had begun the rule that a man had to serve in the khans guards before he could lead even a thousand in battle it was said that the least of them could command a minghaan if he chose to princes of the blood held the tumans but the khans guards were the professionals who made them work the sight of them never failed to please ogedai the sheer power he could wield through them was intoxicating exciting khasars tuman was to the north with lines of scouts between them it would not be hard to find him again and ogedai was satisfied with the mornings work as well as warriors he had brought an army of scribes and administrators to chin lands in order to take a tally of everything he won the new khan had learned from his fathers conquests for a people to be at peace there had to be a foot on their necks taxes and petty laws kept them quiet even comforted them somehow though he found that mystifying it was no longer enough to destroy their armies and move on perhaps the existence of karakorum was the spur but he had men in every chin city running things in his name he had punished skins of wine and airag that day more than he could remember as they rode north ogedai knew he was very drunk he didnt care he had his contracts for silk sealed by the terrified local lord after he was dragged from his town house to witness the deal the sung emperor would either honour them or give ogedai an excuse to invade his territory his buttocks were still rubbed raw each day by the wooden saddle so that his clothes stuck to the pale fluids that seeped out of the broken skin he could no longer undress without first soaking himself in a warm bath but that too was just a minor hardship he had not expected to live even so long and each day was a joy he saw the dust clouds ahead after just a short ride that cracked his scabs and made them weep all over again sung lands were ten miles behind by then ogedai knew he would not be expected from the south he smiled to think of the panic that would follow the appearance of his tumans in the distance khasar was engaging the last remaining army the chin could field outnumbered on an open plain all khasar could do was hold them but he knew the tumans with ogedai and tolui were coming there would be a bloody slaughter and ogedai began to sing as he rode enjoying himself chapter ten khasars sharp eyes picked out the banners of ogedai khan the ground was far from perfect a grassy plain where there had been no herds for years so that saplings and scrub bushes grew everywhere he stood on his saddle balancing casually while his mount cropped the grass good lad ogedai he muttered khasar had taken a position on a small rise outside arrow range but close enough to the enemy to direct his attacks the army of the emperor was visibly battered after days fending off the mongol horsemen yet the chin regiments were disciplined and tough as khasar had learned to his cost time and again they had held a solid line of pikes against his men the ground prevented a full charge with lances and reduced him to picking them off with waves of arrows as the morning passed his archers had killed dozens over and over but all the while the chin soldiers moved steadily south and the mongol tuman drifted with them khasar saw weary heads turn to see the new threat staring at the streaming orange banners of the mongol khan somewhere in those shining chin ranks a particular young man would be raging at the sight khasar thought as a boy emperor xuan had knelt to genghis when the great khan had burnt his capital khasar himself had trapped the young man in the city of kaifeng before being called home it was like hot blood and milk in his stomach to know the chin emperor was once again in play his life in khasars hands it was an ending long in coming even then the emperor had almost reached the southern empire where his family still ruled in splendid isolation if genghis had been given just a few more years he would have entered those lands khasar was certain he knew nothing of the twists and turns of politics between the two nations except that the sung seemed to have armies in the millions it was enough for the moment to bring death to the emperor of the north it was enough to ride with his tuman he was only sorry genghis had not lived to see it lost in wistful memories khasar halfturned to give an order to ho sa and samuka before he remembered they were both dead years before he shivered slightly in the wind there had been so many dead since he and his brothers had hidden from their enemies in a tiny fold of ground with winter on the way from those frightened and starving children a new force had entered the world but only kachiun temuge and khasar himself had survived the cost had been high though he knew genghis had not begrudged it the best of us khasar whispered to himself watching ogedais forces ride steadily closer he had seen enough he dropped back into the saddle and whistled sharply two messengers galloped up to his side they were both barearmed black with dirt and wearing only silk tunics and leggings to be fast and light minghaans one to four to bring pressure on their western flank khasar snapped to the first do not let the enemy drift out of the path of the khan the messenger raced away across the battlefield his young face alight with excitement the other waited patiently while khasar watched the ebb and flow of men like an old hawk over a field of wheat he saw hares racing towards him from some burrow before his delighted bondsmen shot them through with arrows and dismounted to pick them up it was another sign that the ground was rough and filled with obstacles a charge would be even more dangerous when a horse could snap a leg in a hole and kill its rider with the impact khasar winced at the thought there was no easy victory to be snatched not that day the chin army outnumbered his by more than six to one even when ogedai and tolui arrived it would be two to one khasar had harried and cut them as they moved south but he had been unable to force the emperor to stand and fight it had been ogedai himself who suggested the vast circle around to come back from the south three days had gone past with agonising slowness until he had begun to think the emperor would find his way to the border and safety before ogedai even returned khasar found himself wishing it was genghis coming from the south it broke his heart to imagine it and he shook his head to clear it of an old mans dreams there was work to do take this order to yusep he told the messenger grip the east wing force them into a funnel towards the khan use all the shafts if they must he is to command minghaans five to eight i have two thousand as a reserve acknowledge your orders khasar waited impatiently as the scout repeated them then dismissed him to gallop away staring across the open plain khasar wondered how the chin emperor had grown no longer a proud little boy he would be a man in his prime but denied his birthright the lands he had known were ruled by mongolian princes the huge armies of his father had been crushed all he had left were these perhaps that was why they fought so hard he thought they were the last hope of their emperor and they knew it the sung border lay tantalisingly close and they were still strong still many like multicoloured wasps khasar rode back to his reserve where they sat their mounts easily and watched the enemy resting their elbows on the saddle horns they straightened as khasar took his position with them knowing he would notice every small detail ahead they watched the chin ranks reform to deal with the new threat bristling with pikes and spears as khasar had expected they began to manoeuvre away from the direct route south he would not have minded if ogedai had not been there the chin emperor wanted to reach the sung border if he could be forced along its edges without crossing eventually his army would tire and the mongol tumans would tear slices off its flanks sunset was still some way off and the foot soldiers of the emperor would weaken before the mongol riders the chin cavalry had been khasars first targets torn away from those they protected over days of blood and arrows those who survived were deep in the centre humiliated and broken when ogedai reached the chin they would be trapped between two foes khasar hummed under his breath enjoying the prospect nothing sapped morale like the fear of being attacked from behind he watched as his first four thousand warriors rode slowly through a swarm of bolts ducking low in their saddles and trusting their armour some crashed down but the rest forced their way closer and closer small trees lashed at them and khasar saw animals stumble one fell to its knees as the ground subsided but the rider heaved the animal up by main force and went on khasar whitened his own grip on his reins as he watched at fifty paces the air was thick with whining bolts and the closest chin ranks were throwing spears though most fell short or tumbled in the grass the mongol lines were ragged over the poor ground but their bows bent as one the emperors soldiers flinched back despite their roaring officers they had faced the same storm too many times and they were desperate from the rapidly closing range the mongol bows could hammer through almost anything his men heaved with writhing shoulder muscles holding the strings with bone thumb rings no other bows had that power nor men the strength to use them they released with a snap that echoed to where khasar watched the volley tore a great hole in the enemy lines yanking men backwards so that their pikes and crossbows jerked up all along the line khasar nodded sharply neither he nor jebe had won the gold at the festival that honour had gone to tsubodais archers even so this was work he knew bodies fell with many shafts in them and screaming carried on the breeze to where khasar sat he grinned they had broken through the armys skin he longed to give an order to follow with axe and lances deep into them hed seen armies cut into strips in such a way for all their strength and drums and coloured banners the mongol discipline held hardened in battles across the world his men loosed shaft after shaft picking their targets from men trying to turn away or hiding behind shields as they were battered to pieces the outermost fringes met with swinging swords and more men fell on both sides before the minghaan officers blew a low note and pulled them back jubilant a ragged cheer sounded from untouched chin ranks further back but then khasars men turned in the saddle and loosed a final shaft just as the enemy stood tall again the sound choked off and the minghaans whooped as they wheeled to a new position and prepared to come in again the movement of the chin army had been slowed over half a mile and the wounded were left behind in wailing writhing heaps here they come khasar murmured the khan enters the field he could see ogedais bannermen in the host that trotted across the broken land the chin ranks braced to meet them lowering shields and pikes that could gut a charging horse as they reached two hundred paces the mongol arrows started to come in black waves the crackle of thousands of bows releasing was like a raging bonfire a sound that khasar knew as well as any other he had them he was suddenly certain the emperor would not pass to safety that day another thump sounded far louder than the bowstring rattle he had known from childhood it boomed like rolling thunder and was followed by a breath that washed across his men khasar stared at a rising cloud of smoke that obscured part of the lines where ogedai and the chin force had clashed what was that he demanded one of his bondsmen answered immediately gunpowder my lord they have firepots in the field khasar said he cursed loudly he had seen the weapons used on city walls and he knew their effect iron pots filled with black powder could rip shards of hot metal through the packed ranks of his men they had to be thrown far enough for the defenders not to be torn apart themselves he could not imagine how the chin were using them without killing their own people before he could gather his stunned thoughts another great crack sounded at a distance the sound was muted but he saw men and horses blown back from the explosion landing brokenly on the grass the smell came to him then acrid and bitter some of his men coughed in the breeze the chin cheered with more energy and khasars face became savage every instinct urged him to gallop towards the enemy before they could use the small advantage they had won ogedais advance had lost its momentum and only the edge of the two armies were in contact like struggling insects over the distance khasar forced himself under control this was no raid against tribesmen the chin had numbers and nerve enough to lose half their men just to gut the khan of the mongols the sky father knew the chin emperor had the desire khasar felt his men staring at him waiting for the word he clenched his jaw grinding his teeth hold wait he ordered watching the battle his two thousand could mean the difference between victory and defeat or just be lost in the mass the choice the decision was his ogedai had never heard thunder like it he had been riding well back in the ranks as the armies came together he had roared as the arrows flew thousands at a time again and again before his warriors drew swords and hit the men around him had surged forward each man keen to show courage and win the khans approval it was a rare opportunity for them to be within sight of the man who ruled the nation no one wanted to waste it and they prepared to fight like maniacs showing no pain or weakness as they went forward a thumping blast threw men backwards and left ogedais ears ringing dirt spattered him as he tried groggily to understand what had happened he saw a man unhorsed standing numbly with blood running down his face a small group lay dead while many more twitched and pulled at metal stuck in their flesh the explosion had deafened and stunned those closest as the ranks surged forward ogedai saw one unhorsed man stumble into the path of a rider and go down under the hooves ogedai shook his head to clear the sound of rushing air the emptiness his heart pounded in his ears and a wide band of pressure had grown in his head he thought of a man he had once seen tortured a flashing image of leather thongs bound around the head and tightened with a stick it was a simple device but it produced appalling agony as the skull shifted and eventually broke ogedais head felt like that as if the band were slowly tightening another booming explosion seemed to raise the ground beneath them horses squealed and reared their eyes wild as the warriors fought savagely to control them ogedai could see black specks hurled high into the air from the chin forces he did not know what they were or how to counter them with a sudden shock that cut through even his drunken state he realised he could die on that stony plain it was not a matter of courage or even endurance but mere luck he shook his head again to clear it and his eyes were bright his body was weak his heart feeble but above all things he had luck another crack whipped across the field followed by two more ogedais men were wavering shocked into immobility to his right toluis tuman had gone further but they too were stunned by massive explosions that killed men on both sides ogedai drew his fathers sword in one swift gesture bellowing defiance as he held it up his bondsmen saw his recklessness and it lit their blood they came with him as he kicked his mount forward already grinning at the maniac khan charging the enemy on his own they were all young men they rode with the most beloved son of genghis marked by the sky father khan of the nation their lives were not worth as much as his and they threw them away as carelessly as they would a broken rein the explosions came faster as more of the black balls were flung sputtering into the air to land around mongol feet as he thundered forward ogedai saw one unhorsed warrior pick one up the khan shouted but the man was blown into a bloody mass the air was suddenly full of whining flies horses and men screamed as needles of iron tore into them all around ogedais bondsmen plunged into the fray protecting their khan at the centre lowered pikes stopped the horses but more and more of his men had been unhorsed and they killed the pikewielders with knives and swords clearing a path as horses shoved and sweated at their backs ogedai saw another black ball drop almost at his feet and one of his men threw himself on top of it the whump of sound was muted though a small red crater appeared in the mans back and a piece of bone jumped out almost to the height of a man those around ogedai flinched but they stood immediately straight ashamed that the khan might have seen their fear ogedai realised he had seen some sort of answer to the weapons he raised his voice to carry across the lines fall on them as they land for your khan he shouted the order was repeated down the lines as the next wave of missiles were thrown high there were six of the flying iron balls each fizzing with a short fuse ogedai watched in pride as warriors struggled to reach them smothering the threat so that their friends might live he turned back to the enemy and saw fear in the chin faces there was only vengeful fury in his own bows he roared clear a path and bring up lances lances here there were tears in his eyes but not for those who had given their lives there was joy in every waking breathing moment the air was cold and bitter in his throat filled with the strange smell of burning powder he breathed it deeply and for a time the band across his face and head seemed to ease as his men ripped a gash in the chin ranks khasar beat his fist against his armour in unconscious approval of ogedais manoeuvres the two mongol tumans had been rocked back by the explosions moving instinctively away from the source of such sound and snaps of light khasar had seen the khans own bondsmen overcome their fear and hack open the chin lines the thumps of explosions were suddenly muffled and he no longer saw the spray of stones and dirt each time one of them went up it was as if they dropped into the mongol army and were swallowed he grinned at the thought i think the khan is eating those iron balls he said to his men look he is still hungry he wants more to fill his stomach he hid his own fear at such a reckless charge from ogedai if he died that day chagatai would rule the nation and everything they had struggled for would have been in vain his experienced eye ran over the battlefield as he trotted his horse south keeping them in range in that at least the chin emperor had not wavered his men moved as quickly as they could struggling over the dead as they marched such an army could not easily be stopped by half its number it was a tactical problem and khasar struggled with it if he ordered thinner lines spread like a net the chin could break through with a spear thrust if he kept the depth of men they could be passed on the flanks as the emperor forced each dogged step towards the border it must be an agony for him khasar thought to be so close and yet have an enemy boiling around him his own minghaans killed almost at their leisure in the enemy rear leaving a trail of bodies on the rough grass the chin would not turn so intent were they on reaching the border as he trotted south behind them khasar came across one soldier draped on the limbs of a low thorn tree he glanced at the man and saw his face twitch and the eyes open in sightless agony khasar reached out with his sword and flicked the tip across the throat it was not mercy he had not killed that day and he longed to be part of the battle the action bit away a piece of his control and he snapped an order to the two thousand warriors with him ride forward with me we do no good here and the khan is in the field he cantered to just a hundred paces behind the enemy looking for the best place and opportunity to strike he sat as tall as he could in the saddle staring into the distance in the hope of seeing the emperors own bannermen they would be somewhere close to the heart of the massed ranks he was certain a barrier of men horses and metal to bring just one desperate ruler to safety khasar wiped his sword clean on a rag before sheathing it his men picked their targets and sent shafts into the chin soldiers with pitiless accuracy it was hard to hold himself back and his control was wearing thin ogedais charge had brought him past the outer lines of pikemen the chin regiments were disciplined but discipline alone could not win the day though they did not break they were cut down by the marauding horsemen their lines were sundered driven back or reduced to cores and knots of struggling men to be spitted on shafts horns sounded in the chin ranks and ten thousand swordsmen drew their blades and charged screaming defiance they ran into a constant barrage of arrows shot from close range the front lines were ground down and trampled they ran forward as a mass then each rank found themselves in twos threes and lonely dozens facing the swords of horsemen seeing such a slaughter those behind hesitated as the mongols came lunging forward in a line in a few heartbeats they accelerated to a full gallop and struck the charge cleanly unstoppably the chin lines crumpled further back tolui saw his brother had gone deep into the enemy formations the khans wedge of bondsmen killing as if they thought they could win right through to the other side he was in awe of ogedai then he had not expected to see him go insane on a battlefield but there was no holding him back and his bondsmen were hardpressed to keep up ogedai rode as if he was immortal and nothing touched him though the air was filled with death and smoke tolui had never before seen smoke on a battlefield it was a new element and his men hated to see it drifting towards them he was becoming used to the strange odour but the thunderous cracks and thumps were some of the most terrifying moments he had ever known he could not hold back not with ogedai moving into the mass the frustration of being unable to prevent the drift south was telling on all of them it was close to becoming a chaotic brawl with the mongol advantages of speed and accuracy sacrificed to vengeful fury tolui directed his minghaan officers to protect the khan moving swiftly to bolster ogedais flanks and widen the wedge he pressed into the chin army he felt a surge of pride as his son mongke passed on the order to his thousand and they followed him without hesitation there had been few occasions when genghis rode to war with his sons amidst the fear for mongkes safety tolui could grin with pleasure at seeing such a strong young man sorhatani would be proud when he told her the rolling smoke cleared again and tolui expected another wave of thunder to follow he was closer by then and the chin army was spiralling around his men moving south always south tolui cursed them as a chin soldier passed almost under his horses head blindly trying to stay in marching rank tolui killed him with a brief thrust from above choosing a point on the neck where armour did not protect him he looked up and found hundreds more marching rapidly towards his position they were armoured like common soldiers but each carried a black iron tube he saw they struggled with the weight but they strode closer with a strange confidence their officers barked orders to load and brace tolui knew instinctively that he should not give them time tolui bawled his own orders his voice already hoarse a thousand of his men turned to charge the new threat letting ogedais wedge move on without them they followed their general without hesitation swinging swords and loosing arrows at anything in his path the chin soldiers were hacked down as they struggled with fuses and iron tubes some were crushed by horses others died as they pressed a spluttering taper to the weapon many of the tubes fell to the ground and in response mongol warriors yanked their mounts away or even threw themselves on top with their eyes tightly shut they did not catch them all a rattle of lighter cracks sounded rippling across the lines tolui saw a man snatched away from him torn from his saddle before he could even cry out another horse crashed to its knees its chest running with blood the sound was appalling and then the smoke rolled in a great grey wave and they were blind tolui laid about him with his sword until it snapped and he stared at the hilt in disbelief something fell against him whether an enemy or one of his own men he did not know he felt the life go out of his mount and staggered clear before it could roll on him he drew a long knife from his boot holding it high as he limped across the smoking ground more of the strange cracks sounded around him as the tubes fired their load of stone and iron some of them spinning uselessly on the ground as their owners lay dead tolui did not know how long they had been fighting in the thick smoke he was almost overwhelmed with fear he calmed himself with calculations forcing his mind to work amidst the noise and chaos the chin army could reach the border by sunset it lay no more than a few miles to the south by then but they had suffered and died for every step as the smoke cleared tolui darted one look at the sun seeing it closer to the horizon as if it had dropped while he was wreathed in smoke he could hardly believe it as he grabbed a riderless horse and held the reins while he searched the ground for a good sword the grass was slick and bloody as he walked his stomach heaved at the stench of bowels and death mingled with burnt black powder a bitter combination he never wanted to know again xuan the son of heaven rode untouched by bloodshed though he could smell the odour of gunpowder in the evening air around him the mongol tumans tore and screeched at his noble soldiers ripping at them with teeth and iron xuans face was cold as he stared south above their heads he could see the border but he did not think the mongols would hold back as he passed the simple stone temple that marked the boundary between two nations by some chance the chin army had wound its way back onto the main road the white stone building was a distant speck an oasis of peace with clashing armies converging on it xuan sweated in his armour shamed by the thought that he could race his mount alone along that road his horse was a fine cut stallion but xuan was not a fool he could not enter sung lands as a beggar his army protected his body but also the last wealth of the chin kingdoms in a thousand sacks and bags his wives and children were there as well hidden by the walls of iron and loyal men he could not leave them to the mercies of the mongol khan with his wealth he would be welcomed by his cousin with an army he would have the sung emperors respect he would have a place at the table of nobles as they planned a campaign to take back his ancestral lands xuan winced at the thought there was little love for his bloodline in the sung court the emperor lizong was a man of his fathers generation who viewed chin territory as his own claiming a mere error of history that it was not already his by right there was a chance that xuan was putting his hand into a rat hole by placing himself in sung power there was no other choice mongol goatherders strode his lands as if they owned them peering into every storehouse tallying the wealth of every village for taxes they would never know how to spend the shame of it should have been overwhelming but xuan had never known peace he had grown used to the humiliation of losing his kingdom piece by piece to an army of locusts and seeing his fathers capital burn surely his sung cousin would not underestimate the threat yet there had been conquerors before tribal leaders who raised an army and then died their empires always fell apart broken by the arrogance and weakness of lesser men xuan knew emperor lizong would be tempted to ignore them and simply wait for a century or two he wiped sweat from his eyes blinking at the sting of salt time cured so many ills in the world but not these cursed tribesmen the mongols had lost their great conqueror at the height of his power and simply carried on as if one man did not matter xuan did not know if it made them more civilised or just a pack of wolves with another taking the lead he clenched his fist in pleasure as he heard the rippling snaps of his gunners he had so few but they were wonderful fearsome weapons that too was something he took to the sung vital knowledge of the enemy as well as ways to destroy him a wolf would not stand against a man with a burning brand xuan knew he could be that weapon if he had the time and space to plan he was jerked from his reverie by the shouting of his officers they were pointing to the south and he shaded his eyes from the setting sun to look into the distance an army was approaching the border barely two miles away he could see huge fastmoving square formations pouring over the hills like wasps the sung regiments were reacting to the threat he thought or answering the arrogance of a khan who had dared to enter their lands as xuan watched concentrating he began to realise that it was no minor force no regional governor the emperor himself would never leave his capital for the filthy business of warfare it had to be one of his sons perhaps even his heir no one else could command so many the squares layered the ground like a cloth pattern each at least five thousand fresh men well trained and supplied xuan tried to count them but it was impossible with the dust and distance the men around him were already jubilant but he narrowed his eyes to think staring around him at the mongol forces who still growled at his heels if his cousin closed the border he would not survive xuan scratched irritably at a line of sweat on his face leaving a red mark from his fingernails surely they would not stand by and watch him killed he did not know he could not know the tension made bile rise in his stomach as his horse brought him closer and closer the calm centre of a whirling storm taking a deep breath xuan summoned his generals and began to bark orders to them the commands rippled out and the edges of his army hardened men carrying heavy shields raced into position setting up a strong defence that would hold the mongols long enough to reach the border it was his lastditch plan just to survive but at that point it might also serve to keep as many soldiers alive as possible he had fought a defensive battle for days if the border was closed he would have to turn at bay and strike down the khan he had the numbers still and his men were hungry to give back the blows they had taken the thought was intoxicating and xuan wondered if he should attack even if the border army opened to let him through all he had wanted was to find safety with enough men to make him a powerful voice in the councils that would follow yet the mongol khan remained outnumbered the grubby mongol shepherd would be dumbstruck and unnerved at the sight of so many pristine regiments the first sung ranks had reached the border and halted perfect lines of coloured armour and sung banners streaming as xuan stared at them he saw a puff of smoke in the line and heard a crack as a rock ball came flying over the grass it hit no one but the message was not for him the sung prince had brought cannon to the field huge metal tubes on wheels that could smear a line of horses and men with a single shot let the khan digest that little detail xuans army marched on his heart beating like a birds as they approached the dark lines chapter eleven khasar could hardly believe the size of the army that had raced to the sung border stretching back over the land the southern nation had not had its battle of the badgers mouth as the north had their emperor had not sent out armies and seen them battered destroyed routed his soldiers had never run in terror from mongol riders khasar hated them for their splendour and he wished again that genghis was there if only to see his brothers anger kindle at the sight the sung lines stretched for miles dwarfing the marching squares of their chin cousins as they drifted in khasar saw the pace to the border had slowed he wondered if the chin emperor knew whether he would be allowed to escape or be turned away that thought gave some hope the only small comfort to be weighed against khasars fury and indignation he had won the battle the chin regiments had fought to keep him away for days but not once had they sallied out they had only attacked when his men pierced their ranks his tuman had soaked the ground in their blood suffered explosions and storms of hot metal his men had been burnt and broken cut and maimed they had earned the victory and now it was to be snatched from them his reserve of two thousand were still fresh khasar sent up a flag signal to the camel riders keeping pace with him the boys on the beasts rode with the naccara drums strapped on either side all along the lines they began a thunder striking left and right with both hands the armoured horses leapt forward at the signal and the warriors brought their heavy lances down slowly balancing them in a casual display of strength and skill the wall of riders matched the drums with a screaming roar from their throats that terrified their enemies khasars two thousand hit their full speed just twenty paces from the shaken chin the general had time to see some of them jam their long shields into the earth but only a solid shield wall could have stopped his charge good officers would have halted them mingled shields and pikemen together in an unbroken barrier the emperors men had to march terrified the mongol ponies had lightly armoured cloth covering their faces and chests the warriors themselves wore layered scale armour and helmets and carried lances and swords as well as saddlebags full of supplies they crashed into the chin lines like a mountain falling khasar saw the closest ranks collapse the men broken by lances and hooves some of the horses refused and whinnied in wildeyed distress as their riders sawed at their mouths shouting angrily as they brought them round again others plunged straight through the chin their lances snapping with the force of the strike they tossed aside the broken hilts and followed with swords using the muscles from twenty years of bow work to lay about them tirelessly cutting down always down onto the snarling faces khasar was spattered with warm red drops as his horse was killed and he jumped clear he tasted someones blood on his lips and he spat in disgust ignoring the outstretched arm of one of his bondsmen as the man tried to grab him up into a saddle his fury at the emperors looming escape blurred his judgement on foot he stalked the enemy soldiers his sword held low until they attacked his counters were vicious and accurate and as he strode forward with his men the chin backed away rather than engage him he could feel the sullen gaze of the emperors soldiers watching in silence as they marched away from him khasar grunted as he trapped his sword in a shield leaving it and backhanding a soldier before snatching another one from the ground only then did he mount behind a warrior to see what was happening in the distance the front ranks of the chin army had reached the sung lines find me a horse khasar shouted into the ear of the bondsman the man wheeled and rode out of the cup they had cut for themselves it closed behind them the battered shields rising once again khasar looked for ogedai his blood cooling as he considered the threat a child could have seen the position was hopeless faced with such an army all the tumans could do was get clear if the sung regiments attacked the mongols would be forced away routed on the border the only choice was between a dignified retreat and running as if there were wolves after them khasar ground his teeth until his jaw hurt there was no help for it his back straight xuan trotted his horse towards the sung line flanked by three generals in ornate armour and cloaks they were all dusty and tired but xuan rode as if there were no possibility of being turned away he knew he had to be the first one there of course the sung would refuse common soldiers the right to enter their realm only xuan could shape the rules around him as the reigning emperor he was the son of heaven it was a title without a nation an emperor without cities yet he kept his dignity as he reached the first line of soldiers they did not move and xuan reached down to brush a speck of dust from his gloves he showed no discomfort as he stared over the heads of the sung army he could hear the mongols ripping at his own men but he did not move or acknowledge it there was a chance that his cousin lizong would allow his army to be destroyed while they all waited xuan seethed at the thought but there was nothing he could do he had come as a supplicant to the sung lands if the emperor chose to remove his strength in such a way xuan knew he could not react it was a bold stroke and he could almost applaud it let the damaged chin emperor enter but let him see his army withered to just a few men first let him come on his knees begging for favour all xuans choices all his plans and stratagems had been reduced to one course of action he had ridden up to the lines if they opened to let him in he could pass to safety with whoever remained alive in his army xuan tried not to think what might happen if his poisonous sung cousins had decided to remove him from the balance it was not beyond them to have manoeuvred him to exactly this position waiting waiting waiting he could sit his horse in front of them until the mongols had finished slaughtering his army and came for him there was a chance lizong would not lift a hand to save him even then xuans face was utterly without emotion as he studied the sung soldiers whatever happened was his fate and not to be denied some hidden spark of him was white with fury but nothing showed as casually as he could he turned to one of his generals and asked about the cannon the sung had used the general was sweating visibly but he replied as if they were at a military inspection it is a fieldpiece imperial majesty similar to the ones we have used on city walls bronze is poured into a mould and then filed and polished black powder burns with great fierceness sending a ball leaping out to cause terror in the enemy xuan nodded as if he was fascinated by the spirits of his ancestors how long must he wait such a large cannon would be very heavy he said stiffly it must be difficult to move over rough terrain the general nodded pleased that his master had engaged him in conversation though he knew the stakes as well as anyone it sits on a wooden cart imperial majesty it is wheeled but yes it takes many men and oxen to drag it into position more are needed to carry the stone balls the powder bags the swabs and fuses perhaps you will have the chance to inspect one more closely when we enter sung territory xuan looked at the general in reproof for his lack of subtlety perhaps general tell me now about the sung regiments i do not know all these banners the man began to recite the names and histories an expert in his field as xuan knew very well he cocked his head to listen to the droning voice but all the time xuan watched the sung lines the son of heaven glanced up as an officer rode a magnificent stallion through to the borderline he tried not to show how his heart leapt it was hard to allow his general to finish the litany of names but xuan forced himself to listen making the sung officer wait for both of them his precious army was being butchered as he nodded at tedious detail but xuans face was calm and interested at last his general had the sense to subside and xuan thanked him appearing to notice the sung officer for the first time the man dismounted as soon as their eyes met he came forward and prostrated himself on the dusty ground before touching his forehead to the generals stirrup he did not look at xuan as he spoke i bear a message for the son of heaven speak your message to me soldier i will tell him the general replied the man prostrated himself again then rose his imperial majesty bids you welcome in his lands son of heaven may you live ten thousand years xuan would not lower himself to reply to a mere soldier the message should have been delivered by someone of noble rank and he wondered what to make of the subtle insult he barely listened as his general completed the formalities xuan did not glance behind him as he walked his mount forward sweat trickled down his back and from his armpits under his armour he knew his undertunic would be sopping wet the sung lines stood apart as he moved a rippling motion that spread along them for half a mile in this way the last chin army could walk between the ranks and the border was still held against their mutual enemy xuan and his generals crossed the invisible line showing no emotion to those who watched them the chin ranks began to follow them like a blister collapsing into skin ogedai watched in furious disbelief he saw pavilions rise amidst the sung ranks great squares of peachcoloured silk banners floated on the wind marking out regiments of bowmen pikemen lancers it was the sight of the fresh cavalry that broke through his battle madness regiments of horsemen stared out onto the broken plain with its trail of dead would the sung be able to resist a sudden charge as soon as the chin emperor was safe only the setting sun would stay their hand and perhaps not even then the mongol ponies had ridden for days they were as weary as their riders and for once the khan himself was in the field vastly outnumbered and with every advantage taken away ogedai shook his head he had seen the puff of smoke that revealed the presence of heavy guns it was a thought for another day but he did not see how he could ever bring such weapons to a battlefield they were too slow too heavy for an army whose chief strength had always been in its speed and manoeuvres in the distance he saw a small group of horses move through the sung lines perhaps ten thousand still marched to follow them but the chin emperor had passed through the net ogedai felt a wave of weariness replace the thrilling energy of the fighting he could hardly believe he had walked without fear he had faced his enemies and survived unmarked for just an instant a heartbeat pride swelled in him even so he had failed the band across his head returned tightening he imagined mockery in every concerned face he could almost hear the whispered voices among his warriors genghis would not have failed his father would somehow have plucked victory from disaster ogedai gave fresh orders and the three tumans pulled back from the retreating chin ranks the men had been expecting the command and the minghaans moved quickly and easily into squares of horse facing the sung border the sudden silence was like a pressure and ogedai rode slowly along the lines of his own men his face flushed and sweating if the sung generals wanted him badly enough they would not even wait for the rest of the chin to come across half the sung army could launch an attack at that moment ogedai swallowed working his tongue around a mouth so dry he thought he would choke he gestured to a messenger and the man brought him a skin of red wine it moistened his lips and he gulped at it sucking desperately on the leather teat the pain in his head was growing all the time and he realised his vision was blurred he thought at first it was just sweat in his eyes but it remained no matter how roughly he rubbed at them as the mongol tumans came to order hundreds were still panting or binding gashes ogedai saw tolui trotting a mare across the broken ground towards him the two brothers met with a quick glance of resignation and tolui turned his mount to watch the chin emperor escape them once again he has a lot of luck that man tolui said softly but we have his land and his cities we have taken away his armies except for that rabble of survivors enough ogedai snapped rubbing his temples you do not need to add honey i must bring an army into sung lands now they have given sanctuary to my enemies and they know i must respond he winced and sucked again on the wineskin there will be other days to avenge the dead form the men up to go back to the north with haste but not too visible do you understand tolui smiled no commander liked to be seen retreating but the men would understand far better than ogedai realised they could see the wall of sung soldiers as well as anyone none of the mongol warriors were clamouring to be first against that solid border as tolui turned away a single crack sounded in the distance he jerked back and saw the puff of smoke rising above the row of sung cannon only one had fired and both men saw a tumbling object rise only a short way and bounce across the ground it came to rest just a few hundred paces from the khan and his brother for a moment no one moved then tolui shrugged and rode over to it he kept his back straight as he went knowing he was watched by more men than at the festival in karakorum by the time he returned to ogedai carrying a cloth bundle khasar had ridden across the tumans to see what was happening he nodded to his nephews and reached for the cloth bag tolui shook his head a fraction before he held it out to ogedai the khan kept blinking at it his vision doubling tolui waited for an order but when none came he cut the rope around the bag himself and snorted in disgust as he pulled out a mottled head by its hair its eyes upturned khasar and tolui both looked blank as it dangled spinning slowly ogedai squinted frowning as he recognised the administrator from his morning ride had it been that very same day it seemed impossible there had been no army in sung lands then though they must have been marching almost in his wake the message was as clear as the silent ranks who stood and moved not a foot from the border he was not to enter sung lands for any purpose ogedai opened his mouth to speak and a sudden pain flared in his head worse than anything he had ever known he made a soft sound in his throat helplessly tolui saw his distress and dropped the bloody object moving his mount to take his brother by the arm are you unwell tolui hissed at him his brother swayed in the saddle and tolui feared he might fall in front of the tumans the khan would never recover from such an omen not in sight of the enemy tolui jammed his horse up against his brothers mount and kept his hand on ogedais shoulder to steady him khasar fell in on the other side awkward with worry step by painful step they forced the pony into the mongol lines then dismounted as soon as they were surrounded by staring warriors ogedai had been holding on his hands gripping the saddle horn like death his face had twisted somehow his left eye weeping in a constant stream his other eye was wide and clear with agony but he did not let go until tolui began to prise his fingers away then he slumped and slid into his brothers arms his body as limp as a sleeping child tolui stood aghast staring down at the pale face of his brother he looked up at khasar suddenly seeing his own expression mirrored i have a good shaman in the camp tolui said send yours to me also with any chin or moslem healers the best you know for once khasar did not argue his gaze kept drifting to his nephew aware but helpless it was a fate that made khasar shudder very well general he said but we must put some distance between that army and ours before they decide to test our strength command the tumans uncle i will take my brother tolui gestured and khasar helped him heave ogedai onto toluis pony making the animal snort at the double weight tolui gripped his brother around the chest holding him in place ogedais legs dangled loosely and his head lolled as tolui broke into a trot as the sun set the warriors of the khan were still moving slowly towards their camp more than a hundred miles north across the plain behind them the sung soldiers lit torches all along the line making a false horizon they could see for many miles as they retreated chagatai reined in at the top of a hill reaching down to pat his mare and rub her ears two tumans halted behind him his sons and wives waiting patiently with them he had chosen the high place deliberately wanting a view of the khanate genghis had won and ogedai had granted to him chagatai could see for many miles and his breath caught in his throat at the sheer vastness of the land he now owned it was the only true wealth many years had passed since the armies of genghis had stormed through the region the marks of that violent passage would take generations to vanish he smiled at the thought his father had been a thorough man some of the cities would remain ruins for ever dustblown and empty of all but ghosts yet ogedais gift was not a false one the citizens of samarkand and bukhara had rebuilt their walls and markets of all peoples they knew the khans shadow was long his vengeance unforgiving under that protective wing they had grown and gambled on peace chagatai squinted into the setting sun and saw black lines in the far distance caravans of carts oxen and camels stretching to the east and west they were heading for samarkand a blur of white on the horizon chagatai cared little for traders but he knew the roads kept cities alive made them strong ogedai had given him a land of good earth of rivers and fine herds the vista before him was enough to make him wonder at his own ambition was it not enough to rule such a land with water and good grass he smiled for the son and heir of genghis no it was not enough a hot wind blew across the hill as the sun set and he closed his eyes and faced it enjoying the breeze as it tugged at his long black hair he would build a palace on the river he would hunt with arrows and falcons along the hills he would make a home in his new lands but he would not sleep or dream he had spies and informants with ogedai tsubodai all the men of power in the nation there would come a time when he would put aside the khanate of milk and honey and reach once again for what he had been promised it was in his blood to be khan but he was no longer a foolish young man with such a dominion he could wait for the call he thought of the women such cities produced soft of flesh and fragrant their beauty and youth was not worked out of them in the life of the plains perhaps that was the purpose of cities to keep women soft and fat instead of hard it was a good enough reason to let them exist as he prepared to ride on he chuckled at the thought of the wolf entering the sheepfold he would not ride with fire and destruction the shepherd did not frighten his own pretty lambs chapter twelve the ger stank of something unpleasant the air thick tolui and khasar sat on low beds in the corner watching uncomfortably as ogedais shaman manipulated the khans limbs mohrol was a man of powerful build short and stocky with a thick grey tuft of beard at the point of his chin khasar had tried not to stare at his right hand which had marked him from birth as one who would never hunt or fish a sixth finger brown and twisted against the others had made mohrol a shaman the status of his craft had suffered hugely since the betrayal of genghis years before by one whose name was no longer spoken yet mohrol had conferred only briefly with robed healers and other shamans before sending them away the khans own shaman still had some power to command at least among those of his own craft mohrol seemed unaware of the two men watching him he straightened and bent each of ogedais limbs letting them fall limp while he worked his thumbs into the joints and murmured to himself he took particular care with the head and neck as the generals waited mohrol sat on the bed with his legs crossed and pulled ogedais head and shoulders into his lap so that the khan stared sightlessly upward the shamans thin fingers tested and pressed the bones of his skull clasping the dome of ogedais head while mohrol looked into the middle distance khasar and tolui could make nothing of it as mohrol nodded and tutted to himself the khans body was slick with sweat ogedai had not said a word since his collapse at the sung border two days before he had no wound but his breath was as sweet as rotting fruit and it was that smell that filled the ger and made khasar want to gag the chin healers had lit tapers of soothing incense saying the smoke would help him to heal mohrol had allowed such things though his disdain was poorly hidden the shaman had already worked on ogedai for a full day dipping his flesh into icy water then pummelling his body with coarse cloth so that the blood bloomed under the surface the khans eyes stared throughout and sometimes they moved but he did not wake when he was turned to the side he drooled long tendrils of spit his lips slack ogedai would not survive if he stayed like that khasar realised miserably water even warm blood and milk could be forced into his stomach with a thin bamboo tube though he choked and bled from the mouth as it scored his throat cared for like a helpless baby he could be kept alive almost indefinitely yet the nation was without a khan and there were other things that could kill a man khasar had refused all permission to leave the camp as messengers came in they were unhorsed and put under guard for a short time the news could be contained chagatai would not yet be readying his forces for a triumphant return to karakorum even so there were ambitious men in the tumans who knew only too well how they would be received if they brought that news chagatai would reward them with gold promotion and horses whatever they wanted sooner or later one or more would be tempted to slip away in the night if nothing changed before that moment even if ogedai still lived he was finished khasar winced at the thought wondering how long he had to stay in the khans ger he did no good sitting there shifting about like an old man with piles ogedais face seemed even puffier than before as if fluid was building up underneath the skin yet he was hot to the touch his body burning its reserves time crept slowly in the ger while outside the sun rose and passed noon tolui and khasar watched as mohrol took each of ogedais arms and pierced them at the crook of the elbow letting the blood flow into a brass bowl the shaman peered closely at the colour of the liquid pursing his lips in disapproval putting aside the bowls he chanted over the khan suddenly striking his chest with an open palm nothing changed ogedai stared on blinking rarely they did not know if he could even hear them at last the shaman fell silent tugging irritably at his chinbeard as if he wanted to yank it out he laid ogedais head back on the coarse blankets and rose his servant moved in to bandage the cuts his master had made silent with awe at treating the khan of the nation with the unthinking authority of his calling mohrol gestured to the two watching men to follow him out into the clean air they joined him breathing deeply in the breeze to clear the foul sweetness from their lungs around them warriors of the khan stood with hope on their faces waiting for good news mohrol shook his head and many of them turned away i have no medicines for this the shaman said his blood flows well enough though it seems dark to me without the life spirit i do not think it is his heart though i am told that is weak he has been using chin syrups he held up an empty blue bottle with distaste he took a terrible risk in trusting their potions and filth they use anything from unborn children to the penis of a tiger i have seen it i dont care about any of that khasar snapped if you can do nothing for him i will find others with more imagination mohrol seemed to swell with anger and khasar responded by stepping in instantly deliberately standing too close and using his height to advantage watch yourself little man khasar murmured if i were you id try and remain useful you do ogedai no service by arguing out here tolui said it does not matter what has gone before or what potions or powders he has taken can you help him now mohrol still glowered at khasar as he replied physically there is nothing wrong with him his spirit is weak or made weak i do not know if he has been cursed brought to this by some enemy or whether it is something of his own doing he blew air out in a gust sometimes men just die he said the sky father calls and they are snatched even khans there is not always an answer without warning khasars hand shot out and grabbed the shamans robe twisting the cloth as he yanked him close mohrol struggled in reaction before his instinct for survival made him drop his hands khasar was a man of power and mohrols life hung on the single thread of his goodwill the shaman mastered his outrage there is a dark magic khasar snarled i have seen it i have eaten a mans heart and felt the light bursting in me do not tell me there is nothing to be done if the spirits demand blood i will spill lakes of it for the khan mohrol began to stammer a reply but then his voice steadied it will be as you say general i will sacrifice a dozen mares this evening perhaps it will be enough khasar let go and mohrol stumbled back your life rests with his do you understand khasar said i have heard too many of your kind with their promises and lies if he dies you will be skyburied with him staked out on the hills for the hawks and foxes i understand general mohrol replied stiffly now i must prepare the animals for sacrifice they must be killed in the right way their blood for his there had been a city on the site of jiankang for almost two thousand years fed by the immense yangtze river that was the lifeblood of all china it had been the capital of ancient states and dynasties made wealthy on the back of dyes and silk the sound of looms was always present clicking and thumping day and night to provide sung nobles with clothing shoes and tapestries the smell of frying grubs was heavy in the air as they fed the workers at every meal tumbled golden brown with herbs fish and oils in comparison to the small city of suzhou to the north or the fishing villages that fed the workers jiankang was a true stronghold of power and wealth it was visible in the colourful soldiers who stood on every corner in the palaces and bustling streets of a million workers their lives revolving around a moth grub that made a cocoon of thread so perfect it could be unwound and made into extraordinarily beautiful sheets of cloth at first xuan had been treated reasonably well as he left the border miles to the north his wives and children had been placed in palaces away from him his soldiers had been moved further south where they could not be a danger he had not been told the location of their barracks sung officials had shown the bare courtesy due his rank and the emperors own son had deigned to receive him and use words of honeyed sweetness xuan controlled the spasm of anger that threatened to engulf him as he remembered the meeting he had lost everything and they let him know his status by the most subtle insults only a man used to perfection could have detected the faint tinge of age in the tea they offered him or the fact that the servants they sent to him were coarse of feature even clumsy xuan did not know if the emperor intended to humiliate him or whether the mans soft and perfumed son was simply a fool it did not matter he was already aware that he was not among friends he would never have come to sung lands if his situation had not been desperate his weapons had caused some excited interest at first as sung soldiers began to catalogue his baggage and supplies that too brought a moment of irritation as xuan recalled their sly grins his most precious possessions had been laid out in a vast courtyard that dwarfed the remnant of his fathers wealth even then xuan was not certain he would see any of it again chests of gold and silver coins had vanished into some hidden treasury perhaps not even in the city in return xuan had only a sheaf of ornate papers stamped with the marks of a dozen officials he was completely in the power of men who thought of him at best as a weak ally at worst as an obstacle to lands they claimed as their own as he stared out across jiankang xuan ground his teeth silently the only sign of his tension they had scorned his firepots and handcannon the sung had such things in their thousands and of more advanced designs it was clear they thought themselves untouchable their armies were strong and well supplied their cities wealthy some bitter part of him almost wanted the mongols to reveal the folly of such arrogance it made his stomach churn to see the way the sung officers glanced at him and whispered as if he had just given chin lands away to herdsmen it was a peculiar thing to take pleasure in the image of the mongol khan riding his warriors into jiankang sending the sung armies running in disarray xuan smiled at the thought the sun had risen and the silk looms could be heard tapping like insects deep in a beam of wood he would spend the day with his senior advisers talking endlessly and pretending they had some purpose while they waited for the sung emperor to notice their existence as xuan looked over the roofs of jiankang a bell sounded nearby one of a hundred different tones that rang across the city at different times in the day some signalled the changing hours or announced the arrival of messengers others called children to school as the sun set the words of a poem from xuans youth came back to him and he murmured the lines taking pleasure in the memories the sun grows dim and sinks in the dusk people are coming home and the bright peaks darken wild geese fly to the white reeds i think of a northern city gate and i hear a bell tolling between me and sleep tears sprang into his eyes as he thought of his fathers kindness to the thin little boy he had been but he blinked them away before someone could see and report his weakness the horses mohrol had chosen were all young mares capable of bearing foals he had taken them from the herd of spare mounts that followed the tumans spending half a day selecting each mare for perfection of colour and unblemished skin one of the owners stood in mute misery as two of his best white mares were marked for sacrifice the product of generations of careful selection and breeding neither had borne foals and their bloodlines would be lost ogedais name made all resistance vanish despite the nearsacred relationship between herdsmen and their beloved mounts such a thing had never been seen before on the plains the tumans pressed so closely around the ger where ogedai lay that mohrol had to ask for them to be kept away even then the warriors crept forward with their wives and children desperate to see magic and great sacrifice the life of no other could have been worth such a price and they watched with fascination and dread as mohrol sharpened his butchers knives and blessed them khasar sat close to where ogedai lay on a silkcovered pallet in the setting sun the khan had been dressed in polished armour and at intervals his mouth opened and shut slowly as if he gasped for water it was impossible to see his pale skin and not think of genghis laid out for death khasar winced at the thought his heart beating faster at an old grief he tried not to stare as the first white mare was brought forward with two strong men holding her head the other horses were kept well back where they would not see the killing but khasar knew they would smell the blood the young mare was already nervous sensing something in the air she pranced jerking her head up and down and whinnying aloud fighting the tight grip of fingers in her mane her pale skin was perfect unmarked by scars or ticks mohrol had chosen well and some of the watching warriors were tightmouthed at such a sacrifice mohrol built a bonfire taller than himself in front of the khans ger then lit a branch of cedar wood snuffing the flames so that the wood gave off a trail of fragrant white smoke the shaman walked to ogedai and held the smoking branch over his body cleansing the air and blessing the khan for the ritual to come with slow steps he made a path around the supine form muttering an incantation that made the hair on khasars neck stand up khasar glanced at his nephew tolui and found him rapt fascinated by the shaman the younger man would never understand how khasar had once heard genghis speaking an ancient tongue with the blood of enemies fresh on his lips the darkness seemed to come quickly after looking into the flames of mohrols fire thousands of warriors sat in silence and even those who had been injured in the fighting had been moved far away so that their cries of pain would not disturb the ritual the quiet was so perfect that khasar thought he could hear their keening cries even so thin and distant like birds with great care the mares front and rear legs were bound in pairs whinnying in distress she struggled briefly as warriors pushed at her haunches rolling them so that she could not remain upright unable to take a step she fell clumsily lying with her head raised one of the warriors took her muscular neck in his arms holding her steady the other gripped the back legs and they both looked up for mohrol the shaman would not be rushed he prayed aloud singing and whispering in turn he dedicated the life of the mare to the earth mother who would receive the blood he asked again and again for the khans life to be spared in the middle of the ritual mohrol approached the mare he had two knives and continued to sing and pray as he chose a place below the neck where the smooth white skin began to sweep down into the mares chest the two warriors braced themselves with a quick jerk mohrol jammed the blade in to its hilt blood streamed out pumping rich and dark covering his hands the mare shuddered and whinnied in panic snorting and struggling to rise the warriors sat on her haunches and the blood continued to gout with every beat of her heart covering the warriors as they struggled to hold her slippery flesh mohrol placed a hand on her neck feeling how the skin grew cold the mare was still struggling but more weakly he pulled back her lips and nodded at the sight of the pale gums in a loud voice the shaman called once more to the spirits of the land and reached out with his second knife it was a heavyhilted block of metal as long as his forearm and fineedged he waited until the blood flow was sluggish then sawed quickly back and forth across the mares throat the blade disappeared into the flesh more blood rushed and he watched her pupils grow large and infinitely dark mohrols arms were red as he walked over to the khan unaware of all that was being done in his name ogedai lay unmoving pale as death mohrol shook his head slightly and marked the khans cheeks with a red stripe from his finger no one dared to speak as he returned to the dead mare they knew there was magic in sacrifice as mohrol brushed a biting insect from his face many of them made a sign against evil at the thought of spirits gathering like flies on carrion mohrol did not look discouraged as he nodded to the men to drag away the dead animal and bring in the next he knew the mares would struggle as they smelled the blood but he could at least spare them the sight of a dead horse once again he began the chant that would end in sacrifice khasar looked away and many of the warriors drifted off rather than witness such wealth being ruined with a blade the second mare seemed quieter than the first less spirited she allowed herself to be walked in but then she sensed something in just a moment she was panicking whinnying loudly and using all her strength to pull the rein away from the man holding her as they heaved in opposite directions the halter snapped and she was free in the darkness she cannoned into tolui knocking him to the ground she did not get far the warriors spread their arms and herded her turning her around until they were able to get a new halter on and lead her back tolui rose to his feet with no more than bruises dusting himself off he saw mohrol was looking strangely at him and he shrugged under the shamans stare the chanting began again and the second mare was hobbled quickly ready for the knives it would be a long night and the bitter smell of blood was already strong chapter thirteen the ground around the khan was sodden red blood from a dozen mares had soaked into the earth until the soil could take no more and it pooled fat black flies buzzed and dipped all around them driven to frenzy by the smell mohrol was dark with it his bare arms and deel still wet as the torches guttered out and the sun began to rise his voice was hoarse his face filthy mosquitoes had gathered in clouds in the warm damp air the shaman had exhausted himself but the khan lay motionless on the pallet with eyes like shadowed holes the warriors were sleeping on the grass waiting for news they had not taken the mares for meat and the bodies lay sprawled in a heap their thin legs outstretched as their bellies began to swell with gas no one knew whether the sacrifice might be lessened if they consumed the meat so it would be left to rot untouched as the camp moved on many of them had left the scene of the slaughter for their own gers and women unable to watch such fine mares being killed any longer in the dawn mohrol knelt on the wet grass and his knees sank into the soft ground he had killed twelve horses and he felt leaden weighed down by death he refused to let his despair show while the khan lay helpless his face marked with a script of dry blood mohrol felt lightheaded as he knelt and his voice began to fail completely so that he whispered the ancient spells and divinations rhythmic chants that rolled over and over until the words blurred into a stream of sound the khan is in chains he croaked lost and alone in a cage of flesh show me how to break his bonds show me what i must do to bring him home the khan is in chains the shaman could feel the weak dawn sunlight on his closed eyes he had grown desperate but he thought he could sense the whisper of spirits around the still figure of ogedai in the night mohrol had taken the khans wrist and checked for a pulse he was so still yet without warning ogedai would jerk and twist his mouth opening and closing his eyes bright for a few moments with something like awareness the answer was there mohrol was certain if he could only find it tengri of the blue sky erlik of the underworld master of shadows show me how to break the chains mohrol whispered his voice scratching let him see his mirror soul in water let him see his shadow soul in sunlight i have given you blood in rivers sweet mares bleeding their lives into the ground i have given blood to the ninetynine gods of white and black show me the chains and i will strike them free make me the hammer by the ninetynine by the three souls show me the way he raised his right hand to the sun splaying the fingers that were his mark and his vocation this is your ancient land spirit lords of the chin if you hear my voice show me how you will be appeased whisper your needs into my ears show me the chains ogedai moaned on the bier his head falling to one side mohrol was with him in an instant still chanting after such a night with the dawn still grey and the dew halffrozen on the red grass he could feel the spirits around the khan he could hear them breathe his mouth was dry from a bitter paste that left a black crust on his lips he had soared with it in the darkness but there had been no answers no flash of light and understanding what will you take to let him go what do you want this flesh is the cage for the khan of a nation whatever you want you may have mohrol took a deep breath close to collapse is it my life i would give it tell me how to break the chains were the mares not enough i can have a thousand more brought to mark his skin i can weave a web of blood around him a skein of dark threads and dark magic he took faster breaths forcing his body to pant raising the heat within him that might lead to more powerful visions shall i bring virgins to this place shall i bring slaves or enemies his voice fell lower so that no one else could hear shall i bring children to die for the khan they would give their lives gladly enough show me the chains that i may strike them away make me the hammer is it a kinsman that he needs his family would give their lives for the khan ogedai moved he blinked rapidly and as mohrol watched in astonishment the khan began to sit up falling backwards as his right arm crumpled the shaman caught him and tipped his own head back to howl in triumph like a wolf is it his son mohrol went on desperately as he held the khan his daughters his uncles or friends give me the sign strike off the chains at the shamans howl men had jerked from sleep all around them hundreds came running from all directions the news spread and as they heard men and women raised their hands and cheered hammering pots or swords together whatever they had they crashed out a rippling thunder of joy and ogedai sat up flinching from it bring me water he said his voice weak what is happening he opened his eyes and saw the field of blood and the corpse of the last mare lying dark in the dawn light ogedai could not understand what had happened and he rubbed his itching face staring in confusion at the flakes of dried blood on his palms raise a fresh ger for the khan mohrol ordered his voice barely a wheeze but growing stronger in his jubilation make it clean and dry bring food and clean water the ger was raised around ogedai though he was able to sit up the weakness in his arm drained away in slow stages by the time the rising sun was blocked by felt and wood he was drinking water and calling for wine though mohrol would not hear of it the shamans authority had grown with his success and the khans servants could not ignore his stern expression for just a short time the shaman could overrule his own khan mohrol stood tall with a new dignity and visible pride khasar and tolui joined ogedai in the new ger as the most senior men in the camp the khan was still pale but he smiled weakly at their worried expressions his eyes were sunken and dark and his hand quivered as mohrol handed him a bowl of salt tea telling him to drink it all the khan frowned and licked his lips at the thought of wine but he did not protest he had felt death pressing and it had frightened him for all he thought he had prepared for it there were times when i could hear everything but not respond ogedai said his voice like an old mans breath i thought i was dead then with spirits in my ears it was his eyes darkened as he sipped and he did not go on to tell them of the sick terror he had felt trapped in his own body drifting in and out of consciousness his father had told him never to speak of his fears men were fools genghis had said always imagining others were stronger faster less afraid even in his weakness ogedai remembered the terror of that dark had hurt him but he was still the khan servants laid sheets of rough felt on the bloody ground around him the thick mats drew up the blood in an instant becoming heavy and red more were brought in and piled on top of the lower layers until the whole floor of the ger was covered mohrol knelt then at ogedais side and reached out to examine his eyes and gums you have done well mohrol ogedai said i did not expect to be coming back mohrol frowned it is not over my lord the sacrifice of mares was not enough he took a long breath and fell silent while he bit at a ragged nail on his hands tasting the specks of blood there the spirits of this land are full of bile and hatred they released their grip on your soul only when i spoke of another in your place ogedai looked blearily at the shaman struggling not to show his fear what do you mean my head is full of wasps mohrol speak clearly as if to a child i will understand you then there is a price for your return lord i do not know how long you have before they snatch you back into the darkness it could be a day or even a few more breaths i cannot tell ogedai stiffened i cannot go through that again do you understand shaman i could not breathe he felt his eyes prickle and rubbed furiously at them his own body was a weak vessel it always had been bring me wine shaman not yet my lord we have just a little time and you need to think clearly do what you must mohrol i will pay any price ogedai had seen the dead mares and he shook his head wearily looking through the walls of the ger to where he knew they still lay you have my own herds my slaughtermen whatever you need horses are not enough my lord im sorry you came back to us ogedai looked up sharply speak who knows how much time i have for once the shaman stammered hating what he had to say another sacrifice lord it must be someone of your own blood that was the offer that pulled you back from death that was the reason you returned mohrol was so intent on watching ogedais response that he did not sense khasar coming towards him until he was heaved into the air to face the older man you little khasars mouth worked in rage sending flecks of spit onto mohrols face as he held the shaman and shook him like a dog with a rat i have heard these games before from men like you we broke the back of the last one and left him for the wolves you think you can scare my family my family you think you can demand a blood debt for your shabby spells and incantations well after you shaman you die first and then well see as he spoke khasar had drawn a short skinning knife from his belt keeping his hand low before anyone could speak he flicked his wrist cutting into mohrols groin the shaman gasped and khasar let him fall onto his back he wiped blood from the knife but kept it ready in his hand as mohrol writhed his hands cupped ogedai rose slowly from his pallet he was thin and weak but his eyes were furious khasar looked coldly at him refusing to be cowed in my camp you cut my own shaman uncle ogedai growled you have forgotten where you are you have forgotten who i am khasar stuck his chin out defiantly but he put away the blade see him clearly ogedaimy lord khan khasar replied this one wants my death so he whispers that it has to be one of your blood they are all hipdeep in games of power and they have caused my family your family enough pain you should not listen to a word from him let us wait a few days and see how you recover you will be strong again id bet my own mares on it mohrol rolled to his knees the hand he pressed to his groin was red with fresh blood and he felt sick and shaky with the pain he glared at khasar i do not know the name yet it is not my choice i wish it was shaman ogedai said softly you will not have my son even if my own life depends on it nor my wife your wife is not your blood lord let me cast another divination and find the name ogedai nodded easing himself back down to the pallet even that small exertion had brought him to the edge of fainting mohrol got to his feet like an old man hunched over against the pain khasar smiled coldly at him spots of blood fell from between the shamans legs vanishing instantly into the felt do it quickly then khasar said i do not have patience for your kind not today mohrol looked away from him frightened by a man who used violence as easily as breathing he could not untie his robe and examine the wound with khasar leering at him he felt ill and the gash throbbed and burned he shook his head trying to clear it he was the khans shaman and the divination had to be correct mohrol wondered what would happen if the spirits gave him khasars name he did not think he would live long after that as khasar watched with contempt mohrol sent his servants running for tapers of incense soon the air of the ger was thick and mohrol added other herbs to his burning bowl breathing in a coolness that made the ache in his groin just a distant irritation after a time even that faded and was gone at first ogedai coughed as the harsh smoke entered his lungs one of the servants dared mohrols disapproval at last and a skin of wine had appeared at the khans feet he drank it like a man dying of thirst and a bloom of colour came back to his cheeks his eyes were bright with fascination and dread as mohrol clutched the bones for divination holding them to the four winds and calling for the spirits to guide his hand at the same time the shaman took a pot of gritty black paste and rubbed a stripe of it along his tongue it was dangerous to release his spirit again so soon but he steeled himself ignoring the way his heart fluttered in his chest the bitterness brought tears to his eyes so that they shone in the gloom when mohrol closed his mouth his pupils grew enormous like the eyes of dying horses the blood was slowly seeping into the layers of felt and the smell of it was pungent with the narcotic incense the exhausted men could hardly stand it but mohrol seemed to thrive in the thick air the paste giving strength to his flesh his voice rolled out a chant as he moved the bag of bones to the north east south and west over and over calling for the spirits of home to guide him at last he threw the bones too hard so that the yellow pieces scattered across the felt was it an omen to see them leap and jump away from him mohrol cursed aloud and khasar laughed as the shaman tried to read the way they fell tenelevenwhere is the last one mohrol said speaking to no one none of them noticed that tolui had grown almost as pale as the khan himself the shaman had not seen the yellow ankle bone resting against toluis boot touching the soft leather tolui had seen he had kept to himself the sick fear he had felt on hearing that it had to be one of ogedais blood from that moment he had been gripped by a numb helplessness a resignation to a fate he could not avoid the bolting mare had knocked him from his feet no other he thought he had known then part of him wanted to tread the bone deep into the felt to hide it with his foot but with an effort of will he did not ogedai was the khan of the nation the man his father had chosen to rule after him no life was worth as much as his it is here tolui whispered then repeated himself as no one heard him mohrol looked up at him and his eyes flashed with sudden understanding the mare that struck you the shaman said in a whisper his eyes were dark but there was something like compassion in his face tolui nodded mute what ogedai broke in looking up sharply do not even think of that shaman tolui is not part of this he spoke firmly but the terror of the grave was still on him and his hands trembled on the wine cup tolui saw you are my older brother ogedai tolui said more you are the khan the man our father chose he smiled and rubbed his hand across his face looking almost boyish for a moment he told me once that i would be the one to remind you of things you have forgotten that i would guide you as khan and be your right arm this is madness khasar said his voice tight with suppressed rage let me spill this shamans blood first very well general mohrol snapped suddenly he stepped forward to face khasar with his arms open i will pay that price you have spilled my blood already this morning have the rest if you wish it will not change the omens it will not change what must be done khasar touched his hand to where his knife lay under his belt tucked into the grubby folds of cloth but mohrol did not look away from him the paste he had consumed had stolen away any fear and instead he saw khasars love for ogedai and tolui coupled with his frustration the old general could face any enemy but he was lost and confused by such a decision after a time mohrol dropped his arms and stood patiently waiting for khasar to see the inevitable in the end it was toluis voice that broke the silence i have much to do uncle you should leave me now i have to see my son and have letters written to my wife his face was stiff with pain but his voice remained steady as khasar glanced at him your father would not have given up khasar said gruffly believe me as one who knew him better than any man he was not as certain as he seemed in some moods genghis would have thrown his life away without a thought enjoying the grand gesture in others he would have fought to the last furious breath doomed or not khasar wished with all his heart that his brother kachiun were there kachiun would have found an answer a way through the thorns it was just ill luck that kachiun was riding with tsubodai and batu into the north for once khasar was alone he felt the pressure from the younger men as they looked to him in hope for some stroke that would cut through the decision all he could think of was to kill the shaman that too was a useless act he realised mohrol believed his own words and for all khasar knew the man spoke the perfect truth he closed his eyes and strained to hear kachiuns voice what would he say someone had to die for ogedai khasar raised his head his eyes opening i will be your sacrifice shaman take my life for the khans i can do that much for my brothers memory for my brothers son no mohrol said turning away from him you are not the one not today the omens are clear the choice is as simple as it is hard tolui smiled wearily as the shaman spoke he came close to khasar and the two men embraced for a moment while ogedai and the shaman looked on sunset mohrol tolui said looking back at the shaman give me a day to prepare myself my lord the omens are set we do not know how long the khan has left before his spirit is taken ogedai said nothing as tolui looked at him his younger brothers jaw tensed as he struggled with himself i will not run brother he whispered but i am not ready for the knife not yet give me the day and i will bless you from the other side ogedai nodded weakly his expression tortured he wanted to speak out to send mohrol away and dare the malevolent spirits to come back for him he could not a wisp of memory of his helplessness came to him he could not suffer it again sunset brother ogedai said at last without another word tolui strode out of the ger ducking to pass through the small door into the clean air and sun around him the vast camp was arrayed in all directions busy and alive with the noise of horses and women children and warriors toluis heart thumped with pain at such a pleasant normal scene he realised with a stab of despair that it was his last morning he would not see the sun rise again for a time he simply stood and watched it holding one hand above his eyes to shade them from its brilliant glare chapter fourteen tolui led a small group of ten riders to the river that ran by the camp his son mongke rode at his right shoulder the young mans face pale with strain two slave women ran at toluis stirrups he dismounted on the banks and the slaves removed his armour and underclothes naked he walked into the cold water feeling his feet sink into the cool mud slowly he washed himself using silt to work the grease from his skin then dipping under the surface to sluice himself down his female slaves both stripped to enter the water with him they shivered as they worked bone tools under his fingernails to clean them both women stood up to their waists in the water their breasts firm with goosebumps there was no lightness or laughter from them and tolui was not aroused by the sight whereas any other day might have had him playing in the shallows and splashing to make them squeal with care and concentration tolui accepted a flask of clear oil and rubbed it into his hair the prettier of his slaves tied it into a black tail that hung down his back his skin was very white at the nape of his neck where the hair protected it from the sun mongke stood and watched his father the other minghaans were senior men who had seen battle a thousand times next to them he felt young and inexperienced but they could not look at him they were quiet with respect for tolui and mongke knew he had to maintain the cold face for his fathers honour it would have shamed the general to have his son weeping so mongke stood like a stone his face hard yet he could not take his eyes off his father tolui had told them his decision and they were all bruised by it helpless in the face of his will and the khans need one of them gave a low whistle when they saw khasar ride out from another part of the camp the general had earned their respect but they were still willing to block him from the river as he came close on that day they did not care that he was the brother of genghis tolui had been standing with blank eyes as his hair was tied the whistle brought him out of himself and he nodded to mongke to let khasar through watching as his uncle dismounted and came to the bank you will need a friend to help you in this khasar said mongkes stare bored into the back of khasars head but he did not notice tolui looked up in silence from the river and finally dipped his head in acceptance striding out of the water his slaves came with him and he stood patiently as they rubbed him down the sun warmed him and some of his tension seeped away he looked at the armour that lay waiting a pile of iron and leather he had worn something like it for all of his adult life but suddenly it seemed an alien thing of chin design it did not suit his mood i will not wear the armour he said to mongke who was standing ready for orders have it bundled up perhaps in time you will wear it for me mongke struggled with his grief as he bent and gathered the pieces into his arms khasar looked on with approval pleased to see how toluis son kept his dignity the fathers pride was shining in his eyes though mongke turned away without seeing it tolui watched as his women yanked on clothes to cover their nakedness he sent one barefoot over the grass with instructions to find a particular deel and leggings from his ger as well as new boots she ran well and more than one of the men turned to watch her legs flash in the sun i am trying to believe this is really happening tolui said softly khasar looked at him and reached out to grip his bare shoulder in silent support as he went on when i saw you coming i hoped that something had changed i think some part of me will expect a shout a reprieve up to the last moments it is a strange thing the way we torture ourselves your father would be proud of you i know that khasar replied he felt useless unable to find the right words strangely it was tolui who saw his uncles distress and he spoke kindly i think i will be better on my own for the moment uncle i have my son as a comfort to me he will take my messages home i will need you later on at sunset he sighed i will need you to stand by me then without a doubt now though i still have words to write and orders to give very well tolui i will come back as the sun sets i tell you one thing when this is over i am going to kill that shaman tolui chuckled i would expect nothing else uncle i will need a servant in the next world he would do very well the young slave returned bearing an armful of clean woollen clothes barechested tolui pulled rough leggings up his thighs concealing his manhood from view the slave tied the thong at his waist while tolui stood with his arms out staring into the distance his women had begun to weep and neither man rebuked them for it tolui was pleased to hear the crying of women for him he dared not think of sorhatani and how she would react he watched as khasar mounted his horse once more the older man silent with misery as he held up his right hand and turned to ride away tolui sat on the grass and the slaves knelt before him the boots were new soft leather the women bound his feet in untreated wool and then pulled the boots over them tying them with quick neat movements finally he rose the deel robe was the simplest he owned a lightly padded cloth with almost no decoration beyond buttons shaped like tiny bells it was an old piece that had once belonged to genghis and it was marked with the stitching of the wolf tribe tolui ran his hands over the coarse design and found he could take comfort from it his father had worn it and perhaps there was a hint of his old strength left in the cloth walk with me for a time mongke he called to his son there are things i want you to remember for me the sun dipped on the last day spreading a cool light that slowly lost its colours so that the plains softened into grey sitting crosslegged on the grass tolui watched the sun touch the hills in the west it had been a good day he had spent some of it rutting with his slaves losing himself for a time in the pleasures of the flesh he had appointed his second in command to lead the tuman lakota was a good man and loyal he would not shame toluis memory and in time when mongke had more experience he would step aside for the son ogedai had come to him in the afternoon saying that he would appoint sorhatani the head of toluis family with all the rights her husband had known she would retain his wealth and the authority over his sons on his return home mongke would be given toluis other wives and slaves as his own protecting them from those who would take advantage the khans shadow would keep his family safe it was the least ogedai could offer but tolui felt lighter after hearing it less afraid he only wished he could speak to sorhatani and his other sons one last time dictating letters to his scribes was not the same and he wished that he could hold his wife just once that he could crush her to him and breathe in the scent of her hair he sighed to himself it was hard to find peace as the sun went down he tried to hold on to every moment but his mind betrayed him drifting and coming back to clarity with a start time slipped like oil through his hands and he could not hold a single instant of it the tumans had gathered in ranks to witness his offering ahead of him on the grass ogedai stood with khasar and mohrol mongke waited slightly apart from the other three only he looked directly at his father a constant gaze that was the sole sign of the horror and disbelief that he felt tolui took a deep breath enjoying the scent of horses and sheep on the evening breeze he was pleased he had chosen the simple garb of a herdsman armour would have choked him confined him in iron instead he felt looselimbed clean and calm he walked towards the small group of men mongke stared at him like a stunned calf tolui reached out and drew his son into a brief embrace releasing him before the shuddering he felt against his chest turned into sobs i am ready he said ogedai lowered himself to sit crosslegged on one side of him khasar on the other mongke hesitated before sitting to one side there was a certain shared animosity as they all watched mohrol set a taper to brass pots thin trails of smoke dragged their way across the plain and the shaman began to sing mohrol was barechested his skin marked in stripes of red and dark blue his eyes looked out from a mask that seemed barely human the four men faced west and as the shaman worked his way through six verses of the song of death they stared at the setting sun slowly eaten by the horizon until there was just a fat line of gold mohrol stamped the ground as he finished his verse to the earth mother he jabbed a knife into the air as he called on the sky father his voice grew in strength a double tone from his nose and throat that was one of the earliest sounds tolui could remember he listened distractedly unable to look away from the golden thread that bound him to life as the verses to the four winds ended mohrol passed a knife into toluis cupped hands tolui stared at the blueblack blade in the last light he found the calm he needed everything around him was sharp and defined and he breathed deeply as he pressed the blade against his skin ogedai reached out and clasped his left shoulder khasar did the same with his right tolui felt their strength their grief and it steadied the last of his fear he looked at mongke and saw the young mans eyes were brimming with tears there was no shame in it look after your mother boy tolui said then looked down and took a deep breath it is time he said i am a fitting sacrifice for the khan i am tall and strong and young i will take the place of my brother the sun vanished in the west and tolui pushed the knife into his chest finding the heart all the air in his lungs came out in a long rasping breath he found he could not breathe in and struggled to control his panic he knew the cuts that had to be made mohrol had explained every detail of the ritual his son was watching and he had to have the strength toluis body had gone tight and hard every muscle straining as he sipped air back in and wrenched the blade between his ribs cutting his heart the pain was a burning brand in him but he pulled out the knife and looked in astonishment at the rush of blood that came with it his strength was fading and as he began to fall forward khasar reached out and took his hand in fingers that were impossibly strong tolui turned his eyes to him in gratitude unable to speak khasar guided his hand higher holding the grip closed so he could not drop the blade tolui sagged as khasar helped him draw the edge across his neck he was frozen a man of ice as his warm blood drained into the grass he did not see the shaman hold a bowl to his throat his head lolled forward and khasar gripped him by the back of the neck tolui could feel the warm touch as he died mohrol offered the brimming bowl to ogedai the khan knelt with his head down staring into darkness he did not let go of toluis body so that it remained upright held between the two men you must drink my lord while i finish mohrol said ogedai heard and took the bowl in his left hand tipping it back he choked on the warm blood of his brother and some of it dribbled down his chin and neck mohrol said nothing as the khan steeled himself and fought the urge to vomit when it was empty ogedai tossed the bowl away into the gloom mohrol began to sing the six verses once again from the beginning drawing the spirits close to witness the sacrifice before he was halfway through mohrol heard ogedai vomiting onto the grass it was already too dark to see and the shaman ignored the sounds sorhatani rode hard calling chuh and forcing her mare to gallop across the brown plains her sons galloped with her and with the remounts and pack animals they made a fine plume of dust rising behind them under the hot sun sorhatani rode barearmed in a yellow silk tunic and deerskin leggings with soft boots she was grubby and she had not bathed in a long time but she exulted as her horse flew across the ancient land of the tribes the grass was very dry the valleys thirsty drought had drained all but the widest rivers to refill the waterskins they had to dig into the river clay until water seeped into the hole brackish and full of silt silk had proved its value yet again to strain muck and wriggling insects out of the precious liquid as she rode she saw the pale bones of sheep and oxen the white shapes cracked to shards by wolves or foxes to anyone else it might not have seemed a great reward for her husband to be given such a dry land yet sorhatani understood there were always hard years there that such a land made strong men and stronger women her sons had already learned to eke out their supplies of water and not gulp it as if there would always be a stream within reach the winters froze and the summers burned but there was freedom in its immensity and the rains would come again her childhood memories were of hills like rippled green silk stretching away to the horizon on all sides the land endured the droughts and the cold but it would be reborn in the distance she could see the mountain of deliunboldakh a peak of almost mystical significance in the legends of the tribes genghis had been born somewhere near that place his father yesugei had ridden with his bondsmen there protecting his herds from raiders through the coldest months sorhatani kept her eyes on a different crag the red rock that genghis had climbed with his brothers when the world was smaller and all the tribes were at each others throats her three sons kept pace with her and the red hill grew before them there genghis and kachiun had found an eagles nest and brought down two perfect chicks to show their father sorhatani could imagine their excitement even see their faces in the features of her own sons she only wished mongke could have been there though she knew that was a mothers foolishness mongke had to learn to lead to campaign with his father and uncles the warriors would not respect an officer who knew nothing about terrain or tactics she wondered if genghis mother had loved bekter as she loved her own first born as the legends told it bekter had been solemn in spirit just as mongke was her eldest son was not easily given to laughter or the lightning flashes of insight and humour that characterised a boy like kublai she watched kublai ride his chin tail of hair whipping in the wind he was slim and wiry like his father and grandfather her boys raced each other through the dust and she gloried in their youth and strength as well as her own tolui and mongke had been gone for many months it had been hard for her to leave karakorum but she knew she had to prepare a camp for her husband to scout the land it was her task to raise gers in the shadow of deliunboldakh and find good grazing on the river plains thousands of men and women had come with her to the homeland but for the moment they would wait on her pleasure while she rode to the red hill perhaps one day mongke would command an army like tsubodai or become a man of power under his uncle chagatai it was easy to dream on such a day with the wind making her hair flow back in a river of silk threads sorhatani glanced behind her checking on the presence of her husbands bondsmen two of the most ferocious warriors at his command rode within easy reach of the family as she watched them she saw their heads turning to the left and right looking for the slightest danger she smiled before he left tolui had given very clear orders about keeping his wife and sons safe it might have been true that the hills and steppes of their homeland were practically empty of nomadic families but still he worried he was a fine man she thought with just a fraction of his fathers ambition he would have risen far sorhatanis mood did not sink at the thought the destiny of her husband had never been hers to shape he had always been the youngest son of genghis and from the earliest age he had known his brothers would lead and he would follow her sons were a different matter even her youngest arikboke had been trained as a warrior and a scholar from the moment he could walk all could read and write the court script of the chin though she prayed to christ and his mother they had been taught the religion of the chin and sung where true power lay whatever the future held she knew she had prepared them as best she could the small group dismounted at the foot of the red hill and sorhatani cried out in pleasure as she saw the circling specks of eagles high above part of her had thought the rumour of their presence was just a herdsmans boasting a way of honouring the story of genghis yet they were there and their nest would be somewhere in the crags her husbands bondsmen came up and bowed deeply before her waiting patiently for her orders my sons are going to climb for the nest she said as excited as a girl she did not need to explain both of the warriors had squinted up at the circling birds scout the area for water but do not go too far in moments the men had leapt back into the saddle and were cantering away they had learned that sorhatani expected the same sort of instant obedience as her husband she had grown up around men of power and had married into the great khans family at a very young age she knew that men prefer to follow that it takes an effort of will to lead she had that will kublai and hulegu were already at the base of the red hill shading their eyes against the sun for the location of the nest it was later in the year than the ideal if there were chicks there they would already be strong perhaps even able to leave the nest and fly on their own sorhatani did not know if her sons would be disappointed but it did not matter she had made them part of a tale from genghis life and they would never forget the climb whether they brought down a chick or not she had given them a memory they would tell to their own children one day the boys removed their weapons and began to scramble up the easy section as sorhatani pulled a bag of soft curds from under her saddle she had hammered the chips of hard cheese herself breaking them small enough so that they would not gall the mares skin as they softened in water the thick yellow paste was bitter and refreshing a particular favourite of hers she licked her lips as she dipped her hand inside then sucked her fingers clean it did not take long to fetch water from the packhorses and water the animals with a leather bucket when the chore was done sorhatani rummaged further in her saddlebags until she found some sweet dried dates she looked guiltily at the hill as she nibbled one knowing that her sons loved the rare delicacy still they were not there she could see them rising higher climbing easily on strong thin legs it would be sunset by the time they returned and for once she was on her own she hobbled the pony with a length of rope so it would not wander far then sat on the dry grass spreading a saddle blanket for herself sorhatani dozed through the afternoon enjoying the peaceful solitude at times she took up a deel robe she was embroidering in gold thread for kublai it would be very fine when it was finished and she worked with bowed head over the stitches cutting lengths of thread with strong white teeth in the suns warmth it was easy to nod over the cloth and she dozed for a time when she came awake again it was to find the afternoon had faded to coolness she rose and stretched yawning this was a good land and she felt at home here she had dreamed of genghis as a young man and her face was flushed with perspiration it had not been a dream to share with her sons in the distance the movement of a rider caught her eye it was an instinctive talent born of generations for whom spotting an enemy was the key to survival she frowned and shaded her eyes then made her hands into a tube to focus her sight further even with the old scouts trick the dark figure was just a speck her husbands bondsmen had not slept in the afternoon and already they were galloping to intercept the lone rider sorhatani felt her sense of peace dwindle and fade as they reached the man and the single point became a larger knot who are you she muttered to herself it was hard not to feel a twinge of worry a single rider could only be one of the yam messengers who crisscrossed thousands of miles for the khan and his generals with fresh horses they could ride a hundred miles in a day sometimes even further if it was a matter of life and death the khans forces in chin territory were only ten days away by the reckoning of such men she saw the three riders begin to approach the red hill together and her womb clenched in sudden premonition behind her she heard the sound of her sons back from their climb their voices were light and cheerful but there were no calls of triumph the fledgling eagles had left the nest or flown from their grasping hands sorhatani began to pack away her supplies folding her precious needles and spools of thread back into their roll and tying the knots with unconscious expertise she did it rather than stand helplessly waiting and she took her time with the saddlebags stowing the waterskins carefully when she turned back her hand flew to her mouth as she recognised the lone rider flanked by the bondsmen they were still some way off and she almost cried out to them to go faster as they drew nearer she saw how mongke swayed in the saddle close to utter exhaustion he was coated in dust and the sides of his horse heaved with caked muck from where he had emptied his bladder without dismounting she knew the scouts did that only when the news had to be brought home with all speed and her heart skipped with dread she did not speak as her eldest son dismounted and staggered almost falling as his legs betrayed him he clung to the saddle horn using his strong right hand to rub out the cramps at last their eyes met and he did not have to speak sorhatani did not weep then though some part of her knew her husband was gone she stood tall her mind racing there were so many things she had to do you are welcome in my camp my son she said at last almost in a trance she turned to the bondsmen and told them to make a fire and salt tea her other sons stood in silent confusion at the sight of the small group sit with me mongke she said softly her son nodded his eyes redrimmed with weariness and grief he took his place on the grass beside her and nodded to kublai hulegu and arikboke as they made a tight circle around their mother when the salt tea was ready mongke drained the first bowl in a few gulps to cut the dust in his throat the words still had to be spoken sorhatani almost cried out to stop him her emotions in turmoil if mongke did not speak it would not be completely true once the words were out her life her sons lives would all change and she would have lost her beloved my father is dead mongke said his mother closed her eyes for a moment her last hope was torn away she took a long breath he was a good husband she whispered choking he was a warrior who commanded ten thousand for the khan i loved him more than you will ever know tears made her eyes large and her voice roughened as her throat closed on grief tell me how it happened mongke leave nothing out chapter fifteen tsubodai reined in at the edge of a cliff leaning out of his saddle to peer down on the valley below it had taken him a day of following goat trails to reach the place but from such a height he could see for twenty miles his gaze encompassing hills and villages rivers and towns the wide volga river ran to the west but it was not a serious obstacle he had already sent men wading across its sandbars to scout islands and the banks beyond he had raided these lands years before he smiled as he remembered taking his men across the frozen rivers the russians had not believed anyone could withstand their winter they had been mistaken only genghis could have called him back then when the great khan had ordered him home tsubodai had returned but it would not happen again ogedai had given him a free hand the chin borders were secure to the east if he could crush the lands of the west the nation would hold the central plains from sea to sea an empire so vast it beggared the imagination tsubodai hungered to see the lands beyond the russian forests all the way to the legendary cold seas and the ghostly white peoples there who never saw the sun with such a view it was easy to imagine the threads of his influence stretching back to him tsubodai stood at the centre of a web of messengers and spies for hundreds of miles around the spot where he stood he had men and women in every market village town and fortress some of them had no idea the coins they were paid came from the mongol armies a few of his scouts and informants were from the turkic tribes who lacked the eyefolds that marked his warriors others came from those tsubodai and batu had already recruited or taken by force they staggered out of the ashes of every town homeless and desperate ready to accept whatever their conquerors asked in exchange for their lives the khans silver flowed like a river through tsubodais hands and he bought information as much as meat and salt and valued it more the general turned his head as batu came around the last turn and brought his pony onto the ridge crest before dismounting batu stared at the valleys below with an expression of bored resentment tsubodai frowned to himself he could not change the past any more than he could challenge ogedai khans right to raise a sullen young man to command ten thousand a green adolescent with an army could do a great deal of damage the strange thing was that tsubodai persisted in training him to be the most efficient destroyer he could be time alone would give him perspective and wisdom all the things batu currently lacked they sat for a long time in silence before batus patience frayed as tsubodai had known it would there was no calm at the centre of the angry young warrior no internal peace instead he simmered with constant rage and all those around him sensed it i have come tsubodai bahadur batu pronounced the generals nickname with a sneer making the valiant sound like mockery what is it that only your eyes can see tsubodai replied as if it was nothing his voice as infuriatingly relaxed as he could make it when we move on your men will not be able to see the terrain batu they might become lost or be stopped by some obstacle you see those low hills there batu peered where tsubodai pointed from here you can see how they run almost together leaving a central ground free fora mile perhaps two four or five li as the chin measure distance we could hide two minghaans on either side in ambush if we bring the russians to battle a few miles further on a false retreat will drag them back to those hills and they will not get out this is nothing new batu said i know about the feigned retreat i thought you would have something more interesting to make it worth dragging my horse up here tsubodai kept his cold eyes on the younger man for a moment but batu held his gaze with insolent confidence yes orlok tsubodai he asked is there something you wish to say to me it is important to choose the ground then scout it well for hidden obstacles tsubodai replied batu chuckled and stared down again for all his bluster and arrogance tsubodai saw he was taking in every detail of the land his eyes flickering back and forth as he memorised it he was an unpleasant student but his mind was as sharp as anyone tsubodai had known it was hard not to think of his father at times the memories robbing the general of his irritation tell me what you see in our tumans tsubodai went on batu shrugged down below he could see five columns moving slowly across the land it took just a glance for him to read them we march apart and attack together five fingers covering as much ground as possible the messengers keep them in contact for quick response to any show of force i believe my grandfather began the practice it has worked well enough since then he grinned without looking at tsubodai batu knew the general was responsible for the formation that allowed a small army to sweep across huge areas clearing towns and villages before them so that they left a smoking landscape behind they came together only when the enemy appeared in strength when the arrow messengers would bring the tumans racing a fist to smash the resistance before they moved on your eyes are strong batu tell me what else you see tsubodais voice was maddeningly calm and batu rose to the bait determined to show the older man that he needed no lessons from him he spoke quickly and used his hand to chop the air for each column there are scouts at the front in groups of ten they ride up to eighty miles out looking for the enemy the centre is the families the baggage gers oxen camels drummers and collapsed gers by the thousand there are mobile forges on carts with spoked wheels ironreinforced i believe you are responsible for those general boys and foot warriors march there our final defence if the warriors are ever overrun around them are the herds of sheep goats and of course remounts three to a man or more he spoke faster enjoying the chance to show his knowledge beyond those are the heavy tuman cavalry in minghaan ranks further still we have the light cavalry screen the first to meet any attack with arrows finally we have the rearguard who plod along and wish they were closer to the front instead of riding through everyone elses shit shall i begin naming the officers you are the orlok in overall command i am told you have no bloodline worth mentioning so i am the prince whose name appears on the orders the grandson of genghis khan it is an odd arrangement but we will discuss it another time i lead a tuman as do generals kachiun jebe chulgetei and guyuk the minghaan officers in order of seniority are that is enough batu tsubodai said quietly ilugei muqali degei tolon onggur boroqul enough tsubodai snapped i know their names i see batu said raising an eyebrow then i do not understand what you wanted me to learn by losing half a day riding up this rock with you if i have made mistakes you must feel able to bring them to me am i in error general have i displeased you in some way you must tell me so i can remove the fault his eyes bored into tsubodai allowing his bitterness to show for once tsubodai controlled his temper felt it rise in him and took a firmer grip before he ruined a young man guilty of nothing more than spite and arrogance he looked too much like jochi for tsubodai not to know he had reason you have not mentioned the auxiliaries tsubodai said calmly at last in response batu chuckled an unpleasant sound no and i will not our ragged conscripts are good for nothing more than soaking up the missiles of our enemies i am going to rejoin my tuman general he began to turn his mount and tsubodai reached out and took his reins batu glared at him but he had the sense not to reach for the sword that hung at his waist i have not yet given you permission to leave tsubodai said his face was still emotionless but his voice had hardened and his eyes were very cold batu smiled and tsubodai could see he was on the point of saying something that would tear down the strained courtesy between them this was why he preferred to deal with more senior men who had some idea of consequences and would not throw their entire lives away on a badtempered moment tsubodai spoke quickly and firmly to head him off if i have the slightest doubt about your ability to follow my orders batu i will send you back to karakorum batu began to take a breath his face twisting as tsubodai went on relentlessly you may take your complaints to your uncle there but you will no longer ride with me if i give you a hill to take you will destroy your entire tuman rather than fail if i tell you to ride to a position you will break your horses to reach it in time do you understand if you fail me in anything there will be no second chance this is not a game general and i do not care what you think of me not at all now if you have something to say to me say it at almost twenty batu had matured in the years since winning the horse race at karakorum he took command of his temper with a swiftness that surprised tsubodai reining in his emotions and shuttering them away so that his eyes were blank it showed he was more man than boy but it made him a far more dangerous adversary you may put your faith in me tsubodai bahadur batu said this time without the sneer in his voice with your permission i will return to my column tsubodai inclined his head and batu trotted his mount back down the goat path that led to the base of the hill tsubodai stared after him for a time then grimaced to himself he should have sent him back to karakorum with any other officer he would have had him whipped and strapped to a horse to be ridden home in disgrace only the memories of batus father and yes his grandfather held tsubodais hand they had been men to follow perhaps the son could be made in their image unless of course he got himself killed first he needed to be tested to gain the soul weight that came only from true knowledge of skill rather than empty arrogance tsubodai nodded to himself as he looked over the lands ahead there would be many opportunities to temper the young prince in fire the russian lands had been wide open for the sort of attack tsubodai had perfected even the nobles there had homes and towns protected by little more than a wooden palisade some of them had the solidity of decades or even centuries but the mongol war machine had overcome such obstacles in chin territory their catapults smashed apart the ancient logs sometimes crushing those who sheltered behind them it was true that the mongol archers had to contend with thicker forests than they had ever seen sometimes stretching for thousands of miles and able to hide large forces of horsemen the last summer had been hot and heavy rainfall meant the ground was often too soft to move forward with any speed tsubodai disliked the marshes intensely but he was coming to the opinion that if it hadnt been for those genghis had made an error in attacking to the east the lands to the west were still ripe and as yet tsubodai had seen no force worthy to challenge his tumans as they scoured the land the mongol sweep took them hundreds of miles into the north and winter brought blessed relief from the flies and rain and disease for the first year he had kept to the east of the volga river preferring to crush any possible threat from the area that would become his rear and be part of the supply route to karakorum though the distances were vast there was already a constant stream of riders the first yam waystations were rising behind his tumans as well fortified as anything else in russian territory tsubodai cared nothing for the buildings but they housed grain saddles and the fastest mounts from the herds ready for whoever needed to race through it was a spring morning when tsubodai gathered his most senior officers on a meadow by a lake filled with wildfowl his scouts had spent the morning trapping thousands of birds in nets or taking them in flight for sport the women in the camps were plucking the birds to be roasted that evening creating great drifts of feathers that tumbled over the grass like spilt oil batu watched with carefully hidden interest as tsubodai brought forward one of his strongest warriors the mans face could not be seen under the helmet of polished iron everything he wore had been captured further to the west even the horse was a monster black as night and half as high again at the shoulder as any mongol pony like its rider it was sheathed in iron from plates around its eyes to a skirt of hardened leather and metal to protect its hindquarters from arrows some of the men looked on it with greed in their eyes but batu scorned such a beast as large as it was with such a burden of armour he was certain it would be slow at least in the thrust and parry of battle this is what we will face as we move west tsubodai said men like this in cages of iron are the most feared force on a battlefield according to the christian monks in karakorum they are unstoppable in the charge a weight of metal and leather that can crush anything we have the senior men shifted uncomfortably unsure whether to believe such a wild claim they watched in fascination as tsubodai brought his pony close to the larger animal he looked small next to the man and horse but he used his reins lightly to take his pony around in a tight circle raise your hand when you can see me tangut he said it was not long before they understood the line of sight tsubodai had revealed was just a small strip to the front even with the visor raised he can see nothing at the side or behind and that iron will be hard to turn quickly tsubodai reached out and clanged his fist against the warriors breastplate it rang like a bell his chest is well protected under this is a layer of iron links like metal cloth it serves a similar purpose to our silk tunics but is made to withstand axes and knives more than arrows tsubodai gestured to a boy holding a long lance and the boy ran to the armoured warrior and handed it up to him tapping his leg for attention this is how they are used tsubodai said like our own heavy horse they ride headon against an enemy in a charge they have no flaw or hole in their armour he nodded to tangut and they all watched as the warrior trotted away his ungainly metal carapace jingling with every step at two hundred paces the man turned his heavy mount which reared and flattened its ears he dug in his heels and the animal lunged forward the thick legs thumping the ground batu saw how dropping the horses head brought the armour of chest and skull together forming an impenetrable shell the lance lowered the point cutting the air in circles as it centred on tsubodais chest batu found he was holding his breath and he let it go annoyed with himself for falling under tsubodais spell he watched coldly as the warrior hit full gallop his lance a deadly weapon the hooves thundered and batu had a sudden vision of a line of such men sweeping across a battlefield he swallowed at the thought tsubodai moved quickly darting to one side with his pony they saw the armoured warrior try to correct but he could not turn at full speed and swept past tsubodai raised and drew his bow in a fluid motion aiming casually the front of the horse was as well armoured as its rider there was even a crest of armour running along the line of the mane but below that the great neck was open and bare tsubodais arrow punched into the flesh and the horse screamed spattering bright blood from its nostrils from the sides to a good bowman they are unprotected tsubodai shouted over the noise he spoke without pride any one of the men watching could have made the shot they smiled at the thought of such powerful enemies brought down by speed and arrows they could all hear the tortured snorting of the horse as it wrenched its head back and forth in pain slowly it sank to its knees and the warrior stepped clear he dropped his lance and drew a long sword advancing on tsubodai to defeat such armoured men we must first kill the horses tsubodai went on their armour is designed to deflect arrows shot from the front everything is made for the charge but on foot they are like turtles slow and ponderous to make his point he selected a thick arrow with a long steel tip it was a wickedlooking thing smooth and polished with no barbs to slow its speed the approaching warrior saw the action and hesitated he did not know how far tsubodai was willing to go to make his point but the general would be equally ruthless with a man whose nerve failed the moment of indecision passed and the warrior clumped forward straining to pump his heavy legs and arms quickly so that he could bring his sword to bear from the saddle tsubodai guided his mount with his knees sending the pony dancing back out of sword range he drew again feeling the immense power of the bow as he pulled the threefoot shaft right back to his ear with the warrior just a few paces away tsubodai loosed and watched closely as the shaft passed straight through the side plates the warrior went down hard with a crash of metal the arrow was lodged in his armour the feathers showing clearly as he toppled tsubodai grinned they have just one strength in a line facing forward if we allow them to use that strength they will sweep us away like wheat to a scythe if we scatter and ambush them stage false retreats and flank them they will be as children to us batu watched as tsubodais serving men carried the dying warrior away between them sweating and struggling under the massive burden at a distance they stripped the armour revealing a mailed body spitted through by the shaft they had to break the arrow to get the plate free and bring it back to tsubodai according to those boastful christians who wished to frighten us these knights have had no equal on the battlefield for a hundred years he held up the metal plate and everyone there could see the sunlight gleam through the neat hole we cannot leave a major force or city behind us or on our flanks but if this is the best they have we will surprise them i think they raised their own bows and swords then cheering tsubodais name batu joined them careful not to be the only one who remained outside the group he saw tsubodais gaze flicker over him a look of satisfaction crossed the generals face at seeing batu shout with the others batu smiled at the thought of holding tsubodais head up in just such a way it was only a fantasy the army was strong but he knew they needed tsubodai to lead them west against the great armies of horsemen and further to these men of iron for batu men like tsubodai were old and approaching the end of their time his chance would come naturally he did not need to force its progress chagatai had built a summer palace on the banks of the amu darya river the western edge of his empire that led as far south as kabul for the site he had chosen a high ridge over the river where there was always a cool breeze even in the hottest months the sun of his khanate had baked him lean and dark as if all the moisture had been boiled out leaving him as hard as ancient birch he ruled the cities of bukhara samarkand and kabul with all their wealth the citizens there had learned to deal with the summer heat sipping cool drinks and sleeping through the afternoon before rising again chagatai had chosen almost a hundred new wives from those cities alone and many of them had already given birth to sons and daughters he had taken ogedais order to breed a new army literally and he enjoyed the sound of the squalling children in the infant rooms of his seraglio he had even learned the new word for his collection of beautiful women as there was nothing like it in his own tongue yet there were times when he missed the frozen plains of his homeland winter was a passing thing in his new lands always with the promise of a return to green life though their nights could be bitter the people of his new khanate had no concept of the endless crushing cold that had shaped the mongol people the desolate high plains that had to be fought for every meal with life and sudden death as the stakes his heartland had groves of figs and fruit rolling hills and rivers that flooded every few years and had not run dry in living memory his summer palace had been built to the same specification and measurements as ogedais in karakorum then carefully reduced in all dimensions chagatai was nowhere near the fool some believed him to be no great khan would enjoy hearing of a building to rival his own and chagatai was careful to remain a support rather than any kind of threat he heard his servant approaching along the marble corridor that led to the audience room over the river suntais sole concession to the climate was wearing open sandals with iron studs that clacked and echoed long before he could be seen chagatai stood on the balcony enjoying the sight of the ducks sweeping in to settle in the reed beds along the banks above them a lone whitetailed eagle hung in perfect stillness silent and deadly as suntai entered chagatai turned and gestured to a bottle of arack on the table both men had developed a taste for the aniseed drink so popular among the persian citizens chagatai turned back to the river as suntai clinked the cups together and poured adding a dash of water so that it whitened like mares milk chagatai accepted the cup without taking his eyes off the eagle over the river he squinted against the setting sun as it stooped dropping suddenly to the waters and rising again with a squirming fish in its claws the ducks rose in mindless panic and chagatai smiled when the air cooled in the evenings he found he had grown affectionate towards his new home it was a fitting land for those who would come after him ogedai had been generous you have heard the news chagatai said it was a statement rather than a question any message that reached his summer palace would have passed through suntais hands at some point suntai nodded content to wait to hear his masters mind to those who did not know him he looked like any other warrior though one who had marked his cheeks and chin with heavy lines of knife scars as some did removing the need to shave on campaign suntai was always grubby and his hair was thick with ancient rancid oil he scorned the persian habits of bathing and he suffered worse than most with boils and spreading rashes with his dark eyes and lean frame he looked like a rough killer in fact the mind behind the carefully created image was sharper than the knives he carried hidden against his skin i did not expect to lose another brother so soon chagatai said softly he emptied the cup down his throat and belched two are gone just two of us remain master we should not stand at a window to discuss such things there are always ears to hear chagatai shrugged and gestured with his empty cup suntai walked with him deftly snatching up the jug of arack as he passed the table they sat facing each other at an ornate table of goldinlaid black wood once the property of a persian king it was not symbolism that placed it at the very centre of the room suntai knew they could not be overheard by the keenest listener with his ears pressed to the outer walls he suspected ogedai would have spies in the new summer palace just as suntai had placed them with tsubodai and ogedai khasar and kachiun all the senior men he could reach loyalty was a difficult game but he loved it i have reports of the fit suffered by the khan suntai said i cannot say how close he was to death without interviewing the shaman who tended him he is not one of mine unfortunately nevertheless i must be ready to move at the first messenger to come galloping in despite the placing of the table chagatai was unable to resist glancing around to be sure no one could hear him and he leaned forward his voice very low it took fortynine days for me to hear this suntai it is not good enough if i am to take the great khanate as my own i must have better news and faster the next time ogedai falls i want to be there before he is cold do you understand suntai touched his forehead mouth and heart with his fingertips in the arab gesture of respect and obedience your will commands me my lord one of my closest servants was gored in a boar hunt it has taken time to replace him in the great khans retinue however i have two others ready for promotion to his personal staff in just a few months they will be part of his innermost councils make it so suntai there will be only one chance to take the reins i do not want his weakling son gathering the tribes before i can act serve me well in this and you will rise with me the nation of my father is too strong for a man who cannot command even his own body suntai smiled tightly rubbing the ugly ridged skin of his cheeks the instinct of years prevented him from agreeing with the treason or even to nod his head he had spent too long with spies and informants and he never spoke without carefully weighing the words chagatai was used to his silences and merely refilled the cups adding the splash of water that took the edge off the bitterness let us drink to my brother tolui chagatai said suntai looked closely at him but there was real grief in his eyes the khans spymaster raised his cup and dipped his gaze he would have made my father proud with such a sacrifice chagatai went on it was insane but by the sky father it was a glorious insanity suntai drank aware that his lord had been drinking most of the day already it showed in his bloodshot eyes and clumsy movements in comparison suntai only sipped from his cup he almost choked when chagatai slapped him on the shoulder and laughed spilling the white liquid across the lacquer family is everything suntai never think that i forget that he trailed off staring into memories for a time but i was my fathers choice to succeed him there was a time when my destiny was written in stone and carved deep now i must make it for myself but it is nothing more than fulfilling the old mans dreams i understand my lord suntai said refilling chagatais cup it is a worthy aim chapter sixteen the rain could not last tsubodai was almost certain the sheer force of it was astonishing drumming across his tumans the sky was a wall of black cloud and lightning flashed at irregular intervals revealing the battlefield in stark images tsubodai would never have fought on such a day if the enemy had not moved into position in the darkness it was a bold move even for mounted horsemen armed much as his own warriors the volga river was behind them it had taken another year to secure the lands beyond the river the second since leaving karakorum he had chosen to be thorough to sting the great men attacking their walled towns and cities on a wide front until they were forced to unite against him in that way his tumans could destroy them all rather than spend many years hunting down each duke and minor noble whatever they called themselves for months tsubodai had seen strangers watching his columns from hilltops but they vanished when challenged disappearing back into the damp forests it seemed their masters knew no loyalty to each other and for a time he had been forced to pick them off one by one it was not enough to cover the sort of ground he intended he dared not leave a major army or city untouched it was a complex web of terrain and information and it grew harder to manage with each passing month his spearhead was widening further and further his resources stretched he needed more men his scouts had ridden out as usual in a constant relay a few days before without warning some had not come back as soon as the first ones were missed tsubodai prepared for attack almost two full days before an enemy was in sight still in darkness with a cold drizzle soaking them all to the skin horn warnings sounded relayed from man to man the mongol columns had come together from miles apart forming a single mass of horses and warriors there was no separate camp for those who could not fight from children to old women on carts tsubodai preferred them to move in the safety of the main army his light cavalry took positions on the outskirts each man covering his bow and dreading the moment when he would have to shoot arrows in the rain they all carried spare bowstrings but rain ruined them quickly stretching the skin strips and robbing the shafts of force the ground was already soft as the grey morning lightened almost imperceptibly it would bog down the carts tsubodai began to arrange a corral for them behind the battlefield all the time he continued to gather information many of his scouts had been ridden down but others struggled through to bring him news some of them were wounded and one had an arrow lodged in his back near the shoulder blades before tsubodai could even see the horizon he had estimates of the enemy numbers they were moving quickly towards him risking life and mounts to surprise the mongol columns to catch them out of formation he smiled at the thought he was no wild tribesman to be surprised at dawn his men could not be routed with a sudden charge the russian noblemen were reacting like ants to repulse an invader without a pause for thought the tumans moved smoothly in formation each jagun of a hundred following the next in the darkness calling back and forth to keep position the five generals spoke to tsubodai in turn and he gave them their orders without hesitation they split apart at a gallop to pass them down the line of command it was tsubodais practice to interrogate prisoners if gold would not buy what he needed moscow lay ahead a centre of power in the region the prisoners had known its location on the moskva river now tsubodai knew as well the russians had a record of arrogance considering themselves masters of the central plains tsubodai smiled again to himself the downpour had begun after the enemy horsemen had begun the attack but they had not called it off the soft ground would hamper them as much as his own warriors his tumans were outnumbered but they always were the auxiliary forces batu had poured scorn on were good enough to hold the flanks and prevent encirclement tsubodai had his best men among them training them constantly and setting up chains of command they were already more than just a rabble of peasants and he would not throw them away without good reason to his experienced eye their formations of foot soldiers were ragged compared with the discipline of his tumans but they were still many standing in the mud with axes sword and shields tsubodai had given his orders and the rest was up to the individuals who led his men knew the plans could change in an instant if some new factor showed itself the ripple of orders would run again and the formations would change faster than an enemy could possibly react the light did not brighten under the cloud the rain became suddenly heavier though the thunder fell silent for a time by then tsubodai could make out horsemen moving across the hills like a stain he rode alongside his own tumans checking every detail as messengers raced across the field if it had not been for the rain he would have split his force and sent batu to one side to flank or encircle the enemy as it was he had chosen to appear slow and clumsy a single mass of warriors riding blindly at the enemy it was what the russians would expect from armoured knights tsubodai looked across to where batu rode with his tuman the younger mans position was marked in the third rank by a host of banners though tsubodai knew he was not there that too was an innovation armies concentrated their arrows on officers and kings tsubodais orders had been to reveal those spots with flags but have the generals in the ranks to one side the bannermen carried heavy shields and their morale was high at the thought of fooling an enemy in such a way a clot of cold mud flung from a hoof touched tsubodais cheek and he wiped it away the russians were no more than a mile off and his mind clicked through calculations as the armies closed what else could he have done he grimaced at the thought much of the plan depended on batu following his orders but if the younger general failed or disobeyed tsubodai was ready he would not give batu another chance no matter who his father and grandfather had been the rain died away without warning the morning suddenly filled with the sounds of horses and men orders suddenly clear where they had been muffled the russian prince had widened the line when he saw their numbers preparing to encircle one of the russian flanks was struggling to keep up with the rest over boggy ground their horses plunging and rising it was a weakness and tsubodai sent scouts to his generals to make sure they had noted it eight hundred paces and he kept the columns together it was too far for arrows and cannon would have been left behind on such a slog over soft ground tsubodai saw that the russian warriors carried spears and bows he could not see the huge horses ridden by knights in iron this russian noble seemed to favour light armour speed over power much as tsubodai did himself if the enemy truly understood those qualities tsubodai knew they would be hard to pin down but they showed no sign of such an understanding they had seen his smaller force lumbering along in a single block whoever led them had chosen a simple hammerhead formation to crush mere tribesmen and sheepherders at four hundred paces the first shafts were sent high shot by young fools on both sides who should have known better none reached his men from the russian side and most of his own warriors guarded their bowstrings keeping them covered until the last moment men who had fashioned a bow themselves would not risk it being destroyed by a snapping string the weapons were precious sometimes the only thing of value they owned apart from a pony and saddle tsubodai saw the russian prince who led the force like batus false position he was surrounded by flags and guards but there was no mistaking the enormous horse at the centre of the army its rider sitting in armour that shone like silver in the rain the mans head was bare and at two hundred paces his eyes still sharp over distance tsubodai could see a blond beard he sent another rider to batu to be sure he had marked his man but it was unnecessary as soon as the messenger had hared away tsubodai saw batu point and exchange commands with his minghaans thunder grumbled again above their heads and for an instant tsubodai saw thousands of lighter faces among the enemy as men looked up many were bearded he realised compared to the mongol face where little hair grew they were like great lumbering bears arrows followed as his light cavalry released thousands of shafts sending them high for the first shots every tenth man used a whistling head carved and fluted to scream in the air they did less damage than the steelhead shafts but the sound was unearthly and terrifying in the past armies had broken and run from that first volley tsubodai grinned to hear the naccara drums hammer out their own thunder answering the storm as it dwindled to the east the arrows curved upwards dropping hard tsubodai noted the way the russians protected the blond leader with shields ignoring their own safety some of the mans guards fell but then the steady approach seemed to go faster and the distance between them dwindled rapidly the mongol light horsemen released another storm of arrows before falling back at the last moment and letting the lancers through it was batus moment of madness exactly as tsubodai had ordered the grandson of genghis would challenge the blond leader personally a knight of iron would expect just such a challenge the naccara drums roared the strikes blurring as the camel boys hit the great kettles at their sides as batus minghaans cantered into a spear formation lunging ahead of the tumans the warriors screamed an ululating bellow to send men white arrows rained down from the russian horsemen they fell most heavily on the bannermen in the third rank of the main formation surrounded by the snapping flags they raised their shields above their heads and endured ahead of them batu took three thousand in a charge for the very centre of the russian force tsubodai watched coldly satisfied that the younger mans nerve was up to the task the spearhead was to serve one purpose tsubodai watched as they punched a hole with arrows in the russian lines then rode lances at it crashing deeper in the blond leader was pointing at them shouting to his men as batus minghaans threw down broken lances and drew the lightly curved swords of good steel horses and men went down but they pushed on before he was lost to sight in the mass tsubodai saw batu at the bloody tip of the spear pushing his mount on and on batu seethed as he chopped down on a roaring face dragging his blade across a mans mouth so that his jaw hung slack his sword arm ached but his blood was on fire and he felt as if he could fight all day he knew tsubodai would be watching the ruthless tactician the orlok bahadur who threw warriors away as if they were nothing to him well let the old men see how it was done batus strike minghaans crashed on into the russians aiming at the prince and his long flags there were moments when batu could see the blond warrior in his shining armour he knew they were coming for him risking it all on a single blow to his throat it was the sort of attack a russian army might have made batu knew the true plan tsubodai had given him that much before sending him out he was to hit hard until his men began to be overwhelmed only then could he fight his way out again he smiled bitterly to himself it would not be hard to feign panic at that point the false retreat would collapse the mongol centre quickly turning into a rout as the tumans withdrew the enemy horsemen would be drawn through the wings of foot soldiers further and further stretched thin over the ground then the jaws would close if any of them made it through the trap kachiuns reserve would hit from both sides hidden two miles back in heavy forest it was a good plan if the auxiliaries could hold the flanks if batu survived it as he backhanded his sword across a horses cheek tearing a great flap he recalled the challenge in the generals eyes as he had given him the order batu had shown him none of the roiling fury that filled him of course tsubodai had chosen him who else had been a thorn in his side for so many months his minghaan officers had exchanged resigned glances when they heard but they had still volunteered not one of them had stood back rather than ride with the grandson of genghis fresh fury filled batu at the thought of their wasted loyalty how far had he come two hundred paces three more into the enemy they milled around him their blades flickering their shields taking his blows arrows whipped past his face they wore leather armour and his blade was sharp enough to pierce it with a thrust or even gash it as he went past leaving them gasping over bloody ribs he had no idea how long he had been pressing forward in the mass of horses further and further away from safety and the tumans all he knew was that he had to choose the moment well too soon and the russians would sense a trap and simply close ranks behind him too late and there would not be enough battered warriors left to stage the false retreat his men had chosen to follow into the mouth of the beast not because of tsubodai but because of him he felt his charge slowing as the mongol warriors were hemmed in every step brought more russian warriors against their flanks stretching their force thinner and thinner like a needle into flesh that gripped it tight batu felt fear rise in his throat like acid he grabbed a shield of leather and wood and yanked it towards him with his left hand stabbing down over the edge into the man behind it he thrust the blade with all his fury and then punched with the hilt so that the enemy fell away his face a mass of blood three warriors stayed in line with him as he forced his mount another four steps forward killing a man to make space without warning one of his companions was gone taken by an arrow in the throat and falling backwards out of the saddle so that the horse snorted and lashed out with its hooves its own panic growing it was time it was surely time batu looked around him had he done enough the agony of the choice ate at him he could not come back too early and face tsubodais stern expression better to die than have that man consider he had lost his nerve it had always been hard to look in the eyes of a man who had known genghis how could he ever match up to those memories the grandfather who had conquered a nation who had never known batu at all the father who had betrayed the nation and been killed like a dog in the snow it was time batu took a sword blow on his armoured sleeve letting it slide uselessly past him as he gashed the arm that held it more blood coated him and there was screaming everywhere the russians he faced were pale with rage or fear holding heavy shields that bristled with mongol arrows batu turned to begin the retreat and for a single moment he saw through the ranks of enemies to where the blond leader sat calmly watching him a huge sword ready across his saddle horns tsubodai had never expected the spearhead to get so close batu saw that his men were ready to cut their way back though he bore no marks of rank that would have made him the target for every russian archer his warriors watched him risking their lives to glance his way most of the russians were still facing the front where the tumans were clashing with them they would howl and chase as the mongols turned to run but batu thought his men would win through beginning the rout he was so close who would have thought his spearhead thrust could reach the russian prince batu took a deep breath no retreat he roared warning his men he dug in his heels and his pony kicked out with its front hooves knocking a shield from its owners broken fingers batu lunged for the gap swinging his blade wildly something hit him from the side and he felt a wave of pain that vanished before he knew whether it was serious he saw the blond leader raise his sword and shield and the enormous horse snorted the russian prince had decided not to wait his blood lighting up at the challenge his own shieldbearers were knocked to one side as the warhorse started forward batu yelled in excitement a babble of insult and fury he had not known if he could break through the final solid ranks but there was the prince himself coming to cut down the impudent horsemen batu saw the mans sword rise up behind his shoulder the two horses were headon but batus mount was weary and battered bruised by constant impact and the thousand scrapes and cuts that came from running through a fighting line batu brought his own sword high trying to remember tsubodais words on the weaknesses of knights the blondbearded man seemed like a giant as he came closer wrapped in steel and unstoppable yet he wore no helmet and batu was young and fast as the russian blade swept down with enough force to cut him in half batu nudged his pony to the right away from the sweeping sword his own blade licked out in a thrust holding it just long enough to caress the mans throat under the beard batu swore as his weapon scraped across metal a piece of the beard had been cut loose but the man himself was untouched though he roared in shock the horses were passing in the press unable to ride free but both men were sideon to each other their weaker left sides exposed the princes sword came back up but he was slow and heavy before he could land a blow batu had struck three times into his face chopping at the cheeks and teeth cutting away part of the jaw the russian prince lurched as batu hammered at his armour denting the plate metal that protected his chest the princes face was a bloody ruin his teeth broken and his jaw hanging loose he would surely die from such a terrible wound but his eyes cleared and he swung his left arm like a mace clad in iron it struck batu across the chest he was guiding his pony with pressure from his knees and he had no reins the high wooden saddle horns saved him and he twisted at an impossible angle his sword had gone and he could not remember it leaving his hand spitting anger he pulled a blade from a sheath on his calf and jammed it into the red mess of the princes jaw sawing back and forth at the blond beard that was thick and shining red the prince fell and a wail of horror went up from his shieldbearers and retainers batu raised both hands in victory roaring long and loud at being alive and victorious he did not know what tsubodai was doing or what the orlok would think it had been batus decision and the prince had faced him he had defeated a strong and powerful enemy and for a time he did not care if the russians killed him it was batus moment and he relished it at first he did not see the ripple that spread across the russians as the word spread for half the army it had happened behind them and the news of the death of the prince had to be shouted from unit to unit before batu lowered his arms some of the furthest nobles had turned their mounts and begun to withdraw taking thousands of fresh horsemen with them those who tried to continue the fight saw them go and shouted angrily across the battlefield blowing horns the prince was dead and his armies shook with the suddenness of the omen this was not to be their day their victory they went from determined fighters to frightened men as they heard backing away from tsubodais tumans while they waited to be rallied to have someone else take command it did not happen tsubodai sent minghaans racing along the flanks the wiry ponies spattering clots of earth like rain as they went arrows poured into the russian ranks once again and tsubodais heavy horse peeled off from the front and then came back in spearpoints like the one batu had led into the heart of their army three separate strikes tore at the milling ranks even then the defenders were halfhearted they had seen their senior noblemen leaving and regiments and units beginning to withdraw it was too much to ask that they stay to be slaughtered someone else could take the brunt of the mongol warriors now that their blood was up more and more russians marched clear looking back at the shrinking heart where their companions still rode and died it was enough the prince was dead and they had done enough tsubodai watched calmly as the russian army fell apart he wondered how his own tumans would fare if he was seen to fall but he knew the answer they would go on they would endure in the tumans the warriors hardly ever saw the orlok or even their own generals they knew the leader of their ten a man they had elected among themselves they knew the officer of the hundred perhaps even the minghaan officer by sight those were the ones who spoke with authority not some distant commander tsubodai knew that if he fell the nation would complete his task and promote another to lead in his stead it was a cold business but the alternative was to witness the destruction of an army from the death of one man tsubodai sent messengers to his generals congratulating them as they took new orders he wondered if those who had left the field expected him to let them go he could not always understand the foreign soldiers he encountered though he learned everything he could he knew that some of them might expect to return to their homes but that was foolish why leave alive men who could one day face you again that was war as a game and tsubodai knew it would be a long hunt weeks or even months before his men had killed the last of them he did not need to teach them their foolishness only to destroy them and move on he rubbed his eyes suddenly weary he would have to face batu if the young man still lived he had disobeyed his orders tsubodai wondered if he could have a general whipped after handing him such a victory tsubodai looked around as men cheered nearby his lips thinned in irritation as he saw batu was at the centre of it half the russian army was still in the field and his minghaans were passing around wineskins and whooping like children tsubodai turned his horse and trotted slowly towards the scene silence fell among those he passed as they realised the orlok was among them his bannermen unfurled long strips of silk that fluttered and snapped in the breeze batu sensed or heard the approach he had already begun to feel the battering he had taken one eye and cheek were swelling making his face look lopsided he was filthy with blood sweat and the strong smell of wet horses scales from his armour hung loose and he had a line of crusted red marking the skin from one ear down into his tunic yet he was jubilant and the sour face of tsubodai could not spoil his mood general you are throwing away a morning tsubodai said the men around batu choked off their cheering as it died away tsubodai continued coldly pursue the enemy general let not one of them escape locate their baggage and camp and secure it from looting batu looked at him suddenly quiet well general tsubodai went on will you face them again tomorrow when you have thrown away this advantage will you allow them to reach the safety of moscow or kiev or will you hunt the russians down now with the other tumans under my command the warriors around batu turned away with sudden jerkiness like boys caught stealing they would not look at tsubodai and only batu held his gaze tsubodai expected some sort of retort but he misjudged his man another group of riders came cantering across the lines the slaughter of the enemy was beginning with lancers and archers picking them off almost as sport tsubodai saw that the group was led by the khans son guyuk his face fixed on batu as he approached he did not seem to see tsubodai batu bahadur guyuk called bringing his horse alongside that was very fine cousin i saw it all by the sky father i thought you would never make it back but when you reached the nobleman lost for words he clapped batu on the back patting him in admiration i will put it in the reports to my father what a moment it was batu glanced at tsubodai to see how he was taking such generous praise guyuk noticed and turned my congratulations on such a victory tsubodai guyuk said he was bluff and cheerful apparently unaware of the strained moment he had interrupted what a stroke did you see any of it i thought i would choke when i saw the prince come forward to take him on tsubodai inclined his head in acknowledgement even so the russians must not be allowed to regroup it is time to pursue to hunt them all the way to moscow your tuman will ride out as well general guyuk shrugged a hunt then it has been a good day oblivious he thumped batu on the shoulder again and rode clear with his men bawling orders to another group to come with him the quiet swelled as he moved away and batu grinned as he waited tsubodai said nothing and batu nodded to himself turning his horse and joining his minghaan officers he left tsubodai staring after him chapter seventeen sorhatani swept around the corner in full array sons and servants marching with her she was a member of the khans own family by marriage she had thought he might never return from chin lands for the longest time they seemed to have swallowed his army with no word of their return yet when he came home at last there was no summons nothing from him at all she would not accept any other delays from petty pompous officials her messengers and servants had been baulked and sent back without even an excuse finally she had come to karakorum herself instead of simply being allowed to see the khan to talk of the grief and loss they shared she had been stopped by a chin official with jowls and soft hands what was ogedai thinking in using such perfumed courtiers in his own palace what sort of message of strength would that send to those less benign than sorhatani the courtier had stopped her once but today all four of her sons were with her she would see ogedai today no matter his sorrow she could share it the khan had lost a brother but she had lost her husband the father to her sons if there had ever been a time when ogedai could be persuaded of anything it was then the idea was intoxicating a man with as much power as genghis lay in his rooms like a broken reed the palace was full of rumours that he hardly even spoke or ate whoever reached him could surely have whatever they wanted yet he had given orders to keep visitors away well she would tell him how the insult had hurt her and begin the negotiations with that one last corner lay ahead in the labyrinth of the palace corridors she passed under painted murals without looking up her concentration focused on more important things the final corridor was a long one and in the stone halls the footsteps of her group echoed back though she saw there were men and guards in front of the polished copper door sorhatani stormed on forcing her sons to keep up let the fat little courtier sweat when he heard her coming the khan was her brotherinlaw ill and weak in sadness how dare a chin eunuch bar her entry to her own family as she approached she looked in vain for the brightcoloured silks the man preferred she almost missed a step as she saw yao shu was there in his place there was no sign of the man with whom she had argued that very morning yao shu had turned to face her his attitude clear from his stance sorhatani revised her plan as she went shedding anger like a snakeskin with every step by the time she reached the shining metal door she was walking at a normal pace and smiled as sweetly as she knew how at the khans chancellor still she seethed to have another chin stop her at the door especially one with such authority yao shu could not be browbeaten into submission nor threatened she did not have to look at her younger sons to know they were cowed by the man who had tutored them at one time or other yao shu had thrashed all four of the boys for some transgression he had beaten kublai like a rug when the boy put a scorpion in the chancellors boot now he faced her his face as forbidding as the guards at his sides the khan is not receiving visitors today sorhatani i am sorry you came across the city i did send a runner at dawn to warn you not to come sorhatani hid her irritation behind a smile giving her a house well away from the palace was another sign of voices other than ogedais at work the khan would have given her rooms in the palace if he knew she had come she was certain sorhatani rose to the challenge in yao shus impassive face what plot is this she hissed at him have you murdered the khan yao shu how is it that only chin men seem to roam the corridors of karakorum these days as yao shu took a breath in shock she spoke to her sons without looking away from the chancellor ready your swords mongke kublai i do not trust this man any longer he claims the khan will not see the wife of his beloved brother she heard the jingle of metal behind her but more importantly she saw the sudden doubt come into the faces of the mongol guards on either side of yao shu the khan has an army of servants scribes concubines and wives she said yet where is his wife torogene why is she not here to tend him in his illness how is it that i can find no one who can say they have seen him alive for days even weeks it thrilled her to see yao shus unnatural control crack at the accusations he was immediately flustered off balance as her words struck the khan has been very ill as you say he replied he has asked for quiet in his palace i am his chancellor sorhatani it is not up to me to say where his family has gone or to discuss it in a corridor she saw that he was truly struggling with difficult orders and she pressed on sensing the weak point of the mans essential kindness you say the family have gone yao shu guyuk is with tsubodai i do not know ogedais daughters or the children of other wives torogene is not here then his eyes flickered at the simple question i see she went on the summer palace perhaps on the orkhon river yes that is where i would have sent her if i intended to steal power in this city yao shu if i intended to murder the khan in his bed and replace him with who his brother chagatai he would be here in an instant is that your plan what lies beyond this door yao shu what have you done her voice had risen louder and higher yao shu winced at the strident tone but he was at a loss he could not have the guards take her away by force not with her sons ready to defend their mother the first one to lay a hand on sorhatani would lose it that much was obvious mongke in particular was no longer the sullen boy he had known yao shu deliberately kept his eyes on sorhatani but he could feel mongke staring coldly at him daring him to meet his gaze i must follow the orders i have been given sorhatani yao shu tried again no one is to pass through this door no one is to be granted an audience with the khan he does not have to answer to you and neither do i now please spend the day in the city rest and eat perhaps he will see you tomorrow sorhatani tensed as if to attack him yet yao shu had not been made weak with his duties her sons had told her how he snatched an arrow from the bowstring in the palace gardens it seemed an age ago when her husband was still alive she felt tears start in her eyes and blinked them away this was a time for anger not sorrow she knew if she let herself start weeping she would not pass the door that day she took a deep breath murder she shouted the khan is in danger come quickly there is no danger yao shu shouted over her the woman was insane what did she hope to gain yelling like a scalded cat in his corridors he heard running footsteps coming closer and cursed her under his breath the night before ogedai had become khan was still a painful memory among the guards they reacted to any perceived threat with a massive show of force in just a few heartbeats the corridor was blocked at both ends by sprinting warriors they were led by minghaans in black and red lacquered armour their swords already drawn yao shu held up both hands with palms clearly open and empty there has been a mistake he began no mistake alkhun sorhatani snapped turning to the senior man yao shu groaned to himself of course she knew the officers name sorhatani had a prodigious memory for such things but it was probably part of her plan to learn the names of the officers of the watch the chancellor struggled for words that would rescue the situation the lady is distraught he said the minghaan officer ignored him and spoke to sorhatani directly what is the difficulty here sorhatani looked down shaking her head to yao shus irritation there were tears showing in her eyes this chin official claims the khan cannot be seen by anyone for days now there has been no word he speaks suspiciously alkhun i do not trust his word the soldier nodded a man of quick thought and action as would be expected for one of his rank he turned to yao shu youll have to stand aside chancellor i need to check on the khan he gave orders yao shu started but the officer merely shrugged i will see him step aside right now the two men stood very still glowering at each other as if they were the only ones in the corridor yao shu had been put in an impossible position and sorhatani saw there could be a brief and bloody struggle in the corridor at any moment she spoke to break the deadlock you will accompany us of course yao shu she said his head snapped round towards her but she had given him a way out and he took it very well he said his expression tight with anger he turned to alkhun your concern does you credit minghaan however you are not to allow armed men such as these into the presence of the khan all must be searched for weapons first sorhatani began to protest but yao shu was adamant i insist he said reclaiming the balance of power they will remain here sorhatani said rather than lose the moment in truth she did not mind that her sons were to remain outside with their armour and blades they had served their purpose by backing her at the door she did not need them to hear everything after that with a grimace yao shu lifted the small bar of brass that made the central lock it was an ornate piece carved and marked like a dragon curled around the centre of the door yet another sign of the chin influence on the khan sorhatani thought as the door opened a rush of wind chilled them all as she followed yao shu and alkhun inside there were no lamps lit but dim light came from one open window the shutters had been thrown back with such force that one of them lay askew a hinge broken long silk curtains billowed into the room rustling and snapping at the walls with each gust the room was incredibly cold and their breath showed instantly as white mist the outer door closed behind them and sorhatani shivered as her eyes fell on the figure on a couch in the centre of the room how could ogedai withstand such a chill wearing only a thin silk tunic and leggings his arms were bare and his feet looked bluish as he lay on his back and stared up at the ceiling he had not acknowledged them and yao shu had a moment of dread that they had found the khans body then he saw pale mist rise from the still figure and he breathed again for a moment none of them were sure how to proceed the minghaan officer had seen that the khan still lived his task was at an end though his dignity forbade him from simply leaving at least until he had apologised for invading the khans privacy yao shu too was quiet guilty that he had failed in his orders sorhatani had manipulated them all of course she was the first to speak my lord khan sorhatani said she pitched her voice to carry over the noise of the wind but ogedai did not react i have come to you in my grief my lord still there was nothing and yao shu watched with interest as she firmed her jaw visibly controlling irritation the chancellor motioned for her to be taken away and the officer raised a hand to take her arm sorhatani shrugged off the touch my husband gave his life for you my lord how will you use his gift like this waiting for death in a frozen room that is enough yao shu said horrified he took sorhatanis arm in a firm grip and turned her back towards the door all three froze as they heard a creak behind them the khan had risen from his couch his hands shook slightly as they turned to face him and his skin was a sickly yellow his eyes bloodshot under that cold gaze the senior minghaan of the khans guards knelt and dipped his head to the floor rise alkhun ogedai said in a hoarse whisper why are you here did i not say i was to be left alone my lord khan i am sorry i was led to understand you might be ill or dying to his surprise ogedai smiled mirthlessly or indeed both alkhun well you have seen me now get out the officer moved with great speed to leave the room ogedai stared at his chancellor he did not yet look at sorhatani though he had risen at her voice leave me yao shu ogedai said his chancellor bowed deeply then tightened his hold on sorhatanis arm as he began to guide her out my lord khan she cried out enough yao shu snapped yanking her if he had released his grip she would have fallen but instead she swung around helpless and furious take your hands away she hissed at him ogedai how can you see me attacked and do nothing did i not stand with you on the night of knives in this very palace my husband would have answered this insult where is he now ogedai she was in the doorway when the khan replied you are dismissed yao shu let her approach my lord he began she let her approach sorhatani shot a look of pure venom at the chancellor as she rubbed her arm and stood straight yao shu bowed again and left the room without looking back his face cold and emotionless the door clanged softly behind him and she breathed slowly hiding her delight she was in it had been close and even dangerous but she had won through to the khan alone ogedai watched her come he felt guilt but he met her eyes before she could speak again footsteps sounded and a clinking of glass and metal sorhatani paused at the sight of the khans manservant barasaghur carrying a tray into the room i have a visitor baras ogedai murmured the servant stared at sorhatani with open hostility the khan is not well you should come back another time he spoke with the confidence of a trusted man his service to the khan beyond dispute sorhatani smiled at him wondering if he had taken on a more motherly role during the khans illness he certainly seemed happy fussing around ogedai when she did not move barasaghur tightened his lips and set the tray down by his master with a gentle clinking then he faced her the khan is not well enough for visitors he insisted a little too loudly sorhatani saw his growing indignation so she spoke louder still thank you for the tea barasaghur i will serve the khan in your place you do remember your place the servant spluttered for a moment looking to ogedai when the khan said nothing barasaghur bowed with icy dislike and left the room sorhatani added a sprinkling of brown salt to the steaming golden liquid salt that was so precious for life finally she added milk from a tiny jug its surface smooth in her hands her fingers were quick and sure serve me ogedai said gracefully she knelt before him and held out the cup bowing her head i am yours to command my lord khan she said she shivered slightly at the touch of his hands as he took it from her he was like ice in that room where the wind blew constantly from under lowered eyelids she could see his face was mottled and dark as if there were bruises deep within up close his feet were veined like marble his eyes were pale yellow as they regarded her he sipped the tea the plume of steam whipped away in the breeze sorhatani settled herself kneeling at his feet and looking up into his face thank you for sending me my son she said it was a comfort to me to hear the worst from him ogedai looked away from her he changed the cup from one hand to another as its heat burned his frozen flesh he wondered if she knew how beautiful she was kneeling with her back so straight and the wind snatching at her hair it looked like a living thing and he watched in silence mesmerised since his return to karakorum he had not spoken of toluis death he could feel sorhatani edging towards the subject and he shrank back physically on the low couch cradling the cup as his only warmth he could not explain the lassitude and weakness that beset his days months fled from him without his notice and the challenges of the khanate went unanswered he could not rouse himself from the dim dawns and sunsets he waited for death and cursed its slowness in coming sorhatani could hardly believe the changes in ogedai he had left karakorum full of life constantly drunk and laughing fresh from the triumph of becoming khan he had gone with his elite tumans to secure the chin borders thriving on a difficult task in the field recalling those days was like looking back on youth the man who had returned had aged visibly deep wrinkles appearing on his forehead and around his eyes and mouth the pale eyes no longer reminded her of genghis there was no spark there no sense of danger in the quiet gaze it would not do my husband was in good health she said suddenly he would have lived for many years seen his sons grow into fine men perhaps he would have had other children taken more wives in time he would have been a grandfather i like to think of the joy he would have taken in those years ogedai shrank back as if she had attacked him but she went on without hesitating her voice firm and clear so that he could hear every word he had a sense of duty that is too rare today my lord khan he believed the nation came before his health his life he believed in something greater than himself or my happiness or even the lives of his sons your fathers vision my lord that a nation can spring from the tribes of the plains that they can find a place of their own in the world that they deserve such a place ii have said that he ogedai began sorhatani interrupted him and for an instant anger showed in his eyes before it faded he threw his future into the wind but not just for you my lord he loved you but it was not just for love it was also for his fathers will and dreams do you understand of course i understand ogedai said wearily sorhatani nodded but went on he gave you life a second father to you but not just for you for those who come after you in his fathers line for the nation to come the warriors who are children yet the children who will be born he gestured with his hand trying to fend off her words i am tired now sorhatani perhaps it would be best and how did you use this most precious gift sorhatani whispered you send your wife away you leave your chancellor to roam an empty palace your guards are left to make trouble in the city on their own untended two of them were hanged yesterday did you know that they murdered a butcher for a haunch of beef where is the breath of the khan on their necks the sense that they are in the nation is it in this room in this freezing wind while you sit alone sorhatani you will die here they will find you stiff and cold and toluis gift will have been thrown away tell me then how i will justify what he did for you his face twisted and in astonishment she saw that he was struggling not to weep this was not genghis who would have sprung up in rage at her words this was a broken man before her i should not have let him do it ogedai said how long do i have months days i cannot know what is this foolishness sorhatani said forgetting herself in her exasperation you will live for forty years and be feared and loved throughout a huge nation a million children will be born with your name in your honour if you leave this room and this weakness behind you you dont understand ogedai said only two other men knew of the weakness that plagued him if he told sorhatani he was risking it becoming common knowledge in the camps and tumans yet they were alone and she knelt before him her eyes wide in the gloom he needed someone my heart is weak he said his voice just a breath i truly do not know how long i have i should not have let him sacrifice himself for me but i was he stumbled over the words oh my husband sorhatani said to herself as she understood at last a sudden upwelling of grief choked her oh my love she looked up at him her eyes shining with tears did he know did tolui know i think so ogedai said looking away he was not sure how to respond he had learned that his shaman had discussed the weakness of his body with his brother and uncle but he had not asked tolui himself having surfaced from a dark river choking and gasping back to life ogedai had grasped at anything offered to him at that time he would have done anything just for a day in the light now it was hard to remember that yearning for life as if it had been someone else the cold room with its billowing silk jarred somehow with the memories he looked around him blinking like one awakening from sleep if he knew it was an even greater sacrifice she said and even more reason why you must not waste another day of it if he can see you now ogedai will he consider he gave his life for something worthwhile or will he be ashamed of you ogedai felt a stab of anger at her words you dare to speak to me in such a way he demanded he had stopped blinking like a dayold lamb the gaze he fixed on her had a touch of the old khan in it sorhatani welcomed it though she still reeled at what she had heard if ogedai died who would lead the nation the answer followed on the question without a pause chagatai would be back in karakorum in just days riding in triumph to accept the beneficent will of the sky father she ground her teeth at the very thought of his pleasure get up she said get up my lord if you do not have long there is still much to do you must not waste another day another morning take hold of your life with both hands and crush it to you my lord you will not have another in this world he began to speak and she reached out and pulled his head towards her kissing him hard on the mouth his breath and lips were cool with the scent of tea when she released him he lurched backwards then came to his feet staring incredulously at her what was that he said i have enough wives sorhatani that was to see if you were still alive my lord my husband gave his life for these precious days no matter how long or short they are in his name will you trust me he was still dazed she knew it she had awoken some part of him but the fog of despair perhaps of the chin drugs was still weighing heavily dulling his wits yet she saw a gleam of interest in his eyes as he looked at her kneeling before him he summoned his will like a stick borne aloft on a flood visible for an instant before vanishing into the depths no sorhatani i dont trust you she smiled that is to be expected my lord but you will learn i am on your side she rose and closed the windows shutting out the moaning wind at last i will call your servants lord you will feel better when you have eaten proper food he stared at her as she yelled for barasaghur snapping instructions to the man in a torrent baras looked to ogedai over her shoulder but the khan just shrugged and acquiesced it was a relief to have someone else who knew what he needed the thought sparked another i should have my wife and daughters brought back to the palace sorhatani they are at the summer house on the orkhon sorhatani considered for a moment you are still unwell my lord i think i should wait a few days before restoring your family and servants we will take it slowly for a short time she would be the only one with the ear of the khan with his seal she could have her son mongke join tsubodai on the great trek where the future was being written she was not ready to throw that influence away so quickly ogedai nodded unable to resist her chapter eighteen the ground was covered in autumn frost and the horses snorted white mist as mongke rode past yet another pair of tsubodais scouts he was already in awe of the general but nothing had prepared him for taking ten thousand warriors through the mans trail of destruction from beyond the volga river for hundreds of miles west towns and villages had been looted or destroyed he had passed the site of three major battles still marked with a host of birds and small animals made bold at the presence of so much rotting flesh the odour seemed to have seeped into him so that mongke could smell it on every breeze he saw scouts galloping ahead of him for days before he caught sight of the main mongol army it had spent the summer in an encampment equal to karakorum as it had been before the khans city was built it was a host of white gers a peaceful scene of morning fires and vast herds of horses in the distance mongke shook his head in silent wonder as he trotted closer his banners had been recognised of course but still tsubodai sent a minghaan out to meet him before the tuman was in striking distance of the main camp mongke accepted the silent scrutiny of the orloks men he recognised their officer and saw the man nod to himself mongke knew then that tsubodai had sent a man who could confirm his identity by sight he watched with fascination as the officer gestured to a companion who raised a long brass tube to his lips the note blared out and mongke looked around in astonishment as it was answered to the left and right horses and men appeared less than a mile away on both sides tsubodai had sent out a flanking force to contain him lying with their horses concealed in trees and behind a ridge of ground it went some way to explain how the ice general had fought his way so far from home by the time they reached the main camp a space had been cleared a vast empty field with access to a small river mongke was nervous show them the cold face he said quietly to himself as his tuman fell into the routines of the camp and began to set up gers with quick efficiency mongke dismounted his ten thousand and the horses they brought needed land the size of a large town just to rest tsubodai had prepared for their arrival he turned sharply at a cry of pleasure to see his uncle kachiun walking over the torn grass he looked much older than when mongke had last seen him and he limped heavily mongke watched him with a guarded expression but gripped his hand when kachiun held it out i have been waiting for days to see you kachiun said tsubodai will want to hear news of home this evening you are invited to his ger as a guest you will have fresh information he smiled at the young man his nephew had become i understand your mother has sources our scouts cant match mongke tried to hide his confusion karakorum was three thousand miles to the east it had taken him four months of hard travel to reach the general there had been times over the previous month when tsubodai was moving so fast he thought he would never catch up with him if the general had not stopped for a season to refresh his herds and men mongke would still have been travelling yet kachiun spoke as if karakorum was just over the next valley you are well informed uncle mongke said after a pause i do have a number of letters from home anything for me yes uncle i have letters from two of your wives as well as the khan excellent ill take those now then kachiun rubbed his hands together in anticipation and mongke suppressed a smile as he realised it was the main reason for his uncle coming to greet him in such a way perhaps they were not too busy to want fresh news of home he crossed to his pony as it munched on icerimed grass and he opened the saddlebags pulling out a sheaf of greasy yellow parchments kachiun looked around him as mongke sorted through them you would not have brought your fathers tuman to protect letters mongke you are staying then mongke thought of the efforts his mother had made to have ogedai assign her oldest son to this army she believed that the future of the nation lay in the battle honours he could win there that whoever returned from the sweep west would have a hand on the reins of fate he wondered if she was correct with the permission of orlok tsubodai yes he said handing over the letters marked for his uncle kachiun smiled as he took them and clapped his nephew on the shoulder you are dusty and tired i see rest and eat while your gers are constructed i will see you tonight both mongke and kachiun looked up as another rider came trotting across the camp towards them men covered the entire valley floor the camp and its smoky fires stretching away as far as mongke could see with the constant need for water food wood toilet pits and the thousand details of simply living it was a place of constant bustle and movement children ran around yelling and pretending to be warriors women watched them indulgently while they worked at a thousand different tasks real warriors trained or just stood guard over the herds through them all tsubodai rode with his eyes fixed on mongke his pace brisk he wore a new set of scale armour clean and well oiled so that it moved easily with him his horse was copperbrown almost red in the sunlight the orlok looked neither left nor right as he rode it was an effort for mongke to hold his gaze he saw tsubodai frown slightly and then the general dug in his heels and increased his speed bringing the pony up quickly so that it stood blowing and pawing the ground you are welcome in my camp general tsubodai said giving mongke his official title with no hesitation mongke bowed calmly he was aware that he owned the rank only because his mother seemed to have a hold on the khan yet his fathers sacrifice had raised the son and that was only right he had ridden in war against the chin he would do better with tsubodai he was certain as if in echo of his thoughts tsubodai looked over the tuman from karakorum i was sorry to hear of your fathers death tsubodai said he was a fine man we can certainly use you here the orlok was obviously pleased at the sight of so many additional warriors it brought his tumans up to six with almost as many again in his auxiliaries surely the sky father smiled on this campaign you have a month or two yet before we move tsubodai went on we must wait for the rivers to freeze solid after that we will ride against the city of moscow in winter mongke said before he could stop himself to his relief tsubodai only chuckled winter is our time they shut up their cities for the cold months they put their horses in stables and sit around great fires in enormous houses of stone if you want a bearskin do you attack in summer when it is strong and fast or cut its throat as it sleeps we can stand the cold mongke i took riazan and kolomna in winter your men will join the patrols and training immediately it will keep them busy tsubodai nodded to kachiun who bowed as the orlok clicked in his cheek and trotted the red horse away he isimpressive mongke said i am in the right place i think of course you are kachiun said it is incredible mongke only your grandfather had his touch on campaign there are times when i think he must be possessed of some warlike spirit he knows what they will do last month he sent me to the middle of nowhere to wait i was there just two days when a force came galloping over the hill three thousand armoured knights riding to relieve novgorod he smiled in memory where else would you rather be safe at home you were right to come out here we have one chance to knock the world back on its heels mongke if we can do it there will be centuries of peace if not everything your grandfather built will be ashes in just a generation those are the stakes mongke this time we will not stop until we reach the sea i swear if tsubodai can find a way to put horses on ships perhaps not even then chagatai rode along the cliffs of bamiyan with his eldest son baidur northwest of kabul the redbrown crags ran outside the lands granted him by ogedai but then his family had never truly recognised borders he grinned at the thought pleased to be riding in the fading heat in the shadow of dark peaks the town of bamiyan was an ancient place the houses built of the same dun stone that formed its backdrop it had suffered conquerors and armies before but chagatai had no quarrel with the farmers there he and his men patrolled areas outside the amu darya river but there was no cause to leave the villages and towns as smoking ruins with the khans shadow stretching over them they were actually thriving thousands of migrant families had come to live in the lands around his khanate knowing that no one would dare move an army in reach of samarkand or kabul chagatai had made his authority clear in the first two years as he took control of an area populated by wild bandits and aggressive local tribes most were slaughtered the rest driven away like goats to take word to those who did not hear the message had not been lost and many of the townspeople believed that genghis himself had returned chagatais men had not bothered to correct the error baidur was already tall with the pale yellow eyes that marked the line from the great khan ensuring instant obedience among those who had known genghis chagatai watched him closely as he guided his mare across broken ground it was a different world chagatai thought a little ruefully at baidurs age he had been locked in a struggle with his older brother jochi neither willing to give up the prospect of being khan after their father it was a bittersweet memory chagatai would never forget the day when their father had denied them both and made ogedai his heir the air had been baked all day but as the sun sank it grew cooler and chagatai could relax and enjoy the sights and sounds around him his khanate was a huge area larger even than the homeland it had been won by genghis but chagatai would not scorn the gift of his brother the cliffs were looming closer and he saw baidur look back at him to see where he wanted to go to the foot of the cliffs he said i want you to see a wonder baidur smiled and chagatai felt a burst of affection and pride had his own father ever felt such an emotion he did not know for a moment he almost wished jochi alive so he could tell him how different things were how his world had grown larger than the small inheritance they had fought over the horizons were wide enough for them all he realised now but the wisdom of age is bitter when those you have failed have gone he could not bring back the years of his youth and live them with greater understanding how impatient he had been once how foolish he had vowed many times not to make the same mistakes with his own sons but they too would have to find their path he thought then of another son of his killed in a raid by some ragged tribesmen it had just been his bad luck that he had come across them as they camped chagatai had made them suffer for the death of that boy his grief swelled and vanished just as quickly there had always been death in his life yet somehow chagatai survived where other perhaps better men had fallen his was a lucky line at the base of the cliffs chagatai could see hundreds of dark spots from his previous trips he knew they were caves some natural but most hewn from the rock by those who preferred the cool refuges to a brickbuilt house on the plain the brigand he sought that day had his base in those caves some of them went back into the earth for a great distance but chagatai did not think it would be too hard a task the tuman that rode at his back had brought enough firewood to bank at the entrance to every cave smoking them out like wild bees from their nest in among the dark fingernail smudges of the cave mouths two fingers of shadow rose above them immense alcoves cut into the rock baidurs sharp eyes picked them out from a mile away and he pointed excitedly looking to his father for an answer chagatai smiled at him in response and shrugged though he knew very well what they were it was one reason he had brought his son out on the raid the dark shapes grew before them as they came closer until baidur reined in his mare at the foot of the largest of the pair the young man was awestruck as his eyes made out the shape inside the cliff it was a huge statue larger than any manmade thing baidur had ever seen before the drapes of robes could be seen cut into the brown stone one hand was held up with an open palm the other outstretched as if in offering its partner was only slightly smaller two smiling figures looking out onto the fading sun who made them baidur asked in wonder he would have walked even closer but chagatai clicked his tongue to stop him the cavedwellers were sharpsighted and good with a bow it would not do to tempt them with his son they are statues of the buddha some deity of the chin he said out here the chin are far away baidur responded his hands opened and closed as he stood there obviously wanting to walk up and touch the enormous figures the beliefs of men know no borders my son chagatai said there are christians and moslems in karakorum after all the khans own chancellor is one of these buddhists i cannot see how statues could be movedno they were cut here the rock removed around them baidur said chagatai nodded pleased at his sons sharp wits the statues had been chiselled out of the mountains themselves revealed with painstaking labour according to the local men they have stood here as long as anyone can remember perhaps even for thousands of years there is another one in the hills a huge figure of a man lying down chagatai felt an odd pride as if he were somehow responsible for them himself his sons simple pleasure was a joy to him why did you want me to see them baidur asked i am grateful they areastonishing but why have you shown them to me chagatai stroked the soft muzzle of his mare gathering his thoughts because my father did not believe in building a future he said he used to say there was no better way for a man to spend his life than in war with his enemies the spoils and land and gold you have seen came almost by accident from those beliefs he never sought them for themselves yet here is proof baidur what we build can last and be remembered perhaps for a thousand generations to come i understand baidur said softly chagatai nodded today we will smoke out the thieves and brigands who inhabit the caves i could have hammered the cliffs with catapults in months or years i could have reduced them to rubble but i chose not to because of those statues they remind me that what we make can survive us as the sun set father and son stood and watched the shadows move across the faces of the huge stone figures behind them minghaan officers shouted and whistled to their men until the khans ger was up and the fires lit for the evening meal the men in the caves would wait another night some of them would escape in the darkness perhaps though chagatai had warriors hidden on the other side waiting for anyone who tried as they sat down to eat chagatai watched as baidur crossed his legs and took salt tea in his right hand the left cupping the elbow automatically he was a fine young warrior coming into his prime years chagatai accepted his tea and a plate heaped with pouches of unleavened bread and mutton well spiced and fragrant i hope you understand now why i must send you away my son he said at last baidur stopped chewing and chagatai went on this is a beautiful land ripe and rich a man could ride all day here but this is not where the nation will make its history there is no struggle here even if you count a few rebels and cattle thieves no the future is being written in the sweep west baidur you must be part of that his son did not reply his eyes dark in the gloom chagatai nodded pleased that he did not waste words he reached into his deel robe and withdrew a sheaf of bound parchments i sent messages to the khan my brother asking that you be allowed to join tsubodai he has given me that permission you will take my first tuman as your own and learn all you can from tsubodai he and i have not always fought on the same side but there is no better teacher in years to come the fact that you knew the orlok will be worth much in the eyes of men baidur swallowed his mouthful with difficulty bowing his head it was his greatest wish and he did not know how his father had understood loyalty had kept him in the khanate but his heart had been with the great trek thousands of miles west and north he was overcome with gratitude you honour me he said his voice tight chagatai chuckled and reached over to ruffle his sons hair ride fast boy if i know tsubodai he will not slow down for anyone i thought you might send me to karakorum baidur said his father shook his head his face suddenly bitter there is no future being written there trust me in this it is a place of stagnant water where nothing moves and no life stirs no the future is in the west chapter nineteen the wind moaned and then whispered like a living thing biting into their lungs as they breathed snow fell constantly though it could not obscure the path tsubodai and his men walked their horses along the line of the frozen moskva river beneath them the ice was like bone white and dead in the dark the city of moscow lay ahead its cathedrals and churches rising high on the horizon even in the darkness lights gleamed behind wooden shutters in the walls thousands of candles lit to celebrate the nativity of christ much of the city was shuttered and closed for the heart of winter the terrible cold that stole away the old and the weak the mongols trudged on heads down hooves and reins muffled in cloth the river they walked ran right through the centre of the city it was too wide to guard or block a natural weakness many of the warriors looked up as they passed under a bridge of wood and stone spanning the icy road in arches that were anchored in huge columns there was no outcry from the bridge itself the city nobles had not considered any invading army could be insane enough to walk the ice into their midst only two tumans followed the course of the river into moscow batu and mongke roamed to the south raiding towns and making certain there were no forces on their way to intercept the mongol armies guyuk and kachiun were further north preventing a relief army from forcemarching to save the city it was not likely the tumans seemed to be the only ones willing to move in the coldest months the chilled air was brutal the cold numbed their faces hands and feet leaching away their strength yet they endured many of them wore deel robes as cloaks over their armour they slathered thick mutton fat on exposed skin and wrapped themselves in layers of silk and wool and iron their feet frozen despite the lambswool stuffed into their boots many of them would lose toes even so their lips were already raw gummed shut with frozen spit yet they survived and when the rations ran short they took blood from their mounts filling their mouths with the hot liquid that could sustain them the ponies were thin though they knew to dig through the snow to crop frozen grass beneath they too had been bred in a harsh land tsubodais scouts moved faster than the main force risking their mounts on the icy ground to bring back the first warning of any organised defences the city seemed eerily silent the snow lending such a stillness to the air that tsubodai could hear hymns being sung he did not know the language but the distant voices seemed to suit the cold he shook his head the ice road was strangely beautiful in the shadows and moonlight but it was no place for sentiment his aim was to crush anyone with the strength to stand before him only then could he move on knowing his flanks and rear were safe the city itself was not large its cathedrals had been built on high ground above the river and around them clustered the houses of churchmen and wealthy families in the moonlight they could be seen spreading down the hills into a town of smaller buildings haphazard across the landscape the river fed them all gave them life as it would now bring death tsubodais head jerked up as he heard a voice call nearby high and broken the panic was unmistakable they had been seen at last he was only surprised it had taken so long the voice yelled and yelled then was choked off as one of the scouts riding along the banks used the sound to guide himself in there would be bright red blood on the snow the first of the night yet the watcher had been heard and it was not long before bells began to sound in the distance tolling a warning through the still darkness the cathedral was silent the air heavy with incense issuing from the censer in a trail of white smoke grand duke yaroslav sat with his family in the pews reserved for him his head bowed as he listened to the plainsong words of a prayer written eight centuries before if he was not flesh who was laid in a manger if he is not god whom did the angels who came down from heaven glorify the duke was not at peace no matter how he tried to put the cares of the world aside and take comfort from his faith who could know where the damned mongols would strike next they moved with incredible speed making children of the armies he had sent three thousand of his finest knights had been slaughtered at the beginning of winter they had ridden out to find the mongol army and report their position not to engage them they had not come back all he had were rumours of a bloody streak in the hills already covered in snow duke yaroslav twisted his hands together as the heavy incense filled his lungs if he was not flesh whom did john baptise father dmitri intoned his voice strong and resonant in the echoing church the benches were full and not just to celebrate the birth of christ yaroslav wondered how many of them had heard of the redmouthed wolf hunting through the hills and snow the cathedral was a place of light and safety though it was cold enough to need the heavy furs where better to come on such a night if he is not god to whom did the father say this is my beloved son the words were comforting summoning an image of the young christ on such a night yaroslav knew he should be focusing his thoughts on birth and rebirth but instead he thought of crucifixion of pain and agony in a garden more than a thousand years before his wifes hand touched his arm and he realised he had been sitting with his eyes closed silently rocking like the old ladies at prayer he had to keep up a calm front with so many eyes watching they looked to him to protect them but he felt helpless lost winter did not stop the mongol armies if his brothers and cousins had trusted him he could have put a force in the field to destroy the invaders but instead they thought he schemed for power and ignored his letters and messengers to be surrounded by such fools it was hard to find peace even on such a night if he was not flesh who was invited to the marriage in cana if he is not god who turned the water into wine the priests voice echoed rolling in a rhythm of its own that should have been comforting they would not read the darker verses on the night of christs birth yaroslav did not know if the mongol host would attack his cities of vladimir and moscow would they reach even kiev it was not so many years since they had struck so deep into the forests and tundra killing at will and then vanishing again there were many stories and legends of the fearsome tartars it was all they had left behind the last time like a storm they had struck and then vanished he had nothing that could stop them yaroslav began to wring his hands again praying with all his heart that his city his family might be spared god had mercy he knew the mongols had none far away thin shouts could be heard the duke looked up his wife was staring at him her expression confused he turned at the sound of running feet surely he would not be called out at this hour could his officers not handle one night without him while he found solace in the mother church he did not want to rise from the hardwon warmth of his seat as he hesitated more running steps could be heard as someone raced up the stairs to the bell tower yaroslavs stomach clenched in sudden terror no not here not this night the bell began to toll above his head half the congregation looked up as if they could see it through the wooden beams yaroslav saw father dmitri walking towards him and stood quickly struggling to master his fear before the priest could reach him he bent down and spoke into his wifes ear take the children now take the carriage to the barracks for your life find konstantin he will be there with my horses get out of the city i will come when i can his wife was whitefaced with terror but she did not hesitate as she gathered his daughters and sons herding them like sleepy geese duke yaroslav was already moving leaving his pew and striding down the central aisle all eyes were on him as father dmitri caught up with the duke and dared to take his arm the priests voice was a harsh whisper is it an attack the tartars can you hold the city duke yaroslav stopped suddenly so that the elderly man stumbled into him on another night he might have had the priest whipped for his insolence yet he would not lie in the presence of the born christ if they are here i cannot hold them father no look to your flock i must save my own family the priest fell back as if he had been struck his mouth open in horror above their heads the bell tolled on calling despair across the city and the snow the duke could hear screaming in the distance as he raced outside his riding boots skidding on the icy cobbles his familys coach was already moving a black shape slipping into the darkness with the drivers whipcrack echoing on either side he could hear his sons high voice fading into the distance unaware of the danger as only a child can be snow had begun to fall again and yaroslav shivered as he stood there his mind racing for months he had heard reports of the mongol atrocities the city of riazan had been reduced to smoking rubble with wild animals tearing at bodies in the streets he had ridden there himself with just a few of his guards and two of them had vomited into the snow at what they saw they had been hard men used to death but what they had encountered was utter desolation on a scale they had never known this was an enemy with no concept of honour who fought wars and destroyed cities to crush the will of an enemy the duke stepped towards the snorting mount of his aide it was a stallion uncut fast and black as night dismount he snapped return to the barracks on foot yes your grace the man said immediately swinging his leg over and jumping down to the snow as the duke mounted in his place finding the saddle still warm the aide stood back and saluted yaroslav didnt look at him already turning the animal and digging in his heels the hooves clattered on the stone road as he trotted away he could not gallop on the ice without risking a fall that could kill both him and the horse he heard shouting voices nearby and then a single clash of steel on steel a sword blow that carried in the frozen air from god alone knew how far away around him the sleeping city was waking up candles and lamps appeared in the windows and swung in the hands of men as they came out to stand in the street and shout questions to each other none of them knew anything more than once they stumbled and fell as they tried to avoid the black horse and its rider the barracks were not far away he halfexpected to see his familys coach up ahead the driver could force his horses to more speed held steady by the weight of the carriage and those within duke yaroslav prayed under his breath asking the innocent virgin to take care of his little ones he could not hold the city against the wolves that came in the snow all he could do was escape he told himself it was the correct tactical decision but the shame of it burned him even against the cold as he rode he ignored the voices calling behind him there would be few survivors not now the enemy had come in the depths of winter no one could have expected it he told himself he had gathered his main army near kiev ready for the spring they sat in a winter camp behind vast wooden palisades almost three hundred miles to the southwest he had just two thousand men in moscow and they were not his best troops many were injured soldiers wintering in the comfort of the city rather than the army camps where dysentery and cholera were a constant threat the duke hardened his heart to their fate they had to fight to give him time to get free he could only hope that the mongol army had not yet blocked the roads out of the city one of them must still be open for his family moonlight gleamed through the falling snow above him as he crossed a wooden bridge the frozen moskva river below he glanced at it as he clattered over the ancient wood and stiffened in the saddle at the sight of the white river covered with horses and men they were already spreading onto the banks like spilt blood black in the night he could hear more screaming as they tore into homes near the river he put his head down and rode on drawing the ornate dress sword on his hip in terror he saw dark figures clambering over the wooden bridge railings two no four men they had heard his horse and as he saw them something buzzed by his face too fast even to flinch from it he hoped the black horse made a difficult target and dug in his heels again suddenly heedless of the slippery ground a man loomed up on his right flank and yaroslav kicked feeling a spike of pain up his leg as the impact twisted his knee the man fell away in silence his chest crushed from the blow the duke was through then the white road opening before him as the bridge came to an end he felt the arrow strike as a shudder in his mount the animal whinnied in pain snorting harder and harder with every step the gallop slowed and yaroslav kicked and leaned forward trying for the last burst of speed his hands had held reins from a young age and he could almost feel the life drain out of the stallion as it struggled on panic and duty keeping it going he rounded a corner leaving the bridge behind but the animals great heart could take him no further the stallion went down hard without warning the front legs collapsing yaroslav tumbled tucking in his head and trying to roll as he hit even with the snow the ground was like iron and he lay winded and stunned knowing he had somehow to regain his feet before they came looking dazed and helpless he struggled up wincing as his knee crackled and shifted under him he would not cry out he could hear their guttural voices just around the corner he began to stagger away more from instinct than with any sense of purpose his knee was on fire and when he reached down to it he bit his lip to stop a shout of pain it was already swelling how far was the barracks walking had become agony and he could only shuffle on the bad leg his eyes filled with unwanted tears as he was forced to put his weight on it lurching over it with each step and beginning again if anything the pain worsened until he thought he might pass out in the snow surely he could not endure much longer he reached another corner and behind him he heard the voices grow louder they had found the horse the duke had seen the burnt dead in riazan he forced himself to go faster for a few steps but then his leg crumpled as if he had no control over it he hit the ground hard and bit his tongue feeling sour blood fill his mouth weak and still dazed he turned over and spat he could not kneel to gasp and recover his knee was still too painful even to touch instead he reached out to a wall and dragged himself up with his arms at any moment he expected to hear running footsteps as the mongol animals caught him drawn by the scent of blood perhaps yaroslav turned to face them knowing he could run no longer from the deep shadows by the wall of a house he saw a group of mongols on foot leading their horses as they followed his tracks he groaned at the sight the snow was still falling but his prints would be visible for another hour more they had not yet seen him but a child could follow that path he looked around desperately for some bolthole painfully aware that all his soldiers were at the barracks his family would already be on the road west and south to kiev if he knew konstantin the grizzled old soldier would send a hundred of the best men and horses with them yaroslav did not know if the rest would stay and fight or simply melt away into the darkness leaving the citizens to their fate he could already smell smoke on the air but he could not drag his gaze from the men hunting him in his delirium he thought he had come further but they were no more than fifty or sixty paces away they were already pointing in his direction a rider came trotting down the road from the bridge yaroslav saw the men straighten from where they stared at his tracks to his eyes they looked like dogs faced with a wolf and they stood with their heads down the man snapped orders at them and three of the four immediately began to move the last one stared into the shadows that hid the duke as if he could see him yaroslav held his breath until his senses swam finally the last man nodded grimly and mounted his pony turning the animal back to the bridge the duke watched them go with mixed emotions he could hardly believe he would live but at the same time he had discovered the mongols had discipline ranks and tactics someone higher up had told them to take and hold the bridge the brief chase had dragged them away but the structure of some sort of regular army had found them and dragged them back he had survived but he had yet to face them in the field and the task ahead had suddenly become a great deal harder he staggered as he set off again the pain making him swear under his breath he knew the street of weavers the barracks was not too far away he could only pray there was someone still there waiting for him tsubodai stood alone in a stone tower looking out over the frozen city to reach the window he had inched past a massive bronze bell dark green with age as he stared across the night parts of it were lit by flames spots of gold and flickering yellow he drummed his fingers on the engraved surface of the bell listening idly to the deep tone that went on for a long time the vantage point suited him perfectly in the light of distant flames he could see the result of his sudden strike along the ice road below him mongol warriors were already running wild he could hear their laughter as they tore silk hangings from the walls and threw goblets and chalices across the stone floors unimaginably ancient there was screaming below as well as laughter there had been little resistance what soldiers there were had been slaughtered quickly as the mongols spread through the streets the conquering of a city was always bloody the men received no gold or silver from tsubodai or their generals instead they expected to loot and take slaves wherever he led them it made them hungry as they stared at city walls but when they were inside his officers had to stand back not one of them could control the minghaans after that it was their right to hunt women and men through the streets drunk on wine and violence it offended tsubodais senses to see the warriors reduced to such a state as a commander he had to keep a few minghaans sober in case a counterattack appeared or a new enemy hove into view in the morning the tumans had drawn lots for those unlucky ones who would stand and shiver all night listening to the screams and revelry and wishing they were allowed to join in tsubodai thinned his lips in irritation the city had to burn he had no qualms about that he cared nothing for the fate of the citizens within they were not his people still it seemedwasteful undignified it offended his sense of order to have his tumans run riot the moment a city wall fell he smiled wearily at the thought of how they would respond if he offered them regular pay and salt instead of loot genghis had once told him he should never give an order they would not obey he should never let them see the limits of his authority the truth was that he could have called them back from the city they would form up at his order dropping everything drunk or sober to ride back they would certainly do it once just once he heard raucous laughter coming closer a womans voice whimpered and he blew air out in irritation as he realised the men were coming up the steps in just moments he saw two of his warriors dragging a young woman as they looked for a quiet place the first one froze as he saw the orlok standing at the belltower window of the cathedral the warrior was roaring drunk but tsubodais gaze had a way of cutting through the fog caught by surprise the man tried to bow on the steps and stumbled his companion behind him called out an insult i will leave you in peace orlok the warrior said slurring and dipping his head his companion heard and fell silent but the woman continued to struggle tsubodai turned his gaze on her and frowned her clothes were well made of good materials she was the daughter of some wealthy family probably already killed before her her dark brown hair had been bound in a silver clasp but it had torn halffree so it hung in long tresses swinging as she tried to pull away from the grip of the warriors she looked at tsubodai and he saw her terror he almost turned and let them retreat the warriors were not so drunk that they would dare move until he dismissed them he had no living children himself no daughters leave her here tsubodai snapped surprising himself even as he spoke he was the ice general the man without emotion he understood the weaknesses of others he did not share them yet the cathedral was beautiful in its way with great fluted arches of stone that appealed to him he told himself it was those things that touched his sensibilities not the girls animal panic the warriors let go of her and vanished back down the steps at a great pace pleased to get away without a punishment or extra duties as the clatter of their boots faded tsubodai turned again to look out over the city there were more fires by then and parts of moscow glowed red with flame by morning much of it would be ashes the stones so hot they would crack and burst apart in the walls he heard her panting and the slight scrape as she sank down the wall can you understand me he asked in the chin tongue turning she looked blankly at him and he sighed the russian language had little in common with either of the tongues he knew he had picked up a few words but nothing that would let her know she was safe she stared at him and he wondered how a father would feel in such a position she knew she could not escape back down the stairs violent drunken men roamed the church and streets around it she would not get far it was quieter in the bell tower and tsubodai sighed as she began to sob softly to herself bringing her knees up to her chest and keening like a child be silent he snapped suddenly irritated with her for spoiling his moment of peace she had lost her shoes somewhere he noticed her feet were scratched and bare she had fallen silent at his tone and he watched her for a while until she looked up at him he held up his hands showing they were empty menya zavout tsubodai he said slowly pointing at his chest he could not ask her name he waited patiently and she lost some of her tension anya she said a torrent of sound followed that tsubodai could not follow he had all but exhausted his stock of words in his own language he went on stay here he said gesturing you are safe here i will go now he began to walk past her and at first she flinched when she realised he was trying to step past onto the stone steps she cried out in fear and spoke again her eyes wide tsubodai sighed to himself all right i will stay tsubodai stay until the sun comes up understand then i will leave the soldiers will leave you can find your family then she saw he was turning back to the window nervously she crept further into the room so that she sat at his feet genghis khan tsubodai muttered have you heard the name he saw her eyes widen and nodded to himself a rare bitterness showed in his expression they will talk of him for a thousand years anya longer yet tsubodai is unknown the man who won his battles for him who followed his orders the name of tsubodai is just smoke on the breeze she could not understand him but his voice was soothing and she pulled her legs in tighter making herself small against his feet he is dead now girl gone i am left to atone for my sins you christians understand that i think she looked blankly at him and her lack of understanding freed words that were lodged deep in his chest my life is no longer my own tsubodai said softly my word is worthless but duty goes on anya while there is breath it is all i have left the air was frozen and he saw she was shivering with a sigh he removed his cloak and draped it over her he watched as she curled into its folds until only her face showed the cold intensified without the warm cloth around his shoulders but he welcomed the discomfort his spirits were in turmoil and sadness swelled in him as he rested his hands on the stone sill and waited for the dawn chapter twenty yao shu fumed as he faced sorhatani even the air in the room was subtly scented as it had not been before she wore her new status like heavy robes taking delight in the number of servants attending her through ogedai she had been given the titles of her husband at a single stroke she controlled the heartlands of the mongol plains the birthplace of genghis himself yao shu could not help but wonder if the khan had considered all the implications when he made the offer to tolui before his death another woman would have quietly managed the lands and titles for her sons until she passed them on surely that was what ogedai had intended yet sorhatani had done more only that morning yao shu had been forced to stamp and seal an order for funds from the khans treasury toluis personal seal had been used on the papers and as chancellor yao shu could not refuse it under his sourfaced glare vast sums of gold and silver had been packed into wooden crates and delivered to her guards he could only imagine what she would do with enough precious metal to build herself a palace or a village or a road into the wilderness as yao shu sat in her presence he ran a buddhist mantra through his mind bringing calm to his thoughts she had granted him an audience as his superior fully aware of how her manner irked the khans chancellor it was not lost on him that ogedais own servants scurried to serve them tea no doubt sorhatani had chosen ones he would know personally to demonstrate her power yao shu remained silent as he was handed the shallow bowl he sipped noting the quality of chin leaf that had been used it was probably from the khans personal supply brought at immense cost from the tea plantations at hangzhou yao shu frowned to himself as he put the cup down in just a few months sorhatani had made herself indispensable to the khan her energy was extraordinary but yao shu could still be surprised at how deftly she had read the khans needs what was particularly galling was that yao shu had respected the orders he had been given he had accepted ogedais need for privacy and seclusion the chancellor had done nothing wrong yet somehow she had bustled into the palace wielding her sudden authority over servants as if she had been born to it in less than a day she had furnished and aired a suite of rooms close by ogedais own the servants assumed the khans approval and though yao shu suspected she had overreached his favour a hundred times over sorhatani had dug herself into the palace like a tick burrowing under skin he watched her closely as she sipped her own tea her robe of fine green silk was not lost on him nor the way her hair was bound in silver and her skin dusted with pale powder so that she looked almost like porcelain cool and perfect the robes and manner of a chin noblewoman were deliberately assumed but she returned his gaze with the calm directness of her own people in itself her stare was a challenge to him and he struggled not to respond the tea is fresh chancellor she asked he inclined his head it is very good but i must ask you are comfortable shall i have the servants bring a cushion for your back yao shu rubbed one of his ears before settling himself again i need no cushions sorhatani what i need is an explanation of the orders that were delivered to my rooms last night orders chancellor surely such things are between you and the khan it is certainly no business of mine her eyes were wide and guileless and he covered his irritation by signalling for more of the tea he sipped the pungent liquid once more before trying again as im sure you know sorhatani the khans guards will not let me speak to him it was a humiliating admission and he coloured as he spoke wondering how she had come between ogedai and the world with such neatness all the men around the khan had respected his wishes she had ignored them treating ogedai as if he were an invalid or a child the gossip in the palace was that she doted on him like a mother hen with a chick but instead of being irritated ogedai seemed to find relief in being cosseted yao shu could only hope for his swift recovery that he might throw the shewolf out of the palace and rule again in earnest if you wish chancellor i can ask the khan about the orders you say were sent to you however he has been unwell in spirit and body answers cannot be demanded from him until he is strong again i am aware of that sorhatani yao shu said he clenched his teeth for an instant so that she saw the muscles ripple in his jaw nonetheless there has been some mistake i do not think the khan wishes me to leave karakorum for some pointless taxgathering tally in the northern chin towns i would be away from the city for months still if those are your orders she said shrugging we obey yao shu do we not his suspicions hardened though he could not see how she could have been the author of the command to send him away it made him more determined to remain and challenge her control of the khan in his weakened state i will send a colleague i am needed here in karakorum sorhatani frowned delicately you take great risks chancellor in the khans state of health it would not do to anger him with disobedience i do have other work such as bringing the khans wife back from the summer palace where she has languished these long months it was sorhatanis turn to look uncomfortable he has not called for torogene she said she is not his servant he replied she was most interested in your care of her husband when she heard you were in such close contact i am told she was keen to return and thank you personally sorhatanis eyes were cold as she regarded the chancellor their mutual loathing barely hidden by the facade of manners and calm you have spoken to her by letter of course i believe she will be arriving in just a few days in a moment of inspiration he embroidered the truth a little for his benefit playing the game she has asked that i be here to receive her so that she can be told all the latest news of the city you see now why i cannot go haring off at such a time sorhatani bowed her head slightly giving him the point you have beenconscientious in your duties i see she said there is a great deal to do to welcome back the wife of the khan i must thank you for letting me know in time a tic had begun high on her forehead evidence of internal strain yao shu watched it in delight knowing she felt his gaze on that spot he chose his moment to add to her discomfort for my own part i would also have wanted to discuss the permission ogedai gave for his nephew to travel to tsubodai what sorhatani said shaken from her reverie mongke will not be an observer of the future chancellor he will help to shape it it is right that my son is present as tsubodai secures the west or should the orlok take all the credit for giving us a safe border im sorry i did not mean your own son i meant baidur the son of chagatai he too is following in tsubodais steps oh i thought you would have heard he tried not to smile as he spoke for all her connections at the heart of the city sorhatani had no access to his network of spies and gossipmongers stretching for thousands of miles in every direction at least not yet he watched as she mastered her surprise and her emotions settled it was impressive control and he had to remind himself that her beauty hid sharper wits than most yao shu leaned forward so the servants around them could not easily overhear if you are truly one who looks to the future i am surprised you did not consider baidur joining the great trek west his father is next in line to be khan after all after ogedais son guyuk sorhatani snapped yao shu nodded all being well of course but it was not so many years ago that these corridors and rooms were full of armed men contesting just such an event may it never happen again the princes are gathering sorhatani with tsubodai if you are planning to have your sons reach for the khanate one day you should be aware of the stakes involved guyuk batu and baidur have as strong a claim as your own dont you think she glared at him as if he had raised a hand to her he smiled and stood the meeting at an end i will leave you to your tea and fine things sorhatani i have found such luxuries are fleeting but do enjoy them for the moment as he left her sitting in thought he promised himself that he would be there to witness the khans wife returning to karakorum it was one pleasure he would not deny himself after so many months of strain the soldiers stood and shivered in the shadow of the huge gate like the stockade around them it was made of ancient black logs lashed together with ropes that became brittle in the winter cold there were men in the stockade whose daily task was to walk the outer line stepping carefully along a tiny walkway with frozen hands they checked each rope was still like iron in the cold it took them the best part of the day the stockade was more like a town than a camp and many thousands were crammed inside the yard in front of the gate was a good place to stand pavel thought a safe place he was there because he had been among the last to come in the night before yet the soldiers who stamped and shoved their hands into their armpits for warmth felt its strength looming over them they tried not to think of the moments to come when the gate would be heaved open by snorting oxen and they would go out among the wolves pavel stood back from the men close to the gate he felt his sword nervously wanting to draw it again and look at it his grandfather had told him the importance of keeping it sharp he had not told him what to do if he was given a blade older than he was himself with more nicks cuts and scratches than he could believe pavel had seen some of the real soldiers run a whetstone along their swords but he had not had the courage to ask to borrow one they did not look like the sort of men who would lend anything to a boy he had not seen the grand duke yet though pavel had craned his neck and stood as tall as he could that would be something to tell his grandfather when he went home again his dedushka remembered krakow and in his cups the old man claimed to have seen the king when he was young though it might have been just a story pavel longed for a glimpse of the freemen adventurers the qasaks the duke had bought for the campaign with a river of gold he tried not to get his hopes up that his father could be among them part of him saw the sadness in his grandfathers eyes whenever he spoke of the brave young man who had gone to join the horsemen pavel had seen his mother weep in the house when she thought he couldnt hear he suspected his father had simply abandoned them as so many did when the winters were too hard he had always been a wanderer they had left krakow looking for land of their own to buy but farm work had turned out to be one step from starvation and with little more joy if anything the russian farmers were worse off than those they had left behind there were always men who travelled to kiev or moscow looking for work they promised they would send money to their families but few ever did and fewer still came back pavel shook his head he was not a child hoping for a little truth in all the lies he had a sword and he would fight for the duke alongside those fierce coarse riders he smiled amused at himself he would still look for his fathers face among them tired and lined with hard work with the hair cropped close to the skull against lice he hoped he would be able to recognise him after so long the qasaks were somewhere outside the stockade riding their horses in the snow the cold was biting as the sun came up the ground rubbed to slush by men and horses pavel wrung his hands together and cursed aloud as he was jostled from behind he enjoyed cursing the men around him used terms he had never heard before and he growled a good blasphemy at his unseen assailant his irritation faded as he saw it was just a runner boy carrying dough balls stuffed with meat and herbs pavels hands were quick and he lifted two of the steaming lumps as the boy struggled to get past him the boy swore at the theft but pavel ignored him cramming one into his mouth before someone noticed and took it away the taste was glorious and the juices dribbled down his chin and under the mailed jerkin he had been given just that morning he had felt like a man then with a mans weight to carry he had thought he would be frightened but there were thousands of soldiers in the stockade and many more qasaks outside they did not seem afraid though many of the faces were stern and quiet pavel did not speak to those who wore beards or heavy moustaches he was still hoping to grow whiskers of his own but there was nothing there yet he thought guiltily of his fathers razor in the barn for a month or so hed gone out there every evening to run it up and down his cheeks the boys in the village said it made the hair grow faster but there was precious little sign of it on him at least so far horns sounded somewhere distant and men began shouting orders all around him there was no time to eat the second dough ball so pavel shoved it down his jerkin feeling the heat spread against his skin he wished his grandfather could have been there to see him the old man had been away from home gathering firewood from miles out so that the easy stocks would still be there as winter tightened its grip his mother had wept of course when pavel brought the dukes recruiter to the back door with the man watching she hadnt been able to refuse him just as hed planned it hed walked tall behind the recruiter and he still remembered the combination of excitement and nervousness in the faces of the others on the road some of them were older than pavel and one had a beard that reached almost to his chest hed been disappointed not to see any of the other village lads there no doubt they had run from the recruiters hed heard of boys hiding in hay barns and even lying down with cattle to avoid the dukes call their fathers were not qasaks pavel hadnt looked back at the village as hed left or only once at least to see his mother come to the boundary and hold up her hand to him he hoped his grandfather would be proud when he heard pavel wasnt sure how the old man would react but at least hed miss the beating if that was the result he grinned at the thought of the old devil standing in the yard with the chickens with no one to take his strap to something was happening that much was obvious pavel saw his sotski march past the one officer he knew the man looked tired and though he didnt notice pavel instinct made him fall in behind if they were going out his place was in the hundred as hed been told pavel didnt know any of the ones walking with him but that was where he was meant to be and his sotski at least seemed to be marching with purpose together they crossed the gate and the officer finally saw pavel standing behind him you are one of mine he said then pointed to a slightly larger group without waiting for an answer pavel and six more walked over smiling sheepishly at each other they looked as ungainly as he felt standing with their swords and iron jerkins that draped almost to their knees rubbing their frozen hands as they went red and pale blue in the cold the sotski had gone off to shepherd in a few more of those in his charge pavel jumped as horns sounded again this time from the walls of the stockade one of the men with him laughed unpleasantly at his reaction revealing brown and broken teeth pavels cheeks burned he had hoped for the sort of brotherhood his grandfather had described but he couldnt see it in the frozen yard with men pissing in the slush their thin faces pinched with cold snow began falling out of the white sky above and many of the men cursed it knowing it would make the day harder in all ways pavel watched as steaming brown oxen were driven past him and roped to the gates were they going out already he could not see the sotski anywhere the man seemed to have vanished just when pavel needed to ask him all sorts of things he could see daylight through the gates as they groaned inwards those in the yard were forced back by shouting officers the crowd swaying in like a drawn breath some of the men were facing the widening gap but a new commotion started somewhere far back and heads turned to see what it was pavel could hear voices raised in pain and anger he craned his neck to look behind him and the one who had laughed shook his head the whips are out boy he said gruffly theyll send us into battle like animals being driven its the way of the dukes fine officers pavel did not like the man who spoke especially as he seemed to be criticising the duke himself he looked away rather than answer then shuffled forward as those behind began to press into the open yard the gate yawned wider and the whiteness was almost blinding after so long in its shadow the air was painful in his lungs and throat the cold so intense that batu could hardly breathe the mounts of his tuman cantered in together judging the range to the russian horsemen they were already sweating from the manoeuvres as the sun came up all they could do then was keep moving to stop was to let the sweat freeze and begin to die slowly unaware of the spreading numbness shortly after first light tsubodai had sent his right wing forward batu at the head they did not fear the levies and conscripts the duke had gathered in his great stockades those could be torn apart by arrows the enemy cavalry were the danger and batu felt pride at being first against them they had feinted left at dawn forcing the russians to bolster their lines there as the duke pulled men from his other wing batu had waited for tsubodais signal then gone in fast he could see huge numbers of horses and as he rode he saw the lines accelerate towards his tuman rippling forward as the orders came the duke had gathered a massive force to defend kiev but none of them had expected to fight in winter it was a killing cold batu tested his bowstring easing and heaving back on the bow as he rode feeling the action loosen the great muscles in his shoulders the arrows were thick in the quivers on their backs and he could hear the feathers crackle against each other by his ear the duke had spotted the threat batu could see the man and his pretty flags off to one side horns blew his orders but tsubodai had sent mongke in on the left the two wings drawing ahead of the main force the orlok held the centre with jebe and kachiun his heaviest horsemen armed with lances whoever came out of the stockade would be met with a massed black line ready for them batu nodded to his bannerman and a great streak of orange silk began to swing back and forth visible all along the line the creak of thousands of bows bending sounded a groan that seemed to hum in the air four thousand shafts soared as the first ranks released reaching behind them for another arrow and fitting it at a canter as they had learned to do as children they lifted themselves slightly off the saddle letting their knees balance against the lunge of the horse beneath there was no great need for accuracy at full range the arrows flew high then sank into the qasak horsemen blurring the air and leaving it clean and dead in their wake horses collapsed among the enemy those who had bows responded but they could not match the range of the mongol weapons and their shafts fell short batu slowed the pace rather than throw away such an advantage his signal brought the cantering line down to a trot and then a walk but the arrows continued to fly out one every six heartbeats like hammer blows on an anvil the russian horsemen forced their mounts through the barrage racing blindly forward as they held shields high and crouched as low as they could on the saddles the two wings would clash around the stockaded town and batu eased himself into the front rank his men expected to see him there since his wild ride against the russian prince and his blood ran faster and hot when he was facing down the enemy his tuman around him there was no break no respite in the arrow waves from soaring arcs the mongol riders adjusted and sent them lower then began to pick targets the russian charge was not clad in steel like the dukes personal guard tsubodai would have to take those on in the centre the dukes qasaks continued to fall riding into a gale of shafts that seemed to leave no space for man or horse batu found his quiver empty and he grimaced tucking his bow on the saddle hook without thought he drew his sword and that action was copied all along the line the russian wing had been battered hundreds of them left behind the charge those who remained were still coming on but many were wounded swaying in the saddle breathing blood from shafts through their lungs they wheezed defiance still but the mongols cut them down as they passed striking out with armoured fists and forearms using the swords with neat precision batus tuman swept over the remnants of the wing and on past the stockade walls he had a glimpse of the great gates opening but then it was behind him and he was chasing an enemy halfhanging out of his saddle as he tried to get away the mongol warriors hooted as they rode calling out prime targets to each other batu could feel their pride and pleasure as they nodded to him this was the best of times when the enemy were in disarray and could be hunted like a herd of deer as the gates swung open pavel was shoved out into the bright light the snow making the dawn blinding he blinked in confusion and fear there were too many voices shouting he could not make sense of any of it he drew his sword and marched forward but the man in front of him stopped suddenly the one who had spoken earlier keep moving pavel said already he was being shoved from behind the man with the broken teeth hawked and spat as he stared out at the mongol army riding towards them the lances came down in a line jesus christ save us the man muttered and pavel did not know if it was a prayer or a curse he heard the men behind him begin a martial shout trying to spur each other on but it was thin on the wind and pavel felt his hands weaken his stomach clench the mongol line grew larger bringing with them a swelling vibration of the ground beneath their feet they could all feel it and many of them turned to each other the officers were shouting pointing to the mongols red in the face and spraying spittle in their urging the column still moved unable to stop as those behind pressed them out into the snow pavel tried to slow his steps but he was shoved by men as reluctant as he was for the duke one of the officers shouted a few took up the cry but their voices were feeble and they soon fell silent the mongol tuman came on a line of darkness that would sweep them all away chapter twentyone kachiun heard the laughter before the group was even in sight he winced as his bad leg throbbed an old wound had suppurated in the thigh and he had to drain it twice a day according to tsubodais moslem healer it didnt seem to help the wound had troubled him for months flaring up without warning it made him feel old to approach the young officers limping like a cripple he was old of course limping or not they would have made him feel his years he heard guyuks voice rise above the others telling some story of batus triumphs kachiun sighed to himself as he walked past a final ger the noise stopped for a moment as guyuk spotted him the others turned to see what had caught the young mans attention the tea has just boiled general guyuk called cheerfully youre welcome to share a cup with us or something stronger if you prefer the others laughed as if this was a great jest and kachiun repressed his grimace he had been young too once the four of them were sprawled around like young lions and kachiun grunted as he lowered himself to the mat of felt easing his leg out carefully batu noticed the swollen thigh of course that one missed nothing how is the leg general full of pus kachiun snapped batus face closed at his tone shuttering his emotions away kachiun cursed himself a little pain and sweating and there he was snapping at boys like a badtempered old dog he looked around the little group nodding to baidur who was hardpressed to contain the sheer excitement he felt at joining the campaign the young warrior was jittery and brighteyed to be in such company and be treated as an equal kachiun wondered if any of them knew the treacheries of their fathers or whether they cared if they did kachiun accepted the bowl of tea in his right hand and tried to relax as he sipped the conversation did not resume immediately in his presence he had known all their fathers and for that matter genghis himself the years weighed heavily on him at that thought he could see tolui in mongke and the memory saddened him the promise of chagatais strong features looked out from baidurs face in its lines and jutting jaw time would tell if he had the mans stubborn strength as well kachiun could see the lad had something to prove yet in this company he was not among the leaders of the group by any means that brought kachiuns thoughts to batu and as he glanced over he found the young man watching him with something like a smile as if he could read his thoughts the others deferred to him that much was obvious but kachiun wondered if their newfound friendship would survive the challenges of the years when they were rivals for the khanates they would not be so relaxed in each others presence he thought sipping guyuk smiled easily one who expected to inherit he had not had genghis as a father to harden him and make him understand the dangers of easy friendship perhaps ogedai had been too soft on him or perhaps he was just a normal warrior without the ruthless quality that set men like genghis apart and men like me kachiun thought to himself considering his own dreams and past glories seeing the future in the relaxing cousins was bittersweet for him they showed him respect but he did not think they understood the debt they owed the tea tasted sour in his mouth at the thought though his teeth were rotting at the back and everything tasted bad to him did you have a reason to visit us on this cold morning batu said suddenly i came to welcome baidur to the camp kachiun replied i was away when he brought in his fathers tuman his own tuman general guyuk said immediately we have all been raised by the hands of our fathers he did not notice how batu stiffened his father jochi had done nothing for him yet he sat with the others cousins and princes as strong and perhaps harder than they were kachiun did not miss the flicker of emotions that played across the younger mans face he nodded to himself silently wishing them all luck well i cannot waste a morning sitting here kachiun said i have to walk this leg im told to keep the bad blood moving he clambered painfully to his feet ignoring guyuks outstretched arm the useless thing was throbbing again in time with his heart he would go back to the healer and endure another knife in the flesh to release the brown filth that filled the thigh he frowned at the prospect then inclined his head to the group as one before limping away hes seen a few things in his time guyuk said wistfully looking after him hes just an old man batu replied we will see more he grinned at guyuk like the bottom of a few skins of airag for a start bring out your private store guyuk dont think i havent heard of your fathers packages to you guyuk blushed to be the centre of attention as the others clamoured for him to bring out the drink he rushed away to fetch the skins for his friends tsubodai told me to report to him at sunset baidur said his voice worried batu shrugged and we will though he didnt say we had to be sober dont worry cousin well put on a show for the old devil perhaps its time he realised we are the princes of the nation he is just an artisan we employ like a painteror a maker of bricks good as he is baidur thats all he is baidur looked uncomfortable he had joined the army after the battles around kiev and he knew he had yet to prove himself to his cousins batu had been the first to greet him but baidur was enough of a judge to see the spite in the older man he was wary of the group for all they were his cousins and princes of the same nation he chose to say nothing and batu relaxed back into a pile of grain sacks it was not long before guyuk returned bearing fat skins of airag over each shoulder yao shu had put a lot of effort into being ready for the meeting of sorhatani and the khans wife the summer palace on the orkhon river was barely a days ride away for a scout but the khans wife had never travelled at that sort of speed for all her apparent urgency moving her staff and baggage had taken the best part of a month yao shu had enjoyed the secret pleasure of watching sorhatanis strain grow daily as she bustled about the palace and city checking the tallies in the treasury and coming up with a thousand things for which she might be reproached in her care of the khan in that time with just a few letters and messengers he had won back the freedom of his office no longer was he troubled by sorhatanis constant enquiries and demands on his time and resources no longer was he summoned at all hours of the day and night to explain some matter of policy or some aspect of the titles and powers she had been granted in her husbands stead it was a perfect application of power he decided the minimum force to achieve the desired outcome for the previous two days the palace corridors had been scrubbed by an army of chin servants anything made of cloth had been sent to the courtyard and beaten free of dust before being carefully replaced fresh fruit had been packed in ice barrels and brought to the kitchens below ground while cut flowers were placed in such profusion that the entire building was heavy with their scent the khans wife was coming home and she must not be disappointed yao shu strolled along an airy corridor enjoying the weak sunshine on a cold clear day with blue skies the joy of his position was that no one would challenge the khans own chancellor if he chose to be there when torogene returned it was almost his duty to welcome her and there was little sorhatani could do about it he heard a horn blow from the outskirts of the city and he smiled to himself her baggage train was in sight at last he had time to go to his offices and put on his most formal robes his current deel was grubby and he brushed at the cloth as he jogged to his work rooms he barely noticed the servant prostrating himself at the doorpost as he passed he had clean robes in a chest they would be a little musty but the cedar wood should have kept the moths at bay he crossed the room with quick steps and was bent over the chest when he heard the door swing closed behind him as he spun round in surprise a click sounded then the scrape of a key in a lock yao shu forgot about the chest he crossed to the door and tried the handle knowing it would not open sorhatanis orders of course he could almost smile at the womans sheer effrontery to lock him in his own rooms it was all the more irritating that he was the one responsible for introducing locks to the doors of the palace at least those which guarded valuables the lessons of the long night had been learned when chagatai had sent men into the palace to spread terror and destruction only good doors had saved the khan then yao shu ran his hands over the wood his calloused skin making a sibilant sound he matched it with a hiss of air through his teeth really sorhatani he muttered to himself he resisted the pointless urge to rattle the handle or call for help the whole palace was busy that morning there could be servants rushing by outside but it was more than his dignity would take to have to be rescued from his own rooms he tapped the door with the palm of his hand testing its strength from childhood he had conditioned his body to hardness for years he had begun each day with a thousand blows on his forearms the bones had cracked in tiny fissures filling and growing dense so that he could unleash all his strength without fearing his wrists would snap yet the door felt depressingly solid he was no longer a young man and smiling ruefully to himself he put aside the young mans response of force his questing hands moved to the hinges instead they were simple iron pegs lowered onto rings of iron but the door had been put into place while it was open now that it was closed the frame prevented him from lifting it he looked around his offices but there were no weapons there the chest was too heavy to be flung at the door and the rest his inkstone his pens and scrolls were all too light to be of any use he muttered a curse under his breath the windows of the room were barred in iron high and small enough so that the winter wind did not freeze him as he worked he felt his anger growing again as all his attempts at reason failed it would have to be force he rubbed the two large knuckles on his right hand years of the striking post had given them a sheath of callus but the bones underneath were like marble cracked and healed until they were a mass of dense bone yao shu removed his sandals and stretched his legs for a moment they too had been hardened time would tell if he could break through a door with nothing else he chose the weakest spot where a panel had been fitted into the main frame he took a deep breath readying himself sorhatani stood at the main gate to karakorum she had fretted for some time over where to receive ogedais wife would it seem like a challenge to force her to come all the way through the city to the palace before they met she did not know torogene well enough to be certain her main memory of her was a motherly woman who had remained calm on the long night when ogedai had come under attack in his rooms sorhatani told herself she had done nothing wrong that she could not be reproached for her care of the khan yet she knew well enough that a wifes feeling about a younger woman was not always a rational thing no matter how it went the meeting was going to be delicate to say the least sorhatani had prepared herself as best she could the rest was up to the sky father and earth mother and torogene herself the retinue was an impressive sight with outriders and carts stretching back along the road for almost a mile sorhatani had ordered the city gates opened rather than insult torogene yet she feared that the khans wife would just sweep by her as if she did not exist she watched nervously as the first rows of riders passed under the gate and the largest cart trundled closer pulled by six oxen it moved slowly and creaked loudly enough to be heard some distance away the khans wife sat under a canopy with four poles of birch supporting a silk roof the sides were open and sorhatani twisted her hands together at the first sight of torogene returning to her husband and karakorum it was not reassuring and sorhatani felt the womans eyes seek her out at a distance then rest on her as if fascinated she thought she could see the gleam of them and knew that torogene would be seeing a slim and beautiful woman in a chin dress of green silk her hair tied with a silver clasp as large as a mans hand sorhatanis thoughts raced as the cart came to a halt just a few paces away from where she stood status was the issue and the one thing she had not been able to decide in the days previously torogene was the khans wife of course when they had met last she had been sorhatanis social superior yet in the time since sorhatani had been granted all the titles and authority of her husband there was no precedent in the short history of the nation certainly no other woman had ever had the right to command a tuman if she so chose it was a mark of the khans respect for her husbands sacrifice that he had made the ruling at all sorhatani took a deep slow breath as she saw torogene was moving to the edge of the cart extending her hand to be helped down the greyhaired woman was older but the khans wife would have bowed to tolui if he had been standing there the khans wife would have spoken first without knowing how torogene would react to her sorhatani didnt want to throw away her sole advantage she had the status to demand respect but she did not want to make an enemy of the older woman the moment when she would have to decide came too quickly but her attention was dragged away by the sound of running footsteps sorhatani and torogene both looked up at the same time as yao shu came through the gate his face was stiff with anger and his eyes glittered as they took in the scene sorhatani caught a glimpse of bloody knuckles before he clasped his hands behind his back and bowed formally to welcome the khans wife perhaps it was his example but sorhatani stepped aside from her newfound dignity as torogene turned to face her she too bowed deeply your return is welcome lady sorhatani said straightening the khan is on his way to health and he needs you now more than ever torogene relaxed subtly a hint of tension vanishing from the way she held herself as yao shu watched in anticipation the older woman smiled to his fury he saw sorhatani echo the expression im sure youll tell me everything i need to know torogene said her voice warm i was sorry to hear about your husband he was a brave man more so than i ever knew sorhatani found herself blushing relieved beyond words that the khans wife had not snubbed her or begun hostilities she bowed again on impulse overcome join me on the cart dear torogene said fitting her arm through sorhatanis we can talk on the way to the palace is that yao shu i see there my lady yao shu murmured i will want to see the accounts chancellor bring them to me in the khans rooms at sunset of course my lady he replied what trickery was this he had hoped for two cats spitting rage over ogedai and instead they seemed to have assessed each other and found something to like in just a glance and a greeting he would never understand women he thought they were lifes great mystery his hands ached and throbbed from hammering through the door panels and he was suddenly tired he wanted nothing more than to return to his offices and settle down with something hot to drink he watched in numb frustration as sorhatani and torogene were handed up onto the cart and took seats next to each other already chattering like birds the column moved off with cries from the drivers and warriors riding escort it was not long before he was standing alone on the dusty road the thought came to him that the accounts were in no state to be perused by anyone apart from himself he had a great deal of work to do before sunset before he could rest karakorum was far from quiet as the riders and carts made their way through the streets the khans own guards had been brought out from their barracks to man the roads and keep back crowds of wellwishers as well as those who just wanted to catch a glimpse of torogene the khans wife was seen as the mother of the nation and the guards were hardpressed torogene smiled indulgently as they wended their way through the streets to the golden dome and tower of the khans palace i had forgotten there were so many people here torogene said shaking her head in wonder men and women held children out to her in the vain hope that she would bless them with a touch others cried her name or called out blessings of their own on the khan and his family the guards linked arms at crossroads struggling to hold back a tide of humanity when she spoke again sorhatani could see a faint flush in torogenes cheeks i understand that ogedai is much taken with you torogene began sorhatani closed her eyes for a moment of irritation yao shu looking after him gave me something to do while i bore my own grief she said her eyes were clear of guilt and torogene regarded her with interest she had never been as beautiful even when young you seem to have offended my husbands chancellor at least that says something for you sorhatani smiled he feels the khans wishes should have been respected idid not respect them i think i irritated ogedai into taking a grip on his duties again he is not fully well my lady but i think you will see a change in him the khans wife patted her knee reassured by sorhatanis babbling by the spirits the woman had secured her husbands titles with just a few ruffled feathers if that was not enough she had nursed the khan back to health when the man was refusing to see his wife or his chancellor some part of her knew ogedai had chosen to die alone in his palace he had sent her away with a sort of cold resignation she could not pierce somehow she had thought that to defy him would be to see him break down completely he had not allowed her into his grief it still hurt sorhatani had done what torogene could not and she silently thanked the younger woman however she had achieved it even yao shu had been forced to admit ogedai was in better spirits it was somehow good to know sorhatani could be as nervous as a girl it made her less frightening sorhatani regarded the motherly lady at her side it had been a very long time since anyone had shown her that sort of affection and she found herself liking the woman more she could hardly express her relief that there was no bad blood between them torogene wasnt the foolish sort to come storming home if ogedai had the sense of a marmot hed have had her close from the moment he returned hed have healed himself in her arms instead hed chosen to wait for death in a frozen room hed seen it as refusing to flinch in the face of death she knew now he had tormented himself with past sins and errors until he could no longer move even to save himself i am glad you were there for him sorhatani torogene said the colour in her cheeks deepened suddenly and sorhatani prepared for the question she knew would come i am not a young girl a blushing virgin torogene said my husband has many wivesand slaves and servants to attend to every need i will not be hurt but i do want to know if you comforted him in all ways not in bed sorhatani said smiling he came close to grabbing me once when i was bathing him but i hit him with a footbrush torogene chuckled thats the way to deal with them dear when they get warm youre very beautiful you see i think i would have been jealous of you if you had they smiled at each other each one realising she had found a friend both women wondered if the other valued the discovery anywhere near as much chapter twentytwo tsubodai moved slowly west over the following spring and summer leaving the russian principates behind he reached the limits of his maps his scouts spread out ahead of the tumans ranging in unknown territory for months at a time as they sketched valleys and towns and lakes putting together a picture of the land that lay before him those who could read and write made notes on the strength of armies they encountered or the moving columns of refugees fleeing before them those who could not write bound sticks in bundles of ten with each ten representing a thousand it was a rough system but tsubodai was content to move in summer and fight each winter playing to the strengths of his people the lords and nobles of these new lands were made weak by such an approach to war as yet they had shown him nothing that could threaten his horse warriors tsubodai assumed he would eventually face armies the equal of those wielded by the chin emperor at some point the foreign princes would join forces against the sweep west he heard rumours of armies like clouds of locusts but he did not know if it was exaggeration if the foreign lords did not join together they would be taken one by one and he would not stop would not ever stop until he saw the sea he rode to the front of a column of the closest two tumans checking on the supplies mongke had promised to send after a lucky find just keeping so many in the field forced them to move constantly the horses needed vast plains of sweet grass and the sheer number of ragged foot soldiers was becoming a greater problem every day they served a purpose when used ruthlessly tsubodais tumans sent them in first forcing the enemy to use all their bolts and arrows before they met the main mongol forces in that way they were valuable enough but anything that lived or moved had to be shot to feed the men not just herds of cattle and sheep but foxes deer wolves hares and wild birds anything they could find they scoured the land leaving almost nothing alive behind them he thought the destruction of villages was something like a mercy better a quick death than being left to starve without grain or meat for the winter to come time and again tsubodais tumans had found abandoned villages places filled with ghosts from years back when plague or starvation had forced the people to leave it was no wonder they gathered in great cities in such places they could pretend they were safe and find comfort in numbers and high walls they did not yet know how weak those walls were for his tumans he had brought down yenking with the chin emperor inside it nothing he had seen in the west could match that stone city tsubodai firmed his jaw as he saw batu in the company of guyuk yet again mongke and baidur were a hundred miles away or he thought he might have found them there as well the four princes had become friends which could have been useful enough if batu had not been the one holding them together perhaps because he was the oldest or because guyuk followed his lead batu seemed to set the tone for the others he made a great show of respect whenever tsubodai spoke to him but always there was the mocking halfsmile it was never so obvious that the orlok could react but still it was there he felt it like a thorn in his back too far to reach and pluck out tsubodai reined in as he reached the head of the column behind him batus tuman rode alongside guyuks there was none of the usual rough competition between those warriors as if they took their manner from the generals at the head tsubodai grunted at the clean lines he could not fault them but it rankled to have guyuk and batu talking the day away as if they were riding to a marriage feast and not through hostile territory tsubodai was hot and irritable he had not eaten that day and he had ridden the best part of twenty miles since dawn checking on the columns as they clawed their way across the earth he stifled his temper as batu bowed in the saddle to him do you have new orders orlok batu called guyuk looked up as well and tsubodai brought his horse in closer matching their pace he did not bother to answer the pointless question has the beef herd reached you from mongke yet tsubodai said he knew it had but he needed to broach the subject guyuk nodded immediately just before dawn two hundred head and large weve slaughtered twenty bulls and the rest are in the herds behind send sixty more to kachiun he has none tsubodai said curt and stiff with them he did not like even the appearance of asking for a favour perhaps because kachiun sits on a cart instead of riding out and finding meat batu muttered guyuk almost choked as he tried to smother laughter tsubodai stared them both down coldly if it was not enough to have the khans own son act the fool batus insolence was something he would have to face and crush eventually he hoped batu would step over the line before it became a killing matter he was young and headstrong he would make a mistake tsubodai was sure a scout raced in to report and tsubodai turned automatically only to find the man heading across him towards batu he took a slow breath as the scout saw him and started bowing deeply in the saddle the village by the river is coming up general he said to batu you asked to be told when we were in range and the river itself batu asked he knew tsubodai had scouted it for fords and bridges days before the halfsmile was playing over his mouth again knowing tsubodai could hear every word two shallow fords in our path general the better one is to the north very well thats the one well take show my bondsmen where it is then lead us in yes my lord the scout replied he bowed to batu then tsubodai before kicking in his heels and trotting along the line of moving warriors was there anything else orlok batu asked innocently i have things in hand here camp as soon as you are over the river then both of you come and see me at sunset he saw them look at each other and then away before they could laugh tsubodai gritted his teeth and left them he had news of two cities beyond the mountains cities his scouts said were flooded with refugees running from the mongol tumans yet instead of preparing a campaign against buda and pest he was dealing with generals acting like children he wondered if he could take guyuk aside and shame the young man into something resembling duty or dignity he nodded to himself as he rode ever since his charmed strike to the heart of a russian army batu had eaten away at the orloks authority if it went on it would cost lives perhaps see them all destroyed it was not too early to grab the problem by the throat or even the man there was no place on the march for challenges to his authority even from the sons and grandsons of khans the generals rode to tsubodais ger as the sun set the tumans slept around them an ocean of pale gers as far as the eye could see huddled in their midst was a darker mass of fighting men the vast majority were russian either those who had survived the destruction of their towns and cities or a much smaller number who had come for spoils tracking the army across the valleys and offering their weapons and strength most of those were made officers of the rest as ones who knew one end of a sword from the other their equipment was whatever they could scavenge and the best food went to the tumans so that they were lean and always hungry pavel was one of them thin as a wild wolf and always bruised or tired from the training he did not understand half of what he was made to do but he did it he ran in the mornings loping along behind the tumans for ten miles at a time he had lost his rusty sword in the only battle of his life and come just a hairs breadth from losing his life with it the blow that had felled him had torn a flap of skin from his scalp leaving him stunned when he finally awoke it was to find the stockade burning and the tumans arrayed in a vast camp the dead lay where they had been cut down and some of the bodies had been stripped his face was stiff with his own blood frozen in layers from his hair to his chin he had not dared to touch it though it had closed his right eye in a solid mass pavel might have slunk away then if it had not been for the man with the rotting teeth who had walked past him carrying a skin of some bitter fluid it had made pavel vomit but the man only laughed in that unpleasant way of his and said his name was alexi and that they had stood together it was alexi who had walked him through the camp where mongol warriors lay sprawled and drunken half of them asleep he had taken pavel to a man so badly scarred it made pavel flinch polan blood alexi had said just a farm boy but he didnt run the scarred man had grunted then spoken in russian and told him they could use another sword pavel had held up empty hands he had no idea where his blade had gone by then and the world still swam around him he remembered the man saying his skull was probably cracked before he passed out his new life was hard food was scarce though he had been given a new sword without the flaws and rust of the last one he ran with the tumans and endured until the air in his lungs blew hot enough to burn and his heart pounded as if it would burst he tried not to think of the farm he had left with his mother and grandfather they would be tending the smallholding watching the crops grow ready for harvest he would not be there to help them that year pavel was still awake when he saw three men ride towards the large ger at the centre of the camp he knew the tall one with the cruel face was batu a grandson of genghis pavel learned all the names he could it was the only way he could draw threads from the new chaos of his life he did not know the one who grinned foolishly as batu made some comment pavel fingered his sword hilt in the darkness wishing he had the strength to stride over to them and cut them down he had not seen the duke killed though the other men shook their heads and looked away when he asked about it they did not seem to care as he did unseen pavel wandered closer to the ger he knew the name of their leader though it was hard to make his mouth say the sound tsubodai they had called him the man responsible for burning moscow pavel craned for a glimpse of him but as the three generals dismounted their horses blocked a view inside the ger he sighed to himself he could run further than he would have believed possible just a few months before it was tempting to escape when there was no moon though he had seen the fate of a few men who tried it they had been brought back in pieces and the haunches of meat had been thrown to the others as an insult he had not joined in but he thought his starving companions had eaten the bloody lumps hunger made light of squeamish stomachs he could smell tea and roasting lamb on the breeze and his mouth filled with saliva he had been hungry since leaving the farm but there would be nothing until the morning and only then after he had run and loaded carts until his arms and shoulders burned he rubbed a spot on his back at the thought feeling the new muscle there he wasnt large just hard from work silently in the darkness he told himself he might run at the next new moon if they caught him at least he would have tried but theyd have to ride fast and hard to do it batu ducked his head to enter the ger straightening up as he greeted those inside he had brought guyuk and baidur with him and he was pleased to see mongke already there batu nodded to him but mongke merely glanced over and then went back to filling his mouth with hot mutton batu reminded himself that mongke too had lost a father it was a way in perhaps to share that grief the fact that he felt only hatred for his own father was no obstacle if he handled the younger man carefully they were all princes of the nation with blood ties to genghis that tsubodai could never claim batu enjoyed the idea the sense of identity it gave him to know he was part of that group no that they were his group to lead he was the eldest of them though mongke had the build and dour manner of an experienced man heavy with muscle he would be the hardest to influence batu thought guyuk and baidur were just boys in comparison young and enthusiastic about everything it was easy to imagine ruling an empire with them before he sat down he acknowledged kachiun jebe and chulgetei bowing briefly more old men he noticed kachiuns thigh was hugely swollen far worse than before the general sat on a low pallet with the distended leg stretched out before him a quick glance at kachiuns face showed tired eyes and skin a deep yellow from sickness batu thought his greatuncle would not survive the winter to come but that was the way of things the old died to give way to the young he did not let it trouble him tsubodai was watching his eyes cold as he waited for batu to speak first batu made a point of smiling widely his thoughts making him mellow it is a fine night orlok he said my men say this is the best grassland they have seen since home the horses have put on a layer of fat you wouldnt believe sit batu you are welcome here tsubodai replied curtly guyuk baidur there is tea in the kettle there are no servants tonight so pour your own the two younger men set to the task with clinking and chuckles as they poured boiling tea from a huge iron urn on the stove at the centre of the ger under the smoke hole tsubodai watched as baidur handed batu a cup of the steaming salt liquid it was natural enough but such small things were always to do with power in just a short time it seemed batu had found himself another follower tsubodai might have admired batus gift for leadership if it had not interfered with his own control of the army his father jochi had had the same talent tsubodai had heard the name batu had given the army it would have been hard not to hear it over the years of campaign the golden horde had almost passed into common use as such things will half the men seemed to think batu was in overall command and he did nothing to dispel their belief tsubodai clenched his jaw at the thought ogedai had honoured jochis bastard with titles and authority making a point of it in the face of tsubodais objections in fact batu had not disgraced himself far from it his tuman was well organised his officers carefully chosen some men could inspire loyalty and others could only demand it it was strangely galling to see batu was one of the first kind such men were always dangerous the difficulty lay in handling them directing their energies if it was not already too late the magyars of hungary are horsemen tsubodai began his voice deliberately low so that they had to lean in to listen they have vast herds and they use the central plains much as we do they are not nomads however they have built two cities on the banks of the river danube pest and buda are the names neither is well defended though buda rests on hills pest stands on a plain he paused for questions defences batu said immediately walls weapons supply lines pest has no walls the scouts report a stone palace on one of the hills by buda perhaps the residence of their king his name is not important batu went on it does not sound like such a task to take these cities why even wait for winter his name is bela the fourth tsubodai replied his eyes dark with anger we will wait for winter because the river can be crossed when it freezes as with moscow it gives us a road between the cities right into their heart guyuk sensed the tension between the two men and put a hand on batus arm he shook it off irritably my tuman is ready to ride today orlok batu continued my scouts tell me the mountains to the west are passable before winter we could be in these cities before the first snow you are the one who said speed was important or is it caution that is important now keep your arrogance in your mouth lad jebe snapped suddenly batus gaze flickered over the older man jebe had ridden with genghis through the afghan hills he was dark and lean his face seamed with years and experience batu snorted in contempt there is no need to leave the major targets to winter general as im sure the orlok knows some of us would like to see an end to the conquests before we are old men for others of course it is already too late for that jebe surged to his feet but tsubodai raised a hand across him and he did not move from the spot batu chuckled i have carried out all of tsubodais orders he said he looked around as he spoke deliberately including the princes i have taken cities and towns because the great strategist said go here go there i have not questioned a single command he paused and the ger was very still no one else would speak if tsubodai did not and he remained silent batu shrugged as if it was nothing and went on yet i do not forget that the khan himself raised me not the orlok i am the khans man first as are we all more than that i am of the blood in the line of genghis as are guyuk baidur and mongke it is not enough to follow blindly and hope that it is right we are the ones who lead who question the orders given is that not right orlok tsubodai no tsubodai said it is not right you obey orders because if you do not you cannot expect the same from your men you are part of the wolf not the whole wolf i would have thought you had learned that when you were a boy but it is not the case a wolf cannot have more than one head general or it tears itself apart he took a deep breath thinking deeply batu had chosen the wrong moment to assert himself tsubodai could feel it the older men were shocked at his words while the princes were nowhere near ready to overthrow tsubodai bahadur not this season with hidden satisfaction he spoke again you have displeased me batu leave us i will have fresh orders for you in the morning batu turned to guyuk looking for support he felt his stomach drop away as the khans son would not meet his eyes batu winced then and nodded very well orlok he said stiffly no one spoke as he left in the silence tsubodai refilled his cup and sipped at the hot tea the mountains ahead are more than just a ridge or a few peaks he said my scouts tell me we will have to cross sixty or seventy miles of crags my scouts have made it through but without local men we cannot know the major passes i could force a few minghaans through to map the valleys without carts or supplies beyond a few weeks for the rest the siege machines the carts the families and injured it will be slow and difficult we need to know where the passes are to survive we may have to build ramps or bridges even so we have to make good speed or we will lose many when winter comes in we cannot be in the highlands then there is no grazing up there tsubodai looked around at the assembled generals there was one man he needed to make strong to separate from the rest but it was not batu guyuk you will go first leave tomorrow with two minghaans take tools to cut a path timber anything you might need make a way through that will be suitable for the heavy carts stay in contact with scouts and guide us in the play of authority over batu had not been wasted on guyuk he did not hesitate your will orlok he said bowing his head he was pleased at the responsibility knowing that the survival of the rest depended on finding a good path at the same time it would be grim work and every dead end or false opening would be his to find and mark my scouts say open land lies beyond those mountains tsubodai said they could not see an end to it we will force the peoples there to meet us in the field for the khan we will take their cities their women and their lands this is the great raid the furthest strike in the history of the nation of genghis we will not be stopped jebe grunted in pleasure and hefted a skin of airag throwing it to tsubodai who scored his throat with the liquid the ger stank of wet wool and mutton a sweet smell that he had known all his life guyuk and baidur exchanged glances at seeing the orlok so animated so confident mongke watched them all his face unreadable pavel ran as fast as he had ever run in his life the dim lights of mongol fires faded on the horizon behind him he fell more than once and the third time winded him badly enough to make him limp he had struck his head hard on something in the darkness but the pain was nothing to what the mongols would do if they caught him he was alone in the night with neither the sound of pursuing horses nor any companion many of the other men had lost their homes in the years of war some of them could barely remember another life but pavel had not lost his memory somewhere to the north he hoped his grandfather and mother still tended their little farm he would be safe once he reached them and he told himself that he would never leave again as he ran he imagined the other young men looking on him with envy in their eyes for the things he had seen the village girls would see him as a hardened soldier something different from the country boys around them he would never tell them about the bodies heaped like straw bales or the hot release as his bladder unclenched in fear he would not mention those things his sword was heavy and he knew it slowed him down but he could not bring himself to throw it away he would walk into the yard and his mother would surely weep to see him return from the wars he would make it home the sword tripped him and as he stumbled he let it fall and hesitated before going on he felt much lighter without it chapter twentythree batu cursed as he found himself sweating again he knew that sweat could freeze under clothes in such cold making a man listless and sleepy until he just lay down and died in the snow he snorted at the thought wondering if his constant simmering anger would help to keep him alive it was all very well knowing that sweat should be avoided but there was no help for it when you were manhandling a heavy cart with eight others heaving and rocking it until the stubborn thing finally shifted another few feet ropes stretched from the cart to a group of men pulling like horses sullen trudging russians who never looked back and had to be struck or whipped to break through to them it was maddening work needing to be done over and over again as the carts lurched and spilled their contents the first time batu had seen one break free and race back to the bottom of the hill hed almost laughed then hed seen a man holding his bloody face where a rope had lashed across it and another nursing a broken wrist every day brought injuries and in the cold even a small wound sapped the strength and made it harder to get up the next morning they were all stiff and sore but tsubodai and his precious generals drove them on higher into the carpathian mountains every day the sky had come lower and grown blinding white threatening snow all morning when it began to fall again many of the men groaned the carts were hard enough to manoeuvre on good ground with fresh slush the men slipped and fell at every step gasping for air and knowing that no one was coming to relieve them everyone was involved and batu wondered how they had come to amass such a weight of carts and equipment he was used to riding out with his tuman and leaving most of it behind at times he thought they could have built a city in the wilderness with all the tools and equipment they had with them tsubodai had even brought timber into the mountains a weight of wood that took hundreds of men to move it meant they had fires at night when there was nothing else to burn but the wind sucked away the small heat or chilled one side of you while the other roasted batu seethed at the way he had been treated more so because guyuk had not spoken up for him all he had done was question tsubodais absolute authority over them not refuse an order he prided himself on that but he was being punished almost as if he had batu bent his back again to get his shoulder under a beam with the other men ready to heave the cart over a rut where the wheels had sunk in one two three they grunted with effort as he called the rhythm tsubodai had not been able to stop his men dismounting to help him with the work perhaps at first it was only the loyalty of a warrior to his general but after days of the backbreaking labour he thought they felt as disgusted with tsubodai bahadur as he was one two three he growled again the cart lifted and thumped down batus feet went out from under him and he grabbed the cartbed to steady himself his hands were wrapped in wool and sheepskin but they stung bitterly raw as fresh meat he used spare moments to swing his arms forcing blood to the tips so he would not lose them to frost too many of the men had those white patches on their noses or on their cheeks it explained the faded scars on the older men who had been through it all before tsubodai had the right to set him any task but batu thought his authority was more fragile than the orlok realised his right to command came from the khan but even on the march not all of their actions were purely military there would be moments when political decisions had to be made and those were the responsibility of princes not warriors with guyuks support the orlok could be overruled even dismissed batu was certain it would have to be the right moment when the orloks authority was not so clearcut batu took hold of the cart again as the cursed thing lurched and almost tipped over he was willing to wait but he found his temper growing shorter each day tsubodai was not of the blood the princes would make the future not some brokendown old general who should have retired to tend his goats long before batu used his anger in a surge of strength so that he felt as if he lifted the cart almost by himself shoving it onwards and upwards ogedai mounted slowly feeling his hips protest when had he become so stiff the muscles in his legs and lower back had grown astonishingly weak he could make them shudder like a horse shrugging off flies just by raising himself in the stirrups sorhatani was deliberately not watching him he noticed instead she was fussing around her sons kublai was checking his ponys belly strap while arikboke and hulegu were very quiet in the presence of their khan ogedai knew the younger ones only by sight but sorhatani had brought kublai to talk to him in the evenings she had made it seem a favour to her but ogedai had grown to look forward to the conversations the boy was sharp and he seemed to have an endless interest in the stories of past battles particularly if genghis had been part of them ogedai had found himself reliving past glories through kublais eyes and spent part of each day planning what he would tell the young man that evening the khan tested his legs again surreptitiously then looked down as torogene chuckled behind him he turned his horse to see her standing there he knew he was thin and pale from too much time indoors his joints hurt and he ached for wine so that his mouth grew dry at the thought of it he had promised torogene he would drink fewer cups each day more than that she had made him swear a solemn oath he had not told her about the set of enormous cups the kilns were firing for him his word was iron but wine was one of his few remaining joys dont stay out if you feel yourself getting tired torogene said your officers can wait for another day if they have to you must build your strength back slowly he smiled at her tone wondering if all wives became mothers to their husbands at some point he could not help glancing at sorhatani at that thought still as lean and strong as a herdboy there was one who should not go to waste in a cold bed he could not remember when he had last felt honest lust outside of dreams his body felt worn out withered and old yet the sun shone weakly and the autumn sky was blue he would ride along the canal to see the new works perhaps he would even bathe in the river that fed it if he could bring himself to enter the icy waters do not set my city on fire while i am gone he said gruffly she smiled at his tone i cannot promise but ill try torogene replied she reached out and touched his foot in the stirrup holding it hard enough for him to feel the pressure he did not need to speak the love he felt for her he just reached down and touched her cheek before digging in his heels and clattering through the gate sorhatanis sons came with him kublai held the reins of three packhorses laden high with supplies ogedai watched as the young man clucked to them so full of life that it was almost painful to see he had not told kublai his memories of toluis death he was not yet ready to tell that story with all the pain that continued to that cold day it took half the morning to reach the river his stamina had melted away over so many months of inactivity his arms and legs were leaden by the time he dismounted and he had to struggle not to cry out as his thighs cramped he could already hear the rippling cracks across the valley and in the distance smoke hung like morning mist the air had the tinge of sulphurous bitterness he remembered from the sung border to his surprise he found it almost pleasant to breathe in the exotic scent sorhatani and her sons made camp around him setting up a small ger on dry ground by the bank and starting tea on the stove while it brewed ogedai mounted once again he clicked his tongue to catch kublais attention and the young man leapt into his saddle to join him his face bright with excitement together both men rode across a sunlit field to where khasar readied the ordnance crews for inspection ogedai could see the old generals pride in the new weapons from a distance he too had been on the sung border and seen their destructive potential ogedai rode up slowly he felt no sense of urgency or hurry his glimpse at the greater night had given him a long perspective it was just harder to care about the smaller things having kublai with him was a reminder that not everyone shared his long view the sight of the polished bronze guns had kublai practically sweating ogedai suffered through the formalities with his uncle he declined the invitation of tea and food and finally gestured for the gunners to begin you might want to dismount and hold your horse my lord khan khasar said he looked thin and weary but his eyes were bright in his enthusiasm ogedai wasnt touched by uncles mood his legs felt weak and he did not want to stumble in front of such men he took a moment to remind himself that he was in the eye of the nation once again one slip and his weakness would reach every ear my horse was at the sung border he replied he will not bolt kublai you should do as he says very well my lord khasar said formally he clasped his hands behind his back as he gestured sharply to the gunnery teams they stood in groups of four carrying sacks of black powder as well as a range of oddlooking equipment kublai drank it all in fascinated show me ogedai said to them khasar snapped orders and ogedai watched from the saddle as the first team checked their weapon had blocks against the massive studded wheels a warrior placed a reed in a hole in the tube then lit a taper from a lamp when the taper touched the reed there was a spark then an explosion that sent the cannon rocking back the blocks barely held it and the weapon leapt and crashed back down ogedai did not see the ball that came flying out but he nodded deliberately calm his horse flicked up its ears but then bent to crop at the grass kublai had to slap his gelding on the face shocking it out of panic the young man snarled at the animal he would not be shamed by seeing his horse break free and run in front of the khan however he was more than thankful he was not in the saddle fire the rest together ogedai said khasar nodded proudly and eight other teams inserted their reeds into the touchholes and lit tapers on my mark gunners ready fire the crash was extraordinary the teams had practised outside the city for weeks and the guns fired almost together with only a slight delay this time ogedai saw blurs vanishing across the valley one or two skipping along the ground he smiled at the thought of a line of horses or men in the path of such weapons excellent he said khasar heard and chuckled still delighted at controlling thunder ogedais gaze drifted to the lines of heavy catapults beyond the guns they could launch barrels of gunpowder for hundreds of feet his engineers had learned from the chin but they had improved the powder so that it burned faster and more fiercely ogedai did not understand the process nor care what mattered was that the weapons worked more men waited by the catapults standing perfectly at attention ogedai suddenly realised that he did not feel tired the explosions and bitter smoke had invigorated him perhaps because of that he noticed how khasars shoulders had slumped the older man wore his exhaustion for all to see are you ill uncle he said khasar shrugged with a wince i have lumps in my shoulders the things make it hard to move my arm thats all his yellow complexion gave the lie to his words and ogedai frowned as his uncle went on the shamans say i should have them cut out but i wont let those butchers have me not yet half the men they cut dont walk out again maybe more you should ogedai said softly i dont want to lose you yet uncle khasar snorted im like the hills boy a few lumps wont stop me ogedai smiled i hope not show me more uncle he said when ogedai and kublai returned to the small camp by the river the morning was almost over and the tea was long past stewed and undrinkable the gunnery went on behind them using vast stocks of the powder to train the men who would play a vital role in future battles khasar could be seen striding up and down the lines in his element sorhatani saw that her sons flushed face was smudged with soot both the khan and kublai reeked of sulphurous fumes and arikboke and hulegu could only look on with transparent envy sorhatani left her sons to make fresh tea and walked over to where ogedai had dismounted he stood at the rivers edge and stared over it shading his eyes against the sun the noise of the waterfall hid sorhatanis steps as she came up behind him kublai is chattering like a bird she said i take it the demonstration went well ogedai shrugged better than i had hoped with the new powder mix khasar is convinced our guns have the range of the sung cannon he clenched his fist at the thought his expression fierce that will make a difference sorhatani we will surprise them one day i only wish i could get some of them out to tsubodai but it would take years to drag those heavy things so far you are getting stronger she said smiling its the wine he replied sorhatani laughed its not the wine you great drunkard its morning rides like this one and bow work each afternoon you already look a different man from the one i found in that cold room she paused tilting her head theres a little more meat on you as well having torogene back is good for you i think ogedai smiled but the excitement of the great guns was fading and his heart wasnt in it he sometimes thought of his fears as a dark cloth that draped itself over him choking off his breath he had died on that campaign and though the sun shone and his heart still beat in his chest it was hard to go on with each day he had thought toluis sacrifice might have given him fresh purpose but instead he felt the loss as another burden one too great to bear the cloth still clung to him for all sorhatani had done he could hardly explain it and part of him wished the woman would leave him alone to find a quiet path onwards under sorhatanis watchful gaze ogedai sat with the family drank the tea and ate the cold food they had brought no one brought him wine so he rummaged for a skin of it in the packs drinking straight from the teat like airag he ignored sorhatanis expression as the red liquid brought a glow back to his cheeks her eyes seemed made of flint so he spoke to distract her your son mongke is doing well he said i have reports from tsubodai that speak highly of him the other sons sat up in sudden interest and ogedai wiped his lips tasting the wine it seemed bitter that day sour on the tongue as if there was no goodness in it to his surprise it was kublai who spoke his tone respectful my lord khan have they taken kiev they have your brother was part of the battles around that city kublai seemed to be struggling with impatience are they at the carpathian mountains yet then do you know if they will breach them this winter you will tire the khan with your chatter sorhatani said but ogedai noticed she still looked for an answer the last i heard they are going to try and cross before next year he said thats a hard range kublai murmured to himself ogedai wondered how a young man could presume to know anything of mountains four thousand miles away the world had grown since he was a boy with the chains of scouts and way stations knowledge of the world was flooding into karakorum the khans library already contained volumes in greek and latin full of wonders he could hardly believe his uncle temuge had taken the task of building its reputation seriously paying fortunes for the rarest books and scrolls it would be the work of a generation to translate them into civilised languages but temuge had a dozen christian monks working on the task lost in a reverie ogedai dragged himself back and considered the words that had led him to drift away in thought he wondered if kublai was worried for his brothers safety with baidur tsubodai has seven tumans and forty thousand conscripts he said the mountains will not stop them and after the mountains my lord kublai swallowed trying not to irritate the most powerful man in the nation mongke says they will ride all the way to the sea the younger brothers hung on his response and ogedai sighed he supposed distant battles were exciting compared to a life of study and quiet in karakorum sorhatanis sons would not stay in the nest of stone for long he could see my orders are to secure the west to give us a border without enemies clamouring beyond it to invade our lands how tsubodai chooses to do that is up to him perhaps in a year or two you will travel out to him would you like that yes mongke is my brother kublai replied seriously and i would like to see more of the world than just maps in books ogedai chuckled he could remember when the world seemed limitless and he had wanted to see it all somehow he had lost that terrible hunger and for a moment he wondered if it was karakorum that had taken it from him perhaps that was the curse of cities that they rooted nations in one place and made them blind it was not a pleasant thought i would like to have a private word with your mother he said realising he would not have a better moment that day kublai moved fastest shepherding his brothers to their horses and taking them in the direction of khasars gun teams still practising in the afternoon sun sorhatani sat down on the mat of felt her expression curious if you are going to declare your love for me torogene told me what to say she said to her pleasure he laughed aloud im sure she has but no you are safe from me sorhatani he hesitated and she leaned closer surprised to see a touch of pink come to his cheeks you are still a young woman sorhatani he began she shut her mouth rather than reply though her eyes sparkled ogedai began twice more but stopped himself we have established my youth i think she said you have your husbands titles he went on sorhatanis light mood dropped away the one man who could remove the extraordinary authority she had been given was nervously trying to say what was on his mind she spoke again her voice harder earned by his sacrifice and death my lord yes earned not given as a favour ogedai blinked then shook his head they too are safe sorhatani he said my word is iron and you have those things from my hand i will not take them back then what is sticking in your throat so that it chokes you to say it ogedai took a deep breath you should marry again he said my lord khan torogene told me to remind you not to me woman ive told you before to my son to guyuk sorhatani looked at him in stunned silence guyuk was the heir to the khanate she knew ogedai too well to think the offer was made in haste her mind whirled as she tried to see through to what he truly wanted torogene must have known the offer would be made ogedai would never have thought of it on his own the khan turned away from her giving her time as he stared into the middle distance the cynical part of sorhatani wondered if this was a way to bring her husbands vast holdings back into the khanate at a stroke marriage to guyuk would reverse the rashness of ogedais offer to tolui the effects of that unique decision were still rippling out and she did not know where it would end the original lands of genghis khan were ruled by a woman and she had still barely come to terms with it she thought of her own sons guyuk was older than mongke but not by many years would her sons inherit or would their birthright be stolen from them in such a union of families she shuddered and hoped ogedai had not seen he was the khan and he could order her to marry just as he had given her the titles of her husband his power was near absolute over her if he chose to use it she looked at him without turning her head weighing up the man she had nursed through fits and darkness so strong that she had thought he would never return his life was as fragile as porcelain yet he still ruled and his word was iron she could sense his patience was unravelling a small muscle fluttered in his neck and she stared at it searching for words you do me great honour with such an offer ogedai your son and heir then you accept he said curtly his eyes knew the answer from her tone and he shook his head in irritation i cannot sorhatani replied softly my grief for tolui is the same i will not marry again my lord khan my life now is my sons and no more than that i want no more than that ogedai grimaced and the silence came back between them sorhatani feared his next words would be to command her ignoring her will if he spoke the words she would have no choice but to obey to resist would be to throw the bones with the futures of her sons to see them stripped of authority and power before they had even learned to use it she had wiped the khans skin when he had soiled himself unknowing she had fed him from her own hand when he moaned for peace and death yet he was the son of his father the fate of one wife one woman would mean little to him and she did not know what he would say keeping silent she waited with her head bowed the breeze blowing between them it took an age but at the last he nodded to himself very well sorhatani i owe you your freedom if that is your wish i will not demand your obedience in this i have not told guyuk only torogene knows it was even a thought relief flooded through sorhatani on instinct she prostrated herself on the grass placing her head by his foot oh get up he said a less humble woman i have never met chapter twentyfour kachiun died in the mountains above the snowline where there was neither time nor strength to tend to his body the generals flesh had swollen with the poison from his infected leg his last days had been spent in delirious agony his hands and face mottled with sickness he had died hard the winter had struck early just days afterwards with blizzards howling through the mountains heavy snow blocked the narrow passes guyuk had scouted through to the plains below the only blessing of the plummeting temperatures was that it kept the dead from rotting tsubodai had ordered kachiuns body wrapped in cloth and bound to a cart the brother of genghis had expressed a wish to be burnt in death rather than skyburied laid out for birds and animals in high crags the chin ritual of cremation was becoming more popular those of the nation who had become christian were even buried though they preferred to go into the ground with the hearts of enemies in their hands servants for the next life neither tsubodai nor ogedai laid down the law on any of the practices the people of the nation made their own choices at a time that could hurt no one else there was no single peak to the carpathians but dozens of valleys and ridges to be traversed at first they were the only presence apart from distant birds but then they came upon the first of the frozen bodies high up where the air was painful in the lungs it lay alone the hands and face windseared to black almost as if charred by fire snow halfcovered the man and one of the minghaan officers set his warriors to dig at similar humps of snow there were more bodies the faces dark or pale turkic or russian often bearded men lay with women their children frozen between them they were preserved on the heights their bodies thin their flesh made stone for ever in all there were hundreds and the generals could only wonder who they had been or why they had chosen to risk death in the mountains the bodies did not look old but there was no way to tell they could have lain there for centuries or starved just months before the mongols came loping along the tracks after them the wind and snow of winter came like a new world from the first flakes the animal paths vanished and the drifts built and built having to be dug out at every step only the links between scouts at every pass and the sheer numbers and discipline of the tumans saved them tsubodai could relieve those at the front who had to push through with hands and shovels those behind walked a wide trail of brown slush churned up by tens of thousands of trudging feet and hooves the snows could not stop them they had already come too far as the cold deepened the weakest and the wounded struggled to keep up the tumans passed more and more seated figures their heads bowed in death there had been children born in the years away from karakorum their small bodies froze quickly the wind ruffling their hair as they were left behind in the snow only the fallen horses were butchered for meat to sustain the living the tumans pushed on never stopping until they saw the plains before them and they had left the mountains and eternity behind it took them two months longer than tsubodai had hoped on the other side of the carpathian mountains the tumans gathered to mourn a general and a founder of the nation the army of conscripts sat uncomprehending and sullen as they watched the mongol shamans sing and tell the story of his life for a man of kachiuns history the tales and songs lasted two full days those who witnessed it ate where they stood and heated frozen airag from the icy slush it had become until they could drink to the brother of genghis khan at sunset of the second day tsubodai himself lit the funeral pyre they had soaked in oil then stood back as the black smoke poured out tsubodai watched the dark column rise and he could not help thinking of the signal it would send to their enemies for anyone with eyes to see the smoke meant the mongols had crossed the mountains and reached the plains the orlok shook his head remembering the white red and black tents genghis had raised before cities the first was simply a warning to surrender quickly the red cloth went up if they refused and was a promise to kill every male of fighting age the black tent meant that nothing would survive when the city fell at last it promised only destruction and bare earth perhaps the rising thread of sparks and oily smoke was an omen for those who saw it perhaps they would see it and know tsubodai had come he could smile at his own vanity commanding men still thin and weak from the crushing labour they had endured yet his scouts were already running they would find a place to rest and recover for those who had lost the use of fingers to have them cut away the flames gusted and crackled as the wind huffed across the pyre sending the smoke back into the faces of the men standing around it they had used a part of the seasoned timber tsubodai had brought across the mountains layering it to twice the height of a man over kachiuns body the smoke carried the sweetish smell of frying meat and some of the younger ones gagged as they took a breath tsubodai could hear pings and creaks from the generals armour as it expanded in the heat at times sounding like a voice in the fire he shook his head to clear it of foolishness then sensed batu watching him the prince of the nation stood with guyuk baidur and mongke a group of four all under his command yet separate from the rest tsubodai returned the stare until batu looked away his constant halfsmile flickering on his mouth with a chill tsubodai realised kachiuns death was a personal loss to him the old general had supported him in council and on the field trusting tsubodai to find a way through no matter what the odds that blind faith had died with him and tsubodai knew his flank was exposed he wondered if he should promote mongke to some senior post of the princes he seemed least under batus spell but if tsubodai had misjudged him there was a chance it would just make batus growing power even greater as the wind gusted stronger still tsubodai cursed under his breath he hated the labyrinth of politics that had sprung up since the death of genghis he was used to tactics to the ruses and stratagems of battle the city of karakorum had added layers to those so that he could no longer predict the knife thrust the betrayal he could no longer know the simple hearts of the men around him and trust them with his life he rubbed his eyes roughly and found a smear of moisture on his gloves that made him sigh kachiun had been a friend his death had brought home the fact that tsubodai too was getting old this is my last campaign he murmured to the figure in the pyre he could see kachiun in his blackened armour alone in a furnace of yellowgold when i am done i will bring your ashes home old friend he was a great man batu said tsubodai gave a start he had not heard him approach over the crackling flames fury welled up in him that batu would bring his petty bitterness even to the funeral of kachiun he began to reply but batu held up an open palm no mockery orlok i did not know half his story until i heard it from the shaman tsubodai stifled his retort and held batus steady gaze for a few more moments before looking back to the pyre batu spoke again his voice gentle with awe he hid with genghis and other children from their enemies they were hardened by starvation and fear from that family from those brothers we all spring i understand that orlok you too were there for some of it you have seen a nation born i can hardly imagine such a thing batu sighed and gripped the bridge of his nose between his fingers rubbing the tiredness out i hope there is a tale to tell when it is my turn in the flames tsubodai looked at him but batu was already walking away through the snow the air was clean and cold promising more snow on the way part three ad chapter twentyfive the dancers came to a halt sweat gleaming on their bodies the bells on their wrists and ankles falling silent incense was strong in the air pouring in wreaths of white smoke out of censers as they swung at the foot of the marble stairs the influence of greece was everywhere in the palace from columns of fluted marble and busts of king bela and his ancestors to the scanty costumes of the dancing girls waiting with their heads bowed the walls themselves were decorated in gold leaf from egypt and blue lapis lazuli from the afghan hills the ceiling stretched above them in a great dome that dominated the river city of esztergom in the inlaid images it proclaimed the glory of the risen christ and of course the glory of the hungarian king the courtiers prostrated themselves pressed as close as bees in a hive so that their bodies covered the tiled floor only the martial lords remained standing around the walls looking at each other with poorly concealed irritation among them was josef landau master of the livonian brothers he glanced at his brotherknight a man who had recently become his commanding officer conrad von thuringen was a powerful figure in all senses with the build to handle the enormous longsword he wore and a black beard shot through with grey that did nothing to reduce his physical menace von thuringen was the grand master of the teutonic knights an order that had been formed in the city of acre near galilee he bowed only to priests the pomp and glitter of king belas court made little impression on a man who had dined with the holy roman emperor and even pope gregory himself josef was a little in awe of the grizzled commander if the teutonic knights had not agreed to amalgamate his brothers of livonia would have been disbanded after their losses in war the doubleheaded black eagle he now wore had its twin on conrads chest together their landholdings made them almost the equal of the king who made them wait on him like servants yet they served a higher power and the delay only served to tighten josefs nerves and temper king belas seneschal began to recite the titles of his master and josef saw von thuringens eyes flicker upwards in frustration the holy roman emperor ruled a hundred territories as farflung as italy and jerusalem king bela of hungary could not match those possessions it pleased josef that his commander had little patience for vanities such things were of the world and the teutonic order forced their gaze to heaven so that the venal sins of men were far beneath them josef touched the cross of black and gold that he wore on his chest proud that his brothers of livonia had been taken up by a noble order if they had not been he thought he might have put away his armour and sword and become a wandering monk with a begging bowl and rags to serve the christ at times when politics hung as thick in the air as incense such a life still appealed to him the seneschal finished his litany of titles and the crowd in the palace hall grew tense for the arrival of their master josef smiled to see conrad scratch the side of his mouth in boredom where a sore had scabbed over horns sounded a low note across the city to announce the arrival of the king josef wondered if the peasants in the markets were meant to prostrate themselves as well the idea made his own mouth twitch but he controlled himself as king bela entered at last striding to the top of the marble steps so that he was almost the height of a man above them all the king was blondbearded and wore his hair to his shoulders a gold crown sat firmly on his head and his pale blue eyes looked out from under it as his gaze travelled across them both josef landau and conrad von thuringen bowed the angle carefully chosen king bela did not acknowledge their presence beyond a brief nod then took his place on a throne decorated in the same gold and blue as the walls it glittered behind him as he was handed the ceremonial regalia of his monarchy including a great staff of gold as josef watched the king lifted it and let it fall three times striking the ground the seneschal stood back and some other servant dressed almost as richly came forward to address the crowd there will be no judgments today no court the king has spoken let those who have such business remove themselves from his presence you may petition the master of the court at noon josef could see anger and frustration on the faces of many of the men and women who rose from prostration and turned away they had more sense than to let the king see their response to his edict josef could imagine how they had bribed and waited to get into that room only to be told to leave before a word was spoken about their cases he saw one young woman in tears as she left and he frowned to himself the room emptied quickly until only a dozen or so men remained all senior lords or knights the cuman lord koten is summoned cried the seneschal some of the lords looked askance at each other but josef noted that conrad appeared relaxed when their eyes met the older man shrugged very slightly all the answer he could give with the kings gaze on them doors at the back opened and a small man walked in in many ways the opposite of the king above him kotens skin was almost as dark as the moors of jerusalem to josefs eyes he had the sunken face and wiry build of a man who had never known more food than he needed to stay alive a rarity in that court his eyes were fierce and he bowed only a fraction deeper than conrad and josef had before him king bela rose from his throne and spoke for the first time that morning my lords honoured knights freemen the tartars have crossed the mountains he repeated the words in russian and latin a demonstration of his scholarship conrad and josef both crossed themselves at the words with conrad going on to kiss a heavy gold ring he wore on his left hand josef knew it contained a tiny relic of the true cross from calvary he could only wish he had such a talisman of power to soothe his own nerves the reaction of koten was to lean his head to one side and spit on the floor at his feet the king and his courtiers froze at the action and high points of colour appeared in belas cheeks before he could act perhaps to order the man to lick up his own spittle koten spoke they are not tartars your majesty they are mongol warriors they move quickly and they slaughter every living thing in their path if you have friends my king call them now you will need them all the kings eyes were cold as he looked down on the room i gave your people sanctuary here koten two hundred thousand of your tribe your families you crossed the mountains to get away from thesemongol warriors did you not you were not so well dressed then koten you were ragged and close to death yet i took you in i gave you lands and food from my own hand in exchange for taking the body and blood your majesty koten replied i was baptised myself intoour faith that is the gift of the spirit gods favour to you the worlds price has yet to be paid koten the small man clenched his hands behind his back as he waited josef was fascinated he had heard of the mass exodus of refugees from russia leaving their dead in the frozen mountains rather than be hunted down the stories they had spread of this golden horde of mongols had done the work of an army all on its own half of hungary quaked at the threat and the rumours of black smoke in the mountains josef could see the whiteness of kotens knuckles against the darker skin as king bela went on if i am to count you friend i will need every warrior under your command i will supply what arms they need and i will give them good soup to keep them warm fuel for their fires fodder for their horses salt for their food your oath has been sworn koten as your liege lord my orders are to stand and face the enemy with me do not fear for your people this is my land i will stop them here he paused and for a time koten let the silence go on at last as if exhausted his shoulders dipped will your allies be sending armies the pope the holy roman emperor it was king belas turn to grow stiff and still pope gregory and emperor frederick were locked in their own struggle he had entreated them both for men and arms for more than a year ever since the refugees had arrived from russia king frederick had sent the teutonic knights men chosen for the founding year of their order and never exceeding that number they were legendary fighters but against a golden horde of savage warriors bela could imagine them being swept away like leaves in a storm still he showed only confidence to the men he needed to support him i have been promised an army from king boleslav of krakow one from duke henry of silesia another from king wenceslas of bohemia there will be fresh reinforcements in the spring in the meantime we have my own men of hungary lord koten sixty thousand soldiers all well trained and hungry to defend their land and we have the knights koten they will hold the line with your horsemen i can field a hundred thousand soldiers he smiled at the thought of such a colossal number we will take the worst they can offer us and then we will strike back in the thaw and end this threat to peace for ever koten sighed visibly very well i can bring my forty thousand to this dance my king we will stand he shrugged in winter there is nowhere to run anyway not where they cannot catch us conrad von thuringen coughed into his mailed hand the king looked across the meeting hall at him and nodded graciously the knight marshal of the teutonic order scratched his beard for a moment reaching through the heavy thatch to some flea or louse on the skin your majesty my lord koten the emperor frederick did not send us to you his is the authority over the earth not the souls of men we came because of the christian brothers from russia fresh converted to the true faith we will stand between those families and the storm it is no more than our duty around the room other noblemen stepped forward to pledge their soldiers and houses to the kings cause josef waited until they had finished before he too swore his eight hundred knights of livonia to service he saw that koten looked less than impressed and he smiled slightly at the man as one of those fresh converts conrad had mentioned koten had no inkling yet of the force of men armed in christ the knights were few in number but each one was a master of weapons as strong on the field as in his faith in god for all their fearsome reputation he was certain the mongol army would break on the knights like a wave on a rock every king should have such men to follow him bela said visibly pleased at their open support for once he would not have to broker deals and persuade or bribe his lords to save themselves the enemy have gathered in the foothills of the carpathians they are no more than three hundred miles away with the danube and sajo rivers between us we have a month perhaps two at most to make ready for them they will not be here before spring your majesty koten said in the pause i have seen them move it is true the entire camp would take so long to reach us but the tumans the raiding armies could cross that much land in eight days if they did not spend the summers resting majesty they could have been here long before they came into moscow on the frozen river they run like wolves in winter while other men sleep we should be ready at least as ready as it is possible to be king bela frowned standing above them he twisted an ornate gold ring on one hand with the fingers of the other a gesture of nerves that was not lost on koten or the lords present he had ascended the throne only six years before on the death of his father nothing in his experience had prepared him for the sort of war he now faced at last he nodded very well marshal von thuringen you will decamp today to buda and pest to oversee the preparations we will be ready for them when they come the king put out his hand and his seneschal drew a long sword and handed it to him in front of them all bela raised the blade and cut his forearm he remained impassive as blood flowed using his hand to daub it all along the blade until most of the silver was red my lords you see the blood royal of hungary make a dozen like this and take the swords out to the villages and towns hold them high the people will answer the call of their noblemen the call to arms of their king we will defend the kingdom let this be the sign tsubodai stood huddled in furs stretching out his hands to a crackling fire the smoke rose and his gaze followed it drifting up to ancient beams in the barn it had been long abandoned by the farmer and part of the roof had sagged and broken it smelled of horses and straw and it was dry enough at least at one end it was not much of a place to begin the conquest of a country but there was nowhere else in the frozen fields that stretched to the horizon he watched as an icicle on the open door dripped and frowned at the sight surely it was just the warmth from the fire reaching it yet this was a new land he knew nothing of the seasons or how long the winter would last his seven generals waited patiently for him chewing noisily on pouches of bread and meat and passing a fat skin to take gulps of airag that kept them warm kachiuns senior minghaan ilugei had taken over the tuman in time a new general would be appointed at the khans order but in the field tsubodai had raised ilugei it was no coincidence that the man was greyhaired and wiry almost forty years of age and one of those trained in the personal guard of genghis tsubodai had had enough of the young lions batu had gathered around him he would have preferred khasar if he had not been almost five thousand miles away in karakorum he needed dependable men if he was to take the army on to the sea attend me tsubodai said without preamble he paused only for a beat as the generals stopped eating and came closer to hear the further we go west the more danger comes from the flanks if we drive on it is as a spear thrust into the centre of an army every step is greater risk he did not look at batu as he spoke though the prince smiled tsubodai paused to take a draught of airag feeling the warmth spread in his stomach i am splitting the army in three baidur and ilugei will strike north my scouts tell me there is an army near a city named krakow your orders are to remove it from the field and burn the city the small kings there cannot be allowed to form up on our flank he looked ilugei in the eye you have more years of experience than baidur who is new to the role tsubodai sensed baidur stiffen as the younger man saw his authority threatened before his eyes he went on can you accept his command over you ilugei i can orlok ilugei replied bowing his head baidur let out a breath it was a small thing but tsubodai had taken one of batus supporters and deliberately favoured him guyuk and mongke the lands to the south must be laid waste you will take your tumans to the south of us sweep the land clear of anyone capable of fielding a force of men or horses when you have scorched the earth return and support me what about me orlok batu said softly he was frowning deeply at the news that guyuk would be sent to the south well away from him where would you have me stand at my side of course tsubodai replied with a smile you and i will strike west with jebe chulgetei and the ragged army we command on foot with three tumans we will raze hungary together while our brothers clear the flanks there was no ceremony as the men walked away from the old barn tsubodai noticed how batu made a point of clapping guyuk on the back but there was strain in both mens faces they had fought and ridden with tsubodais eyes on them and other tumans ready to ride in support they were not afraid of the responsibility each man there welcomed the chance to act on his own it was why they had sought power and it had come upon them in the foothills of the carpathians from the hand of tsubodai only batu jebe and chulgetei would remain the three men were a little wistful as they watched the others break into a jog to reach their warriors quickly it feels like a race does it not jebe said batu turned cold eyes on him not to me it seems i am to stay with my wet nurse and you jebe laughed and stretched the stiffness out of his back you think too much batu do you know that he said and walked away still smiling ogedai was in the gardens of karakorum watching the sun set from a stone bench he felt at peace there in a way he could never have explained to his father he chuckled softly even the thought of genghis was like bringing darker shadows into the groves of trees ogedai loved the gardens in summer but in winter they had a different beauty the trees stood bare their branches outstretched and waiting silently for green life it was a time of darkness and yearning of snug gers and heated airag of being wrapped tight against the wind life in the gers was one thing he missed in the palace of karakorum he had even considered having one built in a courtyard before he dismissed the idea as foolishness he could not go back to a simpler life not now he had left it behind it was the longing of a child for the days when his mother and father were still alive his grandmother hoelun had lived long enough to lose her mind and memories and he shuddered at the thought of her last days the first mother of the nation had become a babbling child at the end unable even to clean herself no one would wish such a fate on an enemy never mind someone they loved he stretched his back loosening the cramps from a day of sitting and talking there was so much talking in a city it was almost as if the streets were built on words he smiled at the thought of his fathers reaction to all the meetings he had attended that day the problems of clean water and sewage pipes would have driven genghis to apoplexy ogedai shaded his eyes as the sunlight struck across karakorum the city was washed in dark gold making every line of it stand out with extraordinary clarity his eyes were not as sharp as they had once been and he relished the light and what it revealed he had made karakorum no one else certainly not his father the palace tower cast a long shadow across the city in the wilderness it was young yet but in time it would be the true heart of the nation the seat of khans he wondered how they would remember him in the centuries to come he shivered slightly as the evening breeze picked up with a quick gesture he pulled his deel tighter over his chest but then let it fall open again what would his life have been without the weakness of the flesh he sighed slowly feeling the erratic thumping in his chest he had grown weary waiting he had thrown himself into battle to conquer the terror ridden into an enemy army as if fear was a snake to be crushed under his sandal in response it had sunk its fangs into his heel and dropped him into darkness there were times when he thought he had not yet climbed out of that pit he shook his head in memory trying not to think of tolui and what he had done for him a brave man could conquer fear he had learned that but perhaps only for a time it was something the young did not understand the way it could gnaw at a man the way it came back stronger every time until you were alone and gasping for breath he had smothered himself in despair giving up the struggle giving in sorhatani had pulled him back and given him hope again though she could never know how it was an agony to hope how could he live with death crouched on his shoulders gripping him from behind weighing him down he had faced it he had summoned his courage and raised his head but it had not looked away no man could be strong all day all night it had worn him down to nothing ogedai rested his hands on his knees turning them upwards so he could see the palms the callus had begun to return though he had experienced blisters for the first time in years one or two were still weeping from just an hour with the sword and bow that afternoon he could feel his strength coming back but too slowly in his youth he had been able to call on his body without thought but his heart had been weak even then he raised a hand to his neck and pushed his fingers under his silk tunic over his chest feeling the thready beat there it seemed such a fragile thing like a bird a sudden pain made him start it was as if he had been struck and as his vision blurred he turned to see whatever had hit him he felt his head for blood bringing his hands close to his eyes his hands were clean another spasm made him hunch over leaning against his knees as if he could press it away he gasped aloud panting his pulse thumped in his ears a hammer that throbbed through him stop he snapped furious his body was the enemy his heart the betrayer he would command it he clenched his fist and pressed it against his chest still bent over to his knees another pain hit him then even worse than the last he groaned and threw back his head staring at the darkening sky he had survived before he would wait it out he did not feel himself slump slipping sideways off the bench so that the stones of the path pressed against his cheek he could hear his heart beat in great slow thumps then nothing just an awful silence that went on and on he thought he could hear his fathers voice and he wanted to weep but there were no tears left in him just darkness and cold chapter twentysix sorhatani was tugged from sleep by the creak of the floor she woke with a start to see kublai standing by her bed his expression grim his eyes were red and she was suddenly afraid of what he would say though years had passed the memory of toluis death was still painfully fresh she sat up sharply pulling the blankets around her what is it she demanded it seems your sons are cursed to bear bad news mother kublai replied he looked away as she stood and removed her shapeless nightdress pulling on clothes from the day before tell me she said yanking at a tunics buttons the khan is dead ogedai is dead kublai replied staring out of the window at the night outside the city his guards found him i heard them and i went to see who else knows sorhatani said all sleep forgotten as the news sank in kublai shrugged they sent someone to tell torogene the palace is still quiet at least for the moment they found him in the gardens mother without a mark on him thank god for that at least his heart was weak kublai those of us who knew have feared this day for a long time have you seen the body she asked he winced at such a question and the memory it evoked i did then i left and came to tell you you were right now listen to me there are things we must do now kublai as the news begins to spread or before summer you will see your uncle chagatai come riding through the gates of karakorum to claim his birthright her son stared at her unable to comprehend her sudden coldness how can we stop him now he asked how can anyone stop him sorhatani was already moving towards the door he is not the heir kublai guyuk stands in line and in his way we must send a fast rider to tsubodais army guyuk is in danger from this moment until he is declared khan by an assembly of the nation just as his father was kublai gaped at her have you any idea how far away they are he said she halted with her hand on the door it does not matter if guyuk stands at the end of the world my son he must be told the yam kublai the way stations there are enough horses between us and tsubodai are there not mother you dont understand it is more than four thousand miles maybe even five thousand it would take months to bring word well write the news on parchment she snapped is that not how it works send a rider with a sealed message for guyuk alone can these messengers hand a private letter over such a distance yes kublai replied shocked by her intensity yes of course then run boy run to yao shus offices and write the news down get the news moving to the one who must have it she wrestled a ring from her hand and shoved it into his palm use your fathers ring to seal it in wax and get the first rider on his way make him understand there has never been a message as important as this one if there was ever a reason to create the scout line this is it kublai broke into a sprint down the corridors sorhatani bit her lip as she watched him go before turning the other way towards torogenes rooms already she could hear raised voices somewhere nearby the news would not be kept in the city as the sun rose it would fly from karakorum in all directions she felt sadness swell in her at the thought of ogedai but pressed it down clenching her fists there was no time to grieve the world would never be the same after the day to come kublai had cause to thank his mother as he sat at yao shus writing desk the door to the chancellors workrooms had been replaced by carpenters but the holes for the new locks still sat ready clean and sanded it had swung open at just a push and kublai had shivered in the cold as he took a chin tinderbox and scratched sparks with a flint and iron until a wisp of tinder blew into flame the lamp was small and he kept it well shuttered but there were already voices and movements in the palace he looked for water but there was nothing so he spat on the inkstone and blackened his fingers rubbing a paste yao shu kept his badgerhair brushes neatly and kublai worked fast with the thinnest of them marking the chin characters on the parchment with delicate precision he had barely finished a few stark lines and sanded them dry when the door creaked open and he looked up nervously to see yao shu standing there in a sleeping robe i do not have time to explain kublai said curtly as he stood he folded the vellum parchment goatskin beaten and stretched until it was as thin as yellow silk the lines that would change the nation were hidden and before yao shu could speak kublai dripped wax and jammed his fathers ring down leaving a deep impression he faced ogedais chancellor with a strained expression yao shu stared at the neat package and the glistening wax as kublai fanned it in the air to dry he could not understand the tension he saw in the younger man i saw the light half the palace is awake it seems yao shu said deliberately blocking the door as kublai moved towards it you know what is happening it is not my place to tell you chancellor kublai replied i am on the khans business he met yao shus eyes steadily refusing to be cowed im afraid i must insist on an explanation for thisintrusion before i let you go yao shu replied no you will not insist this is not your business chancellor it is a matter of family kublai did not let his hand drift to the sword he wore on his hip he knew the chancellor could not be intimidated with a blade they locked eyes and kublai kept silent waiting with a grimace yao shu stepped aside to let him pass his gaze falling onto the desk with its stillwet inkstone and writing materials scattered in confusion he opened his mouth to ask another question but kublai had already vanished his footsteps echoing it was not far to the yam way station the central hub of a network that extended as far as chin lands to the east and beyond kublai raced through the palace outbuildings across a courtyard and along a cloister around a garden where the wind caught him up and passed him with a cold breath he could see torches in the garden lighting a spot in the distance as men gathered by the khans body yao shu would hear the terrible news soon enough out of the palace he ran along a street made grey in the dawn he skidded on the cobbles as he rounded a corner and saw the lamps of the yam there was always someone awake there at every hour of the day he called as he passed under the stone arch into a large yard with horse stalls on either side kublai stood panting listening as a pony snorted and tapped the door of its stall with its hoof perhaps the animal sensed the excitement that gripped him he did not know it was just moments before a burly figure came into the yard kublai saw the yam master had only one hand his job a compensation for losing his ability to fight he tried not to look at the stump as the man approached i speak with the authority of sorhatani and torogene wife to ogedai khan this has to reach tsubodais army as fast as you have ever run before kill horses and men if you have to but get it into the hands of the heir guyuk no other but guyuk his hands alone do you understand the old warrior gaped at him what is so urgent he began it seemed the news had not yet spread to those who carried it kublai made a decision he needed the man to jump quickly and not waste a moment longer the khan is dead he said flatly his heir must be told now move or give up your post the man was already turning away and calling for whoever was on duty that night kublai stayed to watch the pony brought out to a taciturn young rider the scout stiffened as he heard the order to kill horses and men but he understood and nodded the papers went deep into a leather satchel that the scout strapped tightly to his back at a run yam servants brought a saddle that jingled with every movement the pony chosen for the task raised its head at the sound snorting once more and flicking its ears it knew the sound of saddle bells meant it would run fast and far kublai watched the rider kick in his heels and canter under the arch out into the waking city he rubbed his neck feeling the stiffness there he had done his part torogene was awake and weeping when sorhatani arrived at her rooms the guards at the door let her pass with no more than a glance at her expression you have heard torogene asked sorhatani opened her arms and the older woman came into her embrace larger than sorhatani her arms came fully round her so that they clung to one another im just going to the gardens torogene said she was shuddering with grief close to collapse his guards are standing overhim there waiting for me i must speak to you first sorhatani said torogene shook her head afterwards i cannot leave him out there alone sorhatani weighed her chances of stopping torogene and gave up let me walk with you she said the two women moved quickly along the corridors that led to the open gardens torogenes guards and servants falling behind as they walked sorhatani heard torogene choke into her hands and the sound tore at her own control she too had lost a husband and the wound was still fresh ripped open by the news of the khans passing she had the unpleasant sensation of events slipping beyond her control how long would it be before chagatai heard his brother had fallen at last how long after that would he come to karakorum to challenge for the khanate if he moved quickly he could bring an army before guyuk could come home sorhatani lost track of the corners and turns in the palace until she and torogene felt the breeze on their faces and the gardens lay before them through a cloister the torches of the guards still lit the spot though dawn had come torogene gave a cry and broke into a run sorhatani stayed with her knowing she could not interrupt as they reached the stone bench sorhatani stood rooted letting torogene cross the last few steps to her husband the guards stood in mute anger unable to see an enemy but consumed with the failure of their office ogedai had been turned to face the sky by whoever had found him his eyes had been closed and he lay in the perfect stillness of death his flesh as white as if he had no blood in him sorhatani rubbed tears from her eyes as torogene knelt at his side and brushed his hair back with her hand she did not speak or weep instead she sat on her heels and looked down at him for a long time the breeze passed through them all and the gardens rustled somewhere close a bird called but torogene did not look up or move from the spot yao shu arrived in the silence still in his sleeping robe and with a face almost as pale as his masters he seemed to age and shrink as he looked on the fallen khan he did not speak the silence was too deep for that in misery he stood as one of the sentinel shadows in the garden the sun rose slowly and more than one man looked at it almost in hatred as if its light and life were not welcome there as the morning light turned the city a bloody gold sorhatani stepped forward at last and took torogene gently by the arm come away now she murmured let them take him to be laid out torogene shook her head and sorhatani bent closer to her whispering into her ear put aside your pain for today you must think of your son guyuk you hear me torogene you must be strong you must shed your tears for ogedai another day if your son is to survive torogene blinked slowly and began to shake her head once then twice as she listened tears came from under her closed eyelids and she reached down and kissed ogedai on the lips shuddering under sorhatanis hand at the terrible coldness of him she would never feel his warmth his arms around her again she reached out to touch the hands rubbing her fingers over the fresh calluses there they would not heal now then she stood come with me sorhatani said softly as if to a frightened animal i will make you tea and find you something to eat you must keep up your strength torogene torogene nodded and sorhatani led her back through the cloister to her own rooms she looked back almost at every step until the garden hid her view of ogedai the servants ran ahead to have tea ready as they arrived the two women swept into sorhatanis rooms sorhatani saw the guards were taking positions on her door and realised they too were without direction the death of the khan had taken away the established order and they seemed almost lost i have orders for you she said on impulse the men straightened send a runner to your commander alkhun tell him to come to these rooms immediately your will mistress the guard said bowing his head he set off and sorhatani told her servants to leave the tea urn was already beginning to steam and she needed to be alone with ogedais wife as she closed the doors sorhatani saw how torogene sat staring stunned with grief she bustled about deliberately making noise with the cups the tea was not fully hot but it would have to do she hated herself for intruding on a private grief but there was no help for it her mind had been throwing sparks from the moment she had woken to find kublai standing beside her some part of her had known even before he spoke torogene i have sent a runner to guyuk are you listening i am truly sorry for what has happened ogedai she choked off as her own grief threatened to overwhelm her she too had loved the khan but she forced the sadness away once again pressing it into a closed part of her mind so that she could go on he was a good man torogene my son kublai has sent a letter to guyuk with the yam riders he says it will not reach him for months i do not suppose guyuk will return as quickly torogene looked up suddenly her eyes were terrible why would he not come home to me she said her voice raw because by then he will know that his uncle chagatai could be in the city with his tumans torogene chagatai will hear the news faster and he is far closer than tsubodais armies by the time guyuk returns chagatai could be khan no listen to me now at that point i would not give a copper coin for your sons life those are the stakes torogene put aside your grief now and listen to counsel the sound of boots on the stones outside made them both look up the senior minghaan of the khans guards entered the room in full armour he bowed briefly to the two women unable to hide his irritation at such a summons sorhatani glanced at him without warmth alkhun may not have realised how power had shifted in the palace since dawn but she had i do not wish to intrude on your grief alkhun said you will both understand that my place is with the guard tuman keeping order who knows how the city will react when the news spreads there could be riots if you will excuse me be silent sorhatani snapped alkhun froze in amazement but she did not give him time to think and realise his error would you walk in on the khan without so much as a knock on the door then why show less honour to us how dare you interrupt i wassummoned alkhun stammered his face flushing it was many years since anyone had raised a voice to him in anger sheer surprise made him hesitate sorhatani spoke slowly with complete confidence i have title to the ancestral lands minghaan there is but one in the nation senior to me she sits here sorhatani saw torogene was staring at her in bewilderment but went on until guyuk arrives in karakorum his mother is regent if it is not obvious to even the least of men i decree it from this moment i alkhun began then fell silent as he considered sorhatani was willing to wait and she poured more tea hoping that neither one noticed the way her shaking hands made the cups clink together you are correct of course alkhun said almost with relief i am sorry to have disturbed you mistress my lady he bowed again to torogene this time much deeper i will have your head if you displease me again alkhun sorhatani continued for the time being secure the city as you say i will let you know details of the funeral as i have them yes my lady alkhun replied the world had ceased spinning wildly at least in those rooms he did not know if the sense of chaos would return outside them bring your nine minghaan officers to the main audience chamber at sunset i will have further orders for you by then i do not doubt chagatai khan will be considering an assault on karakorum alkhun he must not set one foot in this city do you understand i do alkhun replied then leave us sorhatani said waving her hand to dismiss him he closed the door carefully behind him and sorhatani let out a huge breath torogene was watching her with wide eyes may all our battles go so smoothly sorhatani said grimly baidur rode north with a fierce pride in his heart leaving tsubodai and batu behind he suspected that ilugei would report back his every action but he was not daunted by thought of close scrutiny his father chagatai had trained him in every discipline and tactic and his father was a son of genghis khan baidur had not gone into the wilderness unprepared he just hoped he would have the chance to use some of the things he had packed onto spare horses tsubodai had given his approval to leave carts behind the vast herd of ponies that travelled with a tuman could carry almost anything except the spars of heavy catapults it was difficult to smother his visible joy as he rode with two tumans through lands he had never imagined they covered around sixty miles a day by the best reckoning speed was important tsubodai had made that clear enough but baidur could not leave armies in his wake that was why he had taken a path almost true north of the carpathian mountains once he was in position he would drive west in concert with tsubodai breaking anything that stood in his way his men had begun to scour the land clear as they reached a position with krakow to the west and the city of lublin ahead of them as baidur reined in he stared at the walls of lublin with a sour expression the land around him was barren in winter the fields black and bare he dismounted to feel the soil crumbling the black muck in his hands before moving on it was good land only rich earth and horses could excite a real greed in him gold and palaces meant nothing at all his father had taught him that much baidur had never heard of krakow until tsubodai had given him the name but he hungered to claim the polish principalities for the khan it was even possible that ogedai would reward a successful general with a khanate of his own stranger things had happened tsubodai had given him vellum skins with all he knew about the land ahead but he had not yet had a chance to read them it did not matter no matter who he faced they would be as wheat he mounted again and rode closer to the city it was not long till sunset and the gates were closed against him as he approached he saw the walls were shored up showing the patches and marks of generations of poor repairs in places there was little more than a barrier of piled wood and stone he smiled tsubodai expected speed and destruction he turned to ilugei who sat his mount and watched with an impassive expression we will wait for darkness one jagun of a hundred men will climb the walls on the other side drawing their guards to them another hundred will go in and open the gates from inside i want this place burning by sunrise it will be done ilugei said riding away to pass on the orders of the younger man chapter twentyseven baidur and ilugei moved at blistering speed across the landscape no sooner had lublin fallen than baidur was urging the tumans onwards to the cities of sandomir and krakow at such a pace the tumans came across columns of men marching to relieve cities already taken again and again baidur was able to surprise the nobles in the area his twenty thousand routing smaller forces then hunting them down piecemeal it was the sort of campaign baidurs grandfather had relished and his father chagatai recounted in detail the enemy were sluggish and slow to react against a knife thrust across their lands baidur knew there would be no mercy if he failed from his own people or those he faced given the chance the poles would wipe out his tumans to the last man it made sense not to meet them on their own terms or fight to their strengths he had no reinforcements to call on and he husbanded his tumans carefully knowing he had to keep them intact even if it meant refusing to engage he did not know the name of the man who led out the regiments of bright knights and foot soldiers against him near krakow baidurs scouts reported an army of around fifty thousand and baidur swore to himself when he heard he knew what tsubodai would want him to do but he had never seen the race across the north as suicide at least the polish noble hadnt retreated behind thick walls and dared them to take the city krakow was as open as moscow and as hard to defend its strength lay in the massive army that gathered before it waiting in camp for the mongol tumans to attack baidur rode dangerously close to the city with his senior minghaans observing the formations of soldiers and the lie of the land he had no idea whether the poles presented a threat to tsubodai but it was for exactly this task that he had been sent north such an army could not be allowed to join forces with those in hungary but it was not enough to pin them down around krakow baidurs task was to tear a strip right through the country to make sure that no armed force could consider moving south in support not with such a wolf loose among their own people apart from anything else tsubodai would have his ears if baidur ignored those orders baidur rode to a small hill and stared at the sea of men and horses revealed to him in the distance he could see his presence had been marked polish scouts were already galloping closer their weapons drawn in clear threat other men were mounting on the outskirts ready to defend or attack whatever his presence called for what would his father do what would his grandfather have done against so many that city must be rich to have so many men guarding it ilugei muttered at his shoulder baidur smiled making a quick decision his men had almost sixty thousand horses with them a herd so vast it could never remain in one place for more than a day the horses stripped the grass like locusts just as the tumans ate anything that moved yet each spare mount carried bows and shafts pots food and a hundred other items the men needed for the campaign even the wicker and felt for gers tsubodai had sent him well equipped at least i think you are right ilugei baidur said weighing his chances they want to protect their precious city so they cluster around it waiting for us he grinned if they are kind enough to stay in one place our arrows will speak for us he turned his pony and rode back ignoring the enemy scouts who had come close while he sat and observed as one of them darted in baidur drew an arrow smoothly fitting it to his bowstring and loosing in one movement it was a fine shot and the scout went tumbling a good omen he hoped baidur left their shouts and jeers behind him knowing the scouts would not dare to follow his mind was already busy with the stores on the spare horses he still had almost two million shafts each a piece of straight birch well fletched bundled in quivers of thirty or sixty even with such abundance he had been careful to retrieve and repair as many as he could from the battles they were perhaps his most precious resource after the horses themselves he looked at the sun and nodded it was still early he would not waste the day king boleslav grand duke of krakow drummed his gauntlet on the leather pommel of his saddle as he watched the vast cloud of dust that marked the movements of the approaching mongol horde he sat a massive grey charger a beast of the breed that could pull a plough through the black earth all day without tiring eleven thousand knights stood ready to destroy the invader once and for all to his left the french knights templar stood ready in their livery of red and white over steel boleslav could hear their voices raised in prayer he had archers by the thousand and most importantly of all he had pikemen who could stand against a charge with lances it was an army to inspire confidence and he kept his messengers close by ready to ride to his cousin in liegnitz with news of the victory perhaps when he had saved them all his family would finally recognise him as the rightful ruler of poland the mother church would still stand in his way he thought sourly they preferred the princes of poland to waste their strength in squabbles and assassinations leaving the church to grow fat and wealthy only the month before his cousin henry had sponsored a monastery for the new order of dominicans paying for it all in good silver boleslav winced at the thought of the benefices and indulgences henry had earned as a result it was the talk of the family in his silent thoughts boleslav offered up a prayer of his own lord if i see victory today i will found a convent in my city i will set a chalice of gold on the altar of the chapel and i will find a relic to bring pilgrims from a thousand miles i will have a mass offered for all those who lose their lives i give you my oath lord my troth allow me your victory and i will have your name sung across krakow he swallowed drily and reached for a small bottle of water on a thong hanging from his saddle he hated the waiting and he still feared that the reports of his scouts were true he knew they were prone to exaggerate but more than one had come back with tales of a horde twice the size of his fifty thousand a great ocean of uncountable horses and terrible invaders carrying bows and lances like the trees of a forest his bladder made itself felt and boleslav winced irritably let the damned dogs come he told himself god would speak and they would learn the strength of his right hand boleslav could see the dark mass of the enemy as they rode closer they poured across the ground too many to count though he did not think it was the vast army his scouts had described that thought brought the worry that there might be more out of sight he had only one report from russia but it warned they were fiends for trickery in love with the ambush and the flanking blow none of that was in evidence as his pikemen held their position the mongol warriors were riding straight at his lines as if they intended to gallop through them boleslav began to sweat fearing he had missed something in the battle plans he saw the knights templar ready themselves to countercharge safe for the moment behind the ranks of stolid pikemen boleslav watched intently as the pikes came down the butts firmly grounded in the earth they would stop anything gut anyone no matter how fast or fierce they were the mongols came in a wide line no more than fifty deep as boleslav stared they bent bows and released thousands of shafts rose in the air above his pikemen and boleslav knew a moment of horror they had shields but they had thrown them down to hold the pikes against a charge the sound of arrows striking men clattered across the field followed by screaming hundreds fell and the arrows kept coming boleslav counted twelve heartbeats between each colossal strike though his heart was racing and he could not calm himself his own archers replied with volleys and he tensed in anticipation only to see the shafts fall short of the mongol horsemen how could they have such a range his bowmen were good he was certain but if they could not reach the enemy they were useless to him orders snapped up and down the lines as officers tried to respond many of the pikemen dropped the massive weapons some reached for their shields while others tried to balance shield and pike together neither one serving its purpose boleslav cursed looking over their heads to the commander of the templars the man was like a dog straining on a leash they were ready to ride but by the pikemen were still blocking the templars path into the enemy there could be no smooth manoeuvre as the foot soldiers pulled aside and let the templars thunder through instead they lay in tangled heaps of men and pikes like thorns cowering under their shields as the arrows flew and thumped into them boleslav swore his voice cracking his messengers looked up but he had not spoken for them he had seen armies all his life he owed his power to the battles he had fought and won but what he was seeing made a mockery of everything he had learned the mongols seemed to have no directing structure there was no calm centre to order their movements that would have been something boleslav could have countered yet neither were they a rabble with each man acting on his own instead they moved and attacked as if a thousand guiding hands were over them as if each group was completely independent it was insane but they shifted and struck like wasps responding instantly together to any threat on one side a thousand mongol warriors clipped their bows to their saddles and lifted up lances turning a sweep along the line into a sudden crash into the shields of the pikemen before boleslavs officers could even react they were riding clear and unlimbering bows yet again the pikemen roared in fury and raised their weapons only to swallow the bitter shafts that came buzzing back at them boleslav gaped in horror as he saw the scene repeated up and down the lines he felt his heart leap as the knights templar struggled through shouting and kicking to clear the way of wounded men they would make order from chaos it was their mission boleslav could not know how many hundreds of his footmen had been killed there was no respite in the attack no chance to reform and assess the enemy tactics even as he realised they would not stop two more waves of arrows came at close range taking anyone who chose his pike over a shield the sound of yelling bawling wounded grew in intensity but the templars were on the move beginning the slow rhythmic trot that put the righteous fear of god into their enemies boleslav clenched his fist as they forced their horses through the last of the dazed pikemen the heavy mounts increasing their speed in perfect formation nothing in the world could resist them boleslav saw the mongols lose their nerve as the knights met them headon a few of the smaller ponies were bowled over hammered aside by greater weight the mongol riders leapt clear of their falling mounts but they were hacked down by broadswords or trampled under hooves boleslav exulted as they began to fall back the fluid movement of their units seemed to stall so that they jerked and lost their smoothness the mongols snapped arrows at the knights but the shafts skipped away from the heavy armour or even shattered boleslav felt the battle turn and shouted aloud urging them on the templars roared as they struck the mongol tuman they were men who had fought in muddy fields as far apart as jerusalem and cyprus they expected the enemy in front of them to give way and they dug in their heels and stretched into a gallop their strength was the unstoppable hammer blow a strike to tear an army in half to reach the centre and kill a king the mongols collapsed hundreds at a time turning and racing before the knights the heels of their horses almost within reach of the great swords and heavy lances the templar charge pounded on for half a mile or more driving all before them baidur raised his arm the minghaans had been watching for his signal the moment that was his to choose they snapped orders along the line twenty men raised yellow flags high and roared to the jaguns of a hundred warriors they passed the order down to tens by eye or by ear it spread like fire through straw taking just moments out of the chaos came instant order the jaguns peeled off to the flanks letting the knights come without resistance some still ran ahead to draw them on but the flanks were thickening as more and more men readied their bows the templars had come far from their foot soldiers and their vicious pikes perhaps ten thousand of them had ridden out a massive force well used to victory they had plunged deep into the mongol tumans carried by confidence and faith the french knights stared out through slits in steel at the chaos of the mongol retreat and they cut hard with their swords at anything within reach they saw the ranks splitting away to each side of them but they still drove forward focused on punching right through the enemy and reaching their leader whoever he was from both sides thousands of mongol archers ceased their frightened yelling and placed arrows on the strings of bows with calm deliberation they picked their targets looking down the shafts at the plunging necks of the huge warhorses from the front the animals were armoured in steel the sides of their necks were either bare or covered in flapping cloth baidur dropped his arm all the yellow flags fell in response almost as one the bows thumped releasing the vast tension of the full draw and sending shafts whirring into the mass of horses streaming past them the targets were not hard to hit at close range and in the first blows horses collapsed in shock and pain their throats pierced right through blood sprayed from their nostrils in great gusts as they screamed many of the archers winced but they took another arrow from the quiver and sent it in the knights roared a battle challenge those struck only once dug in their heels and tried to wheel out of the storm coming from both sides their horses began to shudder their legs trembling in agony hundreds of the mounts crashed down with no warning trapping or crushing the knights on their backs they found themselves on the ground dazed and struggling to rise for a time the templar charge drove on regardless of losses it was no easy task to turn the weight of horses and armour aside but as the destruction mounted baidur heard new orders roared across them the man who gave them became the instant target of every archer in reach his horse fell bristling arrows and the man himself was sent reeling his head snapped back in its iron shell by the impact of a shaft the visor was punched in so that he was blinded by it baidur could see the man wrestling to pull it free as he lay on the ground the templars turned wheeling right and left into the body of archers flanking them the charge split along a line with each man taking the opposite path to the one in front it was a paradeground manoeuvre one the mongols had never seen before baidur was impressed it brought the knights into handtohand combat with the men who stung them their one chance to survive the carnage the charge had become they had lost speed but their armour was strong and they were still fresh they used the great reach of the lance points to smash in the ribs of his warriors then the huge swords rose and fell like cleavers the mongol riders danced their mounts around them they were smaller and less powerful but so much faster than the armoured men that they could pick each shot with care from close enough to hear the knights panting beneath their iron plate they could send their ponies skipping aside bend the bow and send a shaft wherever they saw a gap or flesh the longswords swung over them or where they had been moments before baidur could hear the guttural laughter of his men and he knew it was partly in relief the sheer size of the knights and their horses was frightening it was like a cool breeze on the skin to see them flail when the knights struck cleanly each blow was terrible the wounds mortal baidur saw one knight with a ragged tabard of red and white bring his sword down with such force that it cut a warriors thigh through and gashed the saddle beneath even as the warrior died he grabbed the knight and pulled him down with him in a crash of metal the smooth volleys from the flanks had become a melee of yelling men and horses a thousand individual struggles baidur trotted his pony up and down trying to see how his men were doing he saw one knight stagger to his feet and pull off a battered helmet revealing long dark hair sweatplastered to his head baidur kicked forward and cut down as he rode past feeling the shock of impact right up his arm he held back reining in his horse tightly as he tried to keep a sense of the battle he could not join the attack he knew that if he fell the command would drop to ilugeis shoulders baidur stood in his stirrups and surveyed a scene he knew he would never forget all across a vast field knights in silver armour fought and struggled against the tumans their shields were battered and broken their swords lay where they fell thousands were killed on the ground held down by warriors while others heaved at a helmet then jabbed a sword into the gap thousands more still stood unhorsed bellowing to their companions there was little fear in them baidur saw but they were wrong it was a time to be afraid he was not surprised to see the tail of the charge begin to wheel turning in a chaotic mass so that they could run back to the foot soldiers around krakow he gave new orders and eight minghaans moved to follow them loosing arrows as the knights pushed their tired horses into a canter there would not be many left by the time they reached a safe haven behind the pikes boleslav watched in despair as the cream of the nobility were torn apart almost in front of him he would never have believed the knights could fail against horsemen if he had not seen it with his own eyes those arrows the force and accuracy was staggering he had never seen anything like it on the battlefield no one in poland ever had his hopes were raised when he saw the rear turn back to the city he had not been able to observe the extent of the destruction and his mouth slowly fell open as he realised how few they were how ragged and battered in comparison to the shining glory of those who had ridden out the mongols came with them even then loosing their infernal shafts with smooth pulls as if the knights were merely targets to be picked off boleslav sent out a regiment of four thousand pikemen to protect their retreat forcing the mongols to stop in their tracks the shattered remnant of the knights templar came trotting in almost every man dusty and bleeding wheezing as chest plates pressed too close on their ribs boleslav turned in horror as the mongol tumans came closer they would use lances at last he realised he had lost his cavalry shield and they would ride through to krakow he shouted for the pikes to be raised but there was no charge instead the arrows began again as if the knights had never ridden out as if the mongols had all day to finish the killing boleslav looked at the sun dipping down on the distant hills an arrow struck his charger without warning making it buck another hammered his shield pushing it back into his chest with the impact he felt a sick fear overwhelm him he could not save krakow the knights had been reduced to a shadow and only his peasant foot soldiers remained he would be hardpressed to save his own life he signalled and his heralds blew retreat across the battlefield the light was already failing but the mongols continued their shooting as the pikemen began to withdraw the exhausted templars formed a thin line in the rear taking arrows on their armour as best they could to prevent the withdrawal becoming a complete rout boleslav moved into a canter his messengers went with him their heads down defeat hung on them all as well as fear instead of sending letters of victory he would be running to his brother henry asking for his charity and his pity he rode numbly watching the shadows before him the mongols had annihilated the french templars to that point the greatest fighting force he had ever known who could stop them if not the martial orders those knights had slaughtered hordes of moslem heretics in and around jerusalem to see them torn apart in a single day shook his very foundations behind him the mongols howled like wolves hundreds at a time darting in and killing those who wanted nothing more than to retreat the arrows continued to fall even after the light was poor men were dragged off their saddles from behind tumbling into the arms of men who laughed as they killed them pushing and shoving each other to get in a kick or a blow as full darkness came baidur and ilugei called back their men at last the city of krakow stood naked before them and they walked their horses in as the moon rose the moonlight was strong the air clear and cold as the yam rider galloped at full speed along the dusty track he was weary it was hard to keep his eyes open and the ache in his lower back had become a jarring pain a sudden panic gripped him as he lost count of the way stations he had passed that day had it been two or three karakorum was far behind but he knew he would have to hand on the bag with its precious contents he did not know what he had been given except that it was worth his life the man from karakorum had appeared out of the darkness and thrust it into his hands snapping hoarse orders he had been galloping even before the man dismounted with a jolt the scout realised he had almost slipped out of the saddle the warmth of the horse the rhythm of hooves the bells that jingled under him all of them lulled his senses it would be his second night without sleep with nothing but the track and the horse for company he counted again in his head he had passed six of the yam way stations changing horses at each one he would have to hand over the bag at the next one or risk falling on the road in the distance he saw lights they would have heard his bells of course they would be waiting with a horse and spare rider as well as a skin of airag and sweet honey to keep him going they would need the other rider he could feel exhaustion washing over him he was done he slowed to a trot as he reached the stone yard in the middle of nowhere the visible sign of the khans influence and power as the yam staff clustered around him he swung his leg over and nodded to the spare rider little more than a boy there had been a verbal message as well as the bag what was it yes he remembered kill horses and men if you have to he said ride as fast and far as you can this is for the hands of guyuk alone repeat my words he listened as the fresh rider said them all again in a rush overcome with excitement the bag was passed from hand to hand a sacred trust never to be opened until it reach its destination he saw a stone seat in the yard some sort of mounting block perhaps he sank onto it gratefully watching the lad begin his run before he allowed himself to close his eyes he had never run so fast or far in his life and he wondered what could possibly be so important chapter twentyeight the funeral pyre of the khan was an immense structure half as high as the palace tower in the city behind it it had been constructed quickly using vast stocks of cedar wood from the cellars of the palace they had been found there when ogedais instructions were read the khan had prepared for death and every detail of the ceremony had been set out long in advance there had been other letters in the sealed package yao shu had presented to torogene the personal one to her had left her weeping it had been written before ogedai went on the chin campaign and it broke her heart to read the brash enthusiasm of her husbands words he had prepared for death but no man can truly understand what it means to have the world go on without him how it is for those who must live without his voice his smell his touch all that was left were the letters and her memories karakorum itself would be his tomb his ashes placed in a vault below the palace there to rest for eternity temuge stood on the green grass in robes of golden silk inlaid with blue his back hurt him all the time and he had to strain to look up at the top of the pyre he did not weep for his brothers son instead he clasped his hands behind his back and thought deeply about the future as the first flames spread charring the wood and releasing a cedar sweetness into the air that would carry for many miles with the smoke his mind drifted into the past as he stood there doing his duty and being seen by the thousands watching his people were not given to huge displays of grief but there were many red eyes in the crowd of workers that had come out from karakorum the city itself lay empty as if they had never given it life a son of genghis lay in those flames a son of the brother he had loved and feared hated and adored temuge could barely remember the first days of being hunted when they were all just children it was so very long ago though there were times when he still dreamed of the cold and the aching hunger an old mans thoughts often wandered back to his youth but there was little comfort in it his four brothers had been there then temujin who would choose the vainglorious name of genghis kachiun khasar and bekter temuge struggled to remember bekters face and could not bring it to mind his sister temulun had been there as well another one torn from life temuge thought of the yam letter yao shu had shown him just that morning his brother kachiun was dead and he looked inside for a sense of grief of loss such as torogene displayed in her weeping no there was nothing they had grown apart many years before lost in the difficulties and irritations of life that soured clean relationships of the seven who had hidden in a cleft in the ground only he and khasar remained as witnesses only they could say they had been there from the very beginning they were both old men and he felt the aches in his bones every day he looked past the growing brightness of the wooden tower and saw khasar standing with his head bowed they had crossed the chin nation together when they were young finding yao shu when he was just a wandering monk waiting for his future to come upon him it was hard to remember ever being that strong and vital khasar looked oddly thin temuge noticed his head seemed overlarge as the flesh had sunk away in his face and neck he did not look well at all on an impulse temuge walked over to him and they nodded to each other two old men in the sunshine i never thought hed go before me khasar murmured temuge looked sharply at him and khasar caught the glance he shrugged im an old man and the lumps on my shoulder are getting bigger i didnt expect to see the boy die before it was my time thats all you should get them cut out brother temuge said khasar winced he could no longer wear armour that pressed against the painful spots each night it seemed the growths had swelled like grapes under the skin he did not mention the ones he had found in his armpits just to touch them was painful enough to make him dizzy the thought of enduring a knife sawing at them was more than he could bear it was not cowardice he told himself firmly the things would go away in time or kill him one or the other i was sorry to hear about kachiun temuge said khasar closed his eyes stiff with pain he was too old to be on campaign i told him that he replied no pleasure in being right though god i miss him temuge looked quizzically at his brother youre not becoming one of the christians now are you khasar smiled a little sadly its too late for me i just listen to them talk sometimes they curse a lot ive noticed that heaven of theirs sounds a bit dull from what ive heard i asked one of the monks if there would be horses and he said we wouldnt want them can you believe that im not riding one of their angels i tell you that now temuge could see his brother was talking to cover the grief he felt over kachiun once more he looked for it in his own heart and found an emptiness it was troubling i was just thinking of the cleft in the hills where we all hid temuge said khasar smiled and shook his head those were hard times he replied we survived them though like everything else he looked at the city behind the furnace that hid the khans body this place would not exist if it hadnt been for our family he sighed to himself its a strange thing to remember when there was no nation perhaps that is enough for one mans lifetime we have seen some good years brother despite our differences temuge looked away rather than remember his dabbling in the darker arts for a few years of his youth he had been the chosen apprentice of one who had brought great pain to his family one whose name was no longer spoken in the nation khasar had been almost an enemy for those years but it was all far away halfforgotten you should write this down khasar said suddenly he jerked his head to the funeral pyre like you did for genghis you should make a record of it i will brother temuge said he looked again at khasar and truly saw the way he had withered you look ill khasar i would let them cut you yes but what do you know khasar said with a sneer i know they can dose you with the black paste so you dont feel the pain im not scared of pain khasar said irritably even so he looked interested and shifted his shoulders with a wince maybe i will i can hardly use my right arm on some days you will need it if chagatai comes to karakorum temuge said khasar nodded and rubbed his shoulder with his left hand thats one man id like to see with his neck broken he said i was there when tolui gave his life brother what did we get for it a few miserable years if i have to see chagatai ride through those gates in triumph i think id rather die in my sleep first he will be here before guyuk and tsubodai thats the only thing we know for certain temuge said sourly he too had no love for the lout his brother had fathered there would be no grand libraries under chagatais rule no streets of scholars and great learning he was as likely to burn the city as anything just to make a point in that regard chagatai was his fathers son temuge shuddered slightly and told himself it was just the wind he knew he should be making plans to remove the most valuable scrolls and books before chagatai arrived just until he was certain they would be honoured and kept safe the very thought of a chagatai khanate made him sweat the world did not need another genghis he thought it had barely recovered from the ravages of the last one koten of the cumans crossed the danube in a small boat a wherry with a surly soldier on the oars who made it fairly skim across the dark water he wrapped himself tightly in his cloak against the cold twilight lost in thought he could not resist his fate it seemed the king had every right to ask for his men hungary had given them sanctuary and for a time koten thought he had saved them all once the mountains were behind them he had dared to hope that the mongol tumans would not run so far west they never had before instead the golden horde had come roaring out of the carpathians and the place of peace and sanctuary was no refuge at all koten seethed to himself as he saw the shore approach a dark line of sucking mud that he knew would pull at his boots he stepped out into shallow water wincing as his feet sank into the stinking clay the oarsman grunted something unintelligible and examined his coin closely a deliberate insult kotens hand twitched for his knife wanting to cut a scar on the man that would remind him of his manners reluctantly he let his hand fall the man rowed away staring back at him with a curled lip at a safe distance the man shouted something but koten ignored him it was the same story across the cities of buda and pest his cuman people had come in good faith been baptised as their lord ordered and made every attempt to treat the new religion as their own if only for their survival they were people who understood that staying alive was worth sacrifice and they had trusted him none of the christian priests seemed to think it strange that an entire nation would suddenly feel the urge to welcome christ into their hearts yet it was not enough for the inhabitants of belas cities from the first days there had been tales of thefts and murders by his men rumours and gossip that they were behind every misfortune a pig couldnt take sick without someone claiming that one of the darkskinned women had cursed it koten spat on the pebbled shore as he trudged along it the previous month a local hungarian girl had accused two cuman boys of raping her the riot that followed had been put down with ruthless ferocity by king belas soldiers but the hatred was still there simmering under the surface there were few who believed she had been lying after all it was just the sort of thing they expected from the filthy nomads in their midst they were rootless and they could not be trusted except to steal and kill and foul the clean river koten disliked his hosts almost as much as they apparently hated him and the presence of his people they could not take up less room than they did he thought in irritation seeing the city of tents and shacks huddled along the river the king had promised them he would build a new city or perhaps expand two or three of those already there he had talked of a ghetto for the cuman people where they could live safely among their own perhaps bela would have kept his word if the mongols had not come though koten had begun to doubt it somehow the threat of the mongols had only increased the tension between the local magyars and his tribe his people could not walk down a street without someone spitting at them or jostling the women every night there were dead men left in the gutters their throats slit no one was ever punished if they were cuman bodies but the local judges and soldiers hanged his men in pairs and more if it was one of their own it was a poor reward for two hundred thousand new christians there were times when koten wondered at a faith that could preach kindness and yet be so cruel to its own as he made his way along the shitstrewn shore the smell made him gag the wealthy people of buda had fine drains for their waste even the poor quarters in pest had halfbarrels on the corners that the tanners would collect at night the cuman tentpeople had nothing but the river they had tried to keep it clean but there were just too many of them crowded along too short a stretch already there were diseases ripping through his people families dying with red marks on their skin he had never seen at home the whole place felt like an enemy camp but the king had asked for his army and koten was honourbound oathbound to him in that one thing king bela had judged his man correctly but as koten kicked at a stone he thought there were limits even to his honour would he see his people slaughtered for such a poor reward in all his life he had never broken his word not once at times when he was starving or sick it was all he had left to feed his pride he made his way into the town of pest human excrement and clay making his boots heavy he had promised his wife he would buy some meat before he came back to her though he knew the prices would be hiked as soon as they recognised him or heard him speak he tapped the hilt of his sword as he increased his stride and stood tall he felt like a dangerous man to insult on that day no doubt the next day would be different but for a while he would let in a little of his anger it kept him warm as koten clambered up a muddy rise that opened onto the line of merchants stores that formed a street he heard something crash to the ground nearby the wind was in his ears and he turned his head to listen there was a lamp in the front of the butchers shop he saw but the wooden shutters were already coming down over the serving hatch koten swore to himself and broke into a run wait he shouted he did not notice the men struggling together until they collapsed almost at his feet koten drew his sword in reaction but they were intent on punching and kicking each other one of them had a knife but the other had his hand in a tight grip koten knew neither of them his head came up like a hunting dog as more shouting sounded nearby the voices were angry and he felt an answering anger who knew what had happened in his absence another rape or simply the accusation of one against his brothers while he hesitated the butcher finally succeeded in heaving his shutters down shoving a bar through them from the inner side koten hammered on the shutters with his fists but there was no answer furious he turned the corner koten saw the line of men no the crowd of men stalking down the muddy street in the darkness towards him he jerked back round the corner in two quick steps but they had seen him outlined against the setting sun the howl went up instinctively as they saw a frightened figure run from them koten moved as quickly as he could he had lived long enough to know he was in real danger whatever had brought the men out as a mob could end with his head being crushed or his ribs broken in with their boots he heard their roar of excitement and he ran heading back towards the dark river their boots sounded on the wooden walkway thumping ever closer he slipped his mired boots skidding on the wet ground his sword vanished from his hand falling on mud so soft that it made no sound at all someone crashed into him as he rose and then they were on him taking out their rage on the shadowy stranger who had shown his guilt by running he struggled but they kicked and stabbed with short knives pressing him down into the filthy mud until he was almost part of it his blood mingling with the blackness the men stood clear of the lifeless body on the bank of the river some of them clapped others on the back chuckling at the justice they had meted out they had not known the name of the broken thing that lay there in the distance they heard the shouts of the kings officers and almost as one they turned away and began to disappear into the shadows of the merchants quarter the nomads would hear and be afraid it would be a long time before they walked without fear through the cities of their betters many of the men were fathers and they went home to their families taking the back alleys so that they would not come across the kings soldiers the army that assembled in front of the city of pest was vast king bela had spent days in a sort of frenzy as he came to appreciate what it took to field so many men a soldier could not carry food for more than a few days at most before it slowed him down and made it harder to fight the baggage train had taken every cart and workhorse in the country and it spread across almost as much land as the massed ranks before the danube king belas heart filled in his chest as he surveyed the host more than a hundred thousand menatarms knights and foot soldiers had responded to the bloody swords that he had sent racing the length and breadth of hungary his best estimates were of a mongol army half the size or less than the one he had been told to expect the king swallowed yellow bile as it surged into his throat he may have been facing just half the golden horde but the reports coming to him from the north were of destruction beyond belief there would be no armies coming to his aid from boleslav or henry from everything he had learned they were hardpressed to survive the onslaught of the tumans raiding there lublin had certainly fallen and there was a single report that krakow had followed it into flames though bela could not see how such a thing was possible he could only hope that the reports were exaggerated composed by frightened men it was certainly not information to share with his officers and allies at that thought he looked to the teutonic knights on his right two thousand of them in their finest battle array their horses showed no sign of the mud churned up by the army they shone in the weak sunlight and blew mist from their nostrils as they pawed the ground bela loved warhorses and he knew the knights had the very best bloodlines in the world for their mounts only the left wing caused him to pause in his proud assessment the cumans were good horsemen but they were still seething about the death of koten in some grubby river brawl as if such a thing could be laid at the kings feet they were an impossible people bela acknowledged to himself when the mongols had been sent back over the mountains he would have to give more thought to the practicalities of settling so many cumans perhaps they could be bribed to find a new homeland where they would be more welcome and less of a drain on the royal purse king bela cursed under his breath as he saw the cuman horsemen move out of place in the line he sent a runner across the field in front of the city with a terse order to hold position he scratched his chin as he watched the runners progress in the distance he saw the cuman riders coalesce around the single man but they did not stop bela let his hand fall in growing amazement he turned in the saddle gesturing to the closest of his knights ride to the cumans and remind them of their oath of obedience to me my orders are to stay in position until i give the word the knight dipped his lance in answer and cantered with dignity after the first messenger by that time the cumans had ruined the neat symmetry of the lines their horses spreading over the field in no obvious formation bela sighed to himself the nomads could barely understand discipline he tried to remember the name of kotens son who was meant to have command over them but it would not come to mind they did not halt for the knights arrival though by then they were close enough for bela to see him holding his arms out he might as well have tried to stop the tide for they simply flowed around him trotting with no urgency bela cursed aloud as he saw they were making for his own position no doubt they wanted to renegotiate some part of their oath or ask for better food and arms it was typical of the filthy breed to try and squeeze an advantage from him as if he were a grubby merchant trade was all they understood he thought savagely theyd sell their own daughters if there was gold in it king bela glared as the cuman horsemen rolled out moving slowly across his army his messengers were still coming in with the latest reports on the mongols and he deliberately busied himself with them showing his contempt by the time one of his knights cleared his throat and bela looked up it was to see kotens son staring at him the king struggled again for the younger mans name but it would not come there had just been too many details in the previous days for him to remember everything what is so important that you risk the entire formation bela snapped already red in the face from suppressed irritation kotens son bowed his head so briefly it was almost a jerk my fathers oath bound us king bela i am not bound by it he said what are you talking about bela demanded whatever your concern is this is not the place or the time return to your position come to me this evening when we have crossed the danube i will see you then king bela deliberately turned back to his messengers and took another sheaf of vellum to read he jerked his head up in amazement when the young man spoke again as if he had not just been given his orders this is not our war king bela that has been made clear to us i wish you good fortune but my task now is to shepherd my people out of the way of the golden horde belas colour deepened and the veins stood out on his pale skin you will return to the lines he roared kotens son shook his head goodbye your majesty he said christ bless all your many works bela took a deep breath suddenly aware that the cuman horsemen were all staring at him to a man they had their hands on swords or bows and their faces were very cold his thoughts whirled but they were forty thousand if he ordered the son killed they could very well attack his royal guards it would be a disaster and only the mongols would benefit his blue eyes grew still with the enemy in sight bela roared i call you oathbreakers i call you cowards and heretics bela shouted at kotens son as he trotted away christ why could he not remember the mans name his words might as well have been empty air the king could only froth and rage as the cumans peeled off in a mass of riders after their leader they took a path that led around the great army of hungary and back to the encampment of their people we did not need goatherders in the ranks your majesty josef landau said with distaste his brother knights growled their affirmation on all sides the cumans were still streaming across the main lines and king bela struggled to master his fraying temper he forced a smile you are correct sir josef he replied we are a hundred thousand strong even without thosegoatherders but when we have triumphed there will be a reckoning for such a betrayal i would be pleased to teach the lesson your majesty josef landau replied his expression unpleasant it was matched or exceeded by belas own very well spread the word that i sent the cumans from the field sir josef i do not want my men dwelling on their betrayal let them know that i chose to fight alongside only those of good hungarian blood that will raise their spirits as for the nomads you will show them the price of their betrayal they will understand it in those terms i am sure he took a deep breath to calm his anger now i am weary of standing here listening to the plaintive voices of cowards give the order to march chapter twentynine tsubodai watched the army of king bela begin to swarm across the river the bridges black with men and horses batu and jebe sat their mounts and stared out with him judging the quality of the men they would face their horses whickered softly to themselves munching at the grass on the plains spring had come early and it showed green through the last patches of snow the air was cold still but the sky was pale blue and the world was bursting with new life they are good enough horsemen jebe said batu shrugged but tsubodai chose to answer too many he said softly and that river has too many bridges which is why we are going to make them work for it batu looked up aware as always that the two men shared an understanding from which he was excluded it was infuriating and clearly deliberate he looked away knowing they could both read his anger all too easily all his life he had been forced to scramble for everything he had achieved then the khan had dragged him up promoting him to command a tuman in his fathers name batu had been honoured publicly and instead of his habitual hatred for the world he had been forced to a new struggle almost as painful as the first he had to prove he was able to lead that he had the skills and discipline men like tsubodai took for granted in his desire to prove himself no one could possibly have worked harder or done more he was young his energy was almost infinite compared to the old men batu felt torn as he looked at the orlok one small weak part of him would have given anything to have tsubodai clap him on the shoulder and approve just approve of him as a man and leader the rest of him hated that weakness with such a passion that it spilled out making him an angry companion for quieter souls no doubt his father had looked up to tsubodai once no doubt he had trusted him it was part of growingup to crush that sort of need in yourself batu knew very well he would never gain tsubodais trust he would never have his approval instead batu would rise in the nation so that when tsubodai was withered and toothless he would look back and see he had misjudged the young general under his care he would know then that he had missed the only one who could take the legacy of genghis and make it golden batu sighed to himself he was not a fool even the fantasy of an old tsubodai realising his great error was a boys dream if he had learned anything in manhood it was that it didnt matter what other people thought of him even the ones he respected in the end he would patch together a life with its sorry errors and its triumphs just as they had he tried not to listen to the inner need that wanted them to hang on his every word he was too young for that even if they and he had been different men let them get about half their number across the danube tsubodai was saying to jebe they havewhat eighty thousand more i think if theyd hold still i could be certain twice as many horsemen as we have tsubodai said sourly what about the ones who rode away batu asked tsubodai shook his head looking irritated he too had wondered why tens of thousands of riders would suddenly break from king belas army before the march it smelled of trickery and tsubodai was not one who enjoyed being fooled i dont know they could be a reserve or part of some other plan i dont like the idea of so many soldiers out of sight as we pull back ill send a couple of men out to look for them have them cross further downriver and scout around you think they are some sort of reserve batu asked pleased to be part of the conversation tsubodai shrugged dismissively if they dont cross the river i dont care what they are ahead of them king belas army trotted and marched across the wide stone bridges of the danube they came in clear units the movements revealing much about their structure and offensive capability which was why tsubodai watched with such interest the different groups linked immediately on the other side establishing a safe bridgehead in case of attack tsubodai shook his head slightly at seeing their formations king bela had almost three times as many trained soldiers as he did if you didnt count the ragged conscripts tsubodai had brought with him for three tumans to achieve victory over such a host would take luck and skill and years of experience the orlok smiled to himself he had a wealth of those things more importantly he had spent almost a month scouting the land around buda and pest for the best spot to bring them to battle it was certainly not on the banks of the danube a line of battle so vast and varied that he could not control it there was only one response to overwhelming numbers remove their ability to manoeuvre the largest army in the world became just a few men at a time if they could be squeezed through a narrow pass or across a bridge the three generals watched with grim concentration as the army of hungary formed up on their side of the river it took an age and tsubodai noted every detail pleased that they showed no more discipline than any of the other armies he had encountered the reports from baidur and ilugei were good there would be no second army coming from the north in the south guyuk and mongke had razed a strip of land as wide as hungary itself throwing back anyone who looked as if they could be a threat his flanks were secure as he had planned and hoped they would be he was ready to drive through the central plains against its king tsubodai rubbed his eyes for a moment in the future his people would ride the grasslands of hungary and never know he had once stood there with their future in the balance he hoped they would throw a drop of airag into the air for him when they drank it was all a man could ask for to be remembered occasionally with all the other spirits who had bled into the land king bela could be seen riding along the lines exhorting his men tsubodai heard hundreds of trumpets sound from the massed ranks followed by streaming banners raised above their heads on lancepoles it was an impressive sight even to men who had seen the armies of the chin emperor batu watched them in frustration presumably tsubodai would share his plans with him at some point perhaps when he was expected to risk his life to break that vast host of men and horses his pride prevented him from asking but tsubodai had revealed nothing during day after day of cautious manoeuvring and scout reports the tumans and conscripts waited patiently with chulgetei just two miles back from the river already the magyar scouts had spotted the generals leaning on their saddle horns and observing batu could see arms pointing at their position and men beginning to ride out towards them very well ive seen enough tsubodai said he turned to batu the tumans will fall back slow retreat keeptwo miles between us our footmen will have to run alongside the horses pass the word that they can hang on stirrups or ride the spare mounts if they begin to fall behind and think they can stay in the saddle the king has foot soldiers they will not be able to force a battle fall back batu said he kept his face calm are you going to tell me what you have planned orlok bahadur of course tsubodai said with a grin but not today today we retreat from a superior force it will be good for the men to learn a little humility sorhatani stood on the walls of karakorum looking along their length as the sun rose for as far as she could see teams of chin labourers and warriors were building them higher adding courses of limestone slabs and lime cement before slathering more lime over it all in layer after hardening layer there was no shortage of willing labour and they started early and finished only when it was too dark to see everyone with a stake in the city knew that they must expect chagatai khan to come he would not be allowed to enter and there was no doubt then what would follow his tumans would begin an assault on the walls of their own nations capital sorhatani sighed to herself in the morning breeze walls would not stop him ever since genghis had faced his first city the tumans had been perfecting catapults and now they had the gritty black powder capable of extraordinary destruction she did not know if chagatais artisans had followed the same paths but it was likely he knew every detail of the latest cannons and barrelthrowers to her left a platform for a field gun was being constructed a squat tower capable of taking the weight and force of such a powerful weapon as it recoiled when he came chagatai would not have it all his own way she had made sure of that the city would belch fire at him and perhaps a tongue of righteous flame would end the threat before he broke the walls and entered the city almost from habit sorhatani counted the days since the khans death twelve she had closed the yam station in the city as soon as her own message had gone out to guyuk but the system was flawed another chain of way stations stretched west from karakorum to chagatais khanate fifteen hundred miles or more a rider from the city had to reach only one link in the chain and the resources of the precious yam could be used to send chagatai word of the khans death she thought over the distances again in her head at the best speed he would not hear for another six days she had gone over the figures with yao shu as they began to fortify the city even if chagatai set out immediately if he ran to his horse and had his tumans standing by he could not bring his tumans back for another month after that more likely two he would have to follow the yam route around the edge of the taklamakan desert at the best guess chagatai khan would arrive in midsummer sorhatani shaded her eyes to look at the progress of the workers on the walls their faces and hands grey with wet lime by summer karakorum would bristle with cannon on walls wide enough to hold them sorhatani reached down and crumbled a piece of chalky stone in her hands rubbing it to dust and then slapping her palms together there was a great deal still to do before then she and torogene were holding the empire together with little more than spit and confidence until guyuk brought the tumans home and assumed his fathers titles until the nation gathered to swear an oath to him as khan karakorum was vulnerable they would have to hold the walls for two months even three sorhatani dreaded the thought of seeing a red or black tent raised before karakorum in a strange way it was ogedais triumph that the city had assumed such importance genghis might have called the nation to him somewhere out of sight of the white walls sorhatani froze for a moment as she considered it no chagatai did not have his fathers imagination and truly karakorum had become the symbol of the peoples ascendancy whoever would be khan had to control the city she nodded to herself ordering her thoughts chagatai would come he had to she stepped lightly down steps set into the inside of the wall noting the wide crest that would allow archers to gather and shoot down into an attacking force at intervals new wooden roofs sheltered spaces on the wall that would house quivers water for the men even firepots of iron and clay filled with black powder the city guards were stockpiling food as fast as they could riding out for hundreds of miles in all directions to commandeer the produce of farms the markets and livestock pens had been stripped of their animals the owners left with just temuges tokens to be redeemed at a later date the mood in the city was already one of fear and none of them had dared to protest sorhatani knew there were refugees on the roads east slow trails of families hoping to escape the destruction they saw coming in her darker moments she agreed with their conclusions yenking had held out against the great khan for a year but its walls had been massive the product of generations karakorum had never been designed to withstand an attack that had not been ogedais vision of a white city in the wilderness with the river running by she saw torogene standing with yao shu and alkhun all of them looking expectantly at her nothing went on in the city without passing through their hands her heart sank at the thought of another hundred problems and difficulties yet there was a part that revelled in her new authority this was how it felt this was what her husband had known to have others look to you and only to you she chuckled at the sudden image of genghis hearing that his fledgling nation was ruled by two women she remembered his words that in the future his people would wear fine clothes and eat spiced meat and forget what they owed to him she kept her expression serious as she reached yao shu and torogene she had not yet forgotten that fierce old devil with the yellow eyes but there were other concerns and karakorum was in peril she did not think her right to the ancestral lands would last long once chagatai became the khan of khans her sons would be killed as the new ruler made a clean sweep and put his own people in charge of the nations armies the future depended on stalling chagatai long enough for guyuk to come home there was no other hope no other plan sorhatani smiled at those who waited for her seeing her own worries etched in their faces the morning breeze lifted her hair so that she smoothed it back with one hand to work then she said cheerfully what do we have this morning kisruth cursed the sky father as he galloped using one hand to feel the graze on his neck he had never known the roadthieves to be so bold before he was still sweating with the shock of seeing a man step out into the road from behind a tree and grab at the satchel on his shoulders kisruth wrenched his neck back and forth assessing the stiffness there they had nearly had him well he would tell old gurban and let them see what happened then no one threatened the yam riders he could see the ger that marked twentyfive miles of the run and as he always did he tried to imagine one of the grand yam stations in karakorum he had heard tales from riders passing through though he sometimes thought they exaggerated knowing he hung on every word their own kitchen just for the riders lamps at all hours and stables of polished oak with row upon row of horses ready to race across the plains one day he would see it and be honoured among them he told himself it was a common dream as he rode back and forth between two stations so small and poor that they were barely more than a few gers and a corral the city riders seemed to bring the glamour of karakorum with them there was nothing like that at his home post gurban and a couple of crippled warriors managed it with their wives and they seemed happy enough with so little kisruth had dreamed of taking important messages and his heart still thumped at the words he had been given by an exhausted rider kill horses and men if you have to but reach guyuk the heir his hands alone kisruth did not know what he carried but it could only be something important he looked forward to handing it over formally to his brother and repeating the words to him he was irritated to see no one waiting as he came charging across the last stretch no doubt gurban was sleeping off the batch of airag his wife had brewed the week before it was just typical of the old sot that the most important message of their lives should find him sleeping kisruth gave the bells a last flick with his hands as he dismounted but the gers were peaceful apart from the line of smoke from one stiffly he strode across the open yard yelling for his brother or any of them surely they could not all have gone fishing for the day he had left them only three days before taking a sheaf of minor messages down the line he kicked at the door of the ger and stood in the yard rather than go inside his letter giving him confidence what is it his brother said peevishly from inside kisruth is that you am i the one who has been shouting your name yes kisruth snapped i have a letter from karakorum to go fast and where do i find you the door opened and his brother came out rubbing his eyes there were creases on his face from where he had been sleeping and kisruth struggled with his temper well im here arent i his brother said kisruth shook his head you know what ill take it on myself tell gurban there is a family of thieves on the road east they nearly had me off my horse his brothers eyes cleared at the news as well they might no one attacked the yam riders ill tell him dont worry do you want me to ride on with that bag he said ill go now if its important kisruth had already made up his mind and in truth he was reluctant to see his part in the excitement end it had not been hard to decide to go on you go back to your sleep ill take it to the next post he jerked back as his brother reached for his reins wheeling the pony in the yard before his brothers temper woke them all suddenly kisruth just wanted to be gone tell gurban about the thieves he called over his shoulder kicking his mount into a gallop it would be almost dark by the time he rode the next section but they had good men there and they would be ready when they heard his saddle bells his brother shouted incoherently behind him but kisruth was riding once again chapter thirty day after day the tumans of tsubodai stayed just out of reach of the hungarian riders batu had lost count of the hungarian kings attempts to bring them to battle the foot soldiers on both sides slowed them down but on the first day away from the danube river king bela had sent twenty thousand horsemen out on the charge tsubodai had watched dispassionately as they closed on his rear lines until with what batu considered to be infuriating calmness he ordered volleys of arrows while the ragged conscripts grabbed saddle horns and let themselves be taken over a fast three miles opening the gap once more when the magyar horsemen pressed too hard they were met with swarms of dark arrows shot with terrifying accuracy the mongol minghaans had a discipline their adversaries had never seen able to take position in the teeth of a charge shoot two volleys and then turn to rejoin the main tumans the first day had been the hardest with repeated lunges and attacks that had to be beaten back tsubodai had worked in a frenzy to keep the two armies separate as they marched until buda and pest were lost to view as the sun set that first night he had smiled to see the huge walled camp belas army built almost a town in itself the magyar host lined sandbags to the height of a man in a vast square on the grasslands they had carried the weight of them all the way from the danube in its way it explained why they could not run the mongols down it confirmed tsubodais impression of the king that only he and his most senior officers rested behind the security of the sandbag walls the rest of his army camped in the open as unregarded as any of his servants the hungarian king might have expected to eat and sleep well in his command tent but each night tsubodai sent men with horns and chin firecrackers to keep the hungarian army awake he wanted the king exhausted and nervous while tsubodai himself slept and snored making his personal guards smile as they watched over his ger the following few days were less frantic king bela seemed to have accepted he could not make them turn and fight his host the charges continued but it was almost as if they were for show and dash with knights pulling up with brandished swords and insults before triumphantly trotting back to their own lines the tumans rode on retreating mile after slow mile on broken ground some of the horses went lame and were quickly killed though there was never time to butcher them for meat the foot soldiers running by their saddles were hardened but even so a few of them picked up injuries tsubodai gave orders that anyone who fell behind was to be left with just a sword but his tumans had worked and fought with the ragged conscripts for a long time he turned a blind eye as they were heaved up behind warriors or tied to a saddle on one of the spare mounts by the afternoon of the fifth day they had covered the best part of two hundred miles and tsubodai had learned everything he needed to know about the enemy he faced the sajo river was in front of him and he spent most of the morning giving orders about crossing the sole bridge his tumans could not risk being trapped against the river and it was no surprise that the magyar riders began to press more closely over the morning they knew the local land as well as anyone tsubodai summoned batu jebe and chulgetei to him as the sun passed the highest point in the sky jebe i want your tumans to cross the sajo river without delay he said the general frowned if i were the hungarian king id hit us now with the river preventing us from manoeuvres he must know there is only one bridge tsubodai turned in the saddle staring out over the thread of the river just a few miles away already chulgeteis tuman was being compressed on the banks they could not stay there up against the deep river this king has driven us in triumph now for five days his officers will be congratulating themselves and him as far as he knows we will run right to the mountains and be pushed back over them again i think he will let us go but if he does not i will still have twenty thousand ready to show him his error go quickly your will orlok jebe said he dipped his head and rode clear to pass on the order to his tuman batu cleared his throat suddenly uncomfortable in tsubodais presence is it time to reveal your plans to lowly generals orlok he said he smiled as he spoke to take out the sting tsubodai glanced at him the river is the key we have run and run they will not expect an attack not now they will press us when they see we are beginning to cross but we will hold them with arrows by nightfall i want them on this side and our tumans on the other it is no more than this king would expect from such easily driven enemies tsubodai smiled to himself once we are across the sajo i will need the last minghaan to hold that bridge it is the only weak spot in my preparations batu if that thousand is quickly overwhelmed they will be on us and the chokepoint of the river bridge will have been wasted batu thought about the bridge which he had seen on the first crossing when the tumans came trotting towards buda and pest it was a main road of stone wide enough for a dozen horses to ride abreast he could hold it for days against knights but the magyar archers would simply use the banks to send shafts in tens of thousands even with shields whoever stood on that bridge would fall eventually he sighed to himself is that your task for me orlok another suicidal stand that i should not survive i just want to be sure i understand your orders to his surprise tsubodai chuckled no not you i need you tomorrow before dawn i will leave it up to you whom you send for the task they cannot retreat under attack batu be sure they understand that the hungarian king must believe we intend to run clear that we cannot face his host in the field holding that bridge will convince him batu tried to hide his relief as he nodded in the distance jebes tuman was already on the move riding as fast as they could through the narrow structure that spanned the river a seasoned officer jebe allowed no delays and batu could see a growing stain of men and horses on the other side he heard trumpets behind him and bit his lip as the hungarian magyars continued to close the distance this will be bloody tsubodai he said quietly the orlok looked at him judging his worth with cold eyes we will pay them back for our losses you have my word now go and choose your men make sure they have torches to light the bridge at sunset i dont want any mistakes batu we have a busy night ahead temuge paced the corridor outside the healers rooms he was pale at the muffled cries he heard but he could not go back in the first cut into khasars shoulder had released a white liquid that stank so terribly it had been all he could do to keep from vomiting khasar had remained silent then but he had shuddered as the knife sliced deeper into his back gouging him the black paste was still thick on his tongue and temuge thought his brother was hallucinating when he began to call for genghis temuge had left at that point with his sleeve pressed over his mouth and nose the sunlight had darkened in the corridor as he paced though the city was never quiet now not even in the palace rooms servants trotted past in groups bearing anything from food to building supplies temuge had to stand back when one group came with a huge beam of oak for what purpose he did not know his nephews woman sorhatani had begun preparations for siege almost on the day ogedai had fallen temuge sneered at the thought wishing for a moment that genghis could return to slap some sense back into her the city could not be held any fool could see that the best they could hope for was to send an emissary to chagatai to begin negotiations the only living son of genghis was not so powerful that words were useless temuge told himself he had volunteered to begin negotiations but sorhatani had only smiled and thanked him for his suggestion before he was dismissed temuge seethed afresh at the thought at the very moment when the nation needed his expertise he had to deal with a woman who understood nothing he resumed his pacing wincing as khasar cried out worse than before the city needed a strong regent not ogedais widow who was still so stunned with grief that she looked to sorhatani for guidance temuge thought again of forcing the issue how many times had he come close to ruling the nation the spirits had been against him before but now it felt as if the bones had been thrown into the air the city was terrified he could feel it surely this was a time when a strong man a brother to genghis himself could seize the reins he cursed under his breath at the memory of the senior officer alkhun temuge had tried to sound him out to gauge his feelings about the two women running karakorum the man had known his purpose temuge was almost sure alkhun had shaken his head before temuge could do more than broach the subject gently the man had dismissed himself with extraordinary abruptness almost rudeness temuge had been left in a corridor staring after him his thoughts were interrupted as the healer came out wiping blood and the white filth from his hands temuge looked up but the chin man shook his head in silence i am sorry the growths were too deep and there were too many the general would not have lived much longer he lost a great deal of blood i could not hold him here temuge clenched his fists suddenly angry what what are you saying he demanded hes dead the healer looked at him sadly he knew there were many risks my lord i am sorry temuge shoved past him and went into the room almost gagging at the stench of sickness there he jammed his sleeve into his mouth once again as he saw khasar staring up at the ceiling his eyes glassy the exposed chest was a mass of scars white rope lines of a thousand battles reaching down to his arms which were thick with them so that it barely looked like flesh he saw again how thin khasar had become the bones showing clearly under tight skin it was a relief that the healer had laid him face up temuge had no wish to see those purple wounds again not while the odour filled his lungs he gagged as he approached his brothers body but he managed to reach out and close the eyes pressing hard so that they remained shut who will look after me now temuge muttered i am the last of us brother what did i ever do to deserve such a fate to his astonishment he began to weep the tears feeling hot against his cheeks get up you fool he said to the body just get up and tell me i am weak and pitiful for weeping get up please he sensed the healers presence at the door and spun round my lord do you want the man began get out temuge roared this is not your business the healer vanished from the door closing it softly behind him temuge turned back to the figure lying on the bed somehow the smell had ceased to bother him i am the last of us khasar bekter and temujin and kachiun temulun and now you you are all gone now i have no one left the realisation brought fresh tears and he slumped into a seat i am alone in a city that waits to be destroyed he whispered for an instant his eyes brightened with bitter rage he had the right to inherit his brothers line not some bastard son who had been nothing but a trial to his father if temuge had commanded a loyal tuman he knew chagatai would not live to take karakorum chagatai would burn all the books in karakorums library without understanding for a moment what treasures lay within temuge swallowed his grief and began to think and weigh his options sorhatani did not understand the stakes involved perhaps the city could be held if it had a man who understood its value not a woman who had merely inherited her power through no talent of her own tsubodai would hear soon and he despised chagatai the entire army would come east like a storm to defend the capital city temuge concentrated harder weighing his decisions and choices if the city survived guyuk would be grateful it felt as if his life had been preparing him for this point this decision his family were no more and without them he felt a strange freedom with the last witnesses gone his old failures were just ashes forgotten there would be some who chafed under sorhatanis rule yao shu was certainly one and temuge thought the chancellor would know of others it could be done before chagatai arrived sometimes power could change hands as quickly as a knife thrust temuge stood up and looked down at khasars body for the last time he will burn the books brother why should i allow that i was there in the beginning when death was just a breath away i promise i will not be afraid now with your spirit watching me i was born to power brother it is the way the world should be not the way it has become i am the last of us khasar this is my time now king bela watched as the camp was set around him beginning with his own tent it was a magnificent affair of oiled struts and sturdy canvas against the wind he could already smell the meal his servants were preparing standing at the centre of it all he felt a surging pride his army had not needed the cuman nomads to drive the mongols back day after day good magyar steel and courage had been all that was required it amused him to think he had herded the mongol shepherds like one of their own flocks he could regret that he had not driven them harder against the banks of the sajo river but they had not checked in their headlong retreat barely pausing at the bridge before flowing across it when he shaded his eyes against the setting sun he could see the enemy tents strange circular things that dotted the landscape across the river they had none of the order and quiet efficiency he saw around him and he relished the thought of the pursuit still to come he had the blood of kings in his veins and he felt his ancestors crying out to see the invader thrown back broken and bloody on the mountains they had come from he turned as one of von thuringens knights came riding up to him the englishman was a rarity among their number though henry of braybrooke was a renowned fighter and deserved his place sir henry king bela said in greeting the knight dismounted slowly and bowed he spoke in french both men fluent in that language my lord they are attempting to hold the bridge against us eight hundred perhaps a thousand of them have sent their horses back to the others they would prefer it if we did not cross eh sir henry king bela chuckled expansively they have felt our breath on their necks for days and they would rather we left them to their retreat as you say my lord but it is the only bridge for a hundred miles or more we must dislodge them tonight or in the morning bela thought for a moment he was in a very good mood when i was a boy sir henry i would collect limpets from the rocks near lake balaton they would cling to the stones but with my little knife i would work them free for the pot do you follow me sir henry bela laughed at his own wit though the knight only frowned slightly waiting for orders the king sighed at such a stolid companioninarms there was little humour in the ranks of knights with their dour version of christianity a waft of roast pork reached them on the air and king bela clapped his hands together in anticipation making his decision send archers sir henry let them have a little sport a touch of target play before sunset hit them hard and drive them back over the river is that clear enough for you the knight bowed again sir henry of braybrooke had a boil on his leg that needed lancing and a sore foot that seemed to be rotting in its bandages for all the unguents and poultices he tried the meal he would enjoy would be a thin soup and stale bread with perhaps a little sour wine to force it down his dry throat he mounted carefully stiff with his discomforts he did not enjoy slaughter though the godless mongols deserved to be wiped from the face of the good earth still he would follow the kings order honouring his vow of obedience to the knights henry of braybrooke passed on the kings command to a regiment of archers four thousand bowmen under a hungarian prince he neither liked nor respected he stayed just long enough to watch them begin their march to the bridge and then went to join the lines for soup and bread his stomach growling chagatai looked out into bright sunshine in his right hand he held a yellowed parchment that had travelled more than a thousand miles along the yam stations it was stained and grubby from its journey but the brief lines written there made his heart pound the yam rider who had delivered it still held position with one knee bent his presence forgotten the moment chagatai had begun to read in hastily scrawled chin characters the message was one he had both expected and almost dreaded for years ogedai had fallen at last it changed everything chagatai had become the last surviving son of genghis khan the last in the direct line of the nationmaker the khan of khans chagatai could almost hear the old mans voice as he thought through what lay ahead it was a time to be ruthless to snatch the power that had once been promised that was his by right tears sprang to his eyes partly in memory of his youth he could be the man his father had wanted him to be at last unconsciously he crumpled the yellow papers tsubodai would stand against him or at least in favour of guyuk the orlok had never been in chagatais camp he would have to be quietly killed there was no other way chagatai nodded to himself the simple decision opening up other pathways into the days to come he had stood in the palace of karakorum with ogedai and tsubodai he had heard his brother talk of tsubodais loyalty but chagatai knew he could never trust the orlok there was simply too much history between them and he had seen the promise of death in tsubodais hard eyes karakorum was the key to the lock he was certain there was no history of direct descent of power at least not in the tribes of the mongol nation the khan had always been chosen from those best suited to lead it did not matter that guyuk was ogedais eldest son or that ogedai favoured him any more than it had mattered that ogedai was not the eldest of his brothers the nation knew no favourites they would accept whoever held the city they would follow whoever had the strength and will to take karakorum chagatai smiled to himself he had many sons to fill those rooms sons who would make the line of genghis stretch to the end of history his imagination filled with a dazzling vision an empire that would reach from koryo in the east to the western nations under just one strong hand the chin had never dreamed so far but the land was vast and it tempted him to try to hold it all he heard footsteps behind him as his servant suntai entered the room for once chagatai had the news before his spymaster he smiled to see the ugly face flushed as if he had been running it is time suntai chagatai said his eyes bright with tears the khan has fallen and i must gather my tumans his servant glanced at the kneeling yam rider and after a moment of thought he copied the position with his head bowed your will my lord khan chapter thirtyone guyuk leaned forward in the saddle balancing a lance as he galloped along a forest path ahead of him he could see the back of a serbian horseman risking life and limb at full speed through the woodland paths guyuk felt his right arm burn as the weight of the lance pulled at his muscles he shifted his stance as he rode rising on the stirrups so that he could soak up the impact in his thighs the battle was over days before but he and mongke still pursued the fleeing forces with their tumans riding hard and making sure there were so few left alive that they could never support the hungarian king guyuk thought again of the numbers of ethnic magyars he had found across the borders tsubodai had been right to send him south where so many villages might have answered belas call to war they could no longer do so his sweep across their lands had seen to that guyuk cursed as he heard a distant horn he was close enough to the serb to see his terrified glances behind but the general took his responsibilities seriously he lifted the reins from where he had dropped them over the wooden saddle horn and pulled gently with his left hand his pony steamed in the glade as he came to a halt and watched the terrified serb rider vanish into the trees guyuk made an ironic salute with his lance then jerked it into the air catching it along its length and fitting it back into its sleeve by his leg the horn sounded again then a third time he frowned wondering what mongke could have found that was so urgent as he rode back along the path he caught glimpses of his men returning with him coming out of the green gloom and calling to each other boasting of their personal triumphs guyuk saw one of them waving a fistful of gold chains and he smiled at the mans expression lifted by their simple joy when tsubodai had given him his orders guyuk had worried it was some sort of punishment it had been clear enough that tsubodai was removing batus closest friends the drive across the south had not promised much in the way of glory yet if the recall was the first signal to rejoin tsubodai guyuk knew he would look back on those weeks with intense affection he and mongke had worked well together each man learning to trust the other certainly his respect for mongke had grown over a short time the man was tireless and competent and if he did not have batus flashes of brilliance he was always where he was needed guyuk remembered his relief only a few days before when mongke had routed a force of serbs that had ambushed two of his minghaans in the hills at the edge of the forest there were rocky outcrops and guyuk picked his way past the broken ground as it merged with grassland he could already see mongkes tuman forming up as well as his own men coming in from all directions and taking their positions guyuk kicked his mount into a canter and rode across even from a distance guyuk heard the jingle of bells that meant a yam rider had reached them his pulse raced with excitement at getting news of any kind it was too easy to feel isolated away from the main army as if his battles and raids were the whole world guyuk forced himself to relax as he rode tsubodai would be calling them back for the final push to the west truly the sky father had blessed their enterprise and he had never once regretted coming so far from the plains of home guyuk was young but he could imagine the years ahead when all those who had ridden in the great trek would share a special bond he felt it already a sense of shared danger even of brotherhood whatever else tsubodai had intended the trek had forged bonds between the generals who had ridden with him as he rode up to mongke guyuk saw his friend was flushed and angry guyuk raised his eyebrows in unspoken question and mongke shrugged he says he will speak only to you he said stiffly guyuk looked in surprise at the young yam rider he was travelstained though that was normal enough guyuk saw great patches of sweat on the riders silk tunic he wore no armour but carried a leather satchel on his back that he had to struggle to remove my instructions are to give the message only into the hands of guyuk my lord i meant no offence the last comment was directed at mongke who glowered at him no doubt orlok tsubodai has his reasons guyuk said accepting the satchel and opening it the weary rider looked uncomfortable in the presence of such senior men but he shook his head my lord i have not seen orlok tsubodai this message came down the line from karakorum guyuk froze in the process of pulling out a single folded parchment the men watching saw him grow pale as he examined the seal with a quick snap he broke the wax and opened the message that had travelled almost five thousand miles to reach his hand he bit his lip as he read his eyes travelling back to the beginning over and over as he tried to take it in mongke could not bear the strained silence what is it guyuk he said guyuk shook his head my father is dead he replied dazed the khan is dead mongke sat still on his horse for only a moment then dismounted and knelt on the grass with his head bowed the men around him followed suit word spreading among their number until both tumans were kneeling guyuk looked over their heads in confusion still unable to take it in stand up general he said i will not forget this but i must return home now i must go back to karakorum mongke rose showing no emotion before guyuk could stop him he pressed his forehead against guyuks boot in the stirrup let me take the oath to you mongke said allow me that honour guyuk stared at the man looking up at him with such fierce pride in his eyes very well general he said softly the khan is dead i offer you salt milk horses gers and blood mongke replied i will follow you my lord khan i give you my word and my word is iron guyuk shuddered slightly as the words were echoed by the kneeling men around them until they had been said by all the silence held and guyuk looked over them beyond the horizon to a city only he could see it is done my lord mongke said we are bound to you alone he mounted in one leap and began snapping orders to the closest minghaan officers guyuk still held the yellow parchment as if it would burn him he heard mongke ordering the tumans north to join tsubodai no general i must leave tonight guyuk said his eyes were glassy his skin like wax in the sunlight he barely noticed mongke bring his horse alongside or felt the grip as mongke reached out to touch his shoulder you will need the other tumans now my friend mongke said you will need all of them tsubodai crouched in the darkness he could hear the river running close by the air was filled with the odour of men and horses damp cloth sweat spiced mutton and manure all mingling in the night air he was in a grim mood having watched a minghaan of warriors slowly cut to pieces as they tried to hold the river bridge on his orders they had completed their task so that darkness came without the main magyar army crossing king bela had forced just a thousand heavy horse across in a bridgehead establishing his position for the morning they would not sleep with mongol campfires all around them the sacrifice had been worthwhile tsubodai thought king bela was forced to wait for the morning before he could flood across the bridge and continue his dogged pursuit of the mongol army wearily tsubodai cracked his neck loosening tired joints he did not need to motivate his men with a speech or fresh orders they too had watched the last stand of the minghaan they had heard the cries of pain and seen the splashes as dying men tumbled into the waters the sajo river was running full and fast and they drowned swiftly in their armour unable to rise to the surface the moon was half full casting its light over the landscape the river shone like a silver rope blurred into darkness as the tumans splashed through the shallow ford this was the key to tsubodais plan the fording place he had scouted on the first crossing out of the mountains everything bela had seen made him believe the mongols were running the way they had held the bridge showed its importance to them since then tsubodai had used the dark hours as the moon rose above the grasslands around the river it was a gamble a risk but he was as tired of running as his men only his ragged conscripts now held the land beyond the river they sat around a thousand fires in the moonlight moving from one to another and making it look as if a vast camp had been set instead tsubodai had led the tumans three miles to the north on foot they led their horses across the fording point out of sight and sound of the enemy he had left not a single tuman in reserve if the plan failed now the hungarian king would storm across the river at dawn and the ragged levy would be annihilated tsubodai sent whispered orders to hurry the pace it took hours to get so many men across especially as they tried to keep quiet again and again he jerked his gaze up to the moon watching its passage and estimating the time he had left before dawn king belas army was huge tsubodai would need the entire day to avenge his losses in full the tumans gathered on the other side of the river the horses were snorting and whinnying to each other their nostrils blocked by the grubby hands of warriors to muffle the sounds the men whispered and laughed with each other in the darkness relishing the shock that would ripple through the army chasing them for five days they had run finally it was time to stop and hit back in the gloom tsubodai could see that batu was grinning as he trotted up for orders he kept his own face stern your tuman is to hit the vanguard of their camp batu where their king rests catch them asleep and destroy them if you can reach the sandbag walls tear them down approach as quietly as you can then let your arrows and swords shout for you your will orlok batu replied for once there was no mockery as he spoke the title i will ride with the tumans of jebe and chulgetei to strike against their rear at the same moment they are certain of our position and they will not expect us tonight their walls are worse than useless for they feel safe within them i want them in panic batu everything depends on routing them quickly do not forget that they outnumber us still if they are well led they could rally and reform we will be forced to fight to the last man and the losses will be huge do not throw away my army batu do you understand i will treat them as if they were my own sons batu said tsubodai snorted ride then dawn is close and you must be in position tsubodai watched as batu vanished silently into the darkness there were no signal horns or naccara drums not with the enemy so close and unsuspecting batus tuman formed up without fuss setting off at a trot towards the hungarian camp the mongol carts and gers and wounded had remained behind with the conscripts left to fend for themselves the tumans were unencumbered able to ride fast and strike hard as they preferred tsubodai nodded sharply to himself he had further to ride than batus tuman and time was short he mounted quickly feeling his heart beat stronger in his chest it was rare for him to feel excitement and he showed nothing in his face as he led the last two tumans into the west king bela came awake starting in his sleep at a crash of sound he was covered in sweat and rubbed the last wisps of a nightmare from his eyes as he stood in his blurred thoughts he could hear the clash and screams of battle and he blinked becoming aware that the sounds were real in sudden fear he stuck his head outside the command tent it was still dark but he saw conrad von thuringen on his horse already in full armour the marshal of the teutonic knights did not see bela as he trotted past shouting orders bela could not make out over the tumult men were running in all directions and out beyond the sandbags he heard battle horns sound in the distance bela swallowed drily as he recognised a distant rumble that was growing louder and clearer with every passing moment he cursed and turned back to his tent fumbling for clothes in the darkness his servants were nowhere to be found and he stumbled over a chair hissing with pain as he rose he pulled a pair of heavy trousers from the fallen chair back and yanked them on it all took precious time he grabbed the embroidered jacket of his rank pulling it over his shoulders as he raced out into the night his horse had been brought and he mounted needing the height to see the first light of dawn had stolen upon them in those moments the sky to the east was growing pale and with a shock of horror bela could see his ranks boiling in utter chaos the sandbag walls there had spilled across the grass worse than useless his own men were coming through the gap driven back by the savage riders and arrows slaughtering them outside he heard von thuringen bellow orders to his knights as they rode to shore up the defences there desperate hope kindled in him the roar of drums began again and the king spun his charger on the spot the mongols were somehow behind him how had they crossed the river it was impossible yet the drums rattled and grew stunned bela rode through the camp preferring to move rather than remain still though his mind was a blank his magyars had breached their own camp boundaries in two places pouring through them to what felt like safety he could barely comprehend the losses they must have taken to be falling back in such a way as he watched the holes widened and more and more crammed themselves behind the sandbags beyond them the mongols still tore into his bewildered men sending them reeling with arrows and lances in the growing light there seemed no end to them and bela wondered if they had somehow hidden an army until then bela struggled to remain calm as the chaos increased around him he knew he needed to retake the perimeter to restore the camp and marshal his men within the walls from there he would be able to assess the losses perhaps even begin a counterattack he bawled the order to the messengers and they rode out through the milling horsemen shouting the words to anyone who could hear rebuild the walls hold the walls if it could be done he might yet save the day from disaster his officers would make order from the chaos he would throw the tumans back the knights under josef landau heard him they formed up and charged back across the camp in a solid mass there were mongols at the walls by then and a hail of arrows buzzed through the camp in such a crush there was no need to aim bela could hardly believe the losses but the knights struggled on like men possessed knowing as he did that the walls were their only salvation von thuringen led a hundred of his own armoured men the enormous marshal easy to mark with his beard and longsword the knights proved their worth to him then landau and von thuringen shattering the mongols who had dared to enter the camp driving them back towards the wide holes in the walls they fought with righteous rage and for once the mongols did not have room to nip and dart past them bela watched with his heart in his mouth as the teutonic knights blocked one breach with their horses holding shields against the arrows still pouring through landau was struck by something and bela had a glimpse of his head lolling limp as his horse bolted away for a moment the knight struggled his arms flailing then he fell into the churned mud almost at belas feet there was blood coming from under his neck plates though bela could see no wound trapped and suffocating in his armour landau died slowly his body buffeted by those running around and over him unhorsed men yanked and sweated at the sandbags rebuilding the walls as quickly as they could the mongols came again using their horses to ride right up to the walls and then leaping over them so that they landed tumbling one by one those intruders were killed taken by the same regiment of archers who had assaulted the bridge the night before bela began to breathe more easily as the threat of imminent destruction receded the walls were repaired his enemies howling outside them they had taken grievous losses though nothing like his own he thanked god he had built the camp large enough to shelter his men king bela stared at the heaps of dead soldiers and horses piled around the edges they were thick with shafts some still twitching the sun was high and he could not believe the time had passed so quickly since the first alarms from the back of his horse he could see the mongols were still pressing close to the walls there was only one true gate and he sent archers to cover it against another attack he saw von thuringen gather the knights there in a column and bela could only watch as they pulled down their visors and readied lances at a bellow from von thuringen the gate was pulled open almost six hundred kicked their chargers into a gallop and rode out into the storm bela thought he would not see them again he had the wits to send archers to every wall with full quivers all around him the snap of bows began and he breathed faster as he heard guttural yells from outside the teutonic knights were in their element slicing through the mongol riders using weight and speed to cut them down as they roared and screamed outside the sandbag walls bela could hardly control his fear inside the camp men and horses roiled in a crush but a great part of his army had been slaughtered in their sleep outside bela heard the jeers and whoops of the mongols suddenly choked off as von thuringen battered through them he felt himself grow cold he would not escape from this place they had trapped him and he would die with the rest it seemed an age before von thuringen came back through the gate the gleaming column of knights had been reduced to no more than eighty perhaps a hundred the men who returned were battered and bloody many of them reeling in their saddles with arrows sticking out of their armour the magyar horsemen were in awe of the knights and many of them dismounted to help them down from the saddle von thuringens huge beard was stained with rusty blood and he looked like some dark god his blue eyes furious as they fell on the hungarian king bela needed guidance and he returned the gaze like a deer staring helplessly at a lion through the heaving mass of men conrad von thuringen came riding the marshals face as grim as his own batu was panting as he rode up to tsubodai the orlok stood by his horse on a ridge of land that stretched across the battlefield watching the battles he had ordered batu had expected the orlok to be furious at the way the attack had gone but instead tsubodai smiled to see him batu rubbed at a clot of mud sticking to his neck and returned the smile uncertainly those knights are impressive batu said tsubodai nodded he had seen the bearded giant throw his men back the mongol warriors had been too close unable to manoeuvre when the knights came charging out even so the sudden attack had been unnerving for its discipline and ferocity the knights had hacked their way through his men like tireless butchers closing the gaps in their own ranks as arrows found them and sent them falling to the ground each one that fell took two or three warriors with him grunting and kicking out until he was held and cut there are not so many now tsubodai replied though the attack had shaken his certainties he had not dismissed the threat of the knights but perhaps he had underestimated their strength in the right time and place that bearded maniac had found the moment surprising his tuman just as they were howling for victory still only a few knights made it back when the volleys of arrows began to snap out from the walls tsubodai had given the order to retreat out of range his own warriors had begun to return the shafts but the deaths were unequal as belas archers shot from behind a stable wall of sandbags for an instant tsubodai had considered another charge to break the walls but the cost would have been too high he had them inside their own walls weaker than any chin fortress he doubted they had enough water for so many crammed into the camp the orlok stared out across the plains with its heaps of bodies some still crawling the attacks had smashed the hungarian army shattering their overconfidence at last he was pleased but he bit his lip as he pondered how to finish the work how long can they hold batu asked suddenly echoing his thoughts so closely that tsubodai looked at him in surprise a few days before their water runs out no more he said but they will not wait until then the question is how many men and horses how many arrows and lances they have left and how many of those cursed knights it was hard to make a good estimate the grasslands were littered with the dead but he could not know how many had survived to reach their king he closed his eyes for a moment summoning up the image of the land as if he flew above it his ragged conscripts were still across the river no doubt staring balefully at the small contingent who had forced the bridge and held the other side the kings camp lay between tsubodai and the river trapped and held in one spot once again batu had mirrored his thoughts let me send a messenger to bring the foot soldiers back across the river batu said tsubodai ignored him he did not yet know how many of his mongol warriors had been killed or wounded that morning if the king had saved even half his army he would have enough left to force a battle on equal terms a battle that tsubodai could only win by throwing his tumans in hard the precious army he had brought on the great trek would be reduced battered against an enemy of equal strength and will it would not do he thought furiously opening his eyes to stare at the land around the camp slowly he smiled and this time batu was not there before him what is it orlok shall i send a messenger across the river ford yes tell them to slaughter the kings men across the river we must retake that bridge batu i do not want the king sending men to the river for water tsubodai tapped his boot on the ridge beneath him when that is done i will pull my tumans further back another mile from this point thirst will make their decision for them batu could only look on in confusion as tsubodai showed his teeth in what might have been a grin chapter thirtytwo temuge was sweating though the air was cold in the courtyard of the palace he could feel the hard length of the knife he had concealed under his robe there had been no search of the men summoned there that morning though he had made sure by hiding the weapon so that it chafed his groin and caused him to shift his weight in the distance temuge could hear hammering the sound that filled his days the fortification of karakorum went on day and night as it would do until the banners of chagatai were seen on the horizon if sorhatani and torogene held the city long enough for guyuk to return they would be praised above all women men would talk of the way they had girded karakorum for war for generations to come the name of temuge keeper of the khans libraries would be forgotten he stared coldly at sorhatani as she addressed the small crowd alkhun was there as the senior minghaan of the khans guards temuge felt the man look strangely at him and ignored him he breathed deeply of the cold air thinking planning deciding his brother genghis had once walked into a khans ger and cut his throat genghis should not have survived it but he had quieted the mans tribe with words and threats they had stopped to listen temuge burned at the thought that the men and women in the courtyard would stop and listen to him he fingered the hilt of the knife under his clothes there was no destiny in life nothing beyond what a man could take and hold for himself temuge had been witness to the bloody birth of a nation whether they understood it or not they owed him their city their lives everything if it had not been for genghis the men and women in that cold yard would still be grubby goatherders on the plains with each tribe at the throat of the next they were even living longer than the men and women he had known as a boy chin and moslem healers had saved many from illnesses that had once been mortal despite the surging anger part of him was still terrified of what he planned again and again temuge let his hands fall open telling himself the moment had passed his moment in history then the memory of his brothers would surface and he could feel them mocking his indecision it was just a death nothing more certainly nothing to unman him in such a way he felt sweat trickle down his neck and wiped at it drawing the gaze of yao shu their eyes met and temuge was reminded that he was not alone in his plotting the chancellor had been more than open with him the man hid a vicious hatred of sorhatani that had led temuge into revealing more of his thoughts and dreams than he had planned sorhatani dismissed the officers of karakorum to their days work and began to turn away torogene went with her already discussing some detail a moment my lady temuge said his mouth seemed to work without his volition spitting out the words sorhatani was in a hurry and barely gestured for him to follow her as she stepped down and walked towards the cloistered hallway back into the palace rooms it was that casual gesture that firmed his nerve with anger to have such a woman treat him as a supplicant was enough to bring a flush to his features he hurried to catch up with the women taking strength from the presence of yao shu falling in with them he glanced back at the open courtyard as they passed into shadow frowning as he saw alkhun was still there staring after him sorhatani had made a mistake in letting him come so close in the shadows he reached out and took her arm she shook off his grip what do you want temuge she snapped i have a thousand things to do this morning it was not a time for words but he spoke to cover the moment as he reached for the knife under his deel robe my brother genghis would not want a woman to rule his lands he said she stiffened and he brought out the blade torogene gasped and took a step away already panicking sorhatanis eyes widened in shock temuge grabbed her with his left hand and drew back his arm to drive the dagger into her chest he felt his arm gripped with such strength that he stumbled and cried out yao shu held him and the mans eyes were cold with disdain temuge yanked at his arm but he could not free himself panic spread through his chest making his heart flutter no he said spittle had gathered in two white specks at the corner of his mouth he could not understand what was happening you were right after all yao shu sorhatani said she did not look at temuge as if he had ceased to matter at all im sorry to have doubted you i just never thought he would truly be so stupid yao shu tightened his grip and the dagger fell with a clatter on the stone floor he has always been a weak man he replied he shook temuge suddenly making him cry out in fear and astonishment what do you want done with him sorhatani hesitated and temuge struggled to find his wits i am the last brother of genghis he said and what are you who are you to sit in judgement of me a chin monk and two women you have no right to judge me he is no threat yao shu went on as if temuge had not spoken you could banish him from the khanate send him far away like any wanderer yes send him far away torogene said she was shaking temuge saw temuge felt sorhatanis gaze on him and he took a long slow breath knowing his life hung in her hands no torogene she said at last such a thing should be punished he would not have shown mercy to us she waited while temuge swore and struggled allowing torogene the decision torogene shook her head and walked away her eyes brimming give him over to alkhun sorhatani said temuge shouted for help suddenly desperate as he writhed against the grip that kept him helpless as a child i was there when we found you in the forests monk he spat it was i who brought you back to genghis how can you let my nephews whore rule over you tell alkhun to make it quick sorhatani said i can do that much for him yao shu nodded and she walked away leaving the pair alone temuge crumpled as he heard footsteps approach and saw alkhun come out of the sunlight into the shadowed cloister you heard it yao shu said the minghaans eyes were furious as he took his own grip on temuges shoulders feeling the thin bones of an old man through the cloth i heard he said he had a long knife in his hand damn you both temuge said damn you both to hell temuge began to weep as he was dragged back into the sunshine by the second day after the night attack belas men had repaired the sandbag walls with broken carts and saddles from dead horses his archers were on permanent alert but they were already dry and gasping there was barely enough water for a single swallow in the morning and evening for each man the horses were suffering and bela was desperate he rested his chin on the rough canvas of a bag staring out over the mongol army that had camped nearby they of course had access to the river and as much water as they could drink as he gazed out across the grassland bela struggled with despair he no longer considered the reports from the north to be exaggerated the mongol general had far fewer men but they had routed the superior force in a display of manoeuvre and tactics that made him burn for the rest of that appalling first day bela had expected an allout assault on the camp but it had not come he felt trapped there crushed in among so many men and horses that they could hardly move he could not understand why they had not come unless they took some perverse pleasure in seeing a king die of thirst they were not even threatening the camp and had moved back far beyond arrow range bela could just make out their movements in the distance it gave a false sense of security to see them so far away he knew from reports and his own bitter experience that they could move at incredible speed if they wanted von thuringen left a conversation with his knights to approach the man had shed his armoured breastplate revealing scarred arms and a quilted jerkin stained and filthy bela could smell the sweat and blood on him still the marshals face was stern and bela could hardly meet his eyes as von thuringen bowed stiffly one of my men thinks hes found a way out of this von thuringen said king bela blinked he had been praying for salvation but the answer to prayers seemed unlikely in the huge bearded man before him still matted with someone elses blood what is it bela said standing up and squaring his shoulders under the knights scrutiny easier to show you your majesty von thuringen replied without another word he turned and pushed his way through the mass of horses and men bela could only follow his irritation growing it was not a long journey though the king was buffeted among the men and barely avoided being knocked down as a horse reared he followed von thuringen to another section of wall and looked in the direction the marshal pointed see there three of my men von thuringen said flatly king bela peered over the wall and saw three knights who had removed their armour yet still wore the tabards of yellow and back that marked their order they were standing in full view of the sandbag walls but bela saw how the land dipped before rising to the mongol camp there was a ridge there that ran west hope leapt in him as he considered the possibilities i couldnt risk horses in daylight but in darkness every man here could ride out below that ridge with a bit of luck and if they keep their heads down the mongols will find an empty camp tomorrow morning bela bit his lip suddenly terrified of leaving the fragile safety of the camp there is no other way he asked von thuringen drew his brows together so that his eyebrows met not without a supply of water not without a much larger camp and materials for the walls we need were crammed so tight in here wed be worse than useless if they attacked be thankful they havent yet realised our weakness your majesty god has shown us the way but it is your order to give can we not defeat them in battle von thuringen surely there is room to form up on the field the marshal of the teutonic knights took a breath to control his anger he was not the one who supposedly knew the lands around the sajo river his men could never have predicted a ford just a couple of miles downstream the blame for the appalling losses was at the feet of the king not his knights it was all von thuringen could do to remain civil your majesty my knights would follow you to death the rest well they are frightened men take this chance and let us get away from this damned camp i will find another place where we can take revenge on the goatherders forget the battle your majesty a campaign is not lost because of a single bad day king bela stood working a ring on his hand round and round von thuringen waited impatiently but eventually the king nodded very well as soon as its dark enough we go von thuringen turned away already issuing the orders to the men around him he would organise the retreat hoping that no mongol scout wandered too close to the ridge that night as soon as the sun set von thuringen gave the order to leave the camp the final hours had been spent wrapping cloth around hooves to silence them though the ground was soft enough the teutonic knights supervised the first men who crept out in darkness and began to walk their mounts beneath the ridge their hearts pounding at the thought of a shout from the enemy it did not come and they moved quickly the knights were the last out of the camp leaving it abandoned in the moonlight von thuringen could see the mongol campfires in the distance and he smiled wearily at the thought of them finding the camp empty in the morning he had spoken the truth to the king the losses had been grievous but there would be other days even if he accomplished nothing more than finding a good field for battle it would offer better odds than dying of thirst behind sandbags as the night wore on von thuringen lost track of the mass of men ahead of him the first miles were an agony of suspense but once the camp was far behind the lines stretched out into a long trail of men over many miles as the faster ones outpaced the injured and slow even his knights felt it a feverish desire to put some real distance between them and the mongol army the marshal of the teutonic knights ached from the battering he had taken von thuringen knew his flesh would be a colourful mass of bruises under his armour from arrow strikes there was already blood in his urine as he rode in the darkness he considered what he had seen and did not enjoy the conclusions there was another reason to preserve the magyar army to fight again if the reports from the north were true they were the last army between hungary and france that had a chance of stopping the mongol invasion the very thought appalled him he had never thought to see such a threat in his lifetime the nobles of russia should have torn the enemy to pieces yet they had failed and seen their cities burn king louis of france would have to be told von thuringen thought sourly more importantly the struggle for power between the pope and the holy roman emperor would have to be put aside none of them were safe until the true enemy had been destroyed von thuringen shook his head as he urged his charger to a trot again somewhere ahead the king of hungary rode with his personal guard von thuringen could have wished for a better leader at such a time but that was the fortune he had been given he would not fail after a single lost battle he had suffered through defeats before and always returned to send the souls of his enemies screaming back to hell the first light of dawn was showing and von thuringen could only guess how far he had come during the night he was mortally tired and his throat was dry the supply of water long gone he knew he should look for a river as soon as there was enough light to restore some strength to the horses and men he reached down and patted the neck of his charger at the thought murmuring words of comfort if god was with them the mongols would not realise they had gone for a morning or longer he smiled at the thought of them waiting patiently for thirst to drive the magyars into their arms it would be a long wait the tasks he faced rattled through his head as the light began to turn from silvery grey to gold the priority was to find a river and drink their fill the thought of fresh water made him work his lips clearing them of thick spit as the light spread across the land von thuringen saw a dark line on his right hand at first he thought it was trees or some outcropping of rock then in a moment the shadowy forms resolved and he froze pulling on the reins mongol warriors on horseback lined the path with bows held ready von thuringen tried to swallow but his throat was too dry his gaze swept up and down the lines seeing the thin trail of men ahead of him by god there was not even a herald to blow a warning horn only a few of his knights rode nearby and they too reined in looking back at him in grim realisation the world held still for a long time and in silent prayer von thuringen made his peace his final penitence he kissed the ring on his finger with its holy relic for the last time as he spurred his charger forward and reached for his sword the arrows began to fly the first ones keening through the air like screaming children the mongols fell upon the thin and broken line of escaping soldiers and the butchery began in earnest baidur and ilugei returned to hungary to find tsubodai resting with his tumans the mood of triumph was visible in every face they saw and they were greeted with drums and horns the tumans with tsubodai knew the part baidur had played in their own victory and he was cheered as he entered the camp around the danube the cities of buda and pest had been sacked over days then looted carefully of anything that they needed or desired baidur trotted through streets of halfburnt houses seeing stones that had been hot enough to shatter into rubble over the open road though king bela had escaped the army of hungary had been slaughtered almost too many to count tsubodais tallymen had collected sacks of ears and some talked of sixty thousand dead or more the scouts were already out roaming further west but for a season the tumans could pause in the great trek growing strong and fat on rich meat and stolen wine tsubodai sent riders to guyuk and mongke to bring them in their flanking rides were ended and he chose to gather them all in one place ready to push on to the sea batu had seen the riders go out and so he was surprised when one of his men brought him news of tumans coming from the south it was too early for tsubodais orders to have reached guyuk but he called to baidur and they rode out of camp they were among the first to recognise the banners of guyuks tuman batu laughed at the sight and dug in his heels sending his pony galloping across the open grassland there were many stories to tell and he anticipated enough drunken evenings to recount them all as he and baidur drew closer neither man noticed the dark expressions on the faces of the returning warriors at first there was no mood of jubilation in the tumans of guyuk and mongke guyuk in particular looked as grim as batu had ever seen him what is it cousin batu said his smile fading guyuk turned his head and batu saw his eyes were redrimmed and sorelooking the khan is dead guyuk said batu shook his head your father how he was still young guyuk looked at him from under lowered brows forcing the words out his heart i must see tsubodai now batu and baidur fell in at his side baidur had paled and he was lost in thought as they rode he knew his father better than anyone and he was suddenly afraid the men around him had become his enemies chapter thirtythree batu stayed with guyuk mongke and baidur as they entered the river city of buda and made their way through the streets to the palace tsubodai was using for his base it was left to their senior minghaan officers to find lodging and food for the men in the ransacked city the four princes rode to the royal palace and dismounted at the outer gate they passed the guards without a challenge the orloks officers took one look and chose discretion rather than the letter of their orders for once guyuk led the small group with batu striding at his right shoulder they found tsubodai in an empty ballroom where a huge dining table had been dragged in and piled with maps and papers the orlok was deep in conversation with jebe chulgetei and ilugei the other men were nodding as tsubodai adjusted coins to show the position of tumans on the landscape batu took in the scene at a glance and smiled tightly to himself it was a meeting of young and old and for the first time batu was confident he could predict the outcome tsubodai looked up as the four princes crossed the hall their steps echoing in the space he frowned at the sight of their stern expressions and stood back from the table i did not summon you here he said he was looking at batu but his gaze snapped over in surprise as guyuk answered my father is dead orlok tsubodai closed his eyes for a moment his face stiff he nodded to himself please sit down he said his authority was so deeply ingrained that all four moved to the chairs around the table though batu held back wanting to keep the impetus they had brought with them tsubodai spoke again before anyone else was it his heart he said guyuk took in a breath so you knew then yes it was his heart he told me when he told his brother chagatai tsubodai replied his eyes fell on baidur as guyuk turned in the chair i knew nothing baidur said coldly guyuk turned back but tsubodai let his eyes remain on baidur until the young man was shifting uncomfortably tsubodai had a hundred things he wanted to say but he controlled himself with an effort of will what are your plans he asked guyuk the more detached part of him was interested to see how guyuk would respond whatever remnant there was left of his youth had been suddenly strangled tsubodai looked at the young prince understanding the quiet reserve he now saw there was new weight on guyuks shoulders whether he wanted it or not i am my fathers heir guyuk said i must return to karakorum once more tsubodai looked to baidur the orlok grimaced but the words had to be said are you aware of the threat from your uncle he has a claim to the khanate neither man looked directly at baidur as he flushed guyuk cocked his head slightly in thought and tsubodai was pleased to see him weigh his response there was no place for the foolish young man he had been not any longer the yam rider reached me a month ago i have had time to consider it guyuk said i will require an oath of allegiance from the tumans here that will have to wait tsubodai said when we are finished here you will summon the nation as your father did baidur shifted again and was ignored his was an impossible position but he was growing desperate to speak i can let you have four tumans leaving me only three tsubodai said you must return in force to secure the khanate chagatai cannot put more than two perhaps three in the field he stared coldly at baidur it is my recommendation that you have baidur remain with me rather than force him to choose between cousin and father he dipped his head to baidur my apologies general baidur opened his mouth but he could not find the words it was batu who spoke next for the first time tsubodais eyes and jaw tightened instantly at his voice betraying an inner tension you know chagatai khan better than any of us except for baidur how do you think he will react when he hears the news tsubodai did not look at batu as he replied keeping his gaze locked on guyuk every word seemed to be dragged out of him if he is rash he will take his tumans to karakorum if he is rashi see batu replied enjoying the discomfort he saw and what will follow when guyuk khan returns home chagatai will either negotiate or he will fight no one can know his mind tsubodai clasped his hands on the table and leaned closer to guyuk believe me chagatai khan is not the threat you believe it looked as if he might go on but then tsubodai clamped his jaw and waited the decision was not simply a military one batu could hardly control the quirking of his lips at seeing tsubodai at a loss guyuk let the men at the table sweat for a time before he shook his head if you can offer me no more than that as assurance orlok i must take the tumans home all of them he glanced at jebe and chulgetei but the older men were not part of the decision tsubodai had ultimate authority over the army but this was not a military problem tsubodai let out a long breath general i have new maps that show lands that are not even legends to us the city of vienna is but a hundred miles further west the homeland of the templar knights is beyond it italy is to the south already i have scouts in the mountains there planning the next stage this has been my lifes achievement he stopped himself rather than beg as guyuk gazed stonily at him i will need all the tumans orlok tsubodai all you do not need the ragged conscripts leave me but those and two tumans and i will go on slowly guyuk reached out his hand and gripped tsubodais shoulder the gesture was one he would not have dreamed of making a month before how could i leave you behind tsubodai the general of genghis khan at the time i need him most come home with me you know i cannot allow you to stay you will come back another year when there is peace tsubodai stared at baidur and his pain was visible to all baidur looked away rather than see when the orloks gaze swept over batu his eyes blazed i am an old man tsubodai said and i saw the beginning of it all when genghis himself was young i will not come back here again i have spoken to prisoners there is nothing between us and the ocean nothing we have seen their knights guyuk do you understand they cannot stop us if we go on the land is ours to take sea to sea for ever sea to sea general ours for ten thousand years can you imagine such a thing it is not important guyuk said softly the homeland is where we began i cannot lose all that for lands here he brought his hand back and his voice was steady i will be khan orlok tsubodai i need you with me tsubodai slumped slowly in his chair the energy draining from his face even batu looked uncomfortable at the changes they had wrought in him very well i will make them ready to ride home chagatai stood looking out at the river as the sun came up the room was bare of furniture the palace itself empty beyond a few servants who would clean the rooms he did not know if he would ever come back there again and he felt a pang of loss at the thought he heard footsteps approaching and turned to see his servant suntai enter the room the mans scarred face was welcome while chagatais heart soared with visions it is time my lord khan suntai said his gaze fell to the crumpled parchment in chagatais hand read and reread a thousand times since it had come just days before it is time chagatai echoed he took a last look at the sun rising lighting the backs of a flight of geese rising from the still waters in such a mood he stared straight at the ball of gold on the horizon daring it to burn him i can be in karakorum months ahead of him chagatai said i will take the oath of our people as khan but there will be war when he returns unless i take the example of my beloved brother ogedai what do you think suntai would guyuk accept my khanate here in exchange for his life come give me your counsel he may my lord after all you did chagatai smiled at peace with the world for the first time in years perhaps i would be storing up trouble for the future or for my son baidur i must think of his life now by the spirits if guyuk would just die in his sleep my path would be clear instead i have sent him a hostage to my goodwill suntai knew his master well and he smiled as he came to stand behind him guyuk may believe so my lord even orlok tsubodai but will such a hostage truly stay your hand chagatai shrugged i have other sons the prize is too great to turn aside for just one baidur will have to fight his own way out after all suntai i gave him my best warriors for his tuman they have no equal in the nation if he falls i will grieve for him but his fate is in his own hands as always chagatai had not noticed suntais soft boots in place of his usual sandals he did not hear the final step he felt a sting at his neck and choked in surprise reaching up to his throat to his astonishment there was a terrible wrongness there as he pulled his hand away he saw it was covered in blood he tried to speak but his voice was lost to him and only creaked through the line that striped his skin it is said that the kirpan dagger is so very sharp that little pain attends a death suntai said i have never had the opportunity to ask its name translates as hand of mercy for that reason the servant leaned closer as he saw chagatais lips move though a low gargling was the only sound he could make suntai stood well back as his master sank to one knee still clutching his throat the wound is mortal my lord try to be calm death is coming swiftly chagatais head sank slowly to his chest his right hand came away bloody and reached for the sword on his hip but he did not have the strength to draw it beyond the first gleaming line of steel i was told to pass on a message to you my lord if there was a chance to do so i have memorised the words can you still hear suntai watched as chagatai fell forward in a clatter someone shouted nearby and suntai frowned at the thought of what must come the message is from ogedai khan my lord to be given at the moment of your death this is not vengeance chagatai it is for my son i am no longer the man who let you live by my hand striking far you will not be khan suntai sighed i have never been truly your servant my lord but you were a fine master go with god chagatais hands fell limp and his guards came storming into the room drawing their blades as they saw suntai kneeling and whispering into the ear of their master he stood as they rushed towards him his face peaceful as the swords swung on a cold clear morning tsubodai mounted his horse and looked back there were no clouds and the sky was a perfect blue seven tumans were waiting in formation the best warriors of his nation behind them the baggage and carts stretched for miles he had taken generals some of them almost boys and he had shown them their strengths despite his flaws guyuk would be a better khan because of what he had learned on the great trek baidur would be more of a man than his father before him mongke would make his fathers soul proud tsubodai sighed he knew he would never see such an army again old age had crept up on him and he was tired for a time he had thought he could ride for ever with the young men the lure of the sea bringing him further from home than he could once have dreamed when guyuk had called a halt it was like a whisper of death in his ears an ending he stared into the distance imagining cities with spires of gold he knew their names but he would never see them vienna paris rome it was done he knew he would take arms if chagatai challenged for ogedais khanate perhaps he would see battle one last time with the princes he would take the field in glory and show chagatai why tsubodai bahadur had been the general of genghis khan the thought lifted him for an instant enough to raise his hand and drop it at his back the mongol tumans began the journey of five thousand miles that would take them home at last epilogue xuan looked out of the windows in a long cloister as he walked each one revealed a view of hangzhou with the river leading out into the bay he had been moved often since coming into sung lands as if they could not think what to do with him on rare occasions he was even allowed to sail on the river and he saw his wives and children twice a year in strained meetings with sung officials watching on all sides the cloister ran along the spine of yet another official building xuan amused himself by timing his steps so that his left foot hit the stone at the centre of each pool of sunlight he did not expect great news from the summons over the years he had realised the sung officials delighted in demonstrating their power over him for too many times to count his presence had been demanded in some private office only to find the official had no connection with the court on two occasions the men involved had brought their mistresses or children to observe as they fussed with permissions and the allocation of his small income the meeting itself was irrelevant they had just wanted to parade the chin emperor the son of heaven himself for their wideeyed dependents xuan was surprised when the small group of officials did not stop at the usual branching corridors the apartments of more important men lay beyond and xuan controlled the first stirring of excitement as they went further and further still more than one door was open as dedicated scholars and bureaucrats laboured inside peering out at the footsteps they heard xuan took a grip on his hopes they had been dashed too many times to expect his letters to have been answered at last though he still wrote every day despite his forced calm he felt his heart beat faster as the bowing servants brought him to the door of the man who administered the examinations for almost all the posts in hangzhou sung kim had taken the name of the royal house as his own though xuan suspected he had been born a commoner as one who controlled the funds xuan was given to maintain his small household sung kim had received many of his letters over the years not a single one had been answered the servants announced him and then stood back with their heads bowed xuan walked into the room pleasantly surprised to see how it opened up before him the administrator lived in luxury amidst sculpture and art of better than average taste xuan smiled to himself at the thought of complimenting sung kim in such a way he could force the odious little man to make him a present of whatever he admired but it was just a spiteful thought his upbringing would not allow him to be rude despite his circumstances while other servants trotted away to announce his arrival xuan wandered from one painting to another taking care not to linger too long on each time was something he had in abundance and he knew sung kim would make him wait to his intense surprise sung kim himself came out of the inner rooms almost immediately xuan inclined his head and accepted an equally brief bow from the other man he endured the polite observances with his usual restraint showing no sign of his mounting impatience at last he was guided into the inner rooms and tea was brought for him xuan settled himself comfortably waiting i have extraordinary news son of heaven sung kim began he was a very old man with white hair and wrinkled skin but his own excitement was visible xuan raised an eyebrow as if his heart did not beat harder with every moment it was all he could do to remain silent the mongol khan is dead son of heaven sung kim went on xuan smiled then chuckled confounding the older man is that all he said bitterly i thoughti must offer my apologies son of heaven i thought the news would bring you great joy does it not signal the end of your time of exile sung kim shook his head in confusion and tried again your enemy is dead your majesty the khan has fallen i meant no offence sung kim i have outlived two mongol khans and that is indeed welcome news theni do not understand does it not fill your heart with happiness xuan sipped the tea which was excellent you do not know them as i do he said they will not mourn the khan instead they will raise one of his sons and they will look for new enemies one day sung kim they will come here to this city perhaps i will still be a prisoner here when that time comes perhaps i will stare down from these very corridors as they bring their armies to the city walls please son of heaven you are the guest of the emperor never a prisoner you must not say such things xuan grimaced and set his cup down gently a guest can walk away when he pleases a guest can ride without guards let us be honest with one another sung kim i am sorry your majesty i had hoped to bring you joy not sadness be assured you have done both today now unless you wish to discuss my written requests i will return to my rooms the administrator bowed his head i cannot grant your desire to see your soldiers son of heaven such things are far beyond my small powers xuan rose from his seat very well but when the new khan comes they will be needed strong and fit you will need every man then i think it was sung kims turn to smile the city of hangzhou was ancient and powerful it lay far from the border with the old chin lands the idea of an army ever coming close enough to cause concern was amusing historical note the third son of genghis was great khan for just twelve years from ad to at a time when the mongols were sweeping west into europe ogedais death would be one of the crucial turning points of history western europe could not have stood against them the medieval castles there were no more daunting than walled chin cities and in the field the mongol style of faststriking tactical warfare would have been practically unstoppable it is no exaggeration to say the future of the west changed when ogedais heart failed we know ogedai was still young and died only fourteen years after his father we do not know why he built karakorum the son of a khan who not only despised cities but who had spent his entire life demonstrating how weak a defence they actually were yet ogedai built a city as the throne of empire contemporary descriptions of it do survive for example the words of a christian friar william of rubruk the silver tree was historical fact as was it having shamanist temples islamic mosques and at least one nestorian christian church it is hard to explain why ogedai would build such a thing at all one explanation that fits the facts is that he was a little like cecil rhodes a man whose heart pain began as young as sixteen before a heart attack finally killed rhodes at fortyeight he had built an empire for himself in africa a man driven to leave a mark always knowing that he had little time to do it ogedai may well have had the same sense of urgency the second question is why he might build a city so influenced by those of the chin cities he had often seen burn there the influence of yao shu can be seen though yao shu was a real adviser to ogedai the character i have rendered is in fact an amalgam of two chinese buddhists from the period i have not yet finished his tale worried by the khans heavy drinking yao shu showed ogedai how wine corroded an iron bottle it is also true that ogedai agreed to halve the number of wine cups he drank each day only to have cups made that were twice the size buddhist advisers brought a sense of chinese civilisation to the mongol court subtly influencing each of the khans as a result cities would one day open their gates to kublai as they never would have to his grandfather the three games of men naadam in mongolia are wrestling archery and horse racing the naadam festival is indeed much older than the time of genghis though in previous centuries it was also a chance for tribes to horsetrade mix bloodlines gamble and be told the future in divinations the modern naadam festival has women taking part in archery and the races though not wrestling which is still the mens sole preserve the description of the archery wall is accurate shots are taken from around a hundred paces and archers compete in groups of ten the smallest unit of genghis army each archer has four arrows and rather than judge individual shots they must hit a certain number of targets to succeed it is interesting that the archery tradition is one of teams bearing in mind the martial nature of the sport and the vital role it played in the armies of genghis khan the horse races of the festival which take place over three days are all endurance races in comparison to the west endurance was the quality that made the khans armies mobile and again it is interesting to see how that has remained the preeminent quality of equine greatness rather than a burst of speed from a horse bred and built like a greyhound i have taken a small liberty with history in including a foot race theres no record of it but it would have been a possibility i have no doubt other events have come and gone before the current form just as the modern olympics used to include a tugofwar competition from to won twice by britain it is sometimes believed that genghis left a will if such a document ever existed it has not survived if it was an oral will we do not know if it was given at the point of death or long before some versions of history have genghis dying almost instantly while others have him lingering for days after a fall or a wound where he could easily have arranged his own legacy either way it is generally accepted that it was genghis khans desire to have chagatai inherit a vast khanate while tolui received the mongol homeland as the official heir ogedai inherited the northern chin territories and whatever else he could win for himself i have put that distribution in ogedais hands in part because it would have been his final choice no matter what his father intended if ogedai had executed chagatai then the bloodlines of that part of the world would have been very different down to the present day instead chagatai khan died just a few months after ogedai in the exact manner of his death is unknown though the incredibly fortuitous timing allowed me to write and indeed suspect that he was killed the earliest written formula for gunpowder is chinese from around it was certainly used in siege warfare during the period of ogedais khanate handheld cannon of the sort i have described have been found dating back to kublai khans period one of the earliest recorded uses was by the mongols in the middle east in but they certainly went back further than that they were the cutting edge of military technology for the period effectively a hugely powerful hand weapon that fired stones or even a metal ball iron vessels filled with gunpowder and lit with a fuse would have made effective shrapnel grenades we do know the mongols encountered them first against the chin and sung and were quick to adopt such terrifying weapons in fact it was the vast territory covered by mongol armies that led to the proliferation of such weapons across the land mass that said the formula for chinese gunpowder was poor in saltpetre so lacked some of the explosive punch we associate with the material a rush of flame would have been more common with batches of the mixture varying enormously between makers regions and periods the extraordinary incident that led to the death of tolui is from the secret history of the mongols on his only campaign in northern china ogedai fell ill and lost the use of mouth and tongue a massive stroke or perhaps grand mal epilepsy mongol shamans and soothsayers made divinations assuming that the spirits of the chin were attacking the khan they asked to be shown the correct sacrifice and in response ogedai spasmed and suffered violent cramps using that response they asked if a kinsman was needed ogedai then came round and drank water asking to be told what had happened prince tolui did not have to be asked the man who was father to kublai and mongke both of whom would be khans willingly gave his life to save his brother on the subject of slaughtering horses i took the opportunity to speak to slaughtermen who had killed many hundreds of elderly horses over the years in the preparation of kosher or halal meat the animal needs to remain alive for the heart to pump out the blood they begin by cutting the throat the man i spoke to wanted a much faster kill so he preferred an initial thrust to the heart then drew the blade across the throat between and per cent of a horses bodyweight will be blood its a rough estimate but in a mongolian pony that would be around forty pints of blood as the secret history records tolui took poison rather than die by the blade but i changed his ending the bloody sacrifice of animals was part of the attempt to save ogedai and the two events seemed to fit together his son mongke was certainly present though no exchange is recorded between them a quick note on the subject of distances by ogedais time a network of way stations had been set up wherever mongol influence extended set miles apart on major roads they were well furnished with regular changes of horses an urgent message could be taken miles in a day if necessary by the same man the riders wore belts of bells so the way stations could hear them coming and have water food and a fresh mount waiting a thousand miles in ten days was not just possible but commonplace such lines of communication made the armies of the khans modern in a sense that no other force of the century could manage the shaman mohrol is fictional though of course the khan would have had diviners and shamans in mongolia it remains the case that an extra finger will mean a child is chosen to be a shaman they do not hunt or fish and are supported by the tribes to be magic and medicineworkers as well as keepers of history and tradition they are men of power still the ancient buddhas of bamiyan in afghanistan did exist one was around feet high the other feet they were dynamited by the islamic taliban in there are still legends of a third sleeping buddha in the hills there tsubodais campaign against the west lasted from around to over that time he encountered russians bulgars and hungarian magyars took buda and pest attacked poland and modernday serbia and sent scouts as far as northern italy in just one winter over a period of two months his tumans took twelve walled russian cities they had learned the use of catapults ballistae even a form of wallsmashing trebuchet in their wars against northern china russia had nothing capable of stopping the war machine of the mongols it is true that tsubodai preferred to campaign in winter and used the frozen rivers as a network of roads through the cities like genghis before him he and his generals were ruthless with fallen enemies slaughtering vast populations his one worry seems to have been the wide battlefront making it easy to flank or encircle his tumans time and again he sent tumans out in sweeps into poland hungary or bulgaria to clear the way of possible enemies the legendary french knights templar said at the time that there was no army between tsubodai and france that could stop him yet even the death of ogedai might not have halted tsubodai had he not had the princes of the nation with him batu jochis son was there as was guyuk ogedais son ogedais grandson kaidu was also present it was he who raided into poland with baidur and fought the extraordinary battle of liegnitz preventing the polish armies flanking the main attack against hungary i have not used kaidu as a character here for fear of the russian novel problem where every page brings new characters until the reader loses track i did include mongke in the campaign he was there for most of it including kiev kublai was not present as one of the princes he remained in karakorum studying buddhism and establishing the chinese influence that would dominate his adult life jebe too was absent for that campaign though i have kept him as a minor character the secret history does not tell his ending unfortunately as with kachiun and khasar a once great leader simply slipped from the pages of history and was lost early death was common in those days of course and they almost certainly met their end through disease or injury a death so ordinary as to be ignored by chroniclers temuge did make a final rash attempt to become khan after the death of ogedai it was unsuccessful and he was executed interestingly sorhatani was given her husbands rights and titles on his death in that one decision she instantly became the most powerful woman in the khanate and in the world at that time three of her four sons would become khan through her influence and training she supported ogedai as khan and was consulted by him as the empire grew and became established the one time she refused his wishes was when he offered to marry her to his son guyuk she turned the offer down preferring to concentrate her considerable energies on her sons history confirms her wisdom in that matter when tsubodais tumans entered hungary over the carpathian mountains he faced the armies of the hungarian king bela iv that monarch had accepted cuman refugees from russia a turkic people similar to the mongols in many ways in exchange for their conversion to christianity they were given a brief sanctuary their leader koten was baptised and his daughter married king belas son to seal the agreement in exchange king bela was able to field an army of nomadic horsemen in addition to his own forces he also expected help from the holy roman emperor frederick ii who was king of what is now germany italy sicily cyprus and jerusalem or perhaps pope gregory ix however they were locked in their own struggle for power with the pope excommunicating frederick ii and even declaring him the antichrist as a result the king of hungary was left to resist the mongol invasion almost without support he did have forces from archduke frederick of austria but they withdrew after the death of koten in a riot the cumans also left it is true that king bela sent bloody swords throughout his kingdom to raise the people there is a record of batus missive to the king demanding that the russian cumans and their leader koten be handed over batus message was stark and simple word has come to me that you have taken the cumans our servants under your protection cease harbouring them or you will make of me an enemy because of them they who have no houses and dwell in tents will find it easy to escape but you who dwell in houses within towns how can you escape me it is interesting to note that the demand was sent in batus name as a senior prince and son to jochi the firstborn of genghis he was in nominal command of the golden horde as they were known yet it was tsubodai who led them strategically and tactically it was a complex relationship and it came to a head when news of ogedais death finally reached them budapest is around four and a half thousand miles west of karakorum in the same land mass tsubodais extraordinary campaign took the mongol tumans right across kazakhstan russia to moscow and kiev romania hungary poland lithuania eastern prussia and croatia they were knocking on the door of austria when ogedai died it was in fact the french king louis ix who fixed a confusing name for the mongols in european minds as he prepared his armies to march he told his wife that his soldiers would send the tartars to hell or the tartars would send them to heaven he deliberately punned on the latin word for hell tartarus and the erroneous name tartar stuck for centuries as a result i have omitted a detailed description of the battle of liegnitz which took place as the climax of baidurs sweep through poland it is the nature of such a sweep that there are many battles against varied opponents but there is a limit to how many can be squeezed into a novel even one about the mongols in history liegnitz is one of the few really wellknown mongol battles omitting it is the equivalent of writing about nelson without mentioning the nile for the sake of the plot flow however i think it was the right decision at liegnitz baidur used the feigned retreat but he added the innovation of tar barrels that sent white smoke across the battlefield this simple device prevented one half of a polish army seeing what was happening to the other half it could easily have been the climax of this book but the other wellknown battle is sajo river and that was tsubodais triumph tsubodais final recorded battle combined not only a night attack and flanking manoeuvre not only the masterful use of terrain in the way he made the river work for him but also the now ancient trick of leaving a path for the enemy to escape only to fall on him as he does tsubodai led three tumans across a ford to the south of the encamped hungarian armies sending batu against the left flank at dawn while the rest galloped further to hit the hungarian rear king bela was forced to take refuge in his night camp while the mongols caused chaos with firecrackers burning tar in barrels and shooting random arrows they had gone from the prey to the hunter and made the most of it in the midst of the chaos king belas men saw a ridge of ground running west that lay out of sight of the mongols he tested the escape route by sending out a small number watching as they rode to safety as the day wore on the king tried to send his entire army from the camp in their panic they lost formation and were strung out over miles it was at that point that tsubodais men attacked the column he had scouted the ground he knew the ridge and had deliberately left the route open to trap them depending on the source the mongol tumans slaughtered of the hungarian army ending it as an entity for a generation or more king bela escaped the slaughter and fled to austria when the mongols left he went on to rebuild hungary from ruins he is still honoured as one of hungarys great kings despite his disastrous encounter with tsubodai in many ways it was a fitting end to tsubodais military career though of course he did not see it like that hungary was in ruins when the news came of ogedais death and everything changed the brilliant tactical manoeuvres of liegnitz and the sajo river were rendered void by the mongol withdrawal they are rarely taught outside military schools in part because they did not lead on to conquest politics intruded on tsubodais ambitions if it had not all history would have changed there are not many moments in history when the death of a single man changed the entire world ogedais death was one such moment if he had lived there would have been no elizabethan age no british empire no renaissance perhaps no industrial revolution in such circumstances this book could very well have been written in mongolian or chinese
