jim butcher furies of calderon codex alera the course of history is determined not by battles by sieges or usurpations but by the actions of the individual the strongest city the largest army is at its most basic level a collection of individuals their decisions their passions their foolishness and their dreams shape the years to come if there is any lesson to be learned from history it is that all too often the fate of armies of cities of entire realms rests upon the actions of one person in that dire moment of uncertainty that persons decision good or bad right or wrong big or small can unwittingly change the world but history can be quite the slattern one never knows who that person is where he might be or what decision he might make it is almost enough to make me believe in destiny from the writings of gaius primus first lord of albra prologue please tavi wheedled the girl in the predawn darkness outside the steadholts kitchen just this one little favor i dont know said the boy theres so much work today she leaned in closer to him and the boy felt her slender body mold against his soft and lowerscented and delightful she pressed her mouth to his cheek in a slow kiss and whispered in his ear id be very grateful well the boy said im not sure if um she kissed his cheek again and whispered please his heart pounded more quickly and his knees felt weak all right ill do it chapter amara rode atop the swaying back of the towering old gargant bull going over the plan in her head the morning sun shone down on her taking the chill out of the misty air and warming the dark wool of her skirts behind her the axles of the cart squeaked and groaned beneath their loads the slave collar she wore had begun to chafe her skin and she made an irritated mental note to wear one for a few days in order to grow used to it before the next mission assuming she survived this one of course a tremor of nervous fear ran down her spine and made her shoulders tighten amara took a deep breath and blew it out again closing her eyes for a moment and blocking out every thought except for the sensations around her sunlight on her face swaying of the pungent gargants long strides creaking of the carts axles nervous asked the man walking beside the gargant a goad dangled from his hand but he hadnt lifted it in the entire trip he managed the beast with the lead straps alone though his head barely came to the old bulls brownfurred thigh he wore the plain clothes of a peddler brown leggings sturdy sandals with a padded jacket over his shirt dark green on homespun a long cape tattered green without embroidery had been cast over one shoulder as the sun rose higher no amara lied she opened her eyes again staring ahead fidelias chuckled liar its not a brainless plan it might work amara shot her teacher a wary glance but you have a suggestion in your graduation exercise fidelias asked crows no i wouldnt dream of it academ it would cheapen your performance amara licked her lips but you think that theres something i should know fidelias gave her a perfectly guileless look i did have a few questions questions amara said were going to be there in a few moments i can ask them when we arrive if you prefer if you werent my patriserus i would find you an impossible man amara sighed thats sweet of you to say fidelias replied youve come a long way since your first term at the academy you were so shocked when you found out that the cursors did more than deliver missives you love telling that story even though you know i hate it no fidelias said with a grin i love telling that story because i know you hate it she looked down at him archly this is why the cursor legate keeps sending you away on missions i think its a part of my charm fidelias agreed now then my first concern question amara corrected question he allowed is with our cover story what question armies need iron youre an ore smuggler and im your slave you heard there was a market out this way and you came to see what money could be made ah said fidelias and what do i tell them when they ask where i got the ore it isnt just found by the roadside you know youre a cursor callidus youre creative im sure youll think of something fidelias chuckled youve learned delegating skills at least so we approach this renegade legion with our precious ore he nodded back toward the squeaking cart whats to stop them from simply taking it youre the harbinger of a smuggling network representing several interests in the business your trip is being watched and if the results are good others might be willing to bring supplies as well thats what i dont understand fidelias said his expression innocent if this is indeed a renegade legion as rumors say under the command of one of the high lords in preparation for overthrowing the crownarent they going to object to any word about them getting out good bad or indifferent yes amara said she glanced down at him which works in our favor you see if you dont return from this little jaunt word is going to spread all around alera about this encampment inevitable since word would get out anyway one can hardly keep an entire legion secret for long its our best shot amara said can you think of anything better we sneak in close furycraft ourselves into the camp obtain evidence and then run like the crows were after us oh amara said i considered it i decided it was too brainless and predictable it has the advantage of simplicity fidelias pointed out we recover the information give solid evidence to the crown and let the first lord launch a more comprehensive antisedition campaign yes thats simpler but once whoever is running this camp knows that they have been observed by the cursors they will simply disperse and move their operations elsewhere the crown will simply spend money and effort and lives to pin them down againand even then whoever is putting out the money to field their own army might simply get away fidelias glanced up at her and let out a low whistle so you want to get in and out undetected get word to the crown andthen what lead a few cohorts of knights aeris back down here and crush them where they lie amara said take prisoners have them testify against their backers and wrap it all up right here ambitious he commented very ambitious very dangerous too if they catch on to us theyll kill us and its reasonable to expect that theyll have knights as welland that theyll be on the lookout for a cursor or two thats why we dont get caught amara said we play the poor greedy smuggler and his slave haggle for all the money we can get from them and leave and keep the money fidelias frowned on general principle i like any mission that involves a profit but amaratheres a lot that could go wrong with this one we are the first lords messengers are we not his eyes and ears dont quote the codex at me fidelias snapped annoyed i was a cursor before your mother and father had called their first furies dont think that because the first lord has taken a shine to you that you know better than i do you dont think its worth the risk i think theres a lot you dont know fidelias said and he looked very old for some reason uncertain let me handle this amara ill go inside you stay here and ill pick you up on the way out theres no reason to risk both of us no she said in the first place this is my mission to run in the second you will need your full attention to play your role ill be able to make observationsespecially from up here she slapped the gargants broad back and the bull snorted up a small whirlwind of trail dust in response ill also be able to watch our backs if i get the impression that theyre onto us we can get out of there fidelias muttered i thought wed just use this guise to pose as travelers get close and slip into the camp after dark when no one else is coming in and when were certain to arouse suspicion if were seen he blew out a breath all right he said all right well do it your way but youre gambling yourself with the crows amaras stomach fluttered again and she pressed a hand to it trying to will the fear away it didnt leave no she said im gambling both of us though the gargants plodding steps seemed slow each covered many strides of a man the great beasts thickclawed feet ate the miles though it stripped the bushes and trees of leaves along the way adding to the layers of blubbery fat beneath its hide if allowed the humpbacked beast would wander into the richest forage and graze but fidelias handled it with a sure and calm hand keeping the beast moving along the road while he marched at the quickstep beside it a mile more by amaras estimation and they had come within picket distance of the insurgent legions camp she tried to remind herself of her role that of a bored slave sleepy and tired from days of travelbut it was all she could do to keep the mounting tension from rising in her shoulders and back what if the legion turned out to be nothing more than rumor and her intelligence gathering mission so carefully outlined and planned turned out to be a costly waste of time would the first lord think less of her would the other cursors it would be a paltry introduction into the ranks indeed if she stepped forth from the academy and straight into a monumental blunder her anxiety grew like bands of iron stretching across her shoulders and back and her head started to pound from the tension and the glare of the sun had they made a wrong turn the old trail they followed seemed too wellworn to be an abandoned lumber track but she could be wrong wouldnt they be seeing the smoke of a legions fires wouldnt they hear something by now if they were as close as she suspected amara was on the verge of leaning down to call to fidelias to ask his advice when a man in dark tunic and leggings and a gleaming breastplate and helmet melted into view beneath the shadows of a tree on the road no more than ten strides in front of them he appeared without a warning of any kind without a flicker of movementfurycrafting involved then and a fairly skilled woodworking at that he was a giant of a man nearly seven feet tall and he bore a heavy blade at his side he lifted one gloved hand and said his tone bored distant halt fidelias clucked to the gargant bull slowing the beast to a stop after several steps the wagon creaked and groaned settling onto its wheels beneath the weight of the ore good morning to you master fidelias called his voice oozing nervous obsequious good cheer the senior cursor doffed his hat and clutched it in his slightly trembling hands and how are you doing on this fine autumn morn youre on the wrong trail said the dark giant his tone was dull almost sleepy but he laid a hand on the hilt of his weapon this land is not friendly to travelers turn around yes master of course we will master fidelias simpered i am but a humble peddler transporting his cargo in the vain hope of finding a ready market i have no desire for trouble good master only for the chance to attempt to recoup my losses on this most excellent but lamentably illtimed bounty of fidelias rolled his eyes skyward and dragged one foot through the dust of the trail iron he shot the giant a sly smile but as you wish good master ill be on my way the dark man stepped forward and said hold merchant fidelias glanced back at him master he asked can i perhaps interest you in a purchase the dark man shrugged he stopped a few feet from fidelias and asked how much ore nearly a ton good master as you can see my poor gargant is all but done in the man grunted eyeing the beast and swept his gaze up it to amara who is this my slave good master fidelias said his voice took on a cringing wheedling tone shes for sale if you like the look of her master a hard worker skilled at weaving and cookingand more than capable of giving a man an unforgettable nights pleasure at two lions shes surely a bargain the man snorted your hard worker rides while you walk merchant it would have been smarter for you to travel alone he sniffed and shes as skinny as a boy take your beast and follow me you wish to buy master the soldier gave him a look and said i didnt ask you merchant follow me fidelias stared at the soldier and then swallowed an almost audible gulp aye aye master well be only a pace or three behind you come on old boy he picked up the gargants lead straps in shaking fingers and stirred the great beast into motion again the soldier grunted and turned to start walking back down the road he let out a sharp whistle and a dozen men armed with bows appeared from the shadows and brush on the sides of the trail just as he had a moment before keep the men here until i return the man said stop anyone from coming past yes sir one of the men said amara focused on that one the men all wore the same outfits black tunics and breeches with surcoats of dark green and dark brown the speaker in addition wore a black sash around his waistas the first soldier had amara checked around but none of the other men wore a sashonly those two she made a mental note of it knights possibly one of them had to have been a strong woodcrafter to have hidden so many men so thoroughly crows she thought what if this rebel legion turns out to have a full contingent of knights to go with it with that many men that many powerful furycrafters they could he a threat to any city in alera and as a corollary it would mean that the legion had powerful backing any furycrafter strong enough to be a knight could command virtually what price he wished for his services they could not be casually bought by any disgruntled merchant set to convince his lord or high lord to lower taxes only the nobility could afford the cost of hiring a few knights let alone a contingent of them amara shivered if one of the high lords was preparing to turn against the first lord then there were dark days ahead indeed she looked down at fidelias and he glanced up at her his face troubled she thought she could see the reflection of her own thoughts and fears there in his eyes she wanted to talk to fidelias to ask him for his thoughts on the matter but she couldnt break her role now amara ground her teeth and dug her fingers into the pad of the gargants riding saddle and tried to calm herself again while the soldier led them to the camp amara kept her eyes open as the gargants plodding steps brought them around a bend in the trail and over a small hill into the valley beyond and behind it there the camp spread out before them great furies she thought it looks like a city her mind took down details as she stared the camp had been constructed along standard legion lines a stakewall and ditch fortification built in a huge square surrounding the soldiers encampment and stores tents of white fabric had been erected within row after row of them too many for easy counting laid out in neat precise rows two gates opposite one another led into the camp the tents and leantos of the camps followers spread out around it in ragged disarray like flies buzzing around a sleeping beast people were everywhere on a practice field beside the camp entire cohorts of men were drilling in formation combat and maneuvers ordered about by bawling centurions or men in black sashes mounted on horseback elsewhere archers riddled distant targets with their arrows while furymasters drilled other recruits in the application of their basic warcraftings women moved among the camp as wellwashing clothes at a stream that passed by mending uniforms tending fires or simply enjoying the morning sunlight amara saw a couple of women wearing sashes of black on horseback riding toward the practice field dogs wandered about the camp and set up a tinny racket of barking upon scenting the gargant as it came over the hill to one side of the camp not far from the stream men and women had established what looked like a small market vendors hawking wares from makeshift stalls and spreading them upon blankets on the ground youre here between breakfast and lunch said the soldier or id offer you some food perhaps well take lunch with you master fidelias said perhaps the soldier stopped and looked up at amara studying her with quiet hard eyes get her down ill send out a groom or two to care for your beast no insisted fidelias ill be keeping my goods with me the soldier grunted theres horses at the camp and theyll go mad if they smell this thing it stays here then i stay here insisted fidelias no the slave then he said she can stay here with the beast and keep him quiet hed spook if strange hands cared for him the soldier squinted at him hard and suspicious what are you up to old man up to im protecting my interests master as any merchant would you are in our camp your interests are no longer an issue are they the soldier put no particular emphasis on his words but he laid one hand on the hilt of his sword fidelias drew himself up voice shocked and outraged you wouldnt dare the soldier smiled his smile was hard fidelias licked his lips then shot a glance up at amara she thought she saw something in it some kind of warning but he only said girl get down amara slid down off of the back of the beast using the leather straps to help lower herself down its flanks fidelias clucked to it and jerked down on its straps and the gargant settled lazily to earth with a contented rumble that shook the ground nearby it leaned its great head over tore up a mouthful of grass and began chewing on it huge eyes halfclosed follow me the soldier said you too slave if either of you gets more than three strides away from me ill kill you both do you understand i understand said fidelias i understand master echoed amara keeping her eyes lowered they followed the soldier then and crossed the stream at a shallow ford the water was cold and flowed quickly over amaras ankles she shivered gooseflesh racing up and down her legs and arms but kept pace with fidelias and the soldier her mentor dropped back beside her and murmured very low did you see how many tents she jerked her head in a nod close well kept and neat too this isnt a gang of malcontent steadholders professional military amara nodded and whispered serious money behind them is it enough for the first lord to bring it to the council an accusation without anyone to accuse fidelias grimaced and shook his head no we have to have something that incriminates someone behind it doesnt have to be ironclad but we need something tangible do you recognize our escort fidelias shot her a look why do you amara shook her head im not sure something about him seems familiar the other nodded they call him the sword amara felt her eyes widen aldrick ex gladius are you sure ive seen him in the capital in the past i saw his duel with araris valerian amara glanced up at the man ahead of them careful to keep her voice down hes supposed to be the greatest swordsman alive yes said fidelias he is then he cuffed her along the head and said loud enough for aldrick to hear keep your lazy mouth shut ill feed you when i please and not a second before not another word they walked in silence then into the camp aldrick led them through the camps gate and down the main path dividing the camp in half he turned left and led them to what amara knew would be in an aleran legions camp the commanders tent a large tent sat there and two legionares stood outside it breastplates gleaming armed with spears in their hands and swords at their belts aldrik nodded to one of them and went inside he appeared a moment later and said to fidelias you merchant come inside the commander wants to speak to you fidelias stepped forward and amara moved to follow him aldrick put a hand on fideliass chest and said just you not the slave fidelias blinked you expect me to just leave her out here good master it could be dangerous he shot amara a glance which she did not miss a warning to leave a pretty young girl in a camp full of soldiers aldrick said you should have thought of that before you came here they wont kill her get inside fidelias looked back at her and licked his lips then he stepped forward into the tent aldrick looked at amara for a moment his eyes distant cool then he stepped back inside a moment later he came back to the opening of the tent dragging a girl with him she was petite even emaciated and her clothes hung off of her like a scarecrows the collar around her neck even on its smallest sizing hung loosely her brown hair looked dry brittle as hay and she had dust on her skirts though her feet were clean enough aldrick shoved the girl out unceremoniously and said business then he tugged the flap of the tent closed and went back inside the girl tumbled to the ground along with a woven basket and landed with a soft cry in a tangle of basket and skirts and frizzy hair amara knelt down beside the girl and asked are you all right oh fine the girl snapped she rose shakily to her feet and kicked a puff of dust at the tent with her toe bastard she muttered here i am trying to clean things up for him and he throws me around like a sack of meal her eyes sparkled with defiance and she turned to amara im odiana amara she responded feeling her mouth tug up at the corners she glanced around her licking her lips and thought for a moment she needed to see more of the camp try to find something she could take with her odiana is there any place to get a drink around here we were traveling for hours and im parched the girl tossed her frizzy hair over one shoulder and sniffed at the commanders tent whats your pleasure theres some cheap beer but its mostly water optionally we could get a drink of water and if none of that suits you i think theres some water ill have the water amara said a dry wit odiana noted she hooked the handle of the basket over the crook of her arm and said this way then she turned and walked with a kind of bristling crackling energy through the camp toward the opposite gate amara caught up with her eyes flicking around a troop of soldiers came jogging by boots striking the ground in rhythm and the two girls had to skip back between two tents to let them pass odiana sniffed soldiers crows take them all i am sick to death of soldiers have you been here long amara asked since just after the new year the other said but there are rumors that well be leaving soon amaras heart pounded going where odiana looked at her with an amused smile youve not been around soldiers much have you it doesnt matter where you go this she gestured broadly at the camp never changes its the same if youre down by the ocean or up at the wall and the men never change the sky never changes and the earth doesnt change enough to notice this is it but still you get to go to new places see new things only new stains on uniforms said odiana the soldiers passed and the girls stepped out onto the track again but ive heard further north and maybe east a ways toward aquitaine odiana shrugged is that whats that way she walked along and opened the basket as they neared the stream rummaging around inside here she said hold these she thrust a pair of dirty plates into amaras arms we can wash them while were here crows soldiers are so messy but at least the legionares keep their tents clean she fished out a bone and threw it toward a passing dog then an apple core from which she took a judicious nibble before wrinkling up her nose and tossing it into the stream next came a piece of paper which she hardly glanced at before flicking it aside amara turned and stomped the paper flat with her foot before the wind could catch it then she bent over and picked it up what asked odiana what are you doing amara picked up the paper well um it hardly seems like a good idea to just toss it on the ground if youre trying to clean up if it isnt in the camp no one will care odiana said she tilted her head to one side watching as amara unfolded the paper and studied the writing inside you can read the slave asked some said amara distracted she read the note and her hands started shaking as she did legion commander second legion you are hereby ordered to strike camp and make for the rendezvous point you should arrive no later than the tenth full moon of the year in preparation for winter maintain drilling until you march and dispatch the men in the usual manner there was more but amara skipped over it barely skimming to see what was at the bottom atticus quentin high lord of attica amaras breath caught in her throat her heart racing her fears were true insurrection rebellion war what does it say asked odiana she shoved another plate into amaras hands and said here put these in the stream it says amara fumbled with the plates moving to the waters edge and leaning down to drop them in it uh i cant really read it she fumbled with the note sliding it away into one of her shoes mind racing with the implications you know said odiana voice bright and cheerful i think youre lying you dont often run into literate slaves who ask questions about troop movements and who are also politically learned enough to realize the wider implications of one little note thats the kind of thing you expect from oh i dont know her voice dropped and she almost purred one of the cursori amara stiffened and turned just in time to eaten odianas bare keel in the chin pain flashed through her dull and hot the wastedseeming girl had far more strength than amara would have credited to her and the blow stunned amara and sent her tumbling back into the stream she stood up out of it shaking water from her face and eyes and drawing in a breath to cry out to her furiesbut water rushed down into her mouth and nose as she inhaled and she began choking amaras heart raced with sudden panic and she reached up to her faceonly to find it coated to above the nose with a thin layer of water she scraped at it with her fingers but it didnt flow down and she couldnt clear it away she struggled and choked but only more water rushed in coating her like a layer of oil she couldnt breathe the world began to glaze over with darkness and she grew dizzy the letter she had to get the letter out back to the first lord the proof he would need she made it to the bank before the water filling her lungs made her collapse she writhed smothering on dry land and found herself staring at odianas bare clean feet amara looked up as the wasted slave girl stared down at her a gentle smile on her face you neednt worry love the girl said and she began to change her sunken cheeks filled out the gangling limbs gained rondure beauty hips and breasts began to curve in enticing lines filling out the clothes she wore her hair grew a bit longer lustrous darker and she shook it out with a little laugh before kneeling down next to amara odiana reached out and stroked fingers through amaras damp hair you neednt worry she repeated we arent going to kill you we need you calmly she removed a black sash from the basket and tied it around her waist but you cursori can be a slippery breed well take no chances just go to sleep amara it will be so much easier and then i can send all the water back and let you breathe again amara struggled and fought for simple breath but none came darkness gathered points of light appearing before her eyes she clutched at odiana but her fingers had gone nerveless and weak the last thing she saw was the beautiful watercrafter leaning down to place a gentle kiss upon her forehead sleep she whispered sleep and then amara sank down into the blackness chapter amara woke buried to her armpits in the earth loose dirt had been piled over her arms and into her hair her face felt thick heavy and after a moment she realized that her entire head had been liberally smeared with mud she struggled to gather her wits through a pounding headache piecing together fragments of memories and perceptions until with a dizzying rush of clarity she remembered where she was and what had happened to her her heart started to thud hard in her chest and fear made her buried limbs feel cold she opened her eyes and bits of dirt fell into them so that she had to blink quickly tears formed to wash the dirt out after a few moments she was able to see she was in a tent the commanders tent in the camp she guessed light poured into it through a gap in the flap that served as a door leaving the tents interior described in terms of dimness shadow and dark you awake yet croaked a voice from behind her she turned her head trying to look she could barely see fidelias out of the corner of her eye but he was there hanging in a cage of iron bars by straps around his shoulders and outstretched arms leaving his feet dangling a good ten inches off of the floor he had a swelling bruise on his face and his lip had been split and was crusted with dry blood are you all right amara whispered fine apart from being beaten captured and scheduled for torture and interrogation youre the one who should be worried amara swallowed why me i think this can safely be considered a failing mark in your graduation exercise amara felt her mouth curve into a smile despite the circumstances we have to escape fidelias tried to smile the effort split his lip some more and fresh blood welled extra creditbut im afraid you wont get the chance to collect on it these people know what theyre doing amara tried to move but she couldnt struggle up out of the earth she barely succeeded in freeing her arms enough to move themand even so they were thickly encrusted with dirt cirrus she whispered sending her thoughts out toward her fury cirrus come pull me out nothing happened she tried again and again her wind fury never responded the dirt she said finally and closed her eyes earth to counter air cirrus cant hear me yes fidelias confirmed nor can etan or vamma hear me he stretched his toes toward the ground but could not reach then he banged his foot against the iron bars of his cage then well have to think our way out fidelias closed his eyes and let out a slow breath then he said gently weve lost amara checkmate the words hit amara like hammers cold hard simple she swallowed and felt more tears rising but blinked them away with a flash of anger no she was a cursor even if she was to die shed not give the enemies of the crown the satisfaction of seeing her tears she thought for a fleeting moment of her home the small apartment back in the capital of her family not so far away in parcia by the sea more tears threatened she took up her memories one by one and shut them away into a dark quiet place in her mind she put everything in there her dreams her hopes for the future the friends shed made at the academy then she shut them away and opened her eyes again clear of tears what do they want she asked fidelias her teacher shook his head im not sure this isnt a smart move for them even with these precautions if something went wrong a cursor could slip away and be gone as long as he was still alive the flap of the tent flew open and odiana walked through it smiling her skirts swirling in the drifting dust the daylight revealed well then she said well just have to remedy that aldrik came in behind her his huge form blocking out the light completely for a moment and a pair of legionares followed him aldrick pointed at the cage and the two went to it slipped the hafts of their spears through rings at its base and lifted it between them carrying it outside fidelias shot aldrick a hard look and then licked his lips turning to amara dont be proud girl he told her as the guards started carrying him out you havent lost as long as youre alive then he was gone where are you taking him amara demanded she swept her eyes from odiana to aldrick and tried not to let her voice shake aldrick drew his sword and said the old man isnt necessary he went outside the tent a moment later there was a sound not unlike a knife sinking into a melon amara heard fidelias let out a slow breathless cry as though he had tried to hold it in keep from giving it a voice and been unable to do so then there was a rustling thump something heavy falling against the bars of the cage bury it aldrick said then he came back into the tent again sword in hand the blade shone scarlet with blood amara could only stare at the blade at her teachers blood something about it would not register on her mind it simply would not accept the fact of fideliass death the plan should have protected them it should have gotten them close and away safely again this wasnt how it was supposed to happen it had never happened like that at the academy she tried to stop the tears from coming to push fideliass face into the dark place in her mind with all the other things she cared about they only flooded over her again bursting free and as they did the tears came with them amara did not feel clever anymore or dangerous or well trained she felt cold and dirty and tired and very very alone odiana let out a soft sound of distress and came to amaras side she knelt down with a white kerchief in her hand and reached out to dab at amaras tears her fingers were gentle soft youre making clean spots love the woman said her voice gentle then she smiled as with her other hand she crushed fresh earth against amaras eyes amara let out a cry and thrust out a hand to defend herself but she wasnt able to stop the water witch she swept at her burning eyes with her dirtcrusted hands but it did her little good her fear and sorrow turned itself into furious anger and she started screaming she screamed every imprecation she could at them incoherent and she sobbed into the earth making muddy tears that burned her eyes she thrashed her arms and struggled useless against the grip of the ground she was buried in and in answer there was only silence amaras anger faded taking with it whatever strength she had left she shook with sobs that she tried to hold in that she tried to keep hidden from them she couldnt shame made her face burn and she knew that she was trembling from cold and from terror she started blinking her eyes again slowly gaining back her visionand as she did she saw odiana standing over her just out of arms reach smiling her dark eyes glittering she took a step and with one dainty bare foot she kicked more dust into amaras eyes amara twisted and turned her head away avoiding it and shot the woman a hard glare odiana hissed and drew her foot back to kick again but aldricks voice rumbled across the tent first love thats enough the watercrafter flashed amara a venomous look and retreated from her to the back of aldricks stool where she rested her hands on his shoulders in a slow caress eyes on amara the entire while the warrior sat with his sword across his lap he ran a cloth along its length and then tossed the rag onto the earth it was stained with blood ill make this simple aldrick said im going to ask you questions answer them truthfully and ill let you live lie to me or refuse to answer and youll wind up like the old man he looked up his expression entirely without emotion and focused on amara do you understand amara swallowed she nodded her head once good youve been in the palace recently the first lord was so impressed with the way you handled yourself during the fires last winter he asked you to visit him you were taken to his personal chambers and spoke with him is that true she nodded again how many guards are stationed in his inner chambers amara stared at the man her eyes widening what aldrick looked up at her he stared for a long and silent moment how many guards are stationed in the first lords inner chambers amara let out a shaking breath i cant tell you that you know i cant odianas fingers tightened on aldricks shoulders shes lying love she just doesnt want to tell you amara licked her lips and then spat mud and dirt onto the floor there was only one reason to be asking questions about the inner defenses of the palace someone wanted to take direct action against the first lord someone wanted gaius dead she swallowed and bowed her head she had to stall them somehow stall for time for the opportunity to find a way to escapeor failing that to kill herself before she could reveal the information she quailed at that thought could she do that was she strong enough before she would always have thought she was before she had been taken captured imprisoned before she had listened to fidelias die dont be proud girl fideliass last words to her came back and she felt her resolve weaken further had he been telling her to cooperate with them did he think the first lord was already doomed and she thought should she should she go along with them offer to throw in should she cast aside what she had been taught what she believed for the sake of preserving her life she couldnt attempt a ploynot with odiana there the water witch would be able to sense whether or not she was sincere damn her everything was lost she had led fidelias to his death gambled his life and lost it she had lost her own life as well she might be able to redeem one of them if she cast her lot with her captors another surge of anger flooded through her how could she even be thinking such a thing how could he have died why hadnt he seen it coming warned her amara lifted her head abruptly and blinked her eyes several times her anger evaporated why hadnt fidelias warned her indeed the trap had been too well laid they had been taken too cleanly which meant which meant that aldrick and odiana had known that they were coming and by logical extension she focused her eyes on the pair of them and swallowed lifting her chin a bit i wont tell you she said and kept her voice calm ill not tell you another thing youll die said aldrick rising ill die amara agreed you and your water witch can go to the crows she took a breath and then raised her voice honed it to a daggers edge and so can you fidelias she had a moment to take satisfaction in the flicker of surprise in aldricks eyes the simple gasp that came from odiana then she turned her eyes to the door and narrowed them keeping her face set in a cold hard mask fidelias appeared in the doorway his clothes still rumpled he had washed the bruise off the side of his face and was holding a clean white cloth to his bleeding lip i told you shed see through it he murmured do i get graded on it patriserus amara asked a plus fidelias stared at her and his mouth twisted into a grimace you will tell us what you know about the palace amara it might get ugly before its over but you will this is checkmate you dont have to make it hard on yourself traitor amara said dropping the word lightly fidelias flinched his grimace darkened to a scowl odiana looked back and forth at the sudden silence and then offered in a helpful tone shall i fetch the branding irons then fidelias turned to them and said i think weve been hamhanded enough for the moment he focused his eyes on aldrick and said give me a few moments alone to talk to her maybe i can get her to see common sense aldrick regarded fidelias with a steady gaze and then shrugged very well he said love would you odiana stepped around aldricks stool eyes focused intently upon fidelias do you intend to assist her in any way or to attempt to prevent us from discovering what we wish to know fideliass mouth quirked up at the corner and he focused on the water witch yes i do no i dont the sky is green i am seventeen years old my real name is gundred the womans eyes widened and fidelias tilted his head to one side you cant tell if im lying love im not some child ive been deceiving crafters stronger than you since before you were born his gaze flicked past odiana to aldrick its in my best interest to get her to talk in for a sheep in for a gargant the swordsman smiled a sudden show of white teeth not going to offer me your word of honor the cursors lip curled would it matter if i did id have killed you had you tried aldrick said a quarter hour no more he rose taking odiana gently by one arm and led her out of the tent the water witch shot a glare at both fidelias and amara and then left fidelias waited until they were gone then turned to amara and simply looked at her saying nothing why she asked him patriserus why would you do this to him he stared at her expression not changing i have served as a cursor for forty years i have no wife no family no home i have given my life to protecting and defending the crown carrying its messages discovering its enemies secrets he shook his head and i have watched it fall for the past fifteen years the house of gaius has been dying everyone knows it what i have done has only prolonged what is inevitable he is a good first lord he is just and as fair as anyone could want this isnt about whats right girl its about reality and the reality is that gaiuss fairness and justice has made him a great many powerful enemies the southern high lords chafe at the taxes he lays upon them to maintain the shieldwall and the shield legion they always have amara interjected it doesnt change that the taxes are necessary the shieldwall protects them as well should the icemen come down from the north they would perish with the rest of us they do not see it that way fidelias said and they are willing to do something about it the house of gaius is weakened he has no heir he has named no successor so they strike amara spat attica who else you dont need to know fidelias crouched down in front of her amara think about this ever since the princeps was killed it has been in motion the house of gaius died along with septimus the royal line was never very fertileand the death of his only child has been taken as a sign by many his time is past that doesnt make it right fidelias snarled get it out of your head child he spat on the ground face twisted in fury the blood ive shed in the crowns service the men ive killed is that any more right are their deaths vindicated because i serve this first lord or that one ive killed ive done worse in the name of protecting the crown gaius will fall nothing can stop that now and you have cast yourself in the role of what fidelias the slive that rushes in to poison the wounded buck the crow that soars down to peck at the eyes of helpless men not yet dead he looked at her eyes flat and gave her a smile empty of mirth or joy or meaning its easy to be righteous when you are young i could continue to serve the crown perhaps prolong the inevitable but how many more would die how many more would suffer and it would change nothing but the timing children like you would come in my placeand have to make the decisions i am making amara let her voice resonate with contempt thank you so much for protecting me fideliass eyes flashed make this easy on yourself amara tell us what we want to know go to the crows fidelias said without anger ive broken men and women stronger than you dont think that because youre my student i wont do it to you he knelt down to look her in the eyes amara im the same man youve known weve shared so much together please his hand reached for her grimecovered one she didnt fight his grasp think about this you could throw in with us we could help make alera bright and peaceful again she returned his gaze steady then said very quietly im already doing that patriserus i thought you were too his eyes hardened like ice brittle distant and he stood up amara lurched forward clutching at his boot fidelias she said pleading please it isnt too late we could escape now bring word back to the crown and end this threat you dont have to turn away not from gaius and she swallowed and blinked back tears and not from me there was a pained silence the die is cast fidelias said finally im sorry you couldnt be shown reason he turned jerking his leg from her grasp and walked out of the tent amara stared after him for a moment then looked down to where she had palmed the knife fidelias always kept in his boot the one he didnt think she knew about she shot a glance up to the tent and as soon as the flap fell she started attacking the dirt that pinned her she heard voices talking outside too quietly to be understood and she dug furiously dirt flew she broke it up with the knife and then frantically dug it away with her hands shoving it away making as little noise as she possibly couldbut even so her gasps for breath grew louder bit by bit as she dug finally she was able to move just a little to shove enough loose earth forward to wriggle she reached out an arm and dug the knife into the ground as hard as she could and used it as a piton to pull herself forward up a sense of elation rushed through her as she strained and wriggled and finally started snaking her way free of the confining earth her ears sang with a rush of blood and excitement aldrick snapped the water witch from outside the tent the girl amara stumbled to her feet and looked around wildly she lurched across the tent to grasp the hilt of a sword laying across a table a light gladius little longer than her own forearm and spun her body still clumsy from its imprisonment just as a dark shape filled the entry flap to the tent she lunged out at it muscles snapping together to drive the point of the sword in a vicious stroke at the heart of the figure in the doorwayaldrick steel glittered her blade met another and was swept aside she felt her point bite flesh but not much or deeply she knew she had missed amara threw herself to one side as aldricks blade rose in a swift counter and was unable to escape a cut that flashed a sudden hot agony across her upper left arm the girl rolled beneath a table and came up on the far side from aldrick the big man came into the tent and stalked her pausing across the table nice lunge he commented you pinked me no ones done that since araris valerian he smiled then that wolfish show of teeth but you arent araris valerian amara never even saw aldricks blade move there was a hissing hum and then the table fell into two separate pieces the man started toward her through them amara threw the gladius at him and saw his sword rise up to parry it aside she dove for the back of the tent now holding only the little knife and with a quick move slashed a hole in the canvas she slipped through it and heard herself whimpering in fear as she began to run she flashed a glance behind her as aldricks sword opened the back side of the tent in a pair of strokes and he came through after her guards the swordsman bellowed close the gate amara saw the gate start to swing shut and she slipped to one side ran down a row of white tents gathering up her skirts in one hand cursing that she hadnt seen fit to disguise herself as a boy so that she could have worn breeches she looked behind her aldrick still pursued but she had left him behind like a doe outstripping a big slive and she flashed a fierce smile at him caked dirt fell off of her as she ran for the nearest wall and she prayed that she could get enough of it off of her to call to cirrus a stepladder rose up to the walls defensive platform in front of her and she took it in three long strides barely touching it with her hand one of the legionares a guard on the wall turned toward her and blinked in shock at her amara made a ridge of her hand let out a shout and drove her hand into the mans throat never slowing he tumbled over backward gagging and choking and she ran past him to the wall and looked over ten feet down to the ground level and then another seven or eight feet of ditch lay beneath her a crippling fall if she didnt land correctly shoot someone shouted and an arrow hissed toward her amara threw herself to the side grasped the top of the wall with one hand and vaulted it throwing herself out into empty space cirrus she calledand felt the stirring of wind around her finally her fury pressed up against her turned her body to a proper angle and rushed down beneath her so that she landed on a cloud of wind and blowing dust rather than on the hard ground of the ditch amara gained her feet again and ran without looking back stretching covering the ground in leaps and bounds she ran to the north and the east away from the practice fields away from the stream away from where they had left the gargant and its supplies the trees had been cut to make the walls of the encampment and she had to run across nearly two hundred strides of broken stumps arrows fell around her and one struck through a hanging fold of her skirts nearly tripping her she ran on with the wind always at her back cirrus an invisible presence there amara reached the shelter of the trees and paused breathing hard looking back over her shoulder the gates of the camp swung open and two dozen men on horses long spears gleaming rode out and turned as a column straight toward her aldrick rode at their head dwarfing the riders nearest him amara turned and ran on through the trees as fast as she could the branches sighed and moaned around her leaves whispering shadows moving and changing ominously around her the furies of this forest were not friendly to herwhich made sense given the presence of at least one powerful woodcrafter she would never be able to hide from them in this forest when the trees themselves would report her position cirrus amara gasped up the wind gathered beneath her and pushed her up off the groundbut branches wove together above her moving as swiftly as human hands joining together and presented her with a solid screen amara let out a cry and crashed against that living ceiling then tumbled back to the ground cirrus softened her fall with an apologetic whisper against her ear amara looked left and right but the trees were joining branches everywhereand the forest was growing darker as the roof of leaf and bough closed overhead the beating of hooves came through the trees amara struggled back to her feet the cut on her arm pounding painfully then she started running again as the horsemen closed in behind her she couldnt have guessed how far she ran later she only remembered the threatening shadows of the trees and a burning fire in her lungs and her limbs that even cirruss aid couldnt ease terror changed to simple excitement and that transformed by degrees to a sort of exhausted lack of concern she ran until she suddenly found herself looking backand into the eyes of a mounted legionare not twenty feet away the man shouted and cast his spear at her she stumbled out of the path of the weapon and away from the horseman into a sudden flood of sunshine she looked ahead of her and found the ground sloping down for no more than three or four strides and then ending in a sheer cliff that dropped off so abruptly that she could not see how far down it went or what was at the bottom the legionare drew his sword in a rasp of steel and called to his horse the animal responded as an extension of the mans body and pounded toward her amara turned without hesitation and threw herself off of the cliff she spread her arms and screamed cirrus up the wind gathered beneath her in a rush as her fury flew to obey and she felt a sudden fierce exultation as with a screaming whistle of gale winds she shot up up into the autumn skies her wake kicking up dust devils along the ridge that cast dirt up in the face of the unfortunate legionare and set his horse to rearing and kicking in confusion she flew on up and away from the camp and paused after a time to look behind her the cliff shed leapt from looked like a toy from there several miles behind her and one below cirrus she murmured and held her hands before her the fury gusted and swirled a part of itself into that space quivering like the waves rising from a hot stone amara shaped that air with her hands bending the light until she was peering back at the cliff through her spread hands as though she stood no more than a hundred yards away she saw the hunting party emerge and aldrick dismount the legionare who had seen her described her escape and aldrick squinted up at the sky sweeping his eyes left to right amara felt a chill as the mans gaze paused directly upon her he tilted his head to the man beside him the woodcrafter knight from before and the man simply touched one of the trees amara swallowed and swept her hands back toward the rebel legions camp half a dozen forms rose up over the treetops which swayed and danced beneath the winds as though they had been the bushes in a holtwifes herb garden they turned and as one they sped toward her sun glinted off of steelarmor and weapons she knew knights aeris muttered amara she swallowed and let her hands fall normally she would have been confident of her ability to outrun them but now wounded and already exhausted in body and spirit she was not so sure amara turned and bade cirrus to bear her north and eastand prayed that the sun would set before her foes caught up to her chapter tavi slipped out of his room down the stairs and through the silence of the last shreds of night before dawn he entered the cavernous shadows of the great hall noting a faint glow of light in the kitchens beside the great hall old bitte rarely slept more than a few hours a night and tavi heard her moving through the kitchen preparing it for the coming breakfast meal he unbolted the door and left the great hall for bernardholts courtyard one of the steadholts dogs lifted his head from the empty barrel he used as a kennel and tavi stooped to scratch the old hounds ears the dog thumped his tail against the barrels interior and laid his head back down to sleep tavi drew his cloak over his shoulders against the chill of the dying autumn night and opened the postern door to leave the safety of bernardholt the door opened to reveal his uncle bernard leaning casually against the doorway dressed in leathers and a heavy green cloak for a day in the wilderness beyond the steadholts fields he lifted an apple to his mouth and crunched into it bernard was a large man with broad shoulders and the heavy muscles of hard labor his dark hair cropped close in a legion cut showed a fleck or two of grey though none such appeared in his closetrimmed beard he wore a quiver of hunting arrows at his side riding beside his legionissued sword and he carried the stave to the lightest of his bows unstrung in his hand tavi drew up short with a flutter of apprehension then he spread his hands silently conceding the victory to bernard and then offered his uncle a faint smile how did you know bernard returned the smile though there was a wary cast to it fade saw you drinking a lot of extra water last night after you came in so late and pointed it out to me its an old soldiers trick to get up early oh tavi said yes sir i counted the flocks bernard said looks like we might be a few heads short yes sir tavi said he licked his lips nervously im going to bring them in now i was under the impression that you had done so last night since you marked down a full count on the tally slate tavis cheeks grew warm and he felt glad for the dimness dodger led his ewes and their lambs out last night when i was trying to bring the south flock in i didnt want you to worry bernard shook his head tavi you know that today is important the other steadholders will be arriving for the truthfind and i dont need any distractions im sorry uncle why dont you stay here then i can find dodger and bring him back in i dont like you wandering around the valley alone tavi im going to have to eventually uncle unless you planned on following me around for the rest of my life bernard sighed your aunt would murder me tavi gritted his teeth i can do it by myself ill be careful and be back before noon thats not really the point you were supposed to bring them in last night bernard said what kept you from it tavi swallowed um id promised to do someone a favor i didnt have time to get them both done before dark bernard sighed crows tavi i really thought you had done a lot of growing up this season that you were learning to handle responsibility tavi felt suddenly sick to his stomach youre not going to gift me the sheep are you bernard said i dont begrudge you getting your fair dues i was gladi am glad to help you get started with your own flock but im not just going to throw them away if you cant show me that youll take care of them properly i cant give them to you it isnt like id be keeping them long perhaps not its the principle of the thing lad nothing comes free but uncle tavi protested its my only chance to make something of myself bernard grunted then you probably shouldnt have chosen to he frowned tavi what did you need to do that was more important than the flocks tavis face grew warmer yet um bernard arched an eyebrow and said oh i see see what theres a girl tavi knelt and tightened the straps on his boots to hide his scowl and said why would you say that youre a fifteenyearold boy tavi theres always a girl no there isnt tavi insisted bernard mused over that for a moment and shrugged when you want to talk about it let me know he pushed himself off the wall with one shoulder and strung his bow with one leg and the pressure of an arm well discuss your gifting later where do you think we should pick up dodgers trail tavi drew his leather sling from his pouch and put a couple of smooth stones into the pocket of his tunic wont brutus be able to find him bernard smiled i thought you said you could do this on your own tavi frowned at his uncle and scrunched up his nose thinking colds coming on and they know it theyll want evergreens for shelter and for food but the gargants were turned out to forage on the southern slope of the valley and they wont go anywhere near gargants if they can help it tavi nodded north dodger has taken them into the pine hollows over the causeway bernard nodded in approval good remember that furycrafting is no substitute for intelligence tavi and intelligence is no substitute for a fury tavi muttered sourly he kicked at the ground scuffing up a small cloud of dust and dried dead grasses bernard laid a heavy hand on tavis shoulder squeezed and then started walking north down the old lane worn by the passage of carts and draft animals and feet its not as bad as you think tavi furies arent everything says the man with two of them tavi said following him aunt isana says you could challenge for full citizenship if you wanted to bernard shrugged if i wanted to perhaps but i didnt come into my furies until i was almost your age but you were a slow bloomer tavi said im way past that no ones ever been my age and furyless bernard sighed you dont know that tavi relax boy it will come to you in time thats what youve told me since i was ten if id had furies of my own i could have stopped dodger and still he choked down his anger before he could blurt out the words uncle bernard glanced back at tavi smiling with only his eyes come on lad lets pick up the pace i need to be back before the other steadholders arrive tavi nodded and they broke into a mileeating lope down the winding lane the sky began to lighten as they passed the apple orchards the beehives and then the northern fields laid fallow for a season the lane wound through a forest of mostly oak and maple where most of the trees were so ancient that only the most meager grass and brush could grow beneath them by the time the predawn pale blue had given way to the first tints of orange and yellow they had reached the last stretch of woods before leaving the lands of bernardholt there the forest was not so old and smaller trees and brush some of it still living despite the lateness of the season stood thick and heavy golden and scarlet leaves covered the dried skeletons of the smaller brush and the naked sleeping trees swayed in a chorus of gentle creaking and then something in his surroundings brought an odd kind of pressure to tavis senses he stopped and let out a short warning hiss of breath from a full jog bernard abruptly dropped to a crouch and tavi instinctively followed suit bernard looked silently back at tavi cocking an eyebrow in a silent question tavi stayed on all fours and crawled up beside his uncle he kept his voice to a whisper between panting breaths and said up ahead in that last stand of trees by the brook theres usually a covey of quail there but i saw them heading along the lane you think something spooked them out bernard said he murmured cyprus and flicked his right hand toward the trees beside him in a signal to the lesser of his two furies tavi looked up and saw a shape glide down from one of the treesvaguely humanoid and no larger than a child it turned pale green eyes toward bernard for a moment crouching down like an animal leaves and twigs seemed to writhe together to cover whatever shape lay beneath them cyprus tilted its head to one side focusing on bernard and then made a sound like wind rustling through the leaves and vanished into the brush tavi was winded from the run and struggled to slow his breathing what is it he whispered bernards eyes slipped out of focus for a moment before he answered you were right well done boy theres someone hiding near the footbridge theyve got a strong fury with them bandits tavi whispered his uncles eyes narrowed its kord tavi frowned i thought the other steadholders were supposed to be arriving later today and why would they be hiding in the trees bernard grunted rising lets go find out tavi followed his uncle on down the road bernard walked with quiet purpose toward the causeway as if he had every intention of traveling past the hidden men then without warning he spun to his left arrow in hand drew back the bow and loosed a greyfeathered shaft at a clump of bushes and detritus a few paces from the near side of the small stone footbridge that crossed a murmuring brook tavi heard a scream and the leaves and bushes thrashed wildly a moment later a boy about tavis age emerged from the bushes one hand clenched upon the seat of his breeches he had a broad strong build and a face that would be handsome if it had been less petulant bittan of kordholt kords youngest son bloody crows the boy howled are you insane bittan called bernard in obviously feigned surprise oh dear i had no idea that was you back there from further down the trail a second young man rose out of hiding kords eldest son aric he was leaner than his brother taller and several years older he wore his hair pulled back into a tail and pensive frown lines had already established themselves between his eyebrows he watched bernard warily and called bittan you all right the boy screamed furious no im not all right im shot tavi peered at the other boy and muttered to his uncle you shot him just grazed him tavi grinned maybe you hit him in the brain bernard smiled a wolfish smile and said nothing from still further back in the brush leaves crackled and dead wood snapped a moment later steadholder kord emerged from the bracken he wasnt terribly tall but his shoulders seemed too large for him and his brawny arms looked unnaturally long kord wore a patched and faded grey tunic badly in need of a thorough washing and heavy garganthide leggings he wore his symbol of office the heavy chain of a steadholder around his neck the chain was smudged and looked greasy but tavi supposed that it made a better match for his unkempt greying hair and patchy beard kord moved with an aggressive tension and his eyes were cold with anger what the crows do you think youre doing bernard bernard waved a friendly hand at kord but tavi noted that he held an arrow along with the bow in his other little accident he said i mistook your boy there for some kind of robber lurking by the road to attack travelers kords eyes narrowed are you accusing me of something of course not bernard drawled his smile not touching his eyes this is just a misunderstanding thank the great furies no one got hurt he paused for a moment his smile vanishing before he said quietly id hate to have someone get hurt on my land kord snarled a sound more bestial than human and rolled forward a furious step the ground under his feet rumbled and quivered restless little hummocks rising and falling as though some kind of serpent slithered about just beneath the surface bernard faced kord without looking away stirring or changing his expression kord growled again and with a visible effort choked back his anger one of these days im going to get upset with you bernard dont say things like that kord tavis uncle replied youll frighten the boy kords eyes flicked to tavi and the boy felt suddenly uneasy under that intense and angry regard he come into any furies yet or are you finally going to admit what a useless little freak he is the simple comment pierced tavi like a thorn and he opened his mouth to make a furious response bernard settled his hand on tavis shoulder and said dont worry about my nephew he glanced at bittan after all youve got other concerns why dont you head on down to the steadholt im sure isana is getting something ready for you think well stay here a while kord said maybe eat a little breakfast suit yourself bernard said and stared on down the lane tavi followed close behind them bernard ignored kord until they had crossed the footbridge oh bernard said looking over his shoulder i forgot to mention that warner already came in last night kord his sons are on leave from the legions so that they could visit their father bring them on bittan snapped well tear them apa kord delivered an openhanded blow to bittans face that knocked the boy to the ground shut your mouth bittan shook his head dazed and scowling he didnt answer kord or look at his father as he stood up go on down bernard said im sure we can get everything worked out kord didnt reply he beckoned his sons with a curt gesture and started down the lane they followed him and bittan cast a harsh hateful glare at tavi as he walked freak tavi clenched his hands into fists but let the comment pass bernard nodded his approval and they waited as kord and his sons headed down the lane to bernardholt as they watched tavi said they were there to attack warner werent they uncle its possible bernard said thats why your aunt asked warner to come in last night kord is desperate why its bittan thats been accused not him rape is a realm offense bernard answered kord is the family head and he shares responsibility for offenses against the realm if the truthfind shows that there needs to be a trial and bittan is judged guilty count gram could remove kords claim to kordholt you think hed kill to protect it tavi asked i think men who lust for power are capable of almost anything he shook his head kord sees power as something to satisfy his desires instead of a tool to protect and serve the people beholden to him its a stupid attitude and it will eventually get him killedbut until then it makes him dangerous he scares me tavi said he scares anyone with good sense boy bernard passed his bow to tavi and opened a pouch on his belt he withdrew a small glass button from it and dropped it over the side of the footbridge and into the brook rill he said firmly i need to speak to isana please they waited there on the bridge for several moments before the sounds of the brook began to change a column of water rose straight up out of the brook taking on human form as it did so until it had formed into a liquid sculpture of tavis aunt isana a woman with the youthful form and features of a strong watercrafter but the bearing and voice of a mature adult the sculpture peered around eventually focusing on bernard and tavi good morning bernard tavi her voice sounded tinny as if it had come down to them through a long tube aunt isana tavi said bowing his head politely sis bernard drawled we just ran into kord and his sons they were waiting around in the brush near the north bridge isana shook her head the fool cant be serious i think he was bernard said i think he knows that with what bittan did gram will get him this time isanas mouth twisted into a wry smile i doubt having a woman appointed the truthfinder for this crime has pleased him either bernard nodded you might want to make sure someone is close just in case theyre coming down the lane to you now isanas image in the water frowned when will you return before noon with luck before dinner otherwise try to hurry ill keep things civil for as long as i can but im not sure anyone but you can make kord back down without shedding blood i will be careful isana nodded and you old bitte says that garados and his wife are brewing up a storm for us by nightfall at the latest tavi shot an uneasy glance to the northeast where the towering mountain of garados sat glowering down at the inhabitants of the calderon valley its upper slopes were already growing white with ice and clouds obscured the topmost peaks where the hostile fury of the towering mountain conspired with lilvia the fury of the cold gales blowing over the great sea of ice to the north they would gather in clouds like herds of cattle feed them to anger on the days light and drive them down over the inhabitants of the valley in a furystorm as the sun set well be back long before then bernard assured her good oh tavi yes aunt isana do you have any idea where beritte would have acquired a fresh garland of hollybells tavi shot his uncle a guilty glance and blushed i guess she must have found them somewhere i see she isnt yet of marrying age shes too irresponsible to care for a child and she certainly is too young to wear hollybells do you think shell be finding any more no ma am excellent isana said rather crisply well discuss the matter when you return tavi winced bernard held on to his chuckle until the water sculpture had lowered itself back into the brook the contact with isana ending as it did no girl eh i thought fred was the one walking out with beritte he is tavi sighed shes probably wearing them for him but she asked me to get them for her and well it seemed a lot more important at the time bernard nodded theres no shame in making a mistake taviprovided you learn from it i think youd be smart to think of this as a lesson in priorities so tavi frowned so what bernard kept smiling what have you learned this morning tavi glowered at the ground that women are trouble sir bernards mouth opened in a sudden merry roar of laughter tavi looked up at his uncle and cast him a hopeful grin bernards eyes shone with merriment oh lad thats about half of the truth whats the other half you want them anyway bernard said he shook his head the smile lingering in his eyes his mouth i did one or two stupid things to impress a girl in my day was it worth it bernards smile faded without giving the impression that he had become any less amused it simply turned inward as though what he was smiling at existed only within bernard never spoke of his dead wife or their children also gone yes every bruise and every scrape tavi sobered do you think bittans guilty likely bernard said but i could be wrong until weve had the chance to hear everyone speak we have to keep an open mind he wont be able to lie to your aunt i can bernard laughed youre quite a bit smarter than bittan and youve had a lifetime of practice tavi smiled at his uncle then he said sir i really can find the flock i can do it bernard regarded tavi for a moment then he nodded toward the causeway prove it then lad show me chapter isana looked up from her scrying bowl with a faintly irritated frown that boy is going to get himself into more trouble than he can explain his way out of one day wan autumn sunlight streamed through the windows of bernardholts main kitchen the smell of bread baking in the wide ovens filled the room along with the tang of the sauce sizzling on the roast turning over the coals isanas back hurt from a mornings work that had begun well before the sun rose and there wasnt going to be a chance to rest any time in the immediate future whenever she had a moment to spare from her preparations she spent it focused on her scrying bowl using rill to keep a cautious eye upon the kordholters and warners folk warner and his sons had added their efforts to that of elder frederic master of the steadholts gargants as he and his brawny son younger frederic cleaned out the halfburied stables of the vast beasts of labor kord and his youngest son lazed in the courtyard the elder boy aric had taken up an axe and had been splitting logs for the duration of the morning burning off nervous energy with physical effort the tension in the air throughout the morning was cloying even to those without an ounce of watercraft in their bodies the hold women had fled the kitchens heat to take their midday meal a quick round of vegetable soup and yesterdays bread together with a selection of cheeses they had thrown together then taken out into the steadholts courtyard to eat the weary autumn sun shone pleasantly down on the courtyard the warmth of its flagstones sheltered from the cold north wind by bernardholts high stone walls isana did not join them the tension building in the courtyard would have sickened her and she wanted to save back her strength and selfdiscipline for as long as she could in the event that she had to intervene so isana ignored the rumble in her own belly and focused on her work a portion of her thought reserved for her furys perceptions arent you going to eat mistress isana beritte looked up from where she was carelessly slicing the skins from a mound of tubers dropping the peeled roots into a basin of water the girls pretty face had been lightly touched with rouge and her already alluring eyes with kohl isana had warned her mother that beritte was entirely too young for such nonsense but there she was hollybells in her hair and her bodice laced with deliberate wickedness beneath her breastsmore eager to admire herself in every shiny surface she could find than to help prepare the evenings banquet isana had gone out of her way to find chores to occupy the girls day beritte often enjoyed seeing young men compete with one another for her attention and between her bodice and the sweet scent of the hollybells in her hair shed have them killing one anotherand isana had far too much on her mind to be bothered with any more mischief isana glanced at the girl eyeing her up and down before she reached for the poker and thrust it back into the oven into the coals where one of two tiny fire furies that regulated the oven wasnt doing its job she raked the poker through them stirring them and saw the flames dance and quiver a bit more as the sleepy fury within stirred to greater life as soon as i have a moment to spare she told the girl oh beritte said somewhat wistfully im sure well be finished soon just peel beritte isana turned back to the counter and her bowl the water within stirred and then quivered upward resolving itself into a face her own but much younger isana smiled warmly down at the fury rill always remembered what isana had looked like the day theyd found one another and always appeared in the same way as when isana then a gawky girl not quite berittes age had gazed down into a quiet lovely pool rill isana said and touched the surface of the water the liquid in the bowl curled over her finger and then swirled around quietly in response to her rill isana said again find bernard she pressed an image from her mind down to the fury through the contact of her finger her brothers sure silent steps his rumbling quiet voice and his broad hands find bernard she said again the fury quivered and swirled the water aboutthen departed the bowl passing through the air in a quiet wave isana felt prickling along her skin and then vanished down through the earth isana lifted her head and focused on beritte more sharply now then she said whats going on beritte im sorry the girl asked she flushed bright red and turned back to her peeling knife flashing over the tuber stripping dark skin from pale flesh i dont know what you mean mistress isana placed her hands on her hips i think you do she said her tone crisp and severe beritte you can either tell me where you got the flowers now or you can wait until i find out later isana felt berittes fluttering panic dancing around on the edges of the girls voice as she spoke honestly mistress i found them waiting for me at my door i dont know who yes you do isana said hollybells dont just miracuously appear and you know the law about harvesting them if you make me find out on my own by the great furies ill see to it that you suffer whatever is appropriate anyway beritte shook her head and one of the hollybells fell from her hair no no mistress isana could taste the way the lie made the girl inwardly cringe i never harvested any of them honestly i isanas temper flared and she snapped oh beritte you arent old enough to be able to lie to me ive a banquet to cook and a truthfind to prepare for and ive not time to waste on a spoiled child who thinks that because shes grown breasts and hips that she knows better than her elders beritte looked up at isana flushing darker with awkward humiliation and then snapped back with her own anger jealous mistress isanas temper abruptly flashed from a frustrated blaze to something cold icy for just a moment she forgot everything else in the kitchen all the events and disastrous possibilities that faced the steadholt that day and focused her attention on the buxom girl for only a moment she lost control of her emotions and felt the old bitter rage rise within her every kettle in the kitchen abruptly boiled over steam flushing out in a cloud that curved around isana and flowed toward the girl scalding water racing over the floor in a low wave toward her seat isana felt berittes defiance transformed in an instant to terror the girls eyes widening as she stared at isanas face beritte thrust her hands out as she stumbled out of her chair the feeble wind sprites she had collected slowing the oncoming steam enough to allow her to flee beritte took a jumping step over the nearest arm of the onrushing water and ran toward the kitchen doors sobbing isana clenched her fists and closed her eyes wrenching her mind from the girl forcing herself to take deep breaths to regain control of her emotions the anger the sheer bitter rage howled inside her like a living thing trying to tear its way free of her she could feel its claws scraping at her belly her bones she fought it down forced it away from her thoughts and as she did the steam settled and spread throughout the room fogging the thick rough glass of the windows the kettles calmed the water started pooling naturally over the floor isana stood amidst the sweltering steam and the spilled water and closed her eyes taking slow deep breaths shed done it again shed let too much of the emotion shed been feeling in another color her own thoughts her own perceptions berittes insecurity and defiant anger had glided into her and taken root in her own thoughts and feelingsand she had let it happen isana lifted one slim hand and rubbed at her temples the additional senses of a watercrafter felt like being able to hear another kind of sound sound that rubbed against ones temples like eiderdown until she almost felt that it was grating her skull raw that blisters would rise on her face and scalp from the sheer friction of all the emotions she felt rubbing against her still there was little she could do about it now but to control herself and to bear what came one couldnt open ones eyes and later simply decide not to use them she could dim the perceptions rills presence brought to her but she could never shut them away altogether it was simply a fact a watercrafter of her power had to live with one of many she thought isana crouched down murmuring to the tiny furies in the spilled water on the floor beckoning them until the separate puddles and droplets began running together in the center of the floor into a more coherent mass isana studied it waiting for all the spare droplets to roll in from the far corners of the kitchen the reflection of her own face looked back at her smooth and slender and barely older than that of a girls she winced thinking of the face rill showed her every time the fury came perhaps it was not so different from her own she lifted her hand and traced her fingers over her cheek she had a pretty face still most of forty years and she barely looked as though she had lived twenty of them she might look as old as thirty if she lived another four decades but no older there were no lines on her face at the corners of her eyes though faint shades of frost stirred in her auburn hair isana rose and regarded the woman reflected in the water tall thin too thin for a woman of her age with scarcely any curve of hip or breast she might have been mistaken for a gawky child true she may carry herself with more confidence more strength than any child could muster and true the faint grey touches in her hair may have granted her an age and dignity not strictly warranted by her appearanceand true everyone in the whole of the calderon valley knew her by name or sight or reputation as one of the most formidable furycrafters in it but that did nothing to change the simple and heartless fact that she looked like a boy in a dress like nothing any man would want to marry isana closed her eyes for a moment pained thirtyseven years old and she was alone no suitors naturally no garlands to wear or dances to plan for or flirtations to plot that was all long past her even with the apparent youth her watercrafting bestowed on her the youth that kept her always a bit distant from the other women her agewomen with husbands families she opened her eyes and idly bade the spilled water to make itself useful and clean the floor the puddle began sweeping over it obediently gathering up bits of dust and debris as it did and isana went to open the door cold air poured in sharp contrast to the steamy kitchen and she closed her eyes taking deep bracing breaths she had to admit it berittes words had stung her not simply because shed been feeling too many of the adolescents intense emotions but because they had rung true as well beritte had all the luscious curves and rondure that would draw any man in the valley to herand indeed she had half a dozen of them dancing on her strings even now including tavi though the boy tried to deny it beritte firm and ripe and able to bear strong children the way no one had thought isana would ever be able to she pressed her lips together and opened her eyes enough there was too much work to be about to let an old pain rise to the surface now thunder rumbled over the valleys floor and isana crossed to the northern window opened it and eyed the mountain peak to the north garados loomed in all of his surly majesty there snow already gliding further down his shoulders and toward the valley floor warning of the coming winter dark clouds gathered around his head and as she watched they flashed with dark green lightning sending another rumbled warning across the valley lilvia thengaradoss wife the storm fury gathering up clouds for another assault on the people of the valley she would wait all day gathering the warmth of the sun into her cloudherds and then send them stampeding across the valley in a rush of thunder and wind and like as not at this time of the year sleet and icy rain isana pressed her lips together intolerable if only a decently gifted windcrafter would settle down in the valley they might blunt the worst of tharas storms before they ever reached the steadholtsbut then any windcrafter that strong would be serving as a knight or one of the cursors she walked to the sink and touched the spigot alerting the furies inside that she desired water from the well a moment later it spilled out cold and clear and she filled a pair of pans before letting the furies stop the flow of it then went around the kitchens and refilled the water in the pots that had boiled over a moment later she took the bread from the ovens setting it out in its pans and slipped the next round of pans into their places she glanced around the kitchens once more making sure that everything was in place the puddle was finished with the floor so she shooed it out the door to ease into the earth beside the threshold and sink back into the ground rill isana called whats taking so long the water bubbled and stirred in her scrying bowl which doubled as her mixing bowl most days and then three little splashes announced rills presence isana crossed back to the bowl drew her braid back over her shoulder and regarded the surface of the water intently as the ripples stilled the fury showed her a dim view from what must have been a stagnant pool somewhere in the pine hollows a murky shape that could have been bernard paced across the image in the bowl and then was gone isana shook her head rills images were not always entirely clear but it seemed that bernard and tavi were still pursuing the missing flock she murmured a dismissal to rill and set the bowl asideand then noticed a sudden lack of sound from the courtyard a breath later the tension levels of bernardholt swelled into painful intensity isana steeled herself against the perceptions and walked briskly out of the kitchen she kept her breathing steady and held herself with rigid confidence the holdfolk were pressed shoulder to shoulder facing the center of the courtyard they were silent but for faint mutters and worried whispers kord she murmured isana stepped forward and the holdfolk made way for her clearing a narrow path through the onlookers until she could see the scene in the center of the courtyard two men stood facing one another in the courtyard and the air between them practically thrummed with tension kord stood with his arms folded over his chest the ground at his feet shifting and trembling his greasy beard framed his smile sharply and his eyes were bright and eager beneath his heavy brows facing him stood steadholder warner a tall man slender as a post with gangling arms and legs and a head that shone bold but for a fringe of wispy grey hair warners narrow chiseled face had flushed bright red in anger and the air around him quivered and danced like heat rising off an oven all im saying kord drawled is that if that little slut of yours cant keep her legs together and men out from between them its your problem friend not mine shut your mouth warner snarled or what kord asked throwing a sneer into the words what are you going to do warner run and hide behind the skirts of a woman and whimper for gram to come save you why you warner spat he took a step forward and the air in the courtyard grew detectably warmer kord smiled a flash of teeth and said go ahead warner call it to juris macto lets settle this like men unless youd rather humiliate your little whore by having her testify how she seduced my boy in front of every steadholder in the calderon valley one of warners sons a tall and lean young man with his hair shorn in legionfashion stepped up to his father and took his arm pa dont he said you cant take him on in a fair fight the other two took up a spot behind warner while kords sons mirrored them behind their own father warners daughter rushed to his side heddys cobwebfine hair rose and rippled in silken yellow waves in the heated air around her father she threw a conscientious look around her her face flaming scarlet with embarrassment papa she urged no not like this this isnt our way kord snorted at the girl bittan he asked glancing back at his son you stuck your wick in that skinny tramp might as well have gone after one of warners sheep isana had to clench her fists and brace herself against the raw tide of emotions in the courtyard from heddys panicky fear and humiliation to warners rage to kords sly satisfaction and eagerness every feeling washed over her too intense to ignore she forced them all away from her and took a breath kords earth fury was a vicious beast trained to kill he used it to hunt and to slaughter his cattle any fury started taking on aspects of its partner after a while but even considering kord himself the earth fury was a bad one a killer isana swept a look around the courtyard the holdfolk all stood well clear of the conflict none of them wanted to involve themselves in a struggle between steadholders crows take her brother where was he when she needed him the flood of intense anger from warner grew more harshin only a moment more he would give in to kords taunts and take the matter to juris macto the realms legal form of duel kord would kill him but warner was too furious at the treatment of his daughter to consider that warners sons too were flooding her with a growing torrent of anger and kords youngest son burned with a barely disguised lust for violence isanas heart fluttered with all the emotions piling on top of her own fear she pushed them all firmly away struggling to master themand stalked out into the courtyard squarely between the two men and put her hands on her hips gentlemen she said letting her voice ring out you are interrupting lunch warner took a step toward kord his eyes never leaving the other steadholder you cant expect me to stand here and take this kord sauntered forward a willing pace himself juris macto he said just declare it warner and we can settle this isana spun to face kord meeting his eyes squarely not in my courtyard you wont bittan behind kord let out a rough laugh and stepped forward toward isana well well he said what we got here another little hold whore standing up for whore heddy bittan kord growled in warning isana narrowed her eyes at bittan the young mans confidence arrogance and a sickening rush of his lust whirled over her like a foul greasy smoke she watched him approach arrogantly smiling as he eyed her from her bare feet to her long braid the idiot evidently did not know her by sight going bad early bittan commented but i bet youd be good for a tumble he reached out a hand to touch isanas face isana let him touch her for a moment felt the desperate arrogant need of the young man to prove himself in his own eyes she reached up and seized his wrist and then said voice cold rill deal with this slive bittan abruptly convulsed and threw himself backward onto the ground he let out a strangled scream that cut off halfway through as clear foaming water burst from his mouth he thrashed on the courtyard stones in a frantic tangle of flailing limbs his eyes bulged and he tried to scream again nothing but water flooding from his mouth and nose kords other son rushed to his fallen brother and kord himself rolled forward a step with an angry snarl bitch he growled the earth bulged beneath him as though preparing to lash forward go ahead kord isana said her voice icy but before you do i should remind you that you are in bernardholt now and you may not challenge me to the juris macto she smiled at him as sweet and venomous as she could manage im not a steadholder i can still kill you isana kord said you could isana replied but then i wouldnt be able to call rill off of your boy there would i and what if i could use one less mouth to feed kord answered her showing her his teeth in that case she said i hope youre ready to kill everyone here because you wont get away with cold murder steadholder kord i dont care how far we are from the first lords justicekill me and there wont be a place in the realm where you can hide isana promptly turned to warner and snapped wipe that smile off your face steadholder what kind of behavior is this to show to my holders and their children she stalked toward warner with a scowl twisting her features ill have your word that you wont engage in this idiocy again while youre a guest in my home isana warner protested he and his sons still staring at kord and his own brood that animal on the ground is the one who raped my daughter papa heddy sobbed tugging at warners sleeve papa please your word warner isana snapped or ill rule against you in the truthfind right here and now warners gaze snapped to isana and she felt his sudden shock and surprise but isana i dont care you cant behave this way in my home warner and my brother isnt here to knock sense into your fool head your word no more of this duel nonsense no more fighting in bernardholt warner stared at her for a moment isana felt the mans dismay his anger his helpless frustration his gaze wavered and went to his daughter and he softened almost visibly all right he said quietly my word for all of us well start nothing isana whirled back toward kord stalking toward the young man still choking on the ground vomiting water she brushed roughly passed the older of kords sons aric was his name she thought and reached down to lay her hand on bittans forehead the boy had gone beyond thought in his animal panic there was no arrogance there now only a fear so intense that it made isanas skin feel cold kord sneered down at her i guess youre going to want my word as well what would be the point isana snapped keeping her voice low youre scum kord and we both know it louder she said rill out she stood away as bittan spluttered and coughed retching more water out finally drawing in a gasping breath of air she left him there coughing on the ground and turned to go the stone of the courtyard folded over one of her feet with a simple and almost delicate finality her heart fluttered with her own fear as she felt kords cold anger on her back she flicked her braid over her shoulder and shot him a look through narrowed eyes this isnt over isana kord promised his voice very quiet i wont stand for this isana faced his dark stare the cold and calculating hatred behind it and borrowed from it used it to steel herself against him to return ice for ice youd best hope its over kord she said or youre going to think what happened to bittan was a kindness she flicked her eyes down to her foot and back up to him theres a space for you in the barn ill have some food sent down for lunch well call you at dinner kord remained still for a moment then he spat to one side and nodded toward his sons aric collected the gasping bittan hauling him to his feet and the three of them walked toward the wide doors of the roomy stone barn only as they left did the ground quiver beneath isanas bare foot and let her go she closed her eyes and the terror shed been holding back her own flooded out and over her she started shaking but she shook her head to herself firmly not in front of everyone she opened her eyes and looked around at the courtyard full of people well she asked them there is a lot of work to do before the feast come sundown i cant do everything around here by myself get to it people moved at her words started talking again amongst themselves some of them shot her looks of mixed respect admiration and fear isana felt that last like frozen cockleburs rolling over her skin her own folk people shed lived and worked with for years afraid of her she lifted a hand as tears blurred at her eyesbut that was one of the first tricks a watercrafter learned she willed them away from her eyes and they simply did not fall the confrontation with its rampant tension and potential for murderous violence had shaken her more than anything in years isana drew in a careful breath and walked toward the kitchens her legs kept her steady at least though the weariness now crawling over her was nearly too much to bear her head ached with the efforts of the morning with the pressure of all that watercrafting fade came shuffling out of the smithy as she passed it he moved with an odd little drag of one foot not a large man he had been badly burned when he had been branded with a cowards mark disfiguring the left half of his facethough that had been years ago his hair nearly black had grown out long and curling to partially conceal it and the scar tracing over his scalp presumably a head wound also suffered in battle the slave offered her a witless smile and a tin cup of water holding it up to her along with a fairly clean cloth far different from his own sweaty rags and burnscarred leather apron thank you fade isana said she accepted both and took a drink i need you to keep an eye on kord i want you to let me know if he or his sons leave the barn all right fade nodded rapidly his hair flopping a bit of drool flicked off his halfopen mouth eye on kord he repeated barn he frowned staring into space for a long moment and then pointed a finger at her watch better she shook her head im too tired just tell me if they leave all right leave fade repeated he mopped at his drool with one sleeve tell thats right she said and gave him a weary smile thank you fade fade made a hooting sound of pleasure and smiled welcome fade youd better not go into the barn the kordholters are there and i get the feeling theyd not be kind to you ungh the slave said watch barn tell he turned at once and shuffled off quickly despite the drag of his foot isana put old bitte in charge of the kitchens and returned to her room she sat down on her bed her hands folded on her lap her stomach fluttered nervously but she forced herself to take deep breaths to stay calm she had headed off the most immediate trouble and fade despite his lack of skilled speech and his simple manner was reliable he would warn her if something else came up in the meantime she worried about tavinow more than any time she could remember he was safe enough with bernard to look after him but her instincts would not relent the pine hollows were the most dangerous stretch of land in the valley but to her weary senses the danger seemed deeper than that and more threatening there was something heavy and foreboding in the air of the valley a gathering of forces that made the storm brewing over garados look weak and tiny by comparison isana laid down on her bed please she whispered exhausted great furies please keep him safe chapter tavi picked up dodgers trail within an hour but from there it wasnt so easy tavi tailed the flock throughout the morning and into the early afternoon stopping only to drink from an icy brook and to eat some cheese and salt mutton his uncle had brought with him by then tavi knew that dodger was living up to his name and leading them on a merry chase looping back and forth through the barrens though gloomy garados grew ever taller and darker with storm clouds tavi ignored the glowering presence of the mountain and kept his focus on his work noon was well past when he finally caught up to the wily ram and his flock he heard the sheep before he saw them one of the ewes let out plaintive bleats he looked back over his shoulder to where his uncle followed several dozen strides behind him and waved a hand to let bernard know hed found them he couldnt keep the grin off his face and his uncle answered tavis smile with his own dodger had led the flock into a dense thicket of brambles and thorns nearly as tall as tavi himself and a hundred feet deep tavi spotted dodgers curling horns and approached the old ram carefully talking as he always did dodger snorted and pawed at the earth with his front hooves shaking his curling horns threateningly tavi frowned at the ram and approached him more slowly dodger himself weighed better than a quarter ton and the tough breed of mountain sheep the frontier folk of alera favored sheep big enough and strong enough to defend themselves against thanadents and worse could become aggressive when threatened careless shepherds had been killed by their overexcited charges a sharp sweet smell made tavi stop in his tracks he recognized the scent of slaughtered sheep of offal and blood something was very wrong tavi approached more slowly eyes carefully sweeping around he found the first dead sheep one of the lambs several yards short of the brambles he knelt down and studied the remains searching for clues as to what had killed the animal it hadnt been slives slives could kill young sheep even adults if they had numbers enough but the poisonous lizards swarmed over corpses and ravaged them into strips of flesh and bared bones the lamb was dead but it only showed a single wounda massive clean cut that had nearly severed the lambs head from its neck a thanadents talons might have been capable of inflicting such a wound but when one of the great mountain beasts took a kill it either devoured it on the spot or else dragged it off to a secluded lair to feed wolveseven the great wolves of the savage barbarian infested wilds east of the calderon valleycould not have struck and killed so cleanly and besides any predator would have begun to devour the lamb beasts did not kill for sport the ground around the lamb was grossly disturbed tavi checked around quickly for tracks but he found only the hoofmarks of the sheep and then some marks he was not familiar with and could not even be sure were tracks one partially disturbed track may have been the outline of a human heel but it could as easily have been the result of a round stone being rolled out of its place tavi rose puzzled and found two more corpses laying on the ground between the first lamb and dodgers refuge in the thicketanother lamb and a ewe both dead of similar massive clean wounds a powerful fury might have been capable of causing those wounds but furies rarely attacked animals without being compelled to do so by their crafter if an animal had not done the killings only a man could have he would need a viciously sharp bladea long hunting knife or a sword and might need furyenhanced strength to help as well but the frontier valley rarely had visitors and none of the holdfolk wandered through the pine barrens garadoss looming presence made the land for miles about it seem heavy with apprehension and it was nearly impossible to get a good nights sleep so near the old mountain tavi looked up and frowned at dodger who remained in the entrance to the thicket horns presented in warning and tavi suddenly felt afraid what could have struck down those sheep that way uncle tavi called his voice cracked a little something is wrong bernard approached frowning his eyes taking in dodger and the flock then the dead sheep upon the ground tavi watched his uncle take it in and then bernards eyes widened he rose and drew the short heavy sword of the legionare from his belt tavi come over to me what bernards voice took on a sharp edge of anger and command that tavi had never heard in uncle before now tavis heart began to pound in his chest and he obeyed what about the flock forget them bernard said his voice crisp and cold were leaving but well lose the sheep we cant just leave them here bernard passed the sword to tavi scanning slowly around them and fitted an arrow to the string of his bow keep the point low put your other hand on the small of my back and leave it there tavis fear rose sharply but he forced it away and obeyed his uncle whats wrong why are we leaving because we want to get out of the barrens alive bernard started pacing silently away from the thicket his face set in concentration alive uncle what could bernard tensed abruptly and spun to one side lifting his bow tavi turned with him and saw a flash of motion beyond a small stand of young trees before them what is th there was a hissing wail from their opposite side tavi whipped his head around but his uncle was slower spinning his entire body with his bow at arms length an arrow drawn back to his cheek tavi could do little but watch their attacker come it looked like a birdif a bird could be eight feet tall and mounted on a pair of long powerful legs thicker and strongerlooking than a racing horses and tipped with wicked claws its head sat on the end of a long powerful flexible neck and sported a hawks beak enlarged many times sharplooking and viciously hooked its feathers were colored in all dark browns and blacks though its eyes were a brilliant shade of gold the bird bounded forward taking a pair of steps and leaping into the air both claws coming forward to rake while it beat at the air with ridiculously undersized wings tavi felt his uncle shove at him with his hip as he turned and fell away and to one side bernard between him and the oncoming horror bernard loosed his arrow without sighting the arrow flew struck at a poor angle and glanced off the things feathers skittering away in a blur of black and green fletching the beast landed on bernard its claws raking its vicious beak whipping forward and down toward him when hot droplets of his uncles blood struck his face tavi began to scream the birdthings talons lashed out raking and tearing one of them ripped through uncle bernards tough leather breeches at the thigh blood welled and flowed another talon tore through his hair down toward his throat but bernard raised his arm sliding the lethal claws away on the wood of the bow the creatures vicious beak darted down at him but again bernard parried the attack away the great birds beak darted to one side and snapped the heavy wood of the bow like a dry twig it gave way with a sharp detonation as the heavy tension of the string was released tavi raised the sword and started toward his uncle screaming but it didnt sound like his own voice it was too high too thin and too terrified to be his voice the birds head swiveled toward him golden eyes focusing on him with a terrible mindless intensity brutus shouted uncle bernard as the birds attention focused on tavi take him the earth at the birds feet shuddered and then ripped itself upward as brutus came to bernards call a thin layer of soil peeled back away from raw stone brutus surged up from the earth like a hound emerging from boiling surf head and shoulders of a great hunting dog made of soil and stone the furys eyes glowed green as emeralds and shone with a faintly luminous light brutus planted his front paws on the ground hauling his ponysized body forward and stone jaws closed on the thigh of the attacking bird the bird let out a whistling teakettle scream and its beak flashed down at the furys head the beak struck sparks from the stone and one of the earthen hounds ears fell off but brutus didnt so much as flinch tavi let out a shout and swung his uncles sword with both hands it struck at the base of the birds neck and tavi felt the blow in his hand as the bird struggled and thrashed a quivering sensation like that of a fish on a line he drew back the sword and struck again dark blood splashed and stained the blade tavi kept on swinging the sword once dodging aside from the birds free talon again and again the heavy weapon bit into the birds body or neck again and again dark blood splashed up from the blade brutus wrenched the bird to one side and threw it to the ground with bonecrushing force tavi screamed again the blood roaring in his ears and swung the sword at the birds head like an axe tavi heard and felt the crunch of impact and the bird collapsed ceasing its thrashing and its teakettle screams tavi trembled violently there was dark blood on his clothes and on the sword in his hands and scattered over the birds feathers and on the ground brutus still held the birds thigh in his granite jaws a stench wafted up from the body foul and rotten tavi swallowed and felt his stomach roil he turned away from the birds body and toward his uncle who lay prone on the ground uncle tavi said he knelt down beside the man there was blood on bernards clothes and on his hands uncle bernard bernard turned his pale face up to tavi his features twisted in a grimace of pain he had both hands clamped to his thigh squeezing until his knuckles had turned white my leg he said weve got to tie off my leg boy or im finished tavi swallowed and nodded he put down the sword and unfastened his belt what about brutus he asked bernard shook his head a tight small motion not yet cant get anything through to him like this tavi had to haul with both hands to move his uncles leg enough to let him slip the belt around it and doing so drew a grunt of pain from the big man tavi wrapped the belt as tightly as he could and then tied it off bernard let out another low sound of pain and removed his hands slowly blood soaked his breeches but no fresh scarlet appeared the wound looked horrible muscles lay open and tavi thought he caught a glimpse of white bone beneath his stomach heaved again and he looked away crows he breathed he was still shaking his heart still beating too quickly uncle are you all right hurting pretty good keep talking to me until it passes a little tavi fretted at his lip all right what was that thing herdbane they have them further south feverthorn jungle mostly never heard of one this far north before or that big they kill for sport no too stupid to know when to stop once they scent blood they tear apart anything that moves tavi swallowed and nodded are we in danger now maybe herdbane hunt in pairs go look at the bird what look at the croweaten bird boy bernard growled tavi rose to his feet and went back over to the herdbane its free leg twitched the talons opening and closing spasmodically the smell of offal surrounded him and tavi held his breath covering his nose and mouth with one hand bernard grunted and sat up though his head dropped for a moment as he did and he had to brace his hands on the ground you killed it with the first blow tavi you should have stepped back and let the thing die but it was still fighting tavi said bernard shook his head youd laid its neck open it wasnt going to be fighting for long takes time to bleed to death and until they do they can take you with them look at its neck right behind its head tavi swallowed and walked around the corpse and around brutus as well until he stood behind the birds beak and looked as his uncle had directed him something disturbed the feathers just behind the birds head he knelt down and reached out with tentative fingers to brush some of the feathers away and peer at whatever it was a circlet made out of a braid of several types of rough cloth and hide encompassed the birds throat denting in the muscle where it pressed theres some kind of collar on it tavi said whats it made of bernard rumbled i dont know cloth and some leather in a braid it doesnt look familiar thats a marat collar we need to get out of the barrens tavi tavi looked up startled there arent any marat in the calderon valley uncle the legions keep them out there hasnt been a marat here since they had the big battle years and years ago bernard nodded before you were born but two cohorts at garrison doesnt necessarily keep them out if they arent coming in numbers theres a marat warrior up here and he isnt going to be happy that we killed his bird neither is its mate mate marks on the top of her head mating scars we killed the female tavi swallowed then i guess we should go bernard nodded the motion weary unsteady come here boy tavi did kneeling close to his uncle one of the sheep let out a bleat and tavi frowned looking up the small flock milled around and dodger began to trot about shoving them roughly back into a group with his horns brutus bernard said his voice gruff and unsteady he drew in a deep breath expression becoming one of concentration let go of the bird take us both back home the stone hound dropped the bird and turned toward bernard brutus sank down into the earth again tavi felt the patch of ground he stood on begin to quiver and move then with a groan of tortured rock a slab of stone perhaps five feet across rose up beneath them and began sliding southward like a raft on a slowmoving river the earthraft drifted toward the entryway to the little clearing slowly gathering speed bernard muttered just wake me up when we get back then he laid down and closed his eyes his face and body going immediately slack again tavi glanced at his uncle frowning and then back at the sheep dodger had them herded into the thicket again and had presented his hornsand not toward tavi uncle bernard tavi said and he thought his voice sounded highpitched and panicky uncle bernard i think something is coming tavis uncle did not respond tavi looked around for his uncles sword but he had left it lying beside the herdbanes body and it was now two dozen strides away tavi clenched his hands into frustrated fists this was all his fault if he hadnt shirked his duties to impress beritte he wouldnt have needed to come looking for dodger and his uncle wouldnt have needed to follow him tavi shivered suddenly the possibility of death seemed very real looming stark and close shadows fell over the valley and tavi looked up to see racing clouds darken the sun and he heard a distant rumble of thunder wind made the trees and scant brush begin to sway and stir and the earth raft seemed to crawl though already up to the walking pace of a man and still accelerating tavi found himself desperate to move faster and terrified that it might already be too late tavi swallowed if something came after them now his uncle would not be able to help him tavi would have to handle it alone a high whistling screech came from the trees to the west of them up the slope tavi jerked his head in that direction but saw nothing the screech repeated itself another herdbane a second screech answered it this time from the east of the earthraft and from unnervingly close at hand a third brush rattled perhaps fifty paces back in the trees then again closer tavi thought he saw something moving toward them closing in theyre coming he said in a quiet voice tavi swallowed though brutus might eventually reach the pace of a running man and hold it for hours or days he wouldnt get there in time to help them escape bernard had no chance at all of evading another herdbane as he lay unconscious and brutuss focus was all on bearing the pair of them back toward home which meant that the only way his uncle could escape was if the herdbanes went looking somewhere else if someone led them off in another direction tavi took a deep breath rolled off the earthraft to one side of the trail and lay completely still if the herdbanes tracked movement surely they would have more trouble with the wind rising and the trees and brush swaying in it he would remain still for a while and then start making plenty of noise and motion to draw the hunters away from their vulnerable prey thunder rumbled again and tavi felt a tiny cold raindrop splash on his cheek he looked up and saw vast and dark clouds growing around the mountain another cold raindrop fell on him and he felt a rush of fear that nearly forced him to empty his stomach furystorms could be deadly to anyone caught out in the open without the solid protection of the steadholts walls or the protection of his own furies he would be nearly helpless before the storm breathing fast and light tavi picked up several rocks that seemed a good size for throwing then he turned to the west and hurled the stone on the highest arch he could manage the stone flew in silence and struck on a tree trunk making a sharp sound tavi pressed against the base of the tree and held still there was a whistle from the other side of the trail and something moved through the brush toward it tavi heard steps behind him and then a great dark form flashed past him in near silence a bound that took it across the rough trail brutuss passage had made another herdbane this one darker larger than the first it ran on its toes though its talons rattled against fallen pine needles and its feathers brushed through the limbs of the evergreens it went toward the spot where the stone had landed vanishing back into the brush tavi let out a breath he threw another stone farther away back toward the clearing rather than in the direction where brutus was slowly bearing his uncle to safety then he crouched low and headed back toward the clearing himself tossing a new stone every few paces the wind kept rising and more tiny stinging droplets of nearfrozen rain began to fall tavi labored to keep his breathing as silent as he could and crept back to the clearing quiet as a cat creeping the last few paces on his belly under the overhanging branches of one of the evergreens the sheep were nowhere to be seen but the second herdbane was already there so was the marat this herdbane stood at least a head taller than the first and its feathers were darker its eyes a browner shade of gold it stood over the corpse of the bird tavi had killed one leg cocked up underneath its body leaning its neck down to nuzzle its beak against its dead mates feathers the marat was the first tavi had seen he was tall taller than anyone tavi knew he looked not unlike a man but his shoulders were very broad and his body heavy with flat swiftlooking muscle he wore only a cloth around his hips though that seemed mostly utilitarian worn only to provide a belt to hang several pouches from and from which depended something that looked like a dagger made of black glass his hair was long and thick and looked sickly white in the dim grey light that shone through the rain clouds he had tied dark feathers into his hair here and there and they lent him a savage aspect the marat moved to the herdbanes body and knelt over it reaching out to lay both wide powerfullooking hands upon the beast he let out a soft keening sound which was echoed by the male beside him and both went still for a moment bowing their heads then the man snarled splitting his lips apart and his head turned this way and that looking around him white teeth bared his eyes tavi saw were precisely the same shade of gold as the herdbanes inhuman and bright tavi remained where he was hardly daring to breathe the marats features were not difficult to read he was furious and as the man turned his head in a slow circle around the clearing tavi saw that his teeth and his hands were stained with scarlet blood the marat stood and held a hand to his mouth he took a breath and blew a wailing whistle flying from his lips loud enough to make tavi wince he blew a short sequence the notes higher and lower long and short then he fell silent tavis brow furrowed into a frown and he dropped his jaw a little halfclosing his eyes and listened after a time there came halfmangled by the rising winds a whistling answer tavi had no way of knowing what the answer said but that there was an answer in itself was frightening enough the whistling communication could mean only one thing there were more than one of the barbarians here the marat had returned to calderon valley perhaps they were simply hunting taking refuge from detection in the humanityfree area in the pine barrens around garados or perhaps tavis panicked thoughts ran they were the advance scouts for a horde but that seemed mad a horde hadnt been seen in more than fifteen yearsnot since before tavi was born and while they had enjoyed a brief spate of victory destroying the crown legion and slaying the princeps gaius the aleran legions had crushed the horde only weeks later dealing them such a deadly stroke that everyone had assumed that the marat would never return tavi swallowed but they had returned and if they meant to return in force the marat in the valley were probably advance scouts if they were they would never let one rather skinny and undersized boy who had seen them escape to warn others of their presence the marat returned to glaring around the clearing he seized several feathers and jerked them out of the dead herdbane then reached up and tied them to strands of his hair he made a whistling sound at the living herdbane moving one hand in a gesture the bird responded by moving in that direction in long stalking steps its eyes sweeping back and forth the marat meanwhile dropped down to all fours he sniffed at the blood on the fallen herdbanes claws and then to tavis disgust leaned down and ran his tongue along it then he closed his mouth with his eyes narrowed tasting the blood as though it were a wine the marat opened his eyes again remained low on all fours and began casting around the floor of the clearing like a dog after a scent he paused at the fallen sword and picked it up staring down at the weapon stained with the herdbanes blood then he lowered the blade to wipe it clean on the grass of the clearing and slipped it through his clothbelt the wind continued to rise and changed directions at every breath tavi felt it brush against his back he froze in place sure that if he moved he would be immediately seen the marat jerked his head up abruptly turning to look directly at tavis hiding place the boy swallowed tensing in fear the marat let out another whistle and made a hand signal the herdbane stalked toward tavis hiding place just like a chicken after a bug tavi thought and im the bug but a few steps later the herdbane let out a shriek turning to face south the marat followed the herdbane golden eyes reading the signs of passage in the earth he crouched down nostrils flaring and looked up with a sudden eager light in his eyes the marat rose and began to stalk southward after tavis wounded uncle no tavi shouted he threw himself to his feet and out of his hiding place hurling one of his remaining stones at the marat his aim proved true the rock struck the marat high on the cheek and blood welled from the gash the marat stared at tavi with those golden birdofprey eyes and snarled something in a tongue tavi could not understand his intentions though were clear even before he drew the glass dagger from his belt his eyes burned with anger the marat let out a whistle and the herdbane whirled toward him then he pointed at tavi and let out that same whistling teakettle battle cry the dead bird had used tavi turned and ran he had run from those larger and stronger than him for the whole of his young life most games at the steadholt involved chasing of one kind or another and tavi had learned how to make his small size and quickness work for him he ran through the densest thickets of bracken he could find and slipped through mazes of thorns windfalls sinkholes and young evergreens the wind grew stronger filling the air with fallen pine needles and dust tavi ran west to lead them away from his uncle the eerie wailing of the herdbane and its master raced after him but fear gave his feet wings the boys heart pounded like a smiths hammer heavy and swift he knew that he was alone and that no one would come to help him he had to rely on his own wits and experience and should he falter or slow the pursuing marat and herdbane would have him sunset was drawing near and the vast storm building over garados had begun to spread over the valley should the marat the storm or the darkness catch him unprotected in the open he would die tavi ran for his life chapter when twilight fell amara remained at liberty her body ached to her bones the first swift rush of flight had taken the strength from her and the second steadier flight would have been impossible without a fortunate breeze blowing north and east in the direction she fled she was able to use the prevailing currents of wind to assist cirrus and thus to conserve much of her own energy amara kept low at the tops of the trees almost and although they swayed and danced at the passage of the miniature cyclone that kept her aloft she was better off flying low where the terrain might help hide her passage from the eyes of the knights aeris pursuing her the last rustcolored light of sunset showed her a sparkle of water a winding ribbon running through the rolling wooded hills the river gaul it taxed her remaining reserves to guide cirrus to bring her in for a gentle landing and took even more of an effort to remain on her feet after the tension of flight left her she felt like crawling into a hollow tree and sleeping for a week instead she reached down to her tattered dress tore at the hem on one side and from it withdrew a small disk of bright copper river gaul she whispered pushing whatever reserves she had left into the effort to speak to the water furies know this coin and hasten word to thy master she dropped the coin giving it a slight spin and the image of the first lords profile spun and tumbled alternating with the image of the sun in the bloody light amara slumped down then by the water reaching out to cup her hands in it long runs were not as draining as an hour of flighteven on a good day for it she had been fortunate if the winds had been different she would not have been able to escape to the gaul she stared down at her faint reflection and shivered for a moment she thought of the water writhing its way up her hands down her nose and throat and her heart thudded with sickly fear she struggled to force it away but it wouldnt leave her she could not make herself touch the water the water witch could have killed her amara could have died right there she hadnt she had survivedbut even so it was all she could do to keep from cowering back on the bank she closed her eyes for a moment and tried to force the image of the womans laughter out of her head the men who had been chasing her presented no special fear if she was captured by them she would be killed with bright steel perhaps brutalizedbut all of that she had prepared herself for she thought of the smile on odianas face as her water fury had smothered amara drowning her on dry land there had been an almost childish unrestrained glee in the womans eyes amara shuddered nothing had prepared her for that and yet she had to face that terror she had to embrace it her duty required her to do no less she thrust her hands into the cold water of the river the young cursor splashed water onto her face and made an abortive attempt to comb her hair with her fingers even though she wore it shorter than was customary barely to her shoulders and even though her hair was straight and fine a tawny browngold still a few hours in gale winds had tangled it into knots and made her look like a particularly shaggy mongrel dog she eyed her reflection again thin harsh features she thought though with the proper cosmetics she could whittle them down to merely severe listless hair cobwebby and delicateand currently as tousled as a haystack her face and arms beneath the grime were tanned as dark as her hair giving her a monochromatic look in the water like a statue carved of pale wood and then lightly stained her simple clothes were tattered frayed at the edges from hours in the wind and thickly stained with mud and spatters of dark brown that must have been blood around the slice in her blouse where her arm throbbed with dull pain the water stirred and a furycrafted form rose out of itbut instead of the first lord a woman took shape gaius caria wife to gaius sextus aleras first lord seemed young hardly older than amara herself she wore a splendid highwaisted gown her hair coiffed into an intricate series of braids with a few artful curls falling to frame her face the woman was beautiful but more than that she carried with her a sense of serenity of purpose of grace and of power amara abruptly felt like a gangling cow and dropped into a curtsey as best she could hands taking the soiled skirts and holding to them your grace academ murmured the woman in reply not twenty days have passed since my husband gave you his coin and already you interrupt his supper i believe that is a new record fidelias i am told did not see fit to drag him from his meal or his bed until at least a month had gone by amara felt her face flush with heat yes your grace i apologize for the necessity the first lady gave her an arch look up and down the grimy length of her body amara felt her blush deepen and she fought not to squirm no apology is necessary lady caria said though you might work on your timing in the future yes lady please your grace i need to speak to the first lord lady caria shook her head impossible she said her tone one of finality im afraid youll have to speak to him later perhaps tomorrow but lady hes swamped the first lady said emphasizing each syllable if you feel the matter is an important one academ then you may leave me a message and i will present it to him as soon as opportunity allows please forgive me lady but i was told that if i ever used the coin that the message was to be only for him mind your tongue academ caria said her brows arched remember to whom you speak i have the orders from the first lord himself your grace i only attempt to obey them admirable but the first lord is not a favorite professor you can simply visit yourself upon whenever you wish academ she stressed the last word very slightly and he has affairs of state to attend to amara swallowed and said your grace please i will not be long in telling him let him judge if i am abusing the privilege please no caria said the sculpted figure looked over its shoulder you have taken enough of my time academ amara the first ladys voice gained a note of tension hurry if that is all amara licked her lips if she could hold on a moment more perhaps the first lord would overhear the conversation your grace before you go may i give you a message to pass on to him be quick yes your grace if you would only tell him that amara didnt get any farther than that before the watery form of the first lady grimaced and shot her a cool glance her features becoming remote and hard the water beside lady caria stirred and a second furycrafted shape rose from it this one was a man tall with shoulders that had once been broad but were now slumped with age he carried himself with a casual pride and a confidence that showed in every line of his body the waterfigure did not appear in liquid translucence as did lady carias it rose from the river in full color and amara thought for just a moment that the first lord himself had somehow come rather than sending a fury in his place his hair was dark streaked with silverwhite strands and his green eyes looked faded weary and confident here now said the figure in a gentle ringing bass what passes my wife the figure of gaius turned toward amara squinting his features went completely still for a moment then he murmured ah i see greetings cursor lady caria shot her husbands image a glance at the use of that title and then her remote gaze returned to amara this one wished to speak with you but i had informed her that you had a state dinner to attend your majesty amara murmured and curtseyed again gaius let out a sigh and waved a hand vaguely you go ahead my wife ill be along shortly lady carias chin lifted tilting with a sharp little motion husband there will be considerable consternation if we do not arrive together gaius turned his face toward lady caria then if it pleases you wife you may wait elsewhere for me the first lady pressed her lips together but gave a graceful proper nod before her image abruptly fell back into the water creating a splash that drenched amara to the waist the girl let out a surprised cry moving to wipe uselessly at her skirts oh my lord please excuse me gaius made a tsking sound and his image moved a hand the water fled from the cloth of her skirts simply pattered out onto the ground in a steady rain of orderly droplets that gathered into a small muddy puddle and then flowed back down into the river leaving her skirts at least quite clean please excuse the first lady gaius murmured these last three years have not been kind to her three years since she married you my lord amara thought but aloud she said only yes your majesty the first lord inhaled then nodded the expression brusque he had shaved his beard since amara had seen him last and the lines of age faint on the mostly youthful features showed as dark shadows at the corners of his eyes and mouth gaius appeared to be a hale forty years of agein fact amara knew that he was twice that and that no silver had been showing in his hair when she arrived at the royal academy five years before your report gaius said lets hear it yes milord as you instructed fidelias and i attempted to infiltrate the suspected revolutionary camp we were successful in getting inside she felt her mouth go dry and she swallowed but but he gaius nodded his expression grave but he betrayed you he proved to be more interested in serving the cause of the insurrectionists than in remaining loyal to his lord amara blinked up at him startled yes milord but how did you gaius shrugged i didnt but i suspected when you reach my age amara people show themselves to you very clearly they write their intentions and beliefs through their actions their lies he shook his head i saw the signs in fidelias when he was only a little older than you but that seed has picked a particularly vicious moment to bloom you suspected amara asked but you told me nothing could you have kept it from him could you have played that kind of charade with him who taught you for the duration of the mission amara clenched her teeth rather than speak in anger gaius was right she never would have been able to keep such knowledge from fidelias why did you send me her words came out clipped precise gaius gave her a weary smile because you are the fastest cursor i have ever seen because you were a brilliant student at the academy resourceful stubborn and able to think on your feet because fidelias liked you and because i was sure of your loyalty bait amara said her words still with hard edges points you used me as bait you knew he wouldnt be able to resist trying to bring me with him recruit me essentially correct you would have sacrificed me if you hadnt come back i would know that you had failed in your mission probably because of fidelias either that or you would have cast your lot with the insurgents either way i would be sure of the color of fideliass cloak which was the point of the exercise hardly i needed the intelligence as well so you risked my life to get it gaius nodded yes cursor you swore your life to the service of the crown did you not amara looked down her face coloring anger and confusion and disappointment piling up in her belly yes milord then report i do have to be at dinner shortly amara took a breath and without looking up she recounted the events of the daywhat she and fidelias had seen what she knew about the insurgent legion and especially of the strength and estimated numbers of the knights accompanying it she looked up at the end of her report gaiuss face looked older the lines deeper somehow as though her words to him had drained out a little more of his life his youth his strength the note the one you were allowed to read gaius began a diversion milord i know an attempt to cast suspicion elsewhere i do not believe lord atticus to have a hand in this perhaps but remember that the note was addressed to the commander of the second legion gaius shook his head that would seem to indicate that more than one of the high lords is conspiring against me this may be the effort of one to ensure that the blame for the entire matter falls on the other assuming there are only two milord gaiuss eyes wrinkled further at the corners yes assuming all of them arent in it together eh the brief smile faded and that they wished details of my inner chambers from you seems to indicate that they believe they could accomplish an assassination and so take power directly surely not milord they could not kill you gaius shrugged not if i saw it coming but the power to shake mountains does little good if the knife is already buried in ones throat he grimaced one of the younger high lords it must be anyone of any age would simply use time as his assassin i am an old man no your majesty you are an old man an old man married to a willful and politically convenient child an old man who rarely sleeps at night and who needs to be on time to dinner he eyed amara up and down and said night is falling are you in condition to travel i believe so milord gaius nodded events are stirring all over alera i can feel it in my bones girl the march of feet the restless migration of beasts already the behemoths sing in the darkness off the western coast and the wild furies of the north country are preparing a cold winter this year a cold winter the first lord drew in a breath and closed his eyes and voices speak loudly tension gathers in one place the furies of earth and air and wood whisper everywhere that something dangerous is abroad and that the peace our land has enjoyed these past fifteen years nears its end metal furies hone the edges of swords and startle smiths at the forge the rivers and the rains wait for when they shall run red with blood and fire itself burns green of a night or blue rather than in scarlet and gold change is coming amara swallowed perhaps they are only coincidences milord they may not be gaius smiled again but the expression was skeletal wasted im not that old amara not yet and i have work for you attend amara nodded and focused on the image are you familiar with the significance of the calderon valley amara nodded once it lies just over the isthmus between alera and the plains beyond there is only one pass through the mountains and it runs through the valley if anyone wants to come into our lands afoot they must come through calderon valley anyone meaning the marat of course gaius said what else do you know of the place what they taught at the academy milord very fertile land profitable and it was where the marat killed your son milord yes the marat hordemaster he killed the princeps and set a chain of events into motion that will clutter the lecture halls and plague the students for a century to come the house of gaius has led alera for nearly a thousand years but when i am gone that will be done all that is left to me is to see to it that the power falls into responsible hands and it would seem that someone seeks to make that choice in my stead do you know who milord suspicions gaius said but i dare not voice more than that lest i accuse an innocent man and lose the support of the high lords altogether loyal and insurgent alike you will go to the calderon valley amara the marat are on the move i know it i feel it what do you wish me to do there milord you will observe the movements of any marat in the area gaius said and speak to the steadholders there to learn what passes amara tilted her head to one side you suspect that the marat and the recent insurgent activity are related milord the marat are easily made into tools amara and i suspect that someone has forged a dagger of them to thrust at my heart his eyes flashed and the river rippled around the feet of the water image in reaction to the emotion i may pass on my power to someone of worth but while i live and breathe they will not take it from me yes milord gaius gave her a grim smile if you should stumble over some connection between the two amara bring it to me if i had a scrap of proof to lay before the high lords i could settle this without needless bloodshed as you wish milord i will go there as swiftly as i am able tonight gaius said amara shook her head im not sure i can do that majesty im exhausted gaius nodded i will speak to the south wind it will help you get there more quickly amara swallowed what am i to look for milord do you have any suspicions if i know what to be on watch for gaius said no i need your eyes open and unprejudiced get to the valley it is where events are centering i want you representing my interests in them am i likely to face nearcertain death again milord amara let just a hint of barb slide into the words gaius tilted his head almost certainly cursor do you wish me to send another in your place amara shook her head i wish for you to answer a question gaius lifted his eyebrows what is your question amara looked steadily at gaiuss image how did you know milord how did you know i would remain true to the crown gaius frowned more lines appearing on his face he remained silent for a long moment before he said there are some people who will never understand what loyalty means they could tell you what it was of course but they will never know they will never see it from the inside they couldnt imagine a world where something like that was real like fidelias like fidelias gaius agreed youre a rare person though amara youre just the opposite she frowned you mean i know what loyalty is more than that you live within it you couldnt imagine a world in which you didnt you could no more betray what you held dear than you could will your heart to stop beating i am old amara and people reveal themselves to me he was quiet for a moment more and said i never doubted your loyalty only your ability to survive the mission and it appears that i may owe you an apology on that count cursor amara consider your graduation exercise a success amara felt pride stir in her an absurd feeling of pleasure that gaius would praise her so she felt her back straighten and her chin lift a little higher i am your eyes and ears to command milord gaius nodded once and behind amara the wind began to rise rustling over the trees like surf over sand making them whisper and sigh in a vast quiet chorus go with the furies then cursor for alera i will find what you need your majesty for alera chapter fidelias hated flying he sat on the litter facing ahead so that the wind sliced into his eyes and blew his hair straight back from his high forehead on the seat facing him sat aldrick the sword huge and relaxed as a newly fed lion odiana had curled up on aldricks lap to doze off hours before and the water witchs dark hair danced and played in the wind veiling the beauty of her features neither one evinced any signs of discomfort at the flight physical or otherwise i hate flying fidelias muttered he lifted a hand to shield his eyes from the wind and leaned over the edge of the litter a brilliant moon looming large among a sea of stars painted the landscape below in silver and black wooded hills rolled slowly beneath them a solid darkness broken here and there by silverkissed clearings and winding halfluminescent rivers four of the knights aeris from the camp bore them through the air one at each pole of the litter they wore harnesses that fitted them to the litter supporting the weight of the three people inside while the knights weight in turn was borne by the powerful furies at their command another halfdozen knights aeris flew in a loose ring around the litter and moonlight glittered on the steel of their arms and armor captain fidelias called to the lead knight the man glanced back over his shoulder murmured something and drifted back through the air toward the litter sir will it be much longer before we arrive in aquitaine no sir we should be there before the hour is out fidelias blinked that soon i thought you said it would take us until dawn the knight shook his head eyes cooly scanning the sky ahead fortune favors us sir the furies of the south are stirring and have brought us a strong wind to speed our way the former cursor frowned thats highly unusual at this season is it not captain the man shrugged its saved us hours of flight time and made it easier on everyone we havent even had to spell the men bearing the litter relax sir ill have you in the high lords palace before the witching hour and with that the soldier accelerated moving to take position ahead of the litter again fidelias frowned and resettled on his seat he glanced over the side of the litter again and his stomach jumped and fluttered with an irrational sensation of fear he knew that he was as safe flying in the litter escorted by knights aeris as anywhere in the realm but some part of his mind simply would not casually accept the vast distance between himself and the ground below here he was far from wood and earth far from the furies he could call to his service and that disturbed him he had to rely upon the strength of the knights with him rather than his own and everyone other than himself had in time inevitably disappointed him he folded his arms and bowed his head against the wind brooding gaius had used him from the very beginning used him with a purpose to be sure and never carelessly he had been far too valuable a tool to waste through misuse or neglect indeed at times the precarious peace of the entire realm had occasionally hinged upon his ability to accomplish on behalf of the crown fidelias felt his frown deepen gaius was oldthe old wolf that led the packand it was nothing more than a matter of time before he was hauled down to his death but despite that brutal simple truth gaius continued to fight against the inevitable he could have turned over power to a nominal heir a decade ago but instead he had held on wily and desperate and delayed matters for a decade by pitting the high lords against one another in bids to see who could position his daughter or niece to marry the first lord and give birth to the new princeps gaius with fideliass aid of course had played the lords off of one another with merciless precision until every high lord of alera spent years convinced that his candidate would surely be the one to wed gaius his eventual choice had pleased no one not even high lord parcius carias father and even the most dense of the high lords had realized in time that they had been played for fools the game had been well played but in the end it had all been for nothing the house of gaius had never been a fertile one and even if he had proved physically capable of producing an heir which fidelias remained unsure about the first lady had not as yet shown herself to be with child and palace rumor held that the first lord seldom went to the same bed in which his wife slept gaius was old he was dying the star of his house was falling from the heavens and anyone who blindly clung to the hem of his robes would fall with him like amara fidelias frowned while something nagged at him distracted him burned in his belly it was a pity to be sure that amara had chosen a fools crusade rather than making an intelligent decision surely if hed had more time it may have proved possible to encourage her to see a more rational point of view now instead he would have to act directly against her if she interfered again and he did not want to do that fidelias shook his head the girl had been his most promising student and he had let her come to mean too much to him he had destroyed some three score men and women in his years as a cursorsome of them as powerful and idealistic as amara he had never hesitated to perform his duty never let himself be distracted by anything so trivial as personal attachment his love was for alera and that was really the issue at hand fidelias served the realm not the first lord gaius was doomed delay of the transfer of power from gaiuss hands to another could only cause strife and bloodshed among the high lords who would wish to assume gaiuss station it might even come to a war of succession something unheard of since the dawn of aleran civilization but which was rumored to have been commonplace in the distant past and should that happen not only would the sons and daughters of alera die pointlessly fighting one another but the division itself would be a signal fire to the enemies of the realmthe savage icemen the bestial marat the ruthless canim and who knew what else in the unexplored wilds of the world above all else such weakening of the realms unity had to be circumvented and that meant establishing a strong ruler and swiftly already the high lords quietly defied the first lords authority it would only be a matter of time before the high lords and their cities disbanded the realm into a cluster of citynations and if that happened it would be simple for the enemies of mankind to quietly nibble away at those realms until nothing was left fidelias grimaced his belly burning more sharply it had to be done like a battlefield surgeon forced to remove a mangled limb there was nothing that would make it less gruesome the best one could hope for was to get it done as swiftly and cleanly as possible which led to aquitainus he was the most ruthless the most able and perhaps the strongest of the high lords fideliass stomach roiled he had betrayed gaius the codex the cursors betrayed his student amara he had turned his back on them to support a man who might become the most ruthless and bloodthirsty dictator alera had ever known the furies knew he had tried everything in his power to convince gaius to take another path fidelias had been forced to this it was necessary it had to be done his stomach burned as the glowing furylights of aquitaine appeared on the horizon wake up he murmured were almost there aldrick opened his eyes and focused on fidelias one hand absently caressed odianas dark wealth of hair and she let out a pleased little whimper in her sleep writhing in the mans lap with liquid sensuality before settling into stillness again the swordsman watched fidelias his expression unreadable deep thoughts old man aldrick asked some how will aquitaine react the big man pursed his lips it depends on what on what he is doing when we interrupt him with bad news is it all that bad aldrick smiled just hope hes up drinking hes usually in a pretty good mood tends to forget his anger by the time the hangover has worn off it was an idiots plan to begin with of course it was his he isnt a planner of deception or subterfuge but ive never met a man who could lead as strongly as he does or anyone with his raw power aldrick continued stroking the sleeping water witchs hair his expression thoughtful are you worried no fidelias lied im still too valuable to him perhaps for now aldrick said he smiled a mirthless expression but ill not be loaning you any money fidelias clucked his teeth direct action would have been premature in any case by escaping the girl may have done his grace the biggest favor of his life i dont doubt it aldrick murmured but somehow im almost certain that he wont see it that way fidelias studied the other mans face but the swordsmans features revealed nothing his grey eyes blinked lazily and his mouth curled into a smile as though taking amusement in fideliass lack of ability to gauge him the cursor frowned at the man a mild expression and turned to watch the city of aquitaine come into sight first came the lights firecrafters by the dozens maintained the lights along the citys streets and they burned with a gentle radiance through the mistshrouded evening all soft yellows deep amber pale crimson until the hill upon which the city was built seemed itself to be one enormous living flame garbed in warmth and flickering color upon the citys walls and just beyond them lights burned with a cold blue brilliance casting the ground far around into stark illumination and long black shadows their harsh glare vigilant against any wouldbe invaders as the litter glided down and closer fidelias could begin to make out shapes in the shifting lights statues stood silent and lovely on the streets houses all elegant lines and high arches contested with one another to prove the most skillfully crafted the most beautifully lit fountains sparkled and flickered some of them illuminated from below so that they burned violet or emerald in the darkness pools of liquid flames trees rose up around houses and lined the streets thriving and beautiful life that had been crafted as carefully as every other part of the city they too wore veils of colored light and their leaves already changed into autumns brilliant hues shone in too many shades to count the sound of a bell tolling the late hour rose to the descending litter fidelias heard the trod of hooves upon paving stones somewhere below and raucous singing from a night club of some kind music came up from a garden party as the litter passed over it strings supporting a sweet alto flute that pursued a gentle haunting melody the smell of wood smoke and spices still drifted on the evening breezes along with the scent of lateblooming flowers and of rain on the wind to call aquitaine beautiful was to call the ocean wet fidelias thought accurate enough in its way but wholly insufficient to the task they were challenged by a barking voice before they had come within a long bowshot of the high lords manor a walled fortress surmounting the hill upon which the city stood fidelias watched as a man in the sable and scarlet surcoat of aquitaine swept down from the air above a dozen more hovered somewhere in the night sky above them unseenbut the cursor could feel the eddies of wind that their furies kicked up in keeping them aloft the challenger of the knights aeris guarding the high lords manor exchanged a pass phrase with the captain of fideliass own escort though the exchange had the comfortable routine air of a formality then the group swept on forward down into the manors courtyard while more guards watched from the walls along with leering statues wrought in the shapes of hunchbacked gangly men the moment fidelias stepped from the litter he felt the light steady tremors of power in the earth that led back to each statue on the wall and found himself staring at the statues gargoyles he breathed all of them aldrick glanced at the statues and then to fidelias and nodded once how long have they been kept here as long as anyone remembers aldrick rumbled aquitaine is that strong fidelias pursed his lips in thought he did not agree with the principles of anyone who kept furies within such a restrictive confinemuch less those who would trap them there for generations but it certainly confirmed had he been in any doubt that aquitaines raw power was more than sufficient for the task at hand the knights aeris accompanying the litter departed toward a bunkhouse for food and drink while the captain of aquitaines guard a young man with an earnest expression and alert blue eyes opened the door to the litter and extended a courteous hand to those within then he led them inside the manor proper fidelias took casual note of the manor as he followed the young captain marking the doors the windows the presence or evident lack of guards it was an old habit and one he would be foolish to surrender he wanted to know the best way to leave any place he walked into aldrick walked beside him casually carrying the stillsleeping odiana as though she weighed no more than an armload of cloth each footstep something solid focused the young captain swung open a pair of double doors leading into a long feasting hall complete with mountainstyle fire pits built into the floors already burning though the season had not yet grown truly cold that dim crimson light was the only illumination in the hall and fidelias took a moment to pause inside the doors and allow his eyes to adjust the hall stretched out lined with a double row of smooth marble pillars curtains covered the walls providing a bit of aesthetic warmth and the perfect cover for eavesdroppers guards or assassins the tables had been taken down for the night and the only furniture in the hall was a table and several chairs upon a dais at the far end the shapes of people moved about there and fidelias could hear the gentle music of strings the captain led them all straight down the hall and toward the dais upon a large chair covered in the fur of a grass lion from the amaranth vale sprawled a manas tall as aldrick fidelias judged but more slender and with the appearance of a young man in the prime of his youth aquitainus had high cheekbones and a narrow face led by a strong jaw whose lines were softened by the tumble of dark golden hair that fell to his shoulders he wore a simple scarlet blouse with black leather breeches and soft black boots a goblet dangled lazily in one hand while the other held the end of a long strip of silken cloth that slowly unwound from the shapely girl dancing before him gradually baring more and more of her skin aquitainus had eyes of pitch black stark in that narrow face and he watched the dancing slave with an almost feverish intensity fideliass eyes were drawn to the man standing behind and just a bit to one side of the high lords chair in the dimness details were difficult to make out the man wasnt tall perhaps only a few inches more than fidelias himself but was strongly built his posture casually powerful relaxed he bore a sword at his hipthat much fidelias could seeand a very slight bulge in his dark grey tunic perhaps revealed the presence of a hidden weapon fidelias met the silent mans eyes briefly and found the strangers gaze to be opaque assessing if you value your head captain aquitainus murmured without looking away from the girl it can wait until this dance is done his voice fidelias noted carried the faintest trace of a drunken slur no your grace fidelias said stepping forward and past the captain it cant the high lords back stiffened and he turned his head slowly toward fidelias the weight of the mans dark eyes fell onto the cursor like a physical blow and he drew in a sharp breath as he felt the stirring in the earth beneath them a slow and sullen vibration deep within the stonea reflection of the high lords anger fidelias assumed a casually confident stance and reacted as though aquitainus had acknowledged him he clasped a fist over his heart and bowed there was a long silence before fidelias heard aquitainuss reaction the man let out a low and relaxed laugh that echoed throughout the nearly deserted hall fidelias straightened again to face the high lord careful to keep his expression schooled into neutral respect so aquitainus purred this is the infamous fidelias cursor callidus if it please your grace cursor no longer you seem rather unconcerned with my pleasure aquitainus noted with a droll roll of the hand still clasping the dancing girls cloth i almost find it disrespectful no disrespect was intended your grace there are grave matters that require your attention require my attention murmured aquitaine with an elegant arch of brow my i dont think ive been spoken to in that fashion since just before my last tutor took that untimely fall your grace will find me a good deal more agile rats are agile sniffed aquitaine the oafs real problem was that he thought he knew everything ah fidelias said you will not face that difficulty with me aquitaines dark eyes shone because you really do know everything no your grace only everything of importance the high lord narrowed his eyes he remained silent for two score of fideliass quickening heartbeats but the cursor refused to let his nervousness show he took slow and even breaths and remained silent waiting aquitaine snorted and drank off his remaining wine with an effortless flick of his wrist he held the goblet out to one side waited a beat then released it the blocky man beside him reached out a hand snake swift and caught it the stranger walked to the table on the dais and refilled the goblet from a glass bottle my sources told me that you had a reputation for insouciance fidelias aquitaine murmured but i had no idea that it would be so readily forthcoming if it please your grace perhaps we might table this discussion for the moment time may be of the essence the high lord accepted the goblet of wine from the stranger glancing at the pretty slave now kneeling on the floor before him head bowed aquitaine let out a wistful sigh i suppose he said very well then report fidelias glanced at the stranger then at the slave and then at the hanging curtains perhaps a more private setting would be more appropriate your grace aquitaine shook his head you can speak freely here fidelias may i present count calix of the feverthorn border in service to his grace high lord of rhodes he has shown himself to be a shrewd and capable advisor and a loyal supporter of our cause fidelias shifted his attention to the blocky man beside the high lords seat the feverthorn border isnt that where that illegal slaving operation got broken up a few years ago count calix spared the former cursor a thinlipped smile when he spoke his voice came out in a light rich tenor completely at odds with the heavy power evident in his body i believe so yes i understand that both the slavers consortium and the dianic league gave you commendations for valor above and beyond the call of duty fidelias shrugged watching the other man a token gesture i never was able to turn up enough information to bring charges against the slave rings leader he paused for a moment then added whoever he was a pity said the count i imagine you cost someone a great deal of money most likely fidelius agreed it could give a man good reason to hold a grudge fidelius smiled im told those can be inimical to ones good health perhaps ill put it to the test one day should you survive the experience be sure to let me know what you learned aquitaine watched the exchange his dark eyes sparkling with mirth i hate to interrupt your fencing gentlemen but i have other interests this evening and we have issues to discuss he took another sip of wine and waved at the other chairs on the dais sit down you too aldrick should i have someone carry odiana to her chambers so that she can rest thank you sir aldrick rumbled ill keep her with me and take care of her later if its all the same to you they settled down into chairs facing aquitaine the high lord gestured and the slave girl hurried to one side returning with the traditional cloth and bowl of scented water then the girl settled at fideliass feet and unlaced his sandals she removed the stockings beneath and with warm gentle fingers began washing fideliass feet he frowned down at the slave pensively but at a second gesture from the high lord fidelias uttered a concise report of the events at the camp of the renegade legion aquitaines expression darkened steadily throughout until at the end it had grown to a scowl let me test my understanding of what you are telling me fidelias aquitaine murmured not only were you unable to attain intelligence regarding gaiuss chambers from this girlin addition she escaped from you and every one of my knights fidelias nodded my status has been compromised and she has almost certainly reported to the crown by now the second legion has already been disbanded into individual centuries aldrick supplied the slave moved to kneel at his feet and to remove his sandals and stockings as well the single long piece of scarlet cloth wound around her had begun to slip and gape displaying an unseemly amount of supple smooth skin aldrick regarded her with casual admiration as he continued they will meet at the rendezvous as planned except for the windwolves fidelias said i advised aldrick to send them ahead to the staging area what snarled aquitaine rising that was not according to the plan the blocky calix came to his feet as well his eyes bright i warned you your grace if the mercenaries are not seen in parcia over the winter there will be nothing to link them to anyone but you you have been betrayed aquitaines furious gaze settled on fidelias well cursor is what he says true if you consider adjusting to changing conditions in the field treachery your grace fidelias said then you may name me traitor if it pleases you he twists your own words against you your grace calix hissed he is using you he is a cursor loyal to gaius if you keep listening to him he will lead you to your death at gaiuss feet kill him before he poisons your thoughts any further he this murderous thug and his mad whorethey all want nothing but your destruction fidelias felt his lips tighten into a smile he looked from aquitaine to calixthen to aldrick where the slave crouched at his feet her lips parted her eyes staring over aldricks lap odiana neither stirred nor spoke but he could see her mouth turn up into a smile ah fidelias said his own smile spreading wider he folded one ankle over the other knee i see aquitaine narrowed his eyes and stalked over to stand over fideliass chair you have interrupted a pleasant moment with the anniversary gift given me by my own dear wife you have it would seem failed miserably in what you said you would do for me additionally you have dispatched my troops in a fashion which could embarrass me acutely before the rest of the lords council not to mention the senate he leaned down toward fidelias and said very gently i think it would be in your own best interest to give me a reason not to kill you in the next few seconds very well fidelias said if you will indulge me briefly your grace i may be able to let you decide for yourself whom you can trust no sputtered calix my lord do not allow this deceitful slive to so use you aquitaine smiled but it was a cold hard expression his gaze swept to the rhodisian count and calix dropped silent at his glance my patience is wearing very thin at the rate were going gentlemen someone will be dead by the end of this conversation heavy tension fell onto the room thick as a winter blanket calix licked his lips throwing a wideeyed glare at fidelias odiana made a soft sound and stirred artlessly on aldricks lap before settling againleaving aldricks right arm free to reach for his sword fidelias noted the slave seemed to take notice of the tension as well and crawled a bit backward until she was no longer between the high lord and anyone else in the room fidelias smiled he folded his hands and rested them on his knee if it please your grace i will need paper and pen paper and pen what for easier to show you your grace but if you remain unsatisfied after i offer you my life as penance aquitaines teeth flashed my esteemed wife would say that your life is lost in either case were she here were she here your grace fidelias agreed may i proceed aquitaine stared down at fidelias for a moment then he gestured toward the slave who went scurrying returning a moment later with parchment and pen aquitaine said be quick my patience is rapidly running out of course your grace fidelias accepted the paper and pen dipped the quill into the inkpot and swiftly made a few notes on the paper careful to let no one see what he was writing no one spoke and the scritching of the quill seemed loud in the hall along with the crackle of the fire pits and the impatient tapping of the high lords boot fidelias blew on the letters then folded the paper in half and offered it to aquitaine without looking away from the man he said your grace i advise you to accelerate your plans contact your forces and move at once calix stepped forward at once to aquitaines side your grace i must disagree in the strongest terms now is the time for caution if we are discovered now all will fall into ruin aquitaine stared down at the letter then lifted his eyes to calix and you believe that by doing so you will protect my interests and those of my lord calix said he lifted his chin but the gesture meant little when the high lord towered over him think of who is advising you your grace ad hominem noted aquitaine is a notoriously weak logical argument and is usually used to distract the focus of a discussionto move it from an indefensible point and to attack the opponent your grace calix said ducking his head please listen to reason to act now would leave you at somewhat less than half your possible strength only a fool throws away an advantage like that aquitaine lifted his eyebrows only a fool my calix swallowed your grace i only meant what you meant is of little concern to me count calix what you said however is another matter entirely your grace please do not be rash your plans have been well laid for so long do not let them fall apart now aquitaine glanced down at the paper and asked and what do you propose your excellency calix squared his shoulders put simply your gracestick to the original plan send the windwolves to winter in rhodes gather your legions when the weather breaks in the spring and use them then bide wait in patience there is wisdom who dares wins murmured aquitaine back i cannot help but wonder at how generous rhodes seems to be calix how he is willing to host the mercenaries to have his name connected with them when the matter is settled how thoroughly he has instructed you to protect my interests the high lord is always most interested in supporting his allies your grace aquitaine snorted of course he is we are all so generous with one another and forgiving no calix the cursor former cursor your grace fidelias put in former cursor of course the former cursor here has done a very good job of predicting what you would tell me aquitaine consulted the paper he held i wonder why that is he moved his eyes to fidelias and arched his eyebrows fidelias watched calix and said your grace i believe that rhodes sent calix here to you as a spy and eventually as an assassin why you calix snarled fidelias overrode the other man his voice iron calix wishes you to wait so that there is time to remove you over the winter your grace the mercenaries will have several months to be tempted by bribes meanwhile robbing you of their strength then when the campaign begins he will have key positions filled with people beholden to rhodes he can kill you in the confusion of battle and therefore remove the threat you represent to him calix here was likely intended to be the assassin i will not stand for this insult your grace aquitaine looked at calix and said yes you will to fidelias he said and your advice what would you have me do fidelias shrugged south winds rose tonight where there should have been none only the first lord could call them at this time of year at a guess he called the furies of the southern air to assist amara or one of the other cursors northeither to the capital or to the valley itself it could be coincidence aquitaine pointed out i dont believe in coincidence your grace fidelias said the first lord is far from blind and he has powers of furycrafting i can hardly begin to accurately assess he has called the south winds he is hastening someone north toward the calderon valley impossible aquitaine said he rubbed at his jaw with the back of one hand but then gaius was always an impossible man your grace calix said surely you arent seriously considering aquitaine lifted a hand i am your excellency your grace calix hissed this common born dog has called me a murderer to my face aquitaine surveyed the scene for a moment then quite deliberately took three or four steps away from them and turned his back as though to study a tapestry hanging on one wall your grace calix said i demand your justice in this matter i rather tend to believe fidelias your excellency he sighed work it out among yourselves i will deal appropriately with whoever is left fidelias smiled your excellency please allow me to add that you stink like a sheep that your mouth froths with idiocy and poison and that your guts are as yellow as a springtime daffodil he steepled his fingers regarding calix and said very soft and distinctly you are a coward calixs face flushed red his eyes wild and he moved a sudden liquid blurring of his arms and hips the sword at his side leapt free of its scabbard and toward fideliass throat as fast as calix was aldrick moved faster his arm alone whipped into motion drawing the blade from his hip across the limp form of the woman on his lap steel met steel in a ringing chime only inches from fideliass face aldrick slid to his feet odiana curling her legs beneath her as she lowered herself to the floor the swordsmans face remained upon calixs calix eyed aldrick and let out a sneer mercenary do you think you can best an aleran lord in battle aldrick kept his blade lightly pressed to calixs and shrugged the only man who has ever matched me in battle was araris valerian himself teeth shone white in aldricks smile and you arent araris there was a rasp and then steel glittered and blurred in the dim light of the hall fidelias watched hardly able to keep up with the speed of the attacks and counters in the space of a slow breath their swords met a dozen times chiming out casting sparks from one anothers blades the swordsmen parted briefly then clashed together again and the duel was over calix blinked his eyes widening and then lifted a hand to his throat as scarlet blood rushed from it he tried to say something else but was unable to make any sound then the rhodesian count fell to the ground and lay unmoving but for a few faint tremors as his faltering heartbeat pumped the blood from his body odiana looked up at aquitaine with a small dreamy smile and asked ought i save him your graced aquitaine glanced back at calix and shrugged there seems to be little point in it dear yes lord odiana turned adoring eyes to aldnck and watched as the swordsman knelt down to wipe his blade clean of blood on calixs cloak the man clenched his fingers and let out a bubbling gasp aldnck ignored him fidelias rose and went to aquitaines side was that to your satisfaction your graced calix was useful aquitaine said then he glanced at fidelias and asked how did you know fidelias tilted his head that he was planning to kill you were you able to sense it in him aquitaine nodded once i knew to look for it he fell apart as you described the role rhodes had assigned him well probably find a furybound dagger in his coat with my likeness and name etched into the steel aldrick grunted rolled the notquite dead calix onto his back and rummaged through his jacket the telltale bulge fidelias had seen earlier proved to be made by a small dagger with a compact hilt aldnck let out a hiss as he touched the knife and set it down hurriedly fidelias asked furybound aldrick nodded nasty one strong i think the knife should be destroyed do it aquitaine said now tonight odiana go with him i wish to speak to fidelias alone the pair rested fist over their hearts and bowed their heads then odiana slipped up to the swordsmans side and pressed to him until he circled her shoulders with one arm the two left without looking back on the floor calix let out his death rattle and his eyes glazed over mouth hanging slightly open how did you know aldrick repeated fidelias glanced back at the dead rhodesian count and shrugged to be honest your grace i didnt know i guessed aquitaine halfsmiled based upon what too many years in this line of work and ive met rhodes he wouldnt step an inch from his way to help someone else and hed cut off his own nose just to spite his face calix was being too pleasant aquitaine murmured indeed perhaps i should have seen it sooner the important thing is that you acted promptly when you did see it your grace fidelias aquitaine said i do not like you you have no reason to but i think i can respect you after a fashion and if its to be a choice of who will put the knife in my back i would rather it be you than rhodes or one of his lackeys i think fidelias felt his mouth tug up at the corners thank you make no mistake man aquitaine turned to face him i prefer to work with someone to forcing them to my will but i can do it and i can kill you if you become a problem you know this yes fidelias nodded good aquitaine said the high lord covered his mouth with his hand and yawned it is late and you are right about moving quickly before the crown has a chance to act get a few hours sleep at dawn you leave for the calderon valley fidelias bowed his head again your gracei dont have any chambers here as yet aquitaine waved a hand toward the slave you take him to your chambers for the night give him whatever he wants and see to it that he is awake by dawn the slave bowed her head without speaking or looking up have you studied much history fidelias only a bit your grace fascinating the course of a century of history can be set in a few short hours a few precious days focal events fideliasand those people who are a part of them become the ones to create tomorrow i have sensed a distant stirring of forces from the direction of the valley gaius is already arousing the furies of the calderon perhaps history is stirring waiting to be nudged in one direction or the other i dont know about history your grace i just want to do my job aquitaine nodded once then do it i will expect word from you and without another word the high lord strode from the hall fidelias watched him go and waited until the doors had closed behind him to turn to the slave girl he offered her a hand and she took it her fingers warm and soft her expression uncertain fidelias straightened his posture bent and placed a formally polite kiss to the back of the slaves fingers your grace he said high lady invidia may i convey to you my heartfelt admnation the slaves expression flickered with shocked surprise then she threw back her head and laughed her features changed subtle and significant until the woman standing before him appeared to be several years older her eyes holding a great deal more wisdom her eyes were grey like ashes and her hair had delicate feathers of frost all through it though her features looked no older than a woman nearmg her thirtieth yearall of the great houses had that kind of skill at watercraftmg or nearly any other form of furycraftmg one could name how did you guess she asked not even my lord husband saw through the disguise your hands fidelias replied when you washed my feet your fingers were warm no slave in her right mind would have been anything less than anxious in that room she would have had chilly fingers and no one but you i judged would have had the temerity or skill to attempt such a thing with his grace high lady aquitaines eyes shone a most astute assessment she said yes i had been using calix to find out more about what rhodes was up to and tonight was the night i thought i might get rid of him i made sure that my husband was in a mood he would not enjoy being taken from and waited for the rhodesian fool to shove his foot down his own throat though i must say you seemed to pick up on what was happening and ensure that it carried through without any hints from me and not the least bit of furycrafting to assist you logic is a fury all its own she smiled but then her expression grew serious intent the operation in the valley will it succeed it might fidelias said if it does it might accomplish what no amount of fighting or plotting could he could win alera without ever spilling aleran blood not directly in any case said lady aquitaine she sniffed attis has few compunctions about blood he is as subtle as a roaring volcano but if his strength can be properly focused fidelias inclined his head just so the woman studied him for a moment then took his hand her features shimmered and slid back into the mask of the slave girl she had worn before the grey smoothing out of her hair her eyes shading toward a dark muddy brown rather than grey in any case i have my orders regarding you this night fidelias hesitated your grace lady aquitaine smiled she touched her fingertips to his mouth and said dont make me press the point come with me i will see to it that you rest deeply in what time you have she turned and started walking again you have far to go come the dawn chapter when twilight fell tavi knew that he was still in danger he had not seen or heard either of his pursuers since he had slithered down an almost sheer rock cliff using several frail saplings to slow what would have been a deadly plummet to a careening slide it had been a perilous gamble and tavi had counted on the saplings frailty to betray the heavy marat warrior killing or at least slowing him the plan had been only a partial success the marat looked once at the cliff and set off at a run to find a safe place to descend it bought tavi enough of a lead to attempt to lose his pursuer and he thought that he had begun to widen his lead the marat were not like the aleransthey had no ability at furycrafting though they were reported to possess an uncanny understanding of all the beasts of the field it meant that the marat had no vast advantagelike tavi he had only his wits and skill to guide him the storm settled over the valley in a glowering veil as the light began to fade thunder growled forth but there was no rise of wind no fall of rain or sleet the storm waited for night to fall in full while tavi kept a nervous eye on both the sky and the barrens around him his legs ached and his chest burned but he had avoided the marat and just before sundown he emerged from the barrens onto the causeway several miles west of the lane to bernardholt he found a deep patch of shade beside a windfall and crouched there panting allowing his tired muscles a brief rest lightning flashed he hadnt meant to move so far to the west instead of being nearly home again tavi would have an hourlong run just to reach the lane down to the steadholt thunder rumbled this time so loud that it shook needles from the fallen pine beside him there was a low dull roar from the direction of garados and in a moment tavi heard it growing nearer the rain had finally begun it came in a wave of halffrozen sleet and tavi barely had time to pull up his hood before a furious frozen wind howled down from the north driving rain and ice alike before it the storm devoured whatever meager scraps of daylight remained and drowned the valley in cold miserable darkness barring frequent flares of lightning skittering among the storm clouds though his cloak had been made to shed water no fabric in alera would have kept the rain and sleet of the furystorm out for long his cloak grew cold and wet clinging to him and the bitter wind drove the chill straight through his garments and into his bones tavi shivered hard if he remained where he was he would die from exposure to the storm in only hoursunless a bloodthirsty windmane beat the cold to the punch and though brutus had surely reached the steadholt with bernard by now he could not rely upon any of the holdfolk to rescue him they knew better than to expose themselves to a furystorm tavi peered at the windfall in the next lightning flash there was a hollowed out space underneath thick with pine needlesand it looked dry tavi started crawling inside and the next lightning flash showed him an image from a nightmare the windfall already had occupantshalf a dozen slives the supple darkscaled lizards were nearly as long as tavi was tall and the nearest lay within arms reach the lizard thrashed restlessly stirring from its torpor it opened its jaws and let out a syrupy hiss showing rows of needlepointed teeth a thick yellow liquid coated the slives front fangs tavi had seen slive venom at work before if the slive struck him he would grow warm and sluggish until he sank slowly down to the ground and then the slives would drag him still alive into their lair and eat him tavis first reaction was a terrified desire to spring awaybut fast motion could trigger the surprised slive even if the slive missed the filthy little scavengers would regard his flight as a sign that he was prey to be pursued and eaten he could outrun them on open ground but slives had a nasty tendency to remain on the trail of their prey sometimes following for days waiting for their target to sleep before moving in for the kill fear and excitement made tavi tremble but he forced himself to remain calm he withdrew as slowly and smoothly as he could he had just gotten out of the slives striking range when the beast hissed again and bolted out of its shelter and toward the boy tavi let out a panicked scream his light baritone cracking into a childs higher pitch as he did he threw himself back from the slives deadly bite got his feet underneath him and started to run then to his complete surprise he heard someone call out in an answering shout one nearly drowned out by the rising winds tavi snarled in frustration the memory of the marat warrior and his terrible partner came back to him in a flood of terror had they caught up to him the wind brought him another shout the pitch too high to be the marat there was no mistaking the panic and fear in it please someone help tavi bit his lip looking down the causeway toward his home and safety then facing the opposite way toward the cry for help he took a shaking breath and turned west away from his home and forced his tired legs into motion again running along the pale stone of the causeway the lightning flashed again a shuddering flame that swept from cloud to cloud overhead first green then blue then red as though the furies of the skies had gone to battle against one another light bathed the rainswept valley for nearly half a minute while thunder shook the stones of the causeway and halfdeafened him shapes began to whirl down toward the ground through the tumult and rain and raced and danced across the valley floor the windmanes had followed the storm their luminous forms swirled and gusted effortlessly among the winds palegreen clouds nebulous and vaguely human in shape with long reaching arms and skeletal faces the windmanes screamed their hatred and hunger their cries rising even above the bellowing thunder tavi felt terror slow his legs but he gritted his teeth and pressed on until he could see that most of the windmanes in sight swirled around and around a central point their pale sharpnailed hands reaching in the center of the ghostly cyclone there stood a young woman tavi had never seen before she was tall and slender not unlike his own aunt isana but there the resemblance to his aunt ended the woman had skin of dark golden brown like the traders from the southernmost cities of alera her hair was straight and fine whipped wildly about her by the wind and was almost the same color as her skin giving her something of the appearance of a golden statue her features were stark striking if not precisely lovely with high cheekbones and a long slender nose softened by a generous mouth her face was set in a grimace of desperation and defiance she wore a bloodstained cloth around her arm and it looked as though she had torn her ragged coarse skirts to make it her blouse was stained with grime and pressed against her by the rain and a woven leather slaves collar circled her slender throat as tavi watched one of the windmanes curled toward her in a graceful swoop the girl cried out throwing one hand toward the windmane and tavi saw a pale blue stirring in the airnot as sharp or as well defined as the windmanes themselves but flashing there momentarily nonetheless the spectral outline of a longlegged horse lashing out with its forelegs at the womans attacker the windmane screamed and fell back and the womans fury drove forward though it moved more sluggishly than the manes more slowly three more manes rushed the air furys flanks and the woman lifted her weight from a branch she had leaned upon hobbling forward to swipe at the windmanes with desperate futility tavi reacted without thinking he lurched into a tottering run clawing at his pouch as he did his balance wavered in the darkness between thunderbolts but only a breath later the clouds lit up again blue red and green lightning warred for domination of the skies one of the windmanes abruptly whipped around toward him and then surged at him through the frigid rain tavi clawed a smaller package from his pouch and tore it open the windmane howled in a spinetingling scream spreading its claws wide tavi grabbed at the crystals of salt within the packet and hurled a portion of them at the windmane as it charged him half a dozen crystals tore through the fury like lead weights through cheesecloth the windmane let out an agonized scream a note that sent terrified chills racing down tavis spine and into his belly it curled in upon itself green fire flaming up and over it as it began to tear wherever the crystals had hit in seconds the mane tore apart into smaller fragments that dispersed and vanished into the galegone the others of its kind scattered out into a wide circle letting out screeches of rage the slave looked back at tavi her eyes wide with desperate hope she clutched at her stick and hobbled toward him the ragged shape of her fury once more becoming unseen when the windmanes drew away salt she shouted through the storm you have salt tavi managed to draw a ragged breath and to shout back not much his heart thudded and lurched in his chest and he hurried to the slaves side casting a look out and around him at the pale phosphorescence of the windmanes circling the pair at a wary distance bloody crows he swore we cant stay out here ive never seen so many in one storm the slave squinted out at the darkness shivering but her voice came to him clearly can your furies shelter us at all tavi felt a sickly little rush in his belly of course they couldnt as he didnt have any no then weve got to get to shelter that mountain there could be a cave no tavi blurted not that mountain it doesnt like trespassers the girl pressed her hand against her head panting she looked exhausted is there a choice tavi cudgeled his wits to work to remember but fear and exhaustion and cold made them as sluggish as a snowcovered slive there was something he should remember something that might help if he could just think of what it was yes he shouted finally theres a place it isnt far from here if i can find it how far asked the slave eyeing the circling windmanes her words trembling as her body shook with cold a mile maybe more in the dark in this she shot him an incredulous look well never make it were not spoiled for choice tavi called back over the wind its that or nothing can you find it the girl asked i dont know can you walk that far she looked hard at him for a moment during another strobe of lightning hazel eyes intent hard yes she said give me some of the salt tavi passed over half of the scant handful of crystals left to him and the slave accepted them closing her fingers over them tightly furies she said well never get that far especially if we never get started tavi shouted and tugged at her arm come on he turned to move away but the girl abruptly leapt at him and shouldered him hard to one side tavi fell with a yelp startled and confused he climbed back to his feet cold and shivering his voice sharp and high what are you doing the slave slowly straightened meeting his eyes she looked tired barely holding on to her wooden club on the ground at her feet lay a dead slive its head had been neatly crushed tavi looked from it to the slave and saw the dark blood staining the end of her club you saved me he blurted lightning flared again in the cold and the gale tavi saw the slave smile baring her teeth in defiance even as she shivered lets not let it go to waste get us out of this storm and well be even he nodded and peered around lightning showed him the strip of the causeway a dark straight line and tavi took his bearings from it then he turned his back on the looming shape of garados and started off into the darkness fervently hoping that he could find the shelter before the windmanes recovered their courage and renewed their attack chapter isana woke to the sound of feet pounding up the stairs to her room the day had passed and night had fallen while she slept and she could hear the anxious rattle of rain and sleet on the roof she sat up though it made her head pound to do it mistress isana gasped a breathless beritte she tripped in the darkness at the top of the stairs and stumbled to the floor with a gasp and an unladylike curse lamp isana mumbled forcing out a familiar effort of will the spark imp in the lamp flickered to life on its wick giving the room a low golden glow she pressed the heels of her hands to her temples trying to sort out her rushing thoughts rain pounded and she heard the wind gust into an angry howl lightning flickered outside followed swiftly by an odd bellowing thunder the storm isana breathed it doesnt sound right beritte gathered herself to her feet and bobbed in a hasty curtsey hollybells the scarlet flowers just beginning to wilt dropped petals to the floor its horrible mistress horrible everyones afraid and the steadholder the steadholder is here and hes badly hurt mistress bitte sent me to fetch you isana jerked in a sharp breath bernard she pushed herself out of bed rising to her feet her head throbbed with pain as she rose and she had to rest a hand against the wall to keep herself from falling isana took a deep breath trying to still herself against the rising panic inside her to steel herself against the pain dimly now she could feel the fear and anger and anxiety of the rest of the people in the steadholt rising up from the hall below they would need strength and leadership now more than ever all right she said opening her eyes and forcing her features to smooth out take me to him beritte rushed out of isanas room and the woman followed her with short determined steps as she stepped out into the hallway the anxious fear flowing up from the room below began to press more firmly against her almost like a cold damp cloth that clung to her skin and began to seep inside her she shivered and at the top of the stairs paused for a moment forcing the cold sensation away from her thoughts until it no longer pressed so tightly against her the fear would not simply go away she knew but for the moment it was enough that she distance herself from it make herself functional again isana then walked down the stairs into bernardholts great hall the room was fully a hundred feet long half as wide and made entirely of bedrock granite long ago raised from the earth the living quarters above had been added on wood beam and brick construction but the hall itself was a single shaped piece of stone wrought by long and exhausting hours of furycrafting from the bones of the earth storms no matter how fierce could not damage the great hall or anyone sheltered within it or the only other such building in the steadholtthe barn where precious livestock lived the hall was crowded with folk all of the steadholts residents were there representing several large families most were gathered around one of the several trestle tables that had been set out earlier in the evening and the food that had been in preparation since before dawn had been taken to the tables and laid out upon them the mood of the room was anxiouseven the children who normally would have been screeching and playing games of chase as the storm gave them a virtual holiday seemed subdued and quiet the loudest voices in the hall were tense murmurs and every time the thunder roared outside folk would fall silent looking toward the doors of the hall the hall was divided fires burned in the hearths at either end at the far fire the steadholders had gathered at a small table beritte was leading her toward the other where bernard was laid between them the holdfolk had gathered in separate groups close together with blankets laid by for sleeping on should the storm last through the night the talk was subdued perhaps due to the confrontation earlier that day isana thought and no one seemed to want to be too near either of the fireplaces isana strode past beritte and toward the nearer fire old bitte the steadholts furycraft teacher was crouched down beside where they had laid bernard out on a pallet near the fire she was an ancient frail woman whose long white braid hung to the small of her back her hands shook as a matter of course and she couldnt walk far but she was still confident her eyes and her spirit undimmed by the years bernards face had the stark pallor of a corpse and for a moment isana felt her throat tighten with terror but then his chest rose and fell in a slow ragged breath and she closed her eyes steadying herself again he was thickly covered with blankets of soft wool except for his right leg which was smeared with blood pale and uncovered bandages also soaked in blood had been wound around his thigh but isana could see that they would need changing shortly isana old bitte croaked her voice gently ragged with the roughness of her years ive done all i can for him child needle and thread can only do so much what happened isana asked we dont know bitte said sitting back he has a terrible wound on his thigh perhaps a beast though it could be a wound from an axe or a blade it looks like he managed to put a tourniquet on it and to let it out once or twice we may be able to save the legbut he lost so much blood hes unconscious and i dont know if hell wake up again a bath isana said we need to draw him a bath bitte nodded ive sent for one and it should be here in a few moments isana nodded once and get tavi over here i want to hear what happened to my brother bitte looked up at isana dark and keen eyes sad tavi didnt come home with him child what fear flooded her swift and chill and horrible she had to fight to push it aside covering the effort by pulling tendrils that had escaped her braid back from her face calm she was a leader in this steadholt she had to appear calm controlled didnt come home with him no hes not here weve got to find him isana said this is a furystorm hell be defenseless only that poor idiot fade would go out into the storm at all child bitte said in an even tone he went out to make sure the barn doors were sealed and was the one who found bernard the furies watch over fools and children they say perhaps they will help tavi as well she leaned forward and said lower because no one here can do anything about it no isana insisted we have to find him several of the men of the steadholt struggled down the stairs carrying the big copper bathtub they set it down on the floor nearby and then began with the help of some of the children to relay buckets of water to the tub from the spigot on the wall isana bitte said her voice frank almost cold youre exhausted youre the only one i know who has a chance of bringing bernard back but i doubt youll be able to do even that much less find tavi in this weather it doesnt matter isana said the boy is my responsibility old bittes hand warm and surprisingly strong gripped her wrist the boy is out there in that storm hes found shelter by now isana or hes dead you must focus on what you do nowor bernard will be dead as well the fear the anxiety pressed closer in tune with the terror rising inside of her tavi she shouldnt have let herself become so distracted with the preparations shouldnt have let tavi deceive her he was her responsibility the image of tavi caught in the storm torn to shreds by the windmanes flashed to the front of her thoughts and she let out a quiet sound of frustration helplessness she opened her eyes to find her hands shaking isana looked at bitte and said ill need help old bitte nodded but her expression was nervous ive spoken to the hold women and theyll give you what they can but it may not be enough without skilled watercrafting there would be no chance at all of saving him and even with it the hold women isana snapped why not otto and roth theyre steadholders they owe it to bernard for that matter why arent they caring for him already old bitte grimaced they wont isana i already asked isana stared at the old matron startled after a moment she asked they what bitte looked down they wont help none of them in the name of all the furies why not the matron shook her head im not sure the storm has everyone nervousespecially the steadholders worrying about their folk at home and kord has been working that for everything he can i think hes hoping to stop the meet kord hes in from the barn aye child wheres warner bitte grimaced the old fool warner nearly flew at kord warners boys took him upstairs that girl of his talked him into a hot bath since theyve not had a chance to bathe since arriving otherwise theyd have been at one anothers throats an hour ago bloody crows isana snarled and rose to her feet the men and children filling the tub blinked and took a cautious step back from her she flicked a glance around the hall and then said to old bitte get him in the tub theyll help my brother or ill shove those steadholder chains down their cowardly throats she turned on one heel and stalked across the hall toward the trestle table at the head of it where several men had gatheredthe other steadholders behind them at the fire were kords sons the mostly silent aric and his younger brother the handsomeand accusedbittan even as isana crossed the hall she saw fade his hair and tunic soaked with cold rain his head ducked down try to slip close to the far fire he reached for the ladle standing in a pot of stew hung by the fire to stay warm bittan scowled up at the slave from his seat immediately beside the fire fade moved a bit closer his branded face twisted into a grotesque parody of a smile he bobbed his head at bittan nervously picked up a bowl and then reached for the ladle bittan spat something to aric and then said something harsh and sibilant to fade the slaves eyes widened and he mumbled something in reply cowardly dog bittan spat letting his voice rise obey your betters you stink and im sitting here now get away from me fade nodded and picked up the ladle his motions hurried aric spun the slave around by his shoulder and threw a short sharp blow at his mouth fade let out a yelp and stumbled back from the fire ducking his head repeatedly and shuffling off away from the young men aric rolled his eyes and looked at bittan scowling then he folded his arms and leaned against the wall on the other side of the stone fireplace bittan smirked and called after fade idiot coward dont come back he bowed his head again mouth tilted up at the corners in a cruel smile contemplating his folded hands thunder shook the air outside and isana braced herself against the accompanying flood of startled fear that flowed through the room it washed over her a second later than she would have expected it and she remained standing still her eyes closed until it had passed thats crow fodder snarled one of the men in the group around the table the curse ringing out into the silence after the thunder had passed isana drew herself up short assessing the steadholders before she confronted them the speaker steadholder aldo continued his hazel eyes fastened on kord his shaven jaw thrust out pugnaciously the holders of this valley have never stood idly by while one of the others needed help and were not going to do it now kord tilted his grizzled head to one side chewing on a bite of meat he had spit on his knife aldo he rumbled youre new to your chain arent you aldo stood over kord but the diminutive young man hardly topped the seated steadholder by a head whats that got to do with it and youre not married kord said you dont have any children any family that you know what its like to worry about i dont have to have a family to know that you two he spun and jabbed a finger at the other two men in the group steadholders chains around both their necks should be on your feet and helping bernard roth what about when that thanadent was after your pigs eh who hunted the thing down and you ottowho tracked down your youngest when he went missing and brought him home safe bernard thats who how can you just sit there otto a rounded man with a gentle face and thinning hair looked down he took a breath and said it isnt that i dont want to help him aldo furies know but kord has a point roth a spare elderly man with a shock of white hair to go with his darker beard took a pull from his mug and nodded ottos right theres more rain coming down than the valley usually sees in an entire autumn if the valley floods we will need every bit of strength we can saveto protect all of our lives he frowned at aldo his expression drawing wrinkles to his brow that time had not and steadholder kord is also correct you are the youngest here aldo you should show more respect to your elders when they whine like whimpering dogs should we do nothing because you might need your strength he turned and spat toward kord convenient for you his death would end the meet and youd be off the hook with count gram im only thinking of everyones good aldo kord rumbled the shaggy steadholder split his lips into a yellowtoothed smile say what you want of me but the life of one man no matter how fine isnt worth endangering everyone in the valley weve ridden out furystorms before but not like this blurted otto still the man didnt look up this is different we havent seen one this violent before it makes me nervous roth frowned and said i concur aldo stared at them both his hands clenching in frustration fine he said then his tone low hard which one of you wants to be the one to tell isana that were going to sit on our hands and do nothing while her brother bleeds to death on the floor of his own hall no one said anything isana stared at the men frowning thinking hard as she did kord passed his mug back to aric who refilled it and passed it back to him bittan evidently recovered from his neardrowning sat with his back against the wall his head down one hand halfshielding his eyes as though his head hurt isana thought of his cruel treatment of fade and hoped that it did but something struck her odd about the kordholders about the way they had arranged themselves or carried themselves in the midst of the storm it took her a moment to pick it out they seemed more relaxed than the rest less concerned about the battling furies outside the hall carefully she lowered her defenses just by a bit in the direction of kord and his sons none of them were afraid she could feel nothing with a casual reaching out of her senses but a mild tension from aric thunder flashed again and she knew she would never be able to raise her defenses again in time she struggled to anywayand again the tide of terrified emotion came a beat later than she expected enabling her to hold steady against it once more she found herself swaying on her feet and then a hand gripped her arm another her elbow she looked up to find fade standing beside her holding her steady mistress fade said ducking his scarred head in a clumsy little bow the blood on his cut lip had begun to dry blackening mistress steadholder hurt i know isana said i heard that you found him thank you fade mistress hurt the slave tilted his head to one side fine isana breathed she looked around at the families huddling together and listening to the fury of the storm outside fade does this storm frighten you fade nodded his head his expression absent eyes focusing elsewhere but youre not very afraid tavi fade said tavi isana sighed if anyone can find him in this its bernard brutus can protect him from the windmanes and cyprus will help him find tavi tavi needs bernard hurt fade said hurt bad yes isana said absently stay near for a moment i may need your help the slave grunted without moving though his distant expression left isana uncertain that he had heard the command she sighed and closed her eyes reaching out to touch her fury rill isana whispered she focused intently on an image of bittan in her mind picturing the young man as he sat against the wall the water fury was a ripple along her spine across her skin as she focused her concentration weary but willing rill show me fade abruptly stepped away from her mumbling hungry isana watched him go frustrated but unable to divert much attention from directing rill fade edged toward the fire looking at the kordholders apprehensively creeping toward the stewpot again as though he expected to be driven away from it with another swift blow then he stepped out of her immediate view isana sensed the furys movement through the moistureheavy air brushing against her and then flowing outward isana felt the furys motion almost as though it was her own arm reaching out toward the young kordholter against the wall rill touched on bittan and a jolt of vibrant fear lanced back to isana through the furys contact she let out a gasp her eyes widening finally understanding what was happening in the room bittan was working a firecrafting on the room sending out a subtle apprehension to almost every person in it heightening their fears and drawing their anxieties to the forefront of their thoughts it was a subtle working more subtle than she would have thought possible from the young man he must have called his fury into the fire near him which explained why he had claimed the space in front of it as his own with the realization a wave of dizzying weariness passed over isana she lost her balance and stumbled forward to her knees lowering one hand to the floor to balance and lifting the other to her face isana aldos voice came to her clearly and talk in the room dropped away to a near silence as the folk of bernardholt turned their attention to her isana are you all right isana looked up to find kords sons looking straight at her their expressions startled guilty bittan hissed something to aric arics face hardened she looked up to tell aldo about bittans firecraftingand suddenly found that she couldnt push the air out of her lungs isana lifted her head eyes sweeping around in a sudden panic she struggled to speak but couldnt her throat unable to expel a breathor she realized a moment later to draw it in people crowded around her then aldo leading the other steadholders over to her with quick fearful steps the diminutive man picked her up and said help me someone help whats wrong with her asked roth good furies shes terrified voices mingled and blended around her in a worried buzz she struggled reaching out for rill but the water fury only clouded around her pressing close in nervous reaction to isanas own wild fear as her helplessness increased her mental defenses eroded and the fear of those in the room flooded over more and more thickly as they pressed closer she lost track of who was speaking and reeled in confusion i dont know she just fell did anyone else see mistress isana oh great furies she and her brother boththis is an evil day isana struggled to look around pushing away otto as he tried to open her mouth to look down her throat and see if she was choking hold her isana calm down shes not breathing kord came over through the crowd but isana looked past the big steadholderto where his sons still sat by the fire unnoticed bittan had looked up at her and a cruel smile had twisted his handsome mouth he clenched his fingers abruptly into a fist and isana felt an accompanying spike of blinding panic flash through her driving away thought for a moment beside bittan sat aric aric isana thought a windcrafter the quiet son of kord wasnt looking at her but he had his fingers bridged together and his expression was set in concentration darkness swam in front of her eyes and she struggled to mouth words to aldo who held her his eyes wide with panic isana he breathed isana i cant understand you everything wavered and isana found herself laying on a table the world spinning above her kord arrived a sudden odor of stale sweat and roasted meat he looked down at her and said i think shes panicked woman calm down dont try to talk he leaned over her his eyes narrowing dont he muttered softly eyes malicious and threatening dont try to talk calm down and dont talk maybe it will go away isana tried to push kord away but he was too big too heavy her arms too weak all you have to do is nod he whispered just be a good girl and agree to let things go it doesnt have to be this way she stared up at him feeling her own helplessness and fear wash through her felt herself losing control in the face of that terror she knew that bittan was making the fear worse making her more afraid but that bit of knowledge seemed to have no particular relevance before the wild animal panic if she did not give in to kord she was certain he would stand by and let her die fury flashed through her then a sudden fire that evaporated the fear isana raked her nails at kords eyes he drew back from her before she could do more than leave a set of small pink weals on his cheek his eyes sparkling with anger isana forced herself to sit up as her vision grew darker and darker she pointed a finger weakly toward the fire everyone turned to lookand aldos eyes widened in sudden comprehension bloody crows he snarled that bastard of kords is killing her there was a general gasp confusion spread rapidly through the room the heightened emotions already present making it flare up like a wildfire through dry grass everyone started crying out at once what otto looked back and forth someones what aldo turned and started shoving his way toward the fire then he yelped and fell forward clutching at his foot where the stone floor had suddenly folded up and over it like a heavy cloth the young steadholder whirled and barked a word at the heavy wooden bench beside the table the wood shuddered and then twisted snapping with the brittle sound of old bones sending splinters as long as daggers flying toward kord the big steadholder ducked toward isana away from the splinters though one of them had opened his cheek in a sudden spilled sheet of scarlet blood he lifted his fist and drove it toward her isana rolled off the table and felt the big steadholders blow shatter the heavy oak like kindling she crawled away from him on her hands and knees toward the fire and the man whose fury was smothering her she saw fade at the fire staring at all the confusion with a baffled expression still halfbent over the pot a ladle in one hand he gabbled something and turned to flee whimpering high in his throat his feet stumbled over bittan as the young kordholder stood to his feet knocking the young man down fade let out a screech and fell to one side steaming stew flying from both bowl and ladle it splashed all over arics frowning face drawing a sudden scream of surprised agony from the slender windcrafter isana drew in a shocked breath even as she felt the wild confusion of emotion in the room vanish as suddenly as the shadow of a bird flying by overhead people looked around for a moment unbalanced by the sudden release from the firecrafting backing toward the walls stop them isana gasped stop kord kord let out a furious roar you barren bitch ill kill you the big man turned and isana could all but feel the stirring in the earth as he drew upon his fury for strength lifted the broken trestle board of the table as though it did not weigh as much as a grown man and swung it toward her aldo his foot twisted and dragging hauled himself to his feet and threw himself at kords legs the smaller steadholder hit the larger man low dragging him off balance and sending the trestle plank sailing wide of isana cracking into the wall kord kicked aldo away as though he weighed no more than a puppy and turned toward isana once more isana struggled to crawl away calling rill to her with desperate intensity she heard a confusion of sounds around her men cursing a door banging open the air suddenly shrieked and a gale flung itself down the chimney and hurled a cloud of redhot embers at isana she cried out falling flat onto the earth waiting for the pain to begin instead she felt them swirl up and past her and kord let out a sudden howl of dismay there kord you lying slive cackled steadholder warner from atop the stairs he stood naked and dripping with water a towel wrapped around his waist soap in his wispy hair and running down his skinny legs his sons stood behind him swords in hand its about time someone taught you to respect a lady take them boys father aric called through the confusion warners sons leapt down the stairs father the door wait isana cried she started to stand wait no no bloodshed in my house a weight hit her from behind and pressed her ungently to the ground she struggled and squirmed to find fade on top of her firmly pressing her down fade she gasped get off me hurt fade the slave gabbled and hid his face against her back sobbing clinging to her like an overlarge child no hurt no more hurt kord let out a bellow and caught the first of warners sons as he threw himself at the big steadholder kord grasped the young man by the wrist and belt and threw him across the room to crash hard into the wall kord rushed toward the doors to the hall aric and bittan hard on his heels and the folk of bernardholt scattered from the steadholders path he slammed into one of the doors and tore it from its hinges letting in a howl of cold wind and halffrozen rain he vanished into the night his sons following let them go shouted isana so sharply did her voice ring out that warners other two sons drew up short staring at her let them go isana repeated she wriggled out from beneath fade and looked around at the hall aldo lay gasping and hurt and warners son slumped unmoving against the wall at the other end of the hall old bitte crouched over bernards pale and motionless form an iron poker from the fire gripped determinedly in her withered fingers isana protested warner coming down the stairs still clasping his towel with one hand we cant just let them leave we cant let animals like that go unstopped weariness and the pounding in her head met with the backwash of isanas terror of the panic at the sudden and vicious violence and she began to shake she bowed her head for a moment and willed rill to keep the tears from her eyes let them go she repeated we have our own wounded to attend to the storm will kill them but no isana said firmly she looked around at the other steadholders roth was standing to his feet slowly and looked dazed otto was supporting the older man and sweat shone on his mostly bald pate we have wounded to see to isana told the two men what happened otto stammered why did they do that roth put a hand on ottos shoulder they were firecrafting us isnt that it isana making us all more afraid more worried than we needed to be isana nodded silently grateful to roth and aware that as a watercrafter he would sense it he smiled at her briefly but how otto said his tone baffled how did they do it without one of us sensing it my guess is that bittan built it up slowly isana said a little at a time the way you can heat bathwater a little at a time so that anyone inside doesnt notice otto blinked i knew you could project emotions but i didnt know you could do it that way most of the citizenry who know firecrafting will do it to one degree or another during their speeches isana said nearly any senator can do it without really thinking about it gram does it without knowing all the time and while his son did it to us roth mused kord fed us that nonsense about a possible floodand we were worried enough to think that it sounded reasonable oh otto said he coughed and flushed pink i see you came down late isana so you were able to notice it but why didnt you just say something because the other one was smothering her dolt growled aldo from where he lay his voice carried the stress of the pain from his injured foot and you saw what kord tried to do to her i told you all warner said with a certain vicious satisfaction in his voice from his position on the stairs theyre a bad lot all around warner isana said wearily go get dressed the spare steadholder looked down at himself and seemed to become aware of his nakedness for the first time he flushed then muttered something to excuse himself and hurried from the room otto shook his head again i just cant believe someone would do that otto muttered aldo use your head for something besides a dressing mirror bernard is hurt and so is warners son get them into a tub and craft them better roth nodded decisively visibly gathering himself together of course steadholder aldo he inclined his head a bit to the younger man was right all along isana i offer you my full support in your crafting as does otto here i do otto said oh i mean yes of course isana how could we have been so stupid of course well help child bitte called from beside bernards still form her voice high sharp isana theres no more time isana turned to look at bitte the old womans face had gone pale your brother hes gone chapter tavi stumbled beneath the force of a sudden gust of wind the girl caught his arm in one hand keeping him upright and with the other she hurled a few scanty remnants of the salt crystals hed given her a few hours before there was a shriek from the faintly luminous form of the windmane behind the gust and it withdrew thats it she called over the wind im out of salt me too tavi answered her are we close he squinted through the darkness and the rain shivering and almost too cold to think i dont know he said i cant see anything we should be almost there she shielded her eyes from the stinging halfsleet with her hand almost wont be good enough theyre coming back tavi nodded and said keep your eyes out for firelight he gripped her hand tightly in his before stumbling forward through the darkness her fingers tightened on his own the slave was stronger than she looked and even though his hand had long since gone mostly numb from the cold and the sleet her grip was painful frightened the wind and the deadly manes within it yowled driving and cold and furious theyre coming she hissed if were going to get out of this it has to be right now its close its got to be tavi squinted against the blinding rain peering ahead of them as best he could then he saw it a faint golden radiance flickering at the edge of his vision in the storm he had gotten turned around somehow and he swerved abruptly to one side hauling on the girls wrist there the fire its right there we have to run for it tavi drove his exhausted body forward toward the distant light and the ground began to slope upward rising steadily toward it the curtains of sleet and rain blinded him and veiled the light so that it flickered like a guttering candle but tavi kept his eyes doggedly locked on his destination lightning snarled among the clouds m treacherous blinding flashes while the windmanes howled out their wrath overhead tavi could hear the slaves labored gasping breath even through the windshe was evidently at the end of her endurance her footsteps staggered as they grew closer to the glowing firelight in the darkness the windmanes screeched and tavi looked back to see one of them swooping down through the sleet its face twisted into a grimace of hatred and hunger the girls eyes widened as she saw tavis expression and she began to spin aboutbut she was too late her reaction too slow she couldnt possibly turn to defend herself in time tavi reached back and seized her wrist in both hands with the weight of his whole body he hauled her forward past him and sent her stumbling toward the light ahead go he shouted get inside the windmane hit tavi and there was suddenly no air in his lungs no warmth in his limbs he felt his feet leave the ground and he went tumbling jouncing and bounding down the slope and away from the shelter at its summit blown like a leaf before the power of the storm he rolled arms and legs loose struggling to keep from stopping too abruptly to guide his fall down the hill and to its base a grey stone appeared before his eyes in a flash of emerald lightning and he felt himself scream as he flinched away from it he caught a flash of light reflected on water on the ground and aimed himself toward it through the half dark desperate and terrified he came to a halt in the mud pooling at the bottom of the hill beneath a fingerwidth of freezing water his arms sinking into it halfway to his elbows he struggled and heaved them free of the muck turning in time to see the windmane descend on him once more tavi rolled to one side the sludge slowing his movements and felt the wrndmanes deadly chill settle around his mouth and nose cutting off his air he thrashed and flinched but accomplished nothing he could no more keep the fury from blocking his air than he could spread his arms and fly above the storm tavi knew that he had only one chance and that a slim one he struggled to his feet then leapt into the air and hurled himself sprawling in the muck cold oozing mud and chilled water slithered over him churned to the consistency of thick pudding by the storm he wriggled down deeper forcing his face into the mud then rolled to his back covering himself in it and suddenly he could breathe again tavi peered up at the windmanebut it wasnt facing him the fury swirled and swooped around the point where it had first attacked him its glowing hungry eyes flicking back and forth they never did settle on tavi the windmane screamed and half a dozen of its fellows came looping down and around the area near where tavi had fallen spinning and spiraling searching for him tavi lifted a hand to brush mud from his eyes a fierce grin stretching his lips hed been right the earth the earth that was the nemesis of furies of the air had covered him hidden him from them but it was bitterly painfully cold tavi stared at the swirling windmanes and felt the chill settle into his bones he was safe from the manes but for how long the rain continued to pelt down and muddy water dribbled into tavis eyes the rain would wash his coating of mud away in short order assuming he didnt simply collapse to the ground and freeze moving as quietly as he could he reached down and scooped more mud into his hand dumping it onto his belly and chest where the rain had begun to make headway tavi peered through the storm and up the gentle slope of the mound to where the light burned at its top outlining an opening in a dark structure otherwise invisible in the night he saw no sign of the slavewhich meant that she was either safe or dead either way he had done everything he could for the young woman he let out a hiss of frustration instantly three of the windmanes spun their glowing eyes toward him and flowed through the air directly at his mouth a yelp started in his chest but he stifled it from reaching his throat instead rolling away through the mud for several paces and got to his feet looking back he saw the furies of the storm swirling around the spot where he had lain they could not see him perhaps but they could surely hear him even in the din of the storm they had heard his breath he scarcely dared to breathe now and wondered if they would hear him moving either way he thought the rain would expose him to them in a few moments he had to get off of the open ground to shelter he had to try to slip past the furious windmanes tavi would remember that walk for the remainder of his life as the torment a starving mouse must feel when darting between the feet of giants to snatch at crumbs of food and then rush back to safety all around him the windmanes swirled and howled a young bounder buck came leaping out of the darkness across tavis tail squealing and throwing his hindquarters wildly about to the buck clung three of the windmanes their claws raking eyes blazing as tavi watched the furies rode the bounder down to the ground its horns passing harmlessly through them the buck let out an awful scream before one of the manes tore open its throat and two more flowed over its muzzle cutting off its air the bounder struggled in silence thrashing and bucking as its blood flowed the other windmanes nearby swirled closer shrieking clawed hands reaching the animal vanished into a luminescent mass of churning mist and vicious claws only moments later the cloud dispersed into a dozen howling forms and all that remained of the bounder was a head its eyes wide open and white with terror beside a scattered pile of clawrent meat and cracked bloody bones tavis knees went weak and for the space of several breaths he couldnt remove his eyes from the gruesome spectacle the lightning left him in the dark a moment later leaving the sight of the poor bucks fate blazed across his vision he opened his mouth to scream and found himself breathless silent as in the helpless terror of a nightmare lightning split the sky again and the fear took him and ate him in one bite his trembling paralysis became a sudden surge of fragile terrified strength and he all but flew up the hill toward the promised safety of the light he heard himself suck in a breath and scream and the windmanes rose up around him in an angry chorusbut one without a director without a tempo they swooped and dove furiously around him but none could see him the protection of the earth held true until tavi had raced up the slope to its summit there a simple dome of polished marble rose from the slope of the hill to the height of three men its open entryway glowed with a soft golden light and above it writ into the marble in gold was the sevenpointed star of the first lord of alera tavi felt a section of earth as heavy as a feastday cake slough off of his back and heard the furies scream behind him his own scream answered them as the terrible wind raced toward him he held his arms over his head and threw himself at the doorway and landed on hard smooth stone within a sudden and shocking silence tavi jerked his eyes up and looked around limbs quivering and shaking his body frantically signaling his mind that he should get up should keep running instead he sat up a twinge passing through his chilled muscles and stared around him panting and mute the beauty of the princeps memorium would have taken his breath away if all the running and screaming hadnt done it already though outside the storm still raged the lightning still flashed the sleet and the thunder still hammered the earth within the memorium those sounds came only as something very distant and wholly irrelevant the earth might shake and the air fairly ignite with fury but within the memorium there was only the slight ripple of water the crackle of flame and an almost meditative stillness broken by the sleepy chirp of a bird the interior of the dome was made not of marble but of crystal the walls of it rising high and smooth to the ceiling twenty feet above light from seven fires that burned without apparent fuel around the outside of the room rose up through the crystal bending refracting splitting into rainbows that swirled and danced with a slow grace and beauty within the crystal walls the floor in the center of the dome was covered by a pool of water perfectly still and as smooth as amaranth glass all around the pool grew rich foliage bushes grass flowers even small trees arranged as neatly as though kept by a gardener between each of the fires around the walls stood seven silent suits of armor complete with scarlet capes the bronze shields and the ivoryhandled swords of the royal guard the armor stood mute and empty upon nearly formless figures of dark stone eternally vigilant the slits in their helmets focused on their charge at the center of the pool rose a block of black basalt upon the block lay a pale shape a statue of the purest white marble in the form of a young man his eyes were closed as though sleeping and he lay with his hands folded upon his breast the hilt of his sword beneath them he wore a rich cloak that draped down over one shoulder and beneath that the breastplate of a soldier at his feet lay a pale marble helm complete with the high crest of the house of gaius his hair lay closecropped to his head his face was thinfeatured stark handsome and his expression peaceful sleeping had the statue been a man of flesh tavi would have expected him to rise don his helmet and set about his business but the princeps gaius had died long ago before tavi was born there was a motion at the edge of his vision but he felt too tired to turn his head the slave knelt down beside him dripping and shivering she touched his shoulder and drew her hand back to consider the soupy mud clinging to it crows and furies for a moment i thought that a gargoyle had gotten in here he looked up at her suspiciously but her eyes were dancing with weary mirth i didnt have time to wash up i turned back to find you but i couldnt see anythingand the windmanes closed on me i had to run here that was the idea tavi said his tone apologetic im sorry but it looked like you were about to collapse the slaves mouth quirked to one side perhaps she acknowledged she scooped more of the mud off of him very cleverand very brave are you hurt tavi shook his head shivering uncontrollably sore tired and cold she nodded her expression worried and smoothed more muck from his forehead all the same thank you he struggled to give her a small smile theres no reason to thank me im tavi of bernardholt the girls fingers went to the collar at her throat and she frowned lowering her eyes amara where are you from amara nowhere the girl said she looked up sweeping her eyes around the inside of the magnificent chamber what is this place pprinceps memorium tavi stuttered shivering this is the mound on the field of tears the princeps died here fighting the marat before i was born amara nodded still frowning she rubbed her hands together roughly and then laid her wrist over tavis forehead youre burning up tavi closed his eyes and found them too heavy to open again an odd prickling ran over his skin slowly replacing the bitter aching chill of the mud the first lord himself made this place they say made it in one day when they buried everyone the crown legion the marat didnt leave enough of the princeps body for a state funeral they did it here instead of taking him back to the capital the slave took his hand and urged him to his feet though she too shook with cold he let her struggling to stand through the heavy sweet lethargy in his limbs he latched onto the words he was speaking using them to hold on to consciousness strong furies here the crowns furies it was said they would have to be strong to keep the shades of all the soldiers at ease couldnt take them home too many dead bodies strong furies would protect us stone mound earth against air shelter you were right amara said she eased him back to the floor again and he sank gratefully back against a wall he could feel a distant heat through the tingling in his body something wonderful and soothing she must have taken him over to one of the fires all my fault tavi mumbled i didnt bring dodger in my uncle the marat are here there was a startled silence then she said what tavi what are you talking about what about the marat he struggled to say more to answer the slaves question to warn her but the words became a jumble on his tongue and within his mind he tried to force them out and found himself shaking too hard to get them out clearly amara said something to him but it didnt make any sense random sounds jumbled together he felt her hands on him then scooping the halffrozen muck off of him and rubbing roughly at his limbs but it felt very distant somehow very unimportant his head fell forward it became a labor even to draw breath blackness fell over him dark and silent and complete chapter isanas heart twisted in her chest and her throat tightened no she whispered no my brother isnthes not gone he cant be old bitte looked down his heart his breathing theyve both stopped he just lost too much blood child hes gone stunned silence fell on the hall no isana said she felt dizzy stunned and she had to close her eyes no bernard the enormity of that simple finality of death fell on her like a mile of chains bernard was her only living family and she had been close to him since before she could clearly remember she could not picture a world without her brother in it there had to be something she could do surely something she had been so close to securing the help she needed if kord and his sons hadnt been interfering if they had only kept to themselves there would have been two skilled watercrafters attending to bernard before she was even awakened let the crows take kord and his murderous little family isana thought viciously what right did he have to jeopardize the lives of others in order to protect his own position bernard could have been cared for he could have lived she needed bernard the steadholt needed him tavi needed him tavi if anyone could find tavi now if anyone could help him it was her brother she had to have his help she had to have him beside her without him tavi could be gone forever he too could no isana said aloud she took a breath steeling herself she could not let kords viciousness kill her brother and tavi all in one moment she lifted her head and focused on old bitte no this isnt over get him into the tub bitte looked up at isana her expression startled what get him into the tub isana said she started rolling up her sleeves in brisk short motions otto roth get over here and prepare your furies isana bitte hissed child you cannot do this she can said otto his voice quiet his pate gleaming in the light of the fire its been done before when i was young just taking my own chain harald the youngers boy fell through the ice and into the mill pond he was under for nearly thirty minutes before we could get him back up through it and he lived lived spat bitte he sat in a chair drooling and never speaking again until fevers took him would you do that to bernard as well roth grimaced and put a frail hand on ottos shoulder shes right even if we bring his body back his mind might not come along with it isana stood and faced the two men i need him she said tavi is out in the storm i have no time to discuss the matter you were willing to help me a moment ago now do it or get out of my way well help otto offered at once roth let out a slow breath his expression reluctant aye he agreed furies willing the attempt wont kill you im touched by your enthusiasm isana stalked to the copper tub several of the holders under bittes direction lowered bernards limp form into the tub the water stained pink blood swirling languidly out from the wound in his thigh get the bandage off she instructed it wont matter now one way or the other she knelt down by the head of the tub reaching out to rest her fingers against bernards temples rill she whispered reaching a hand down to touch the water briefly rill i need you she felt the water swirl slowly as rill entered the tub she could feel the furys reluctance its motions vague and unsureno not rills reluctance but her own weariness as tired as isana was doubtless rill could not hear her clearly could not respond to her as well as the fury usually might in a moment more that would not be an issue immi otto whispered isana felt the portly steadholder rest his hand on her shoulder warm fingers tightening slightly in support the waters stirred beneath her fingers anew as the second fury entered the tub a much smaller more active presence than rills roth put his hand on her opposite shoulder almia once again the water stirred with a stronger more confident presence the older steadholders fury carrying with it a sense of fluid strength isana took a deep breath focusing through her weariness and her fear and her anger she pushed her wild concern for tavi from her thoughts her uncertainty that she could help her brother she cleared everything away but her sense through rill of the water in the tub and of the body it surrounded there was a certain feel to a body submerged in water a kind of delicate vibration spreading out from the skin isana willed rill to surround bernard so that she could feel for that fragile energy around him the tremors of life for a terrible moment the waters were still and she could sense nothing then rill quivered in response to the barest traces of life in the wounded man isana felt her heart lurch in relief and she murmured hes still here but we have to hurry dont risk it isana roth said his voice quiet hes too far gone hes my brother isana said she flattened her hands against either side of bernards thick neck you and otto seal up the wound ill do the rest she felt ottos hand tighten on her shoulder roth let out a quiet resigned sigh if you go in you might not be able to get back out again even if you are successful in reviving him i know isana closed her eyes and leaned forward enough to plant a gentle kiss on her brothers head all right then she said here we go isana let out her breath in a long slow exhalation and poured her attention her focus her will forward into the water the dull ache in her limbs faded away the clenching tension in her back vanished all the sensations of her body from the toocool skin beneath her fingers to the smooth stone beneath her knees and toes faded away to nothing she felt only the water the fading energy around bernard and the nebulous presence of the furies in the water with her rills presence pressed close to her something like concern pressing against isanas awareness she touched rill with her thoughts giving the fury an image a task in response rill glided closer into the same space isanas awareness occupied the sensation of the furys presence overlapped with her own until she could no longer readily distinguish the two isana felt a brief surge of disorientation as she and the fury joined one another then as always rills perceptions began to flow into her in a slow rush of sounds murky vision and in surges of tangible tactile emotion she looked up at the vague pale shape of bernards body at the even more blurred shape of her own standing over him roth and ottos furies hovered anxiously before her in the water each visible to her now faint colors in a pair of cloudy forms she did not speak but from here it was a simple matter to send the words to roth and otto through their furies gather him up and seal closed the wound ill handle the rest the other two furies swirled off at once gathering together the scarlet droplets of blood that had begun spreading into the bathwater and shepherding them back to the gaping rent in bernards thigh isana didnt wait for the furies to complete their task she instead slipped closer to the fading aura around her brother focusing upon it and upon the much stronger thrum of life in the body touching bernardher own she knew that what she was to attempt was dangerous the anima of life was never simple to touch or easy to manipulate it was a force as potent and unpredictable as life itselfand as fragile but dangerous or not it had to be done she had to try isana reached out and made contact with that faint fading quiver of life around bernard and then touching upon that of her own body above him she gathered both together and melded them blended them drew upon the energy of her body to surround both of them to an immediate violent response bernards body convulsed in the water a sudden thrash of motion that moved every muscle in him at once his back contorted and isana felt more than saw his eyes fly wide open and unseeing his heart contracted with a heavy unsteady thumping sound followed by another and another isana felt a thrill of exhilaration fly through her and with rill poured into bernard through the wound in his leg a rush of sudden confinement a sense of herself stretching down hundreds of blood vessels spreading through him her awareness fracturing into a multitude of layers she felt his weary heart the bonedeep ache of his limbs the terrifying cold of oncoming death she felt his confusion his frustration his fear the emotions pressing like a knife against her heart she felt his body struggling against the injuries failing dying what she did next was not a process of logical thought of stimulus and response of procedure and reason her thoughts were too far divided too many too much to direct so clearly everything relied on her instinct on her ability to release conscious will and to reach through him sensing every part of the whole and then acting to restore it she felt it as a pressure building up against her as steely chains of tension that closed in upon her myriad thoughts with a slow and steady inevitability shutting them down crushing them into stillness she fought against that stillness fought to keep her awareness her life sparkling in every part of bernards wounded body she threw herself into the struggle straining against death while around her through her within her she felt every wavering uncertain beat of his toolabored heart she held on to his life as she felt roth and ottos furies send blood back into his battered body she held on to him as the two watercrafters went to work upon the injury itself closing the ragged wound and crafting the very fabric of his flesh together again she held on with all of her strength and in a horrible space between one heartbeat and the next realized that she could hold on no longer she was losing him through rill she felt roths silent urging to withdraw to flow back out of her brother and to her own body to save herself she refused drawing more heavily on the energy of her body feeding it to bernard to his laboring heart she sent everything she could reach coursing into him and felt it flowing out of her somewhere felt herself growing weaker she gave her brother all that she was her love of him her love for tavi terror at the prospect of his death frustration agony fear the joy of glowing memories and the despair of the darkest moments of her life she held back nothing bernard quivered again and abruptly gasped in a breath of air that filled his lungs like cold fire he coughed and the horrible stillness abruptly fractured and fled as his lungs labored again and again and again isana felt relief flood over her as his body grew stronger as the energy of him began to flow again as the rhythm of his heart began to quicken and become regular a hammer pulse that coursed throughout her awareness she felt rill dimly as the fury moved through him and felt her gentle confusion once again roth attempted to send something to her through their furies but she was too tired to understand it too lost in relief and exhaustion to understand she let her awareness drift felt herself sinking down into a darkness into warmth that promised her rest from all of her anxiety and pain and weariness and then a dull fire pulsed in her she thought that she remembered the sensation from some time long before her descent slowed for a moment again the fire came and again and again pain i am feeling fain in a detached remote and unconcerned part of her awareness she understood what was happening roth had been right she had given too much of herself and had been unable to return to her own body too tired too relaxed too weak she would die back there beside the tub her body simply slumping to the floor and empty of life the fire flared again somewhere back up and away from the darkness the dead feel no fain she thought pain is for the living she reached out toward it toward that fire in the night the delicious descent halted though part of her screamed out against it she reached back for the pain but did not move did not begin to rise again it is too late i cannot go back she tried regardless she struggled against the stillness the warmth she struggled to live sudden light flared like a newborn sun above her isana reached for it embraced that distant fire with every part of her that still lived it washed over her in a flood and became an instant blazing torment horrible and bright an agony more searing than anything she had ever known she felt a dizzying wrenching sensation and a sudden rush of confusion of emptiness where rill had been before of more and more pain she went back into it and gladly the light the agony became all consuming her limbs aching her lungs burning with her ragged breath her head pounding and her mind screaming as raw sensation poured into it she heard shouts someone was screaming and there was a heavy thump of impact then more screams fade she thought there someone shouted otto look shes breathing get a blanket replied roths steady voice and another for bernard broth for both theyll need food i know that someone get that idiot slave out of here before he hurts someone else the general cloud of pain over her began to resolve itself by slow degrees to a dull throb in her hand and a sweet and oddly satisfying ache of exhaustion spread throughout her she opened her eyes and turned her head to one side to see bernard looking blearily around him she fumbled her hand toward him and saw the fingers of it swollen and oddly shaped she touched him and the pain swept down on her blinded her easy isana roth took her wrist and gently pressed her hand back down easy you need to rest tavi isana said she struggled to force out the words though they sounded blurry even to her find tavi rest roth said the old steadholder looked down on her with gentle compassionate eyes rest youve done too much already bitte appeared beside isana and assured her well get the steadholder back on his feet by morning child hell take care of everything rest now isana shook her head she couldnt rest not while the storm raged outside not while tavi remained in it helpless and fragile and alone she started to sit up but simply could not she did not have the strength to do much more than lift her head she fell back to the floor and felt a tear of frustration glide from one eye that tear seemed to trigger others and then she was weeping silently weeping until she could not see could barely breathe she should have been more careful she should have forbidden him to leave the steadholt this morning she should have seen to her brother more swiftly should have understood the kordholders plans before it had come to violence she had fought as hard as she could she had tried furies knew she had tried but all of her efforts had been for nothing time had swept down on her swift as a hungry crow tavi was out there in the storm alone o furies and spirits of the departed please please let him come home safe chapter amara strove to ignore the exhaustion and the cold her limbs shook almost too hard to be controlled and her entire body throbbed with weariness more than anything she wanted to collapse upon the floor and sleepbut if she did it might cost the boy his life she had wiped the mud from his face and his throat as best she could but it clung to him in a thin layer of slimy clay greybrown and mottled over paler skin it made him look almost like a corpse several days old amara slipped a hand beneath the boys shirt feeling for his heartbeat even in this weather he wore only a light tunic and cloak for warmth evidence of his hardy upbringing here on the savage frontier of the realm she shuddered soaked and halffrozen and glanced up yearningly toward the nearest of the funeral fires the boys heartbeat thudded against her own mudstained palm quick and strong but when she drew her hand out she saw the mud dappled with bright scarlet the boy was wounded though it couldnt have been anything majorhed have been dead already amara cursed under her breath and felt for his limbs they were dangerously cold while she struggled to force her weary mind to decide on a course of action she began rubbing briskly at once scraping more of the frigid mud off of him and attempting to restore warmth and circulation to his limbs she called his name several times but though his eyelashes flickered his eyes did not open nor did he speak she took a quick look around the chamber amara shuddered to think of what the mud of the field of tears where so many had fallen might do to him if it got into his blood she had to clean it off and quickly she undressed him roughly he was too limp and heavy for all his slender appearance to allow her weakened hands to be any more precise his clothes tore in a few places before she got them off of him and by the time she had his lips had tinged with blue amara halfcarried halfdragged him over to the water and then down into it the waters warmth came as a pleasant shock to her senses the pools floor sloped down sharply until it was about hip deep and even as she kept the boys face out of the water she sank gratefully into it and simply huddled there for a moment until the rattle of her teeth chattering had begun to slow down then she dragged him a few feet to one side out of the mudclouded water and began to rub roughly over his skin brushing the clay away until the boy was clean he had a shocking collection of bruises scrapes abraded skin and minor cuts the bruises were fairly fresh only a few hours old she judged his knees had several layers of skin peeled off apparently a match to the ragged holes in his discarded trousers his arms legs and flanks all showed patches of purple slowly forming as though he had been recently beaten and a lattice of long tiny cuts covered his skin he had to have been running through thickets and thorns she cleared the mud from his face as best she could using her alreadytorn skirts to clean him and then dragged him back up out of the water and over to one of the fires as soon as she felt the air on her she began to shiver again and realized that the water had not been nearly so warm as it had feltshe had simply been too cold relatively to feel the difference she settled the boy in a heap on the floor as near to the fire as she could manage and huddled there for a moment on her heels her arms wrapped tight around her her head nodded and amara let out a startled sound as she fell to her side she wanted to simply surrender to the exhaustion but she could not neither of them might wake up again she felt her throat tighten on a whimper of protest but she drove herself to her feet again shivering nearly too hard to move to think her fingers felt like lead as she struggled from her own soaked clothing thick and nerveless and unresponsive she let the lighter clothing fall in a sopping heap to the marble floor and staggered to one of the stone sentries facing the bier she clawed the red cape from its shoulders and wrapped it around her amara allowed herself a brief respite leaning against the wall and shivering into the capebut then drove herself along the wall to the next statue and the one after claiming both of those capes as well then returning to the boys side with the last of her strength she wrapped him in the scarlet cloaks securing their warmth around him near the fire then huddled into a ball beneath the scarlet fabric of the royal guard she leaned her head back against the wall it took nothing more than that for her to sleep she woke warm and aching the storm raged steadily all howling winds and frozen rain amara pushed herself to her feet her body weary stiff from sleeping crouched down on her heels and blessedly warm beneath the heavy fabric of the cape she moved to look out of the doorway of the chamber night still reigned outside lightning flashed and danced without but it and the accompanying thunder seemed more distant now sound rumbling along well after the light the forces of the furies of the air still battled but the winter winds had pushed their rivals to the south away from the valley and much of the rain that fell outside now rattled and bounced against the cooling earth as true hailstones gaius had to have known amara thought he had to have been aware of the repercussions of calling the southern winds to bear her north to the valley he had been crafting too long and knew the forces that affected his realm too well for it to have been an accident thus clearly the first lord had intended the storm but why amara stared out at the bleak night frowning she would be trapped until the storm relented and so will be anyone else in the valley fool she thought her eyes widened gaius with this act had effectively called a halt to any activity within the calderon valley until the storm had relented but why if speed had truly been of the essence why rush her here only to fence her off from acting unless gaius felt that the opposition was already in motion in that case her arrival would put an effective freeze on their activities perhaps giving her a chance to rest regain her balance before acting amara frowned would the first lord truly arrange such a deadly storm a furycrafting of proportions she could scarcely visualize merely to allow his agent to rest amara shivered and wrapped the cloak around her a little more tightly she could only deduce so much of gaiuss reasoning he knew far more than most in alera ever couldmost would not even begin to grasp the scope of it he was oftentimes a subtle ruler rarely did his actions have only one objective only one set of consequences what else did her ruler have in mind amara grimaced if gaius had wanted her to know surely he would have told her unless he trusted her competence to work out on her own what he intended or unless he still doesnt trust you she turned away from the doorway and padded silently back into the chamber her thoughts in a whirl she leaned against a wall beside one of the stone guardians denuded of his cloak and raked her fingers through her hair she had to get moving surely the enemies of the crown would not be idle once the weather broke she had to have a plan at least and get to work on it right away the first order of business fidelias would have said would be to gather intelligence she had to establish what was going on in the valley before she could effectively do anything about it whether it be to act to invoke her authority as a cursor of the crown to the local count or to report back to gaius she swallowed all she had to help her was the knife shed stolen from fideliass boot and some clothing far too light for the weather it seemed she would be faced with she looked back at the boy curled on his side before the fire shivering she also had him amara moved to the boys side and laid a hand on his forehead he let out a soft groan his skin was too hot feverish and his breathing had dried out his lips cracked them she frowned and went back to the water cupping her hands together and carrying it back to the boy she urged him to drink and tried to tip the water into his mouth most of it trickled through her fingers and splashed onto his chin and neck but he managed to swallow a little amara repeated the process several times until the boy seemed to relax a little settling down again she studied him as she fetched another of the scarlet capes folded it into a pad and slipped it beneath his head he was a beautiful child in many ways his features almost delicate his hair curled around his head dark glossy ringlets he had the long thick lashes that so many men seemed to have and not care about and his hands had long slender fingers that seemed entirely oversized to the rest of him promising considerable growth yet to come his skin where not marred with bruises or scratches glowed with the ruddy clarity of youth that had somehow avoided awkward adolescence she hadnt seen what color his eyes were in the hectic events of the previous evening but his voice had been clarionclear in the storm bellsharp she frowned more seriously studying the boy he had almost certainly saved her life but who was he they were a considerable walk from any of the local steadholts she had chosen her landing site in order to avoid coming down within sight of any of the locals so what had the boy been doing there in the middle of nowhere in that storm home the boy murmured amara looked down at him but he hadnt opened his eyes his face twitched into a frown in his sleep im sorry aunt isana uncle bernard should be home tried to get him home safe amara felt her eyes widen bernardholt was the largest steadholt in the calderon valley steadholder bernard was the boys uncle she leaned closer and asked him what happened to your uncle tavi was he hurt tavi nodded a dreamy motion marat the herdbane brutus stopped it but not before it bit him marat the savages hadnt given the realm any trouble since the incident on this very site fifteen or sixteen years ago amara had felt skeptical when gaius had voiced his concern about the marat but apparently one had come into the calderon valley and attacked an aleran steadholder but what did it mean could it have been one lone marat warrior a chance meeting in the wilderness no too coincidental for mere chance something larger was under way amara clenched her hand on the fabric of the cape in frustration wrinkling it she needed more information tavi she said what can you tell me of this marat was he of the herdbane tribe was he alone had nother one the boy mumbled killed one but he had nother one a second beast mmmhmm where is your uncle now tavi shook his head and his expression twisted with pain here was supposed to be home sent him home with brutus brutus should have brought him back tears had started down his cheeks and amara swallowed upon seeing them she needed information yes but she couldnt torment an unconscious child for it he needed rest if he was the steadholders nephew and the man had survived the attack she could bring him home safely and almost certainly secure the steadholders enthusiastic cooperation m sorry the boy said broken and still weeping quiet tears i tried sorry shhhh she said she used an edge of the cloak to wipe the tears away time to rest now lay down and rest tavi he subsided and she frowned down at him smoothing his hair back from his fevered forehead while he slept if a lone marat was in the valley perhaps the steadholder had gone to hunt it down but if so then why would this boy be along he had no particular skill at crafting she judged or he would have used it when the windmanes had been attacking them he bore no weapons no equipment he couldnt have been hunting the marat amara inverted the idea had it hunted the folk of bernardholt possible particularly from the herdbane tribe if all that she heard of the marat was true they were a cold and calculating people as ruthless and deadly as the animals that accepted them as one of their own but marat didnt often take more than one beast as what sufficed to describe the term mate companion bloodsibling she shook her head with a shiver the savages ways were still alien to her something fantastic from a tale rather than the businesslike reality she had learned from classes in the academy hordemasters took more than one beast commonly as a symbol of status but what would a marat hordemaster be doing in the calderon valley invading her own silent response to the thought gave her a little chill could the holders have run into the advance scouts of a marat attack force the attack could hardly come at a more advantageous time for the enemy amara realized the roads were slowly closing down for the winter season here among the northern cities many troops had been given winter furlough with their families and folk of the countryside in general were winding down the frantic labor of harvest into the sedate pace of winter if the marat attacked the valley now providing the forces stationed at garrison were neutralized they could wipe out every person in it and maraud through all the steadholts practically all the way back to riva itself they might even if they numbered enough simply pour around the city and into aleras interior amara shuddered to imagine what a horde might accomplish in that event she had to contact the count at garrison his name was bram or gram or something like thatand put him on the alert but what if the boy was lying about the marat or mistaken she grimaced she knew the local citizenry by name at least though the memorization of the lords and counts had been one of the more tedious chores at the academy she had no such knowledge of this steadholder bernard or of the folk of the valley by all accounts they were a tough and independently minded folk but she knew nothing about their reliability or lack of it she had to talk to this bernard if he had indeed seen a marat hordemaster and been wounded by one of the great hunting birds of the outland plains then she had to know it secure his support and hopefully some new clothes with it and act she frowned but she could expect the opposition to be moving as well fidelias had lead her into a trap she had escaped by the smallest of margins she had been pursued for several hours and escaped the knights aeris sent after her through skill and good fortune did she suppose that fidelias would not continue the pursuit in all probability she realized his business lay here in the calderon valley that had to be one of the reasons gaius sent her here fidelias was her patnserus or had been she thought with a bitter taste in her mouth she knew him perhaps better than anyone else alive she had seen through his deception at the renegade camp though only barely what would fidelias do he would judge her by her previous actions of course he would expect her to arrive in the valley and promptly to make contact with the steadholders coordinating information and after suitable data had been gathered to take action against whatever was happening whether it meant falling into a defense within one of the strongest steadholts or mobilizing the men of the valley and the troops of garrison to meet it and what would he do to stop it hed find me kill me and sow confusion among the holders until his plan could begin a slow chill went through her she considered the situation again but it was perfectly typical of fidelias he preferred simple approaches direct solutions keep lies simple he had always told her keep plans simple leave them open to modification and use your eyes your head more than any plan word of a cursor in the valley would spread among the holders like wildfire she might as well paint a circle over her heart and wait for an arrow to soar into its center a slow chill crawled through her he would kill her now fidelias had given her a chance and she had made him suffer for it he would not allow himself to make the same mistake again her teacher would kill her without a moments hesitation if she got in his way again thats what im here to do she whispered she started shivering again though she tried to tell herself that it was not fear coloring her decision she felt it tickling at her belly racing with cold spiderfingers up and down her spine she could not allow herself the luxury of openly invoking her authority and revealing herself to fidelias to do so would be to invite her own death swift and certain she had to remain quiet as covert as possible a runaway slave would be a far less unusual occurrence here at the frontier than an emissary of the crown warning of possible invasion she couldnt allow her identity to be known until she knew who she could trust who could give her information that would let her act decisively to do any less would be to invite her own death and possibly disaster upon the valley she looked down at the boy her thoughts still in a tangle he hadnt needed to come and help her the previous evening but he had the boy had courage even if he lacked some more lifepreserving common sense and she had little choice but to be glad that he did that said something of him and in turn of the folk who had raised him in his sleep in his fever he had spoken not to a mother or a father but to his aunt whose name apparently was isana an orphan amara mused and as she did her belly rumbled she rose to her feet and padded among the trees planted around the pool as she expected she found more than a few fruitbearing trees among them gaius never acted with a single consequence in mind when he could manage several at once in creating this memorium for his fallen son he had raised a spectacular tribute to the princeps memory reminded the high lords exactly what power he commanded and provided a place of refuge for himself or for his agents all at the same time she picked fruit from the trees and ate studying the area around her amara went to the statues they had been armed with genuine shields and with weapons the short vicious blades of the royal guard meant to be used in close quarters to incapacitate or kill in a single blow she slid one from its sheath and tested it its edge proved to be keen and she returned it to its resting place food shelter and arms gaius was a paranoid old fox and she was glad for it her arm twinged as she slid the sword back and she glanced at the dirtied bandage on it she retrieved the knife from her discarded skirts and cut a fresh bandage from them she dried it first near one of the fires before cutting the old one off cleaning the wound with fresh water and applying fresh wrappings something else tugged at her attention but she pushed it firmly away there was work to be done amara moved quickly then making sure the boy was sleeping peacefully she gathered fruit onto one of the shields using it as a platter and rested it near him she washed their clothing in the pool and used branches from the small trees to dry them over one of the other fires she called upon the weary cirrus to stand guard around the memorium and to warn her should anyone approach and when those chores were done she found a smooth stone among the soil of the plants and used it to hone the edge of her knife that was when the tears took her when the memories of years of instruction conversation of life shared with the man who had been her teacher came rolling back over her she had loved him in her own way loved the danger of her work loved the experiences he shared with her loved the life to which she had been called he had known how much being a cursor meant to amara he had known and he had done everything to help her with her studies with graduating from the academy he did everything except tell you the truth amara felt the tears rising and she let them come it hurt it hurt to think that he had turned against the realm that he had in that single act of treachery endangered all that she had struggled to achieve to fight to protect he had declared his lifes purpose as a cursor to be empty meaningless and by extension hers as well his actions not his words said that it all had been a hollow vicious lie no matter what happened to amara she would stop him whatever he had planned however he had justified it fidelias was a traitor that cold fact struck her through the heart again and again the knife whispered it as the stone glided along the blades edge the steel wetted with her own tears traitor traitor she would stop him she had to stop him amara did not let herself make a sound she buried the sobs in her belly until her throat ached with the pain of holding them back she blinked the tears from her eyes and honed the edge of the little knife until it gleamed in the light from the fire chapter before noon of the next day the knights aeris brought fidelias together with aldrick the sword and the mad odiana down into the western end of the calderon valley grey clouds hung low and glowering overhead though their threat was an empty one the storm that had preceded them during the previous night had already headed off to the south where distant thunder could only barely be heard they were attired warmly against the nearwinter cold of the valley and breath steamed before every mouth fidelias stepped from the litter with a grimace and demanded of the captain of the contingent of knights you are certain that no one has arrived the man murmured something into the air then tilted his head to one side his eyes abstracted listening he nodded a moment later and said livus reports that there are still marat scouts moving here and there none of our observers saw anyone new coming into the valley that wasnt the question fidelias said he heard the sharp edge in his own voice the last thing we need is an envoy of the crown rousing garrison or bringing in reinforcements from riva the captain shook his head the storm last night was long and extremely violent no one could remain out in it and live i suppose its possible that someone skilled could have come in under it if they could have gotten to cover quickly enough she could fidelias cut off a reply with a wave of his hand the crows take gaius and everyone with him he always loved to show off even when creating distractions someones a grumpy boy this morning odiana murmured to aldrick the big swordsman debarked the litter and turned to lift the shapely woman lightly from it to the ground the water witch gave fidelias a smirk that fairly smoldered with sensuality and pressed herself against aldricks side beneath the curve of his arm one would think that he hadnt gotten enough sleep last night love peace aldrick rumbled the thick fingers of one huge hand sliding over her mouth a casual motion the womans eyes closed and she let out a happy sigh fidelias ignored the barb from the woman and said to the captain this is no time to get sloppy give the girls description to our men in riva if she comes through stop her quietly the same if any of the other cursors ive described to you show themselves the captain nodded and what do i tell the men here the same if you see someone unfamiliar in the air kill them it shouldnt take me long to make contact with our source then we move the captain nodded we were fortunate to have the wind last night sir we were able to bring in more men than we thought would be available fortunate fidelias laughed and tried to ignore the tension burning in his stomach that wind brought the storm and with it one of the crowns own captain i would not be so certain it was such a blessing the captain saluted stiffly and took a step back he murmured something else to the air then beckoned with a hand to the knights supporting the poles of the litter the men rose in a sudden column of rising wind and soared into the air and through the concealing underbelly of the clouds above within a few moments aldrick waited until they were well gone to say laconically you may have been a little hard on them if the crown wanted to craft someone into the valley nothing they could have done would have stopped him you dont know gaius fidelias replied he is neither allknowing nor infallible we should have moved last night wed have arrived amidst the storm the swordsman pointed out it could have killed us yes the nasty storm odiana murmured and then too excursor you would not have been given enough time to enjoy the pretty slave child the last few words of the sentence dripped with a kind of gloating glee the woman smiled her eyes sparkling as aldrick absently covered her mouth with his hand again she bit at his fingers letting out a soft growl and the swordsman let her a smile touching his mouth fidelias stared hard at the water witch she knew he couldnt be sure how much she knew about aquitaines wife and the aftermath of the dismal little scene the previous evening but he could see knowledge glittering in her eyes his belly burned a bit more as he considered the possible consequences should aquitaine learn of his wifes liaison with fidelias aquitaine seemed the type to overlook the forest for the trees at times but he would surely have little patience with anyone who would risk humiliating him by lying with his wife the few bites of biscuit fidelias had managed to get down during the flight threatened to come hurtling up again he kept the tension off of his face and thought that he would have to do something about the water witch she was fast becoming a liability fidelias gave her a flat neutral little smile and said i think we should focus on the task at hand seems pretty straightforward aldrick commented get on the horses ride to the meeting point talk to the savage ride out again fidelias glanced around and then murmured for vamma to fetch the horses the earth fury moved beneath his right foot a stirring in the ground of acknowledgment and vanished i dont anticipate that the ride will be a problem the savage might aldrick shrugged he wont be a problem the former cursor began tugging on his riding gloves you think your sword will alter anything for him it can alter all sorts of things fidelias smiled hes marat he isnt human they dont think the same way we do aldrick squinted at him almost frowning he wont be intimidated by you he regards your sword as something dangerousyoull just be the soft weak thing holding it aldricks expression didnt change fidelias sighed look aldrick the marat dont have the same notion of individuality that we do their whole culture is based around totems their tribes are built upon commonality of totem animals if a man has a powerful totem then he is a formidable man but if the man has to hide behind his totem instead of fighting beside it then it makes him somewhat contemptible theyve called us the dead tribe they regard armor and weaponry as our totemdead earth we hide behind our dead totems rather than going into battle beside them do you see no aldrick stated he slipped odiana from his side and started to draw on his gloves unconcerned that doesnt make any sense not to you fidelias said it makes perfect sense to a marat savages aldrick commented odiana turned to the packs and drew his scabbarded sword from it he held out his hand without looking and she slipped the weapon into it then watched as the swordsman buckled it on what happens if he doesnt cooperate leave that to me fidelias said aldrick raised his eyebrows i mean it keep your weapon at your side unless everything goes to the crows and if it does kill everything that isnt you me or the witch aldrick smiled what do i do odiana asked her duty to aldrick done she wandered a few paces away drawing the toe of her shoe through the mud lifting her heavier warmer skirts enough to be able to study the buckles just keep an eye on the marat if you feel them get angry warn us odiana frowned and looked up at fidelias she placed a hand on the shapely curve of one hip and said if aldrick gets to kill someone i should get to as well its only fair perhaps fidelias said i didnt get to kill anyone last night its my turn well see odiana stamped her foot on the ground and folded her arms scowling aldrick the big man went to her taking off his cape and absently slipping it over her shoulders the fabric could have wrapped around her twice quiet love you know ill let you have what you want she smiled up at him winsome truly dont i always he bent to the woman and kissed her one arm pressing her against him her full lips parted willingly to his mouth her body arching against his and she reached up a hand to rake her nails through his hair evidently delighted fidelias rubbed at the bridge of his nose where tension had begun to gather into a headache and walked a short distance away the horses arrived a moment later nudged into a calm walk by vamma and subtly guided over the ground fidelias called to the other two who broke from their embrace only reluctantly and the three saddled and mounted without further discussion as he had predicted the ride passed uneventfully etan bounded along before them through the trees the wood fury taking the form of a large silent squirrel always just far enough into the shadows to be seen only in faint outline fidelias followed the bounding flickering shape of his fury without the need for conscious effort he had been using etan to track for him and guide him since he had been barely more than a boy they crossed the crown causeway and rode north and east through barren woodland filled with ragged pine trees brambles and thorns toward the glowering shape of mountain rising up several miles before them the mountain fidelias remembered as well as the pine barrens around it had a bad reputation for being hostile to humans little wonder the marat had wanted a meeting near to what would be a safe area for his kind fidelias flexed his right foot in the stirrup as he rode frowning the boot didnt fit correctly without his knife in it he felt a faint and bitter smile stretch his lips the girl had been brighter than hed given her credit for shed seen an opportunity and exploited it ruthlessly just as shed been taught to do as her patriserus he felt an undeniable stirring of pride in her accomplishment but as a professional there was only a cold tense frustration she should have become an asset to his effort and instead she had become a dangerously unknown factor in the play of events if she was in the valley there was no limit to how much havoc she could potentially wreak with his plansand even if she wasnt the distraction of guarding against the possibility was nothing trivial in itself how would he disrupt the plan in motion were he in her place fidelias considered it no that would be the wrong approach he preferred short brutal solutions to such matters the less complicated the better too much could go wrong with finesse in a situation like this amara thought in a far less linear manner the simplest solution would be to get to the nearest steadholder declare her status and dragoon everyone she could lay her hands on into spreading word through the valley that some sort of mischief was abroad in that event hed have several dozen woodcrafty holders roaming about the valley and one of them would almost certainly see something and know it for what it was if she did that identifying herself and her location matters would be simpler a swift stroke would remove her from the equation and he could then muddy the waters until it was too late for the holders to stop matters from proceeding amara would realize the danger of such a course naturally she would need to be more circumspect than that less linear she would be improvising as she went along while he would by necessity play the hunter beating the bushes to force her to move and then acting swiftly to cut off anything she might attempt fidelias smiled at the irony it seemed they would both be playing to their strong suits well enough then the girl was talented but inexperienced she wouldnt be the first person he had outmaneuvered and destroyed she wouldnt be the last a flicker of motion from etan warned fidelias that the three riders were not alone in the grey shadows of the woods he drew his mount to a stop at once lifting his hand to signal the others to do the same there was silence there among the dimness of the evergreens broken only by the breathing of the three horses the drip of rainwater from the trees to the forest floor and the soft sigh of cold northern wind fideliass mount threw back its head and let out a short shrill sound of fear the other two horses picked up on it heads lifted high and eyes wide and white odianas mount threw its head about and danced to one side nervous and spooky fidelias reached out to vamma at once and the earth fury acted upon his will spreading to the beasts around him the soothing calm of the deep earth fidelias felt the earth furys influence expand like a slow wave until it rippled over the horses stealing away the restless agitation and letting their riders bring the beasts once more under control something watches the water witch hissed she drew her mount close to aldricks side her dark eyes glittering and agatehard they are hungry aldrick pursed his lips then put one hand on his sword he didnt otherwise straighten from the relaxed slouch he had maintained during the whole ride easy fidelias murmured putting a hand on his horses neck lets move forward theres a clearing just ahead lets give ourselves some open space around us they eased the horses forward into a clearing and though the mounts were under control they still tossed their heads restlessly eyes and ears flicking about for some sign of whatever enemy they had scented fidelias led them to the center of the clearing though it scarcely gave them thirty feet on any side the shadows fell thick through the trees the wan grey light creating pools of shifting fluid dimness between branch and bough he scanned the edges of the clearing until he spotted the vague outline of etans form the squirrellike shape flickering around the edges of a patch of dimness then he nudged his horse forward a step and addressed it directly show yourself come out to speak beneath the sun and the sky for a moment nothing happened then a shape within that dimness resolved itself into the form of a marat and stepped forward into the clearing he stood tall and relaxed his pale hair worn in a long braid across his scalp and down the nape of his neck dark wiry feathers had been worked into the braid his wore a buckskin belt and loincloth about his hips and nothing more he bore a hookshaped knife in his right hand gleaming like dark glass at his side paced a herdbane one of the tall predator birds of the plains beyond it more than matched the marat in height though its neck and legs were so thickly built with muscle as to seem stumpy and clumsy fidelias knew that they were not the birds beak gleamed in tandem with the marats knife and the terrible raking claws upon its feet scratched through the bed of damp pine needles covering the forest floor and tore at the earth beneath you are not atsurak fidelias said he kept his voice measured clear his speech almost rhythmic i seek him you seek atsurak chovin of the herdbane tribe the marat said his own guttural voice in the same cadence i stand between you you must stand elsewhere that i will not do you must go back fidelias shook his head that i will not do then there will be blood the marat said his knife twitched and the herdbane beside him let out a low whistling hiss from behind fidelias odiana murmured ware he is not alone fidelias followed etans flickering unseen guidance to our left and right at right angles he murmured back to aldrick arent you going to talk aldrick asked his voice a lazy drawl fidelias reached up a hand to scratch at his neck squinting at the marat these three evidently disagree with their chovin their chief they arent interested in talking odiana let out a breathy oh goodie the former cursor gripped the hilt of the knife that hung at the back of his neck and whipped his arm forward and down there was a flicker of grey light on steel and then the spikelike throwing knife buried itself in the herdbane its handle protruding from the birds head just where its beak met its skull the herdbane let out a scream and leapt into the air in a great spasm it fell to the forest floor screaming still thrashing viciously in its agony from the left and right came a sudden shriek of sound the war cries of the birds and their masters one savage paired with a bird rushing the group from either side fidelias felt more than saw aldrick slip to the ground and turn to face one pair but he heard quite clearly the rasp of the mans sword being drawn odiana murmured something under her breath a soft cooing sound the lead marat rushed to the fallen herdbanes side for a moment and then with a decisive motion ripped the hookshaped knife over the birds throat the herdbane let out a final weak whistle and then shuddered to stillness on the ground as its blood stained the earth then the marat turned toward fidelias with his face set in a flat murderous rage and flung himself at the former cursor fidelias barked a command to vamma and flicked his hand in his attackers direction the ground beneath the marat bucked in response throwing him to one side sending him sprawling fidelias took the opportunity to dismount from his increasingly agitated horse and to draw the dagger from the sheath at his hip the marat regained its balance and rushed him aiming to move past his opponent raking the horrible knife along fideliass belly in passing disemboweling him fidelias was familiar with the technique and countered by facing the marat squarely meeting his rush with one boot abruptly thrust out at the marats knee he felt his foot connect hard and something snapped in the marats leg the marat let out a squall and fell whipping its knife at fideliass thigh as it did the aleran pushed away from the marats body in the same motion pulling his leg clear a fingers width ahead of the knife then turned to face his opponent the marat attempted to rise to his feet only to have his knee buckle he fell into the pine needles fidelias turned and walked toward the nearest tree glancing back at the others as he did aldrick stood at the edge of the clearing facing out his blade gripped and held parallel to the ground his arm extended straight out to his side an almost dancelike pose behind the swordsman lay a herdbane its head missing its body flopping and clawing wildly evidently unaware of its own impending death the marat that had rushed aldrick knelt on the forest floor its head lowered and swaying its hands pressing at its belly and stained with blood on the other side of the clearing odiana sat on her horse humming quietly to herself the ground in front of her had it had seemed quite abruptly transformed into bog neither marat nor herdbane could be seen but the silt and mud before her stirred vaguely as though something thrashed unseen beneath its surface the water witch noticed him looking at her and commented her tone warm i love the way the ground smells after a rain fidelias didnt answer her he reached up instead using his knife to make a deep cut scoring a branch on the nearest tree he broke it off and as the others turned to watch him put his knife away took the heavy branch in both hands and from out of the lamed marats knife reach methodically clubbed him to death thats one way to do it aldrick commented if you dont mind spattering blood everywhere fidelias tossed the branch down to one side you got blood everywhere he pointed out aldrick walked back to the clearings center he took a handkerchief from his pocket and used it to fastidiously clean his blade but mines in a pattern its aesthetically pleasing you should have had me do it for you deads dead fidelias said i can do my own chores he glanced at odiana and said happy now the water witch still atop her horse smiled at him and let out a little sigh do you think we shall have more rain fidelias shook his head and called out atsurak you saw what they intended he had the satisfaction of seeing aldrick tense and halfturn to one side and even odiana caught her breath in her throat the former cursor smiled and took up his horses reins laying a hand on the beasts neck and stroking it from the trees came a gravelly voice a satisfiedsounding hah then there was the sound of motion through the brush and a fourth marat appeared this man had eyes of glittering brilliant gold a match for those of the sleek swiftlooking bird beside him he wore his knife at his belt rather than in his handand he also carried a sword bound with a rawhide thong about its hilt and blade and slung over one shoulder he had a halfdozen grass plaits bound over his limbs and his face had been rawly abraded bruised the marat stopped several paces from the trio and held up his hands open palms toward them fidelias mirrored the gesture and stepped forward what i did was necessary atsurak looked down at the dead man only a few paces away whose skull fidelias had crushed it was necessary the man agreed his voice quiet but a waste had they met me openly i would have killed only one the marat squinted at odiana staring at the woman with a silent hawklike intensity before turning an equally intent regard to aldrick deadlanders they fight well time is pressing fidelias responded is everything in readiness i am the chovin of my tribe they will follow me fidelias nodded and turned to his horse then we go wait atsurak said lifting a hand there is a problem fidelias paused and looked at the marat chieftain during the last sun i hunted humans not far from this place impossible fidelias said no one goes here the marat took the sword from his shoulder and with a pair of casual motions unbound the thong from the weapon he flicked it forward so that its point drove into the ground a pace ahead and to one side of fidelias i hunted humans atsurak said as though fidelias hadnt spoken two males old and young the old commanded a spirit of the earth my chala the mate to this one he put his hand on the herdbanes feathered back was slain wounded the old one i hunted them but the young one was swift and led me from his trail aldrick stepped forward and took up the sword from the ground he used the same cloth he had cleaned his own weapon with to brush the mud from the blade legionissue he reported his eyes distant design from a few years ago well cared for the wrappings are worn smooth he took off a glove and touched his skin to the blade his eyes closing someone with a measure of experience used this del i think hes a legion scout or was one fidelias drew in a sharp breath atsurak these two you hunted they are dead atsurak shrugged the old ones blood flowed like a stream his spirit carried him away but he was already pouring out into the earth the young one ran well and was fortunate fidelias spat a sudden acid taste out of his mouth and clenched his jaw i understand i have come to look at this valley and i have seen i have seen that the deadlanders wait to fight that they are strong and watch carefully fidelias shook his head you were unfortunate atsurak nothing more the attack will be a victory for your people i question your judgment the marat have come many tribes have come but though they have no love for your people they have little for me they will follow me to a victorybut not to a slaughter all is in readiness your people will sweep clean the valley of your fathers and mothers and my lord will see to it that it is returned to you so he has pledged atsuraks lip curled into something like a sneer your chovin chovin of the aquitaine do you bear his totem as bond fidelias nodded once i will see it fidelias stepped back to his horse and opened one of the saddlebags from it he drew aquaitaines dagger its hilt elaborately worked with gold and with the seal of the house of aquitaine he held it up so that the savage could see the weapon satisfied atsurak extended his hand fidelias narrowed his eyes this was not a part of our agreement the marats eyes flashed with something hot vicious he said in a very soft voice nor was the death of my chala already there is bad blood between your people and mine now there is more you will give me your chovins totem as bond and then i will fulfill my end of the bargain fidelias frowned and then he flicked the knife still in its scabbard to the marat in an underhand throw atsurak caught it without looking nodded and turned to walk back into the woods a few paces past the first branches he and the stalking bird beside him vanished aldrick stared after the savage chieftain for a moment and then at fidelias i want to know what in the name of all the furies you think you are doing fidelias glared at the man then turned back to his mount and secured the saddlebags again you heard him somethings got the marat spooked without the dagger he wasnt staying aldricks expression darkened thats a signet weapon it can be traced back to aquitaine hes a marat hordemaster hes going to be fighting in the front of the bloody battle fidelias grated his teeth and spoke in a slow patient tone yes aldrick it can yes aldrick he will thus we had best be damned sure that the attack succeeds fidelias slapped the saddlebags back over the horse after the valley has been taken it wont matter what plunder the marat have events will be in motion by then and it will all fall into politics aldrick gripped fidelias by the shoulder and spun the smaller man to face him the swordsmans eyes were hard if it doesnt theres evidence if it gets back to the senate theyll bring charges against him fidelias treason the former cursor glanced down at aldricks hand then up the length of the swordsmans arm to his face he met his eyes in silence for several seconds before saying youre a brilliant fighter aldrick you could kill me right here and we both know it but ive been playing the game for a long time and we both know that you cant do it before i have a chance to react youll be less of a swordsman without your hand without your feet he let the words hang in the air for a moment and the ground shifted very slightly beneath the pair of them as vamma stirred through the earth fidelias let his voice drop to something quiet cool he used the same tone when ordering a man to dig his own grave make up your mind dance or stand down silence stretched between them the swordsman looked away first his stance shifting back into his usual relaxed slouch he picked up the weapon the marat had left and stood facing the other way for a moment fidelias let out a slow silent breath and waited for the tooquick pulse in his throat to slow down again then he turned and mounted his horse folding his hands over the pommel to hide their trembling its a necessary risk well take precautions aldrick nodded his expression unhappy resolved what precautions fidelias jerked his chin toward the sword we start with finding these two who have actually seen the marat in the valley if that belonged to a retired scout he might work out whats going on odiana nudged her horse over to aldricks took the reins and led the mount over to the man her eyes on fidelias her expression pensive the swordsman mounted and slipped the captured sword away into a strap behind the saddle so we find them then what fidelias turned his horse and started riding out of the clearing aiming their path in a gentle circle around the outside of the mountain toward the causeway where he was most likely to find the signs of anyone passing from the mountain and toward the nearest steadhold we find out what they know odiana asked and if they know too much fidelias glanced at his riding gloves and flicked a drying spot of blood from one of them we make sure they stay quiet chapter and thats what happened tavi said it all started with that one little lie and all i wanted to do was to get those sheep back show my uncle that i could handle things without anyones help that i was independent and responsible he picked up a rind from one of the bright orange fruits and threw it back into the plants at the waters edge scowling his thoughts in a turmoil you dont have any furies at all the slave repeated her voice still stunned none tavi hunched his shoulders against her tone and gathered the scarlet cloak closer around him as though the fabric might ward off the sensation of isolation her words brought him his voice came out harsher than hed meant it to defensive thats right so im still a good herder im the best apprentice in the valley furies or not oh amara said quickly no i didnt mean to no one means to tavi said but they all do they look at me like like im crippled even though i can run like im blind even though i can see it doesnt matter what i do or how well i do it everyone looks at me the same way he shot her a glance and said like you are right now amara frowned and rose her torn skirts and her appropriated cloak swaying about her ankles im sorry she said tavi its unusual i know ive never heard of anyone with that problem before but youre also young its possible that you just havent grown into it yet i mean youre what twelve thirteen fifteen tavi mumbled he rested his chin on his knees and sighed amara winced i see and youre worried about your service in the legions what service tavi said i dont have any furies what are the legions going to do with me i wont be able to send signals like the aircrafters hold the lines with the earthcrafters or attack with the firecrafters i wont be able to heal anyone with the watercrafters i cant forge a sword or wield one like a metalcrafter i cant scout and hide or shoot like a woodcrafter and im small im not even good for handing a spear and fighting in the ranks what are they going to do with me no one will be able to question your courage tavi you showed me that last night courage tavi sighed as near as i can figure it all courage gets you is more of a beating than if youd run away sometimes thats important she pointed out taking a beating not running away he frowned and said nothing the slave remained silent for several moments before she settled down beside him wrapping the scarlet cloak around her they listened to the rain outside for a few moments when amara spoke her words took tavi off guard what would you do if you had a choice what tavi quirked his head and looked up at her if you could choose anything to do with your life anywhere to go amara said what would you do where would you go the academy he said at once id go there you dont have to be a crafter there you just have to be smart and i am i can read and write and do figures my aunt taught me she lifted her brows the academy it isnt just for knights you know tavi said they train legates there and architects and engineers counselors musicians artists you dont have to be a skilled crafter to design buildings or argue law amara nodded or you could be a cursor tavi wrinkled up his nose and snorted and spend my life delivering mail how exciting could that be the slave nodded her expression sober good point tavi swallowed against a sudden tightness in his throat out here on the steadholt crafting keeps you alive literally back in the cities it isnt as important you can still be someone other than a freak you can make your own life for yourself the academy is the only place in alera where you can do that sounds like youve thought about this a lot amara said quietly my uncle saw it once when his legion was on review for the first lord he told me about it and ive talked to soldiers on their way up to garrison traders last spring uncle promised me that if i showed him enough responsibility hed give me a few sheep of my own i figured out that if i took care of them and sold them next year and saved up all of my pay from the legions that i could put together enough money for a semester at the academy one semester amara asked what then tavi shrugged i dont know try to find some way to stay i might be able to get someone to be a patron or i dont know something she turned to look at him for a moment and said youre very brave tavi my uncle will never give me the sheep after this if hes not dead the tightness in his throat choked him and he bowed his head he could feel tears filling his closed eyes im sure hes all right the slave said tavi nodded but he couldnt speak the anguish hed been trying to keep stuffed down inside rose up in him and the tears fell onto his cheeks uncle bernard couldnt be dead he just couldnt how would tavi ever be able to live with that how would he ever face his aunt tavi lifted his fist and shoved angrily at the tears staining his cheeks at least youre alive amara pointed out her voice quiet she put a hand on his shoulder thats nothing to take lightly given what you went through yesterday you survived i get the feeling that when i get back home im going to wish i hadnt tavi said his voice choking wry he blinked away the tears and summoned up a smile for the young woman she returned it can i ask you something he shrugged sure why endanger what youd been working toward why did you agree to help this beritte if you knew it could cause problems for you i didnt think it would tavi said his voice plaintive i mean i thought i could have done it all it wasnt until nearly the end of the day that i realized i was going to have to pick between getting all the sheep in and those hollybells and id promised her ah said the slave but her expression remained dubious tavi felt his cheeks color again and he looked down all right he sighed she kissed me and my brains melted and dribbled out my ears now that i can believe amara said she stretched her foot toward the water flicking idly at its surface with her toes what about you tavi asked she tilted her head to one side what do you mean he shrugged and looked up at her again uncertain ive been doing all the talking you havent said a thing about yourself slaves dont usually wander around this far from the road or a steadholt all alone i figured that uh you must have run away no the young woman said firmly but i did get lost in the storm i was on my way to garrison to deliver a message for my master tavi squinted up at her he just sent you out like that a woman alone i dont question his orders tavi i just obey them tavi frowned but nodded well okay i guess but do you think you could come along with me maybe talk to my uncle he could make sure you got to garrison safely get you a hot meal some warmer clothes the slaves eyes wrinkled at the corners thats a very polite way to take someone prisoner tavi he flushed im sorry especially since you probably saved my life and all but if you are a runaway and i dont do something about it the law could come back to hurt my uncle he pushed his hair back from his eyes and ive done enough to mess things up already i understand she said ill come with you thank you he glanced up at the doorway sounds like the rains stopped do you think its safe to go the slave frowned and looked outside for a moment i doubt its going to get any safer if we wait we should get back to your steadholt before the storm gets bad again you think it will amara nodded the motion confident it has that feel to it all right are you going to be all right walking he glanced at her and down at her foot her ankle was swollen around a purpling bruise amara grimaced its just my ankle not the rest of the foot it hurts but if im careful i should be all right tavi blew out a breath and pushed himself to his feet all the cuts and injuries twinged and ached muscle protesting he had to brace his hand on the wall for a moment until he got his balance back okay then i guess it isnt going to get any easier i guess not amara let out a small pained sound as she got to her feet as well well we make a fine pair of traveling companions lead the way tavi headed out of the memorium and into the chill of the northern wind blowing down from the mountains in the north and the sea of ice beyond though tavi had kept the scarlet cloak from the memorium the wind was still almost enough to make him turn back inside and seek shelter frozen blades of grass crunched beneath his feet and his breath came out in a steamy haze before his mouth swiftly torn apart by the winds there could be no more argument on the subject winter had arrived in full force upon the calderon valley and the first snow could not be far behind he glanced at the slave behind him amaras expression seemed remote distracted and she walked with a definite limp bare feet pale against the icy grass tavi winced and said we should stop before long to get your feet warmed up we could strip one of the cloaks at least try to wrap them the wrappings would freeze she said after a moments silence the air will keep them warm better than cloth just keep going once we get to your steadholt we can warm them up tavi frowned more at the way her attention seemed fixed on things elsewhere than at what she had to say he resolved to keep a close eye on her frozen feet were nothing to scoff at and if she was used to life in the city she might not realize how dangerous it could be on the frontier or how quickly frostbite could claim her limbs or her life he stepped up the pace a little and amara kept up with him they reached the causeway and started down it but had walked for no morethan an hour when tavi felt the ground begin to rumble a tremor so faint that he had to stop and place his spread fingers against the flagstones in order to detect it hold on he said i think someones coming amaras expression sharpened almost at once and tavi saw her draw the cloak a little more closely against her her hands beneath it and out of sight her eyes flickered around them can you tell who tavi chewed on his lip feels kind of like brutus my uncles fury maybe its him the slave swallowed and said i feel it now earth fury coming in only a moment more bernard appeared from around a curve in the road the flagstones themselves rippled up into a wave beneath his feet which he kept planted and still his brow furrowed in concentration so that the earth moved him forward in one slow undulation like a leaf borne upon an ocean wave he wore his winter hunting clothes heavy and warm his cloak one of thanadenthide layered with gleaming black featherfur and proof against the coldest nights he bore his heaviest bow in his hand an arrow already strung to it and his eyes though sunken and surrounded by darker patches of skin gleamed alertly the steadholder came down the road as swiftly as a man could run his pace only slowing as he neared the two travelers the earth slowly subsiding beneath his feet until he stood upon the causeway walking the final few paces to them uncle tavi cried and threw himself at the man wrapping his arms as far around him as they could go thank the furies i was so afraid that youd been hurt bernard laid a hand on tavis shoulder and the young man thought he felt his uncle relax just a little then he gently firmly pushed tavi back and away from him tavi blinked up at him his stomach twisting in sudden uncertainty uncle are you all right no bernard rumbled his voice quiet he kept his eyes on tavi steadily i was hurt so were others because i was out chasing sheep with you but uncle tavi began bernard waved a hand his voice hard if not angry you didnt mean it i know but because of your mischief some of my folk came to grief your aunt nearly died were going home yes sir tavi said quietly im sorry to do it but you can forget about those sheep tavi it appears that there are some things you arent swift to learn after all but what about tavi began peace the big man growled a warning anger in the tone and tavi cringed feeling the tears well in his eyes its done bernard lifted his glower from tavi and asked who the crows are you tavi heard the rustle of cloth as the slave dipped into a curtsey my name is amara sir i was carrying a message for my master from riva to garrison i became lost in the storm the boy found me he saved my life sir tavi felt a brief flash of gratitude toward the slave and looked up at his uncle hopefully you were out in that fortune favors fools and children bernard said he grunted and asked youre a runaway are you no sir well see bernard said come with me lass dont run if i have to track you down ill get irritable yes sir bernard nodded and then frowned at tavi again his voice hardening when we get home boy youre to go to your room and stay there until i decide what to do with you understand tavi blinked up at his uncle shocked he had never reacted like this before even when hed given tavi a whipping there had never been the sense of raw scantily controlled anger in his voice bernard was always in control of himself always calm always relaxed looking up at his uncle tavi felt acutely aware of the sheer size of the man of the hard angry glitter to his eyes of the strength of his huge hands he didnt dare speak but he tried to plead with his uncle silently letting his expression show how sorry he was how much he wanted things to be right again he knew dimly that he was crying but he didnt care bernards face remained hard as granite and as unforgiving do you understand boy tavis hopes crumbled before that gaze wilted away before the heat of his uncles anger i understand sir he whispered bernard turned away and started walking down the causeway again back toward home hurry up he said without looking back ive wasted enough time on this nonsense tavi stared after him shocked numb his uncle hadnt been this angry the day before when hed caught tavi leaving what had made this happen what could drive his uncle to that kind of fury the answer came at once someone he cared about had been harmed his sister isana had she truly almost died oh furies how bad was it he had lost something tavi knew something more than sheep or status as a skilled apprentice he had lost his uncles respectsomething that he had only just began to realize that he had possessed bernard had never treated him like the others not reallynever shown him pity for his lack of furycraft never assumed tavis incompetence there had been especially over the past few months a kind of comradeship tavi hadnt known with anyone else a quiet and unobtrusive bond between nearequals rather than his uncle speaking down to a child it was something that had been built slowly over the past several years as he served as his uncles apprentice and it was gone tavi had never really realized it was there and it was gone so were the sheep so was his chance at the future of escaping this valley escaping his own status as a furyless freak an unwanted bastard child of the legion camps tears blinded him though he fought to keep them silent he couldnt see his uncle though bernards impatient snarl came to him clearly tavi he didnt hear amara start walking until he had stumbled forward after his uncle he put one foot in front of the other blindly the ache inside him as sharp and more painful than any of the wounds he had received the day before tavi walked without looking up it didnt matter where his feet were taking him he wasnt going anywhere chapter for amara the walk back to bernardholt proved to be a long and arduous exercise in ignoring pain despite her words to tavi earlier that morning her ankle injured during the wild landing beneath last nights storm had stiffened and burned hideously barely supporting her weight at all similarly the cut aldrick ex gladius had dealt her back in the renegade camp throbbed and ached she could barely ignore one injury without the other occupying her full attention but even so she had enough presence of mind to feel pain on behalf of the boy trudging along in front of her the reaction of his uncle had not been unkind she thought at first many men would simply have commenced with beating the boy and only after would they have had anything to say about why the beating had been delivered if at all but the longer she walked the more clear it became just how deeply injured the boy had been by his uncles wordsor perhaps the lack of them he was used to being treated kindly and with some measure of respect the quiet cool distance that the steadholder had shown was new to tavi and it had hurt him badlydashing his hopes for making a future for himself at the academy and driving home the notion that without furycrafting of his own he was nothing more than a helpless child a danger to himself and others and here on the wild frontiers of the realm of humanity where life or death hinged on the daily struggle against hostile furies and beasts perhaps it was true amara shook her head and focused on the stones of the causeway beneath her feet though she felt some empathy for the boy she could not allow his plight to distract her from her task namely to discover what was happening within the valley and then to take whatever action she thought best to see to it that the realm was protected she already had some facts to piece together and her attention was best spent on them the marat had returned to the calderon valley something that had not happened in nearly seventeen years the marat warrior tavi and his uncle had confronted could well have been an advance scout for an attacking horde but the growing light of day made that possibility seem increasingly remote bringing inconsistencies to light if they had truly encountered a marat why had the boys uncle showed virtually no relief upon finding his missing nephew for that matter how had the steadholder been on his feet again at all if the wounds were as serious as the boy had described it would have taken an extremely talented watercrafter to have had bernard on his feet again and amara didnt think that anyone that skilled would live far from one of the major cities of the realm surely the injury must have been less than the boy describedand if that was true then perhaps the incident with the marat had been likewise exaggerated put into the context of fiction tavis tale of his adventures the previous day made a great deal more sense the boy crushed with feelings of inadequacy could have made up the tales in order to make himself feel more important it was a far more plausible explanation of what he had told her amara frowned it was a more plausible explanation but the boys courage and resourcefulness could not be denied not only had he survived the violent furystorm of the evening before but he had also rescued herat considerable danger to himselfwhen he could have taken himself to safety without risk such courage conviction and sacrifice rarely went hand in hand with falsehood in the end amara decided that she had very little information to work with until she had spoken to the uncle as welland he seemed to be in no mood for any kind of discussion she would have to learn more if the marat were preparing to attack again defending against them would require a major mobilization at the end of the year and at fantastic expense to both the high lord of riva and the crowns treasury there would be resistance to such newsand if she went to the local count with nothing more than the word of a shepherd boy to go on she would doubtless hear endless repetitions of the tale of the boy who cried thanadent she would need the testimony of one of the counts trusted landowners one of the steadholders to get more than a token response the best reaction she could hope for in such a case would be for the count to dispatch scouts of his own to find the enemy and even if they managed to return from such a deadly encounter it might be with a marat horde on their heels the marat could swallow the valley in one assault and ravage the lands around riva while its high lord held captive by the onrush of winter could do little but watch his lands be destroyed ideally with bernards testimony she might get the count to mount a more active defense from garrison and to send to riva for reinforcements perhaps even manage a preemptive strike something that might disperse the wave of an oncoming horde before it broke upon the realms shores on the other hand if there was no imminent invasion and the crowns agent roused the local legions and incurred vast expenditure on riva it would be a major embarrassment before the other high lords and the senate gaiuss reputation might not survive the subsequent attacks further agitating the already restless high lords with what could be tragic results amara swallowed gaius had assigned her to represent his interests in the valley her decisions would be his and while he would bear the moral and ethical responsibility for her actions here the high lords might demand legal retribution against her for the misuse of crown authorityand gaius would be compelled to grant it imprisonment blinding and crucifixion were some of the gentler sentences she could expect from such a trial the crowns reputation the possible security of the realm and her own life rode upon her decisions best she make them carefully she needed more information they came to bernardholt some time just after the sun reached its peak amara was struck at once by the solidity of the place she had been born and raised in a steadholt and she knew the signs of a strong holdingand one in a heightened state of alert the steadholts central buildings had walls higher than some military encampments reaching nearly twice the height of a man and made of seamless dark grey stone laboriously raised from the ground by a powerful earthcrafter the gates heavy oak bound with steel were halfclosed and a grizzled holder wearing an old sword stood on the wall above them squinting laconically out over the distance outbuildings stood not far from the walls all of them onestory affairs including what looked like a forge vast gargant burrow a combination barn and stables and several animal pens the granary she knew would be within the central enclosure along with the kitchens the living areas and several smaller holding pens for animals usually used only in emergencies a pair of gargants tended by a tall handsome young man with windruddy cheeks and black hair stood in harness waiting patiently while he threw several long heavy ropes into a sack and secured it to one side of the harness frederic bernard called as they drew closer what are you doing with the team the young man already tall and strong for a boy not yet old enough to depart for the legions tugged at a forelock with one hand and ducked his head to the steadholder taking them down to the south field to pull out that big stone sir can you handle the fury in that one thumper and me can yes sir the boy started to turn away hullo tavi glad youre back in one piece amara looked at the shepherd boy but tavi barely lifted his gaze to the other young man he waved a hand the motion vague bernard grunted theres another storm in the air i want you back in two hours fred whether the stones moved or not i have no intentions of more people getting hurt frederic nodded and turned back to his work as bernard strode on to the gates nodded to the watchmen over them and slipped into the steadholt proper once inside bernard said tavi the boy without waiting to hear anything else paced toward the side of the great hall and flung himself up the wooden staircase built along the outside of the building and into a door on the upper story where amara knew living quarters would commonly be situated bernard watched the young man vanish inside with a grimace on his face then he let out a heavy sigh and glanced back at her you come with me yes sir amara said and sketched a small curtsey it was then that her ankle chose to give out on her altogether and she wavered to one side with a little yelp bernards hand shot out and gripped her shoulder through the scarlet cloak steadying herand closing tightly over the painful cut on her upper arm she let out an involuntary gasp of pain and her balance swam the big steadholder stepped forward and simply picked her up as though she weighed no more than a child crows girl he muttered with a scowl if you were hurt you should have said something amara swallowed as a pang of relief from her beleaguered body warred with a nervous anxiety at the steadholders sudden proximity like aldrick he was an enormous man but he exuded none of the sense of placid patient danger that surrounded the swordsman his strength was something differentwarm and reassuring and alive and he smelled of leather and hay amara struggled to say something but wound up remaining awkwardly silent as the steadholder carried her into the great hall and then into the kitchens behind it where warm air and the smells of baking bread wrapped around her like a blanket he carried her over to a table near the fire and promptly sat her down upon it sir really she said im all right bernard snorted the crows you are girl he turned and drew up a stool to the table and sat down on it taking her foot quite gently between his hands his touch was warm confident and again she felt soothed as though some of that confidence had transferred into her by the touch cold he said not as bad as it could be you used crafting to keep your feet warm she blinked at him and nodded mutely no substitute for a good pair of socks he frowned over her foot fingers moving smoothly hurt there she shook her head there pain flashed through the whole of her leg and she couldnt keep the grimace from her face she nodded not broken sprain we need to get your feet warmed up he rose and walked to a shelf withdrawing a small copper tub he touched a finger to the spigot above the washbasin and held his hand beneath it until the water streaming out steamed and turned his skin red with its heat then he started filling the tub amara cleared her throat and said you are the steadholder sir bernard nodded then you should not be doing this sir washing my feet i mean bernard snorted we dont hold much with that city nonsense out here girl i see sir as you wish of course but may i ask you another question if you like the boy tavi he told me that you were attacked by a marat warrior and one of their war birds is that true bernard grunted his expression darkening he tapped the spigot again rather sharply and the water cut off with an apologetic little hiccup tavi likes to tell stories she tilted her head to one side but did it happen he placed the tub on the stool hed sat upon a moment before and took her foot and part of her calf in hand for a moment amara was acutely conscious of the sensation of his skin upon hers the way the cloak and her skirts had fallen to reveal her leg nearly to the knee she felt her face heat but if the steadholder took note of it he gave no sign he slipped her injured foot into the water then motioned for her to put the other there as well her coldnumbed feet tingled unpleasantly and steam curled up from the tub how did you hurt your leg he asked her i slipped and fell she replied she repeated to him her story about carrying a message to garrison on behalf of her master adding in a fall just before tavi found her the steadholders expression darkened well have to send him word youre not in any shape to continue traveling for another day or two wait until your feet have warmed up then dry them off and have a seat he turned toward a larder opened it and withdrew a homespun sack full of tubers he dropped that a large bowl and a small knife on the table everyone under my roof works lass once you warm up peel these ill be back directly to see about your arm she lifted a hand resting it over the bandage on her opposite arm youre just going to leave me here with that ankle you wont be going far and theres another storm rising the closest shelter other than this hall is the princeps memorium and it looks like youve already cleaned that place out he nodded toward the scarlet cloak id be thinking about what i was going to say to count gram about that if i were you safeguarding the memorium is his responsibility i doubt hes going to be terribly happy with you or your master whoever he is bernard turned and started to leave through the doors to the hall sir amara blurted you didnt tell me if it was true or not what tavi said about the marat youre right he said i didnt then he left amara stared after the man for a moment in frustration she looked from the doorway hed vanished through down to her feet in the steaming basin and then back up again sensation was returning to her feet in an uncomfortable ripple of sharp pinpricks she shook her head and waited for the feeling in her feet to return to something closer to normal a maddening man she thought confidence bordering upon arrogance she would not be so poorly treated in any court in the realm which was the point of course this was not one of the cities here on the steadholt his word was literal law on nearly any matter one could nameincluding the disposition and nondebilitating punishment of a runaway slave were she a slave in fact rather than in fiction he could have done nearly anything to her and as long as he returned her in one piece and capable of fulfilling her duties the law would support him as though he were a citizen instead of caring for her and leaving her in a warm room with her feet in a hot bath he could have as easily stabled her with the animals or put her to any of a number of other uses her cheeks flushed again the man had affected her and he shouldnt have she had seen him riding an earthwavehe was an earthcrafter after all some of them could affect the temperaments of animals and the base natures of human beings as well draw out raw primal impulses that otherwise would never surface that would explain it but then and more to the point he had been very gentle with her when he held her he neednt have done so much as let her onto his land and he had all but forcibly pressed hospitality onto her despite his threats and words he hadnt locked her in a cellar or shown anything but concern and kindness amara stirred her feet in the water frowning the steadholder was clearly a man who commanded some measure of respect in his people his steadholt was solid and obviously prosperous the holdfolk she had seen had been clean and well fed his reaction to the boy had been severe in its own fashion but restrained by the standards of most of the realm had the man wanted her he could simply have taken her and not bothered with crafting her into a frenzy the contrast of his strength physical and otherwise against several demonstrations of gentleness was a surprising one though she had no doubts that he could be a hard man when called upon she sensed a genuine kindness in his manner and an obvious love for the boy amara drew her feet from the tub and patted them dry with the towel then lowered herself from the table and perched gingerly on another stool she reached for the paring knife and one of the tubers and started skinning the peel off of it dropping the peel in a smooth spiral into the tub of water shed just used and depositing the flesh of the root into the bowl the steadholder had left her the task was soothing in its own way repetitive comforting she had been through a lot in the past few hours her world had been shaken and shed faced death at close quarters more than once that might explain the sudden vibrance of her emotions of her pure physical reaction to the steadholder he was after all an imposing and not unattractive man she supposed she might have had the same reaction to anyone in such proximity to her soldiers reacted that way often when death was so near at hand seizing at any opportunity to live life more richly more fully that must have been it amara decided but that got her no closer to accomplishing her mission she blew out a frustrated breath bernard had neither confirmed nor denied the encounter with the marat any mention of it in fact seemed to have made him increasingly evasive much more so she thought than was reasonable for the situation she frowned over that thought the steadholder was hiding something what why what she wouldnt have given at that moment to be a watercrafter to have been able to sense more about himor to have had more experience in reading peoples expressions and body language she had to know more she had to know if she had a credible witness to bring before the local count or not she had to know if the first lords fears were viable bernard came back a few moments later carrying another bowl under one arm the steadholder lifted his eyebrows his expression surprised then he scowled at her coming over to stand by the table sir she asked did i do something wrong crows girl bernard said i thought youd still be warming your feet up you wanted me to peel these sir yes but he made an irritated noise never mind sit back let me see your feet again and your arm while were at it amara settled back on her stool and the steadholder knelt down on the floor in front of her setting the bowl to one side he lifted her feet grunted something and then reached into the bowl drawing out a small jar of some kind of pungentsmelling ointment youve got some cuts from the hills he said doubt you even felt them as cold as your feet were this should help keep them clean and numb some of the pain when you start getting the feeling back he smoothed on the ointment with broad gentle fingertips on both feet then he drew out a roll of white cloth and a pair of shears he wrapped her feet carefully in the cloth and finally drew from the bowl a pair of slippers with flexible leather soles and a pair of grey woolen socks she began to protest but he shot her a glare and put both socks and slippers on her big feet for a woman he commented had some old slippers that should do for a while she studied him quietly during the process thank you how badly off are they he shrugged they look like theyll be all right to me but im no watercrafter ill ask my sister to take a look at them when shes feeling better amara tilted her head to one side is she ill bernard grunted and stood up move that cloak back and roll up your sleeve let me have a look at that arm amara moved the cloak back from her shoulder she tried to roll the sleeve of her blouse up but the injury was high on her arm and the cloth bunched too much to allow it she tried anyway and the sleeve pinched in on the wound pain flashed through her arm again and she sucked in a shaky breath bernard said thats no good well have to get you another shirt he lifted the shears and carefully started snipping the bloodied sleeve away a little above the first cut in the fabric he frowned at it and then at the scarlet cloth of the bandage the frown only deepened when he unwound the bandage and found the cloth clotted to the wound he shook his head fetched fresh water and cloth and began to soak the bandage and to pull gently at it how did you hurt your arm amara used her other hand to brush at her hair pulling it back from her face i fell yesterday i cut it bernard made a quiet sound and said nothing more until he had soaked the cloth and teased it gently off of the cut without tearing it open he frowned and with the cloth and water and soap cleaned it gently it burned and amara felt her eyes tear up again she thought she would break down crying simply from the exhaustion and the constant relentless pain she closed her eyes tightly while he continued the slow patient work there was a rap at the kitchen door and a nervous voice belonging to the boy hed called frederic said sir theyre asking for you outside ill be there in a moment frederic coughed but sir the steadholder said voice hardening slightly fred in a moment yes sir the boy said the door closed again bernard continued with the wound and murmured this should have had stitches or someone to craft it closed you fell i fell amara repeated apparently you fell along the blade of a sharp sword the steadholder commented he rinsed and dressed the wound once more his hands gentle but even so her arm throbbed and ached horribly more than anything amara wanted to go somewhere dark and quiet and curl into a ball but she shook her head and said sir please is the boys story true were you really attacked by the marat bernard took in a deep breath he walked away and then came back to her and draped a soft gentle weight over her shouldersa blanket youre asking a lot of questions girl not sure i like that and i dont know if youre being honest with me i am sir she looked up at him and tried to smile his mouth crooked up at one corner he glanced at her before turning away to pick up a towel hanging from a peg near the basin ive got a problem with your story no one would send a slave that was hurt as badly as you out to run a message thats insane amara flushed he didnt exactly know that much was true at least i didnt want to miss the opportunity no bernard said girl you dont look much like most slaves ive seen particularly pretty young women in service to a man she felt her face heat still more what do you mean sir he didnt turn toward her the way you hold yourself the way you blushed when i touched your leg he glanced back and said very few people disguise themselves as a slave for fear they wont be able to get back out of it again one has to be either foolish or desperate you think im lying to you i know youre lying the steadholder said without malice it just remains to be seen if youre foolish or desperate maybe you need my help or maybe you just need to be locked in a cellar until the authorities can collect you ive got people to look after i dont know you i cant trust you but if this discussion he said is over now shut your mouth before you pass out she felt him move closer and looked up just as he lifted her up again keeping her unwounded arm against his chest she didnt mean to but she found herself laying her head against his shoulder and closing her eyes she was just too tired and it hurt too much she hadnt slept since had it been two days ago going to be in here fixing dinner bernard was saying so well move you to a cot by the fire in the great hall everyone will be in here tonight because of the storm she heard herself make a small sound of acknowledgment but the ordeal of having her wounds cleaned coupled with her exhaustion left her in no condition to do more she leaned against him and soaked in his warmth his strength drowsing she didnt stir until he began lowering her onto the cot the door to the hall opened somewhere behind him and out of her sight footsteps came toward them but she couldnt see who they belonged to and couldnt work up the energy to care frederics nervous voice said sir theres some travelers asking for shelter from the storm thats right steadholder said fidelias his voice even pleasant using a relaxed rivan accent as though he were a native i hope the three of us wont be an inconvenience chapter isana woke to the sounds of wind groaning over the valley and the hollow clanging of the storm chimes hanging outside she frowned and rubbed at her eyes struggling to orient herself her last memories were of being carried to her bed after tending to bernard she must have slept for hours she didnt feel thirsty which was no surprise rill often tended to such matters on her own initiative but her stomach growled and roiled with an almost painful need for food and her body ached as though shed not moved for days frowning isana pushed aside the purely physical sensations until she reached something deeper more detached and once she had isolated that feeling she focused on it closing her eyes to shut out the miscellaneous emotional noise she always felt around her something was wrong something was very wrong it was a quiet nauseating feeling deep down something that made her think of funerals and sickbeds and the smell of burnt hair it felt familiar and it took her a moment to track back through her memory to realize when she had found such a sensation within her before isanas heart lurched in sudden panic she threw off the covers and rose drawing a robe on over the shift shed slept in her hair hung down past her waist loose and tangled but she left it so she belted the robe and stepped toward her door her balance swayed and she had to lean against the door for a moment closing her eyes until she regained her balance she opened the door to find her brother moving quietly out of his room across the hall bernard she cried and went to him gripping him in a sudden tight embrace he felt warm and solid and strong in her arms oh thank all the furies youre all right she lifted her eyes to his and asked anguish making the words tight is tavi hes all right bernard said a little banged up not terribly happy but hell be fine isana felt sudden tears blur her eyes and she pressed her face against her brothers chest and hugged him again oh oh bernard thank you he hugged her back and said voice gruff nothing i did hed already taken care of himself and was on the way home what happened bernard was silent for a moment and she could feel the discomfort in him im not sure he said finally i remember setting out with him yesterday but beyond that nothing i woke up in bed about an hour before sunrise isana forced the tears back and stepped back from him nodding crafting trauma memory loss like when frederic broke his legs bernard made a growling sound i dont like it if what tavi says is true she tilted her head to one side what does tavi say she listened as bernard recounted tavis story to her and she could only shake her head that boy she closed her eyes i dont know whether to hug him or scream at him but if we were attacked by one of the maratsis this could be very bad wed have to take word of it to gram isana bit her lip i think you should bernard ive got a bad feeling somethings wrong he frowned down at her what do you mean wrong she shook her head and knew that the frustration she felt showed in her voice bad wrong i cant explain it she took a deep breath and told him very quietly ive only felt like this once before bernards face went pale he was silent for a long minute before he said i dont remember any marat sana i cant take word of it to gram his truthfinder would know then tavi will have to do it isana said hes a child you know how gram is hell never take tavi seriously isana turned and paced a few steps back and forth hell have to well make him bernard shook his head no one makes gram do anything he shifted his weight a bit so that more of his body fell between isana and the door to his room this isnt anything to trifle with or to let grams stiff neck isana frowned and leaned to look past her brother without changing expression he moved a bit more to block her view with his body isana let out an impatient breath and shouldered her brother a bit to one side looking past him bernard she said why is there a girl in your bed her brother coughed and flushed isana when you say it that way she turned to blink up at him bernard why is there a girl in your bed he grimaced thats amara the slave tavi helped i was going to lay her down on a cot by the fire but she panicked begged me not to let her sleep down there whispering like she was afraid of something so i told her i wouldnt and she just passed out he glanced back toward his room i brought her up here to your bed isana where else was i supposed to take her just tell me you dont think shes actually a lost slave who tavi happened to rescue no he said i dont her story didnt add up it sounded all right at first but i cleaned out her cuts and didnt give her anything for the pain she got tired fast nearly collapsed shes hurt nothing to kill her so long as she doesnt take fever but yes her feet got cut up on rocks and shes got what looks like a blade wound on her arm says she got them falling down clumsy girl isana said she shook her head sounds like shes someone maybe an agent of one of the lords who knows she seemed decent enough i suppose she could be what she says a quiet and desperate fear curled through her isana felt her hands start to shake and her knees and she just happened to arrive that close to him he sighed and shook his head i didnt like that part either and theres more strangers downstairs three of them theyre asking for shelter until the storm blows over and they just happened to show up today isana swallowed its happening isnt it we knew it might she swore softly furies bernard crows and bloody furies his voice sounded pained isana she held up her hand toward him no bernard no theres too much to do how is tavi he pressed his lips together for a moment but said not good i was hard on him guess i was upset at not knowing what was going on worried we have to find out whats going on we must know whether or not hes in any danger all right what do you want me to do get downstairs to those strangers be polite with them get them some food get their shoes off their shoes isana snapped have someone wash their feet citystyle just do it she closed her eyes thinking ill talk to tavi and this amara make sure they arent hurt worse than you thought shes exhausted he pointed out looks like shes been run into the ground she shouldnt be up to telling much of a lie then isana said ill be downstairs to talk to the strangers in a bit do you know how the storm is shaping up he nodded not as bad as last night but not pretty everyone should be all right if theyre indoors but ive called everyone into the hall just to be safe good isana said the more people there the better dont leave them alone bernard dont let them out of your sight all right i wont he promised what about tavi he should know she shook her head no now more than ever no he doesnt need that on his head bernard looked unhappy with her words but did not gainsay them he turned toward the stairs but hesitated looking into his bedroom at the girl who lay on the bed isana the girl is barely more than a child shes exhausted she had a chance to do wrong and she didnt tavi says she saved his life you should let her rest i dont want anyone to be hurt isana said go on his expression hardened i mean it all right he nodded to her and vanished silently down the stairs again isana went back into her bedroom and took up her bonehandled brush she took it with her gathering her hair over one shoulder and knocked at tavis door there was no response she knocked again and said tavi its me may i come in silence then the doorknob turned and the door opened a fraction she opened the door the rest of the way and walked into the room tavis room was dark with no lights lit of course he couldnt use the furylamps she reminded herself and hed been inside since bernard had come home earlier that day with the windows shuttered and the storm gathering outside the place held a surprisingly deep collection of shadows she could just see him settling back down onto his bed no more than a dim outline across the room she began to brush at her hair giving him a chance to speak he remained silent and after several moments she asked how are you feeling tavi why dont you tell me he said his tone sullen i dont know any watercrafting so how am i supposed to know isana sighed tavi thats not fair you know that i dont have a choice about what i sense from others plenty of things arent fair he shot back youre upset about what your uncle told you i worked all year to get those sheep he promised and this he shook his head his voice tightening with anguish frustration that pressed against isana like the heat from an old fire you made some bad choices tavi but that doesnt mean that choices tavi spat the word bitterly as though i ever had that many to make it isnt like im going to have to worry about that again now she tugged the brush at a tangle in her hair youre just upset so was your uncle this isnt anything to get worked up about tavi im sure that when everyones calmed down the sudden surge of frustration and pain from tavi hit her like a tangible wind the brush tumbled from her fingers and to the floor she caught her breath though the intensity of the boys emotions nearly robbed her of balance tavi are you all right he whispered its nothing to get worked up about i dont understand why these sheep are so important to you no he said you wouldnt i want to be by myself isana pressed her lips together and bent carefully to recover her brush but i need to talk to you about what happened there are some things anger real vibrant rage rushed across the room along with the other sensations pouring from him i am finished talking about what happened tavi said i want to be alone please leave tavi his dim shape rolled over on the bed turning his back to the door isana felt her own emotions begin to drift dangerously toward what the boy felt his feelings beginning to bleed into hers she drew a breath steeling herself against them and said all right but we arent through talking later he didnt answer isana retreated from the room she had hardly shut the door when she heard the latch slide shut on the inside and lock it closed she had to take several steps down the hall before she emerged from the deluge of the boys emotions she couldnt understand it why was tavi so upset over what had happened more to the point what didnt she know about the events of the day before could they have any bearing on the arrival of so many strangers to the valley at once she shook her head and leaned against the wall for a moment tavi had a powerful personality a formidable force of will that leant his passions an extra weight somehow and forced her to struggle more sharply to keep them separate from her own not that it was surprising that she should feel him more keenly than anyone else in any case she loved him too much had been near him too long to say nothing of the other reasons isana shook her head firmly regardless of how drained she felt from last nights crafting there was no time to waste she should have remembered her purpose when speaking to the boy to learn what she could of the previous days events that bernard could not remember she turned toward her brothers room and took a deep breath then she paced inside determined bernard had left the lamp burning on a low flame and the rooms interior was lit by soft golden light bernard lived simply he had ever since cassea and the girls had died he had removed all of her things packing them in a pair of trunks stowed underneath his bed he lived out of a single trunk now as he had in the legions his weapons and gear were stowed on racks on one wall across from the bare writing desk all the records for the steadholt stowed neatly in its drawers the girl slept in bernards bed she was tall with lean features that seemed particularly drawn in the light dark circles like bruises beneath her eyes her skin glowed golden almost the same shade as her hair she was beautiful a braid of leather circled her throat isana frowned at her her brother had gotten down the extra blankets and piled them over the girlthough she had evidently stirred enough that her feet had slipped from beneath them isana stepped forward absently to cover her feet again and saw that they had been bandaged and covered in slippers of soft calfskin isana stared down at the slippers for a moment pale white stitched neatly with delicate beadwork tracing a design over the tops she recognized it at once she had done it herself perhaps ten years before the slippers had been a birthday gift for cassea they had been in the chest beneath the bed for more than a decade isana stepped back from the bed she wanted to speak to the girl but her brother had warned her against disturbing her she had hoped for years that he would find someone else after hed lost cassea and the girls but he never had bernard had continually kept a quiet distance between himself and anyone else and those who lived in the valley those who remembered his wife and daughters had simply given him the solitude he wished if her brother had found it in himself again to reach out to someone elseand from his words to her and the way he had treated the girl it seemed that he hadcould she so readily act against him isana stepped forward and laid her hand across the girls forehead even before she had reached out through rill she felt the mild fever in her she shivered and slowly extended her senses out through the fury and into the sleeping slave bernard had not been mistaken the girl bore several injuries from painful cuts upon her legs to a painfully swollen ankle to a sharp vicious cut along her upper arm her body had been pushed to exhaustion and even in sleep isana could feel that the girl was gripped by a terrible worry and fear she murmured softly to rill and felt the fury course gently through the girl mending closed the smaller cuts and easing the swelling and pain the effort left isanas head light and she drew her hand back and concentrated on remaining on her feet when she looked down again the girl had opened her exhausted eyes and was staring up at her you she whispered youre the watercrafter that healed the steadholder isana nodded and said you should rest i just want to ask you one question the girl swallowed and nodded she let her eyes fall closed have you come for the boy isana asked are you here to take him no the girl said and isana felt the simple truth in her words as clearly as the tone of a silver bell there was a purity to the way she spoke a sense of sincerity that reassured isana let her shoulders unknot if only a little all right isana said she adjusted the blankets over the girl covering her feet once more sleep ill bring you some food in a little while the girl did not reply motionless on the bed and isana withdrew from the room to the top of the stairs she could hear voices below as the holdfolk gathered into the hall outside thunder rumbled low and ominous from the north the events of the night before the kordholders attack on her came rushing back in memory and she shivered then she straightened and walked down the stairs to deal with the other strangers who had come to bernardholt chapter fidelias waited until the big steadholder had padded up the stairs and out of his sight carrying someone wrapped in a blanket the former cursor glanced around the hall for the moment at least he and his companions had been left alone he turned to odiana and aldrick with a frown aldrick stood staring after the steadholder and murmured well i wonder what that was all about fairly obvious fidelias said he glanced at odiana fear she whispered and shivered as she leaned closer to aldrick the most delicious fear recognition amara fidelias nodded shes here that was her aldrick lifted his eyebrows but he never turned around you never saw her face fidelias gave aldrick an even look and suppressed a surge of irritation aldrick please do you expect her to hang a sign on the door that shes here it all fits three sets of tracksthe boys the steadholders and hers she was limping thats why he was carrying her aldrick sighed all right then ill go up and kill those two and we can be about it he turned away and lifted a hand to his sword aldrick fidelias hissed he seized the swordsmans arm at the biceps and reached down into the earth to borrow from his furys strength he stopped the larger man cold aldrick glanced down at fideliass arm and relaxed that was the point wasnt it the swordsman said fidelias we have to stop them from reporting to gram without the element of surprise this entire campaign could be for nothing we came here to find the steadholder and the boy who had seen our friend atsurak and kill them oh and the agent of the crowseaten crown if we happen to run across her which we have love odiana said we still dont know where this boy is do we if you go and kill the ugly little girl right now wont the steadholder object and then youd have to kill him as well and anyone else upstairs and all these people here she licked her lips her eyes bright and said to fidelias why shouldnt we do this again remember where you are fidelias said this is the most dangerous area of the realm powerful furies dangerous beasts this isnt one of the old plantations of the amaranth vale it breeds strong crafters did you see the way that boy handled those gargants out front and he calmed our mounts when they got nervousthat wasnt me and he did it without so much as stopping to make an effort a boy think about it aldrick shrugged they dont go armed theyre steadholders not warriors we could kill them all probably fidelias said but what if that retired legionnaire steadholder is a strong crafter to boot what if some of the other holders here are that strong odds are some of them would escapeand since we dont know who the boy were looking for is wed never know if we got him what about that boy out front odiana asked that lovely strong tall one with the gargants his feet are too big fidelias said the rain all but obliterated the tracks but the ones from earlier today are clearer were looking for a smallish boy not growing a beard yetor possibly a girl atsurak probably wouldnt know the difference at that age if a girl had been wearing breeches the marat dont make the same distinctions we do he had big hands too odiana mused and leaned against aldrick her eyes heavy drowsy may i have him love aldrick leaned down and absently kissed her hair youd only kill him and then hed be no good to you get the idea out of your heads fidelias said his tone firm we have an objective find the boy the storm is rolling in behind us and everyone will be gathering into the hall as soon as we find him well take him the steadholder and the cursor and leave aldrick grunted assent and what if we dont what if hes already gone off to garrison to warn the local count fidelias grimaced and looked around i grew up on a steadholt and youd never keep something like that a secret if thats what has happened well hear about it when everyone gathers in but what if weve borrowed trouble enough fidelias sighed he shook his head and slapped aldricks arm gently releasing him if the boy has already left the storm will be as dangerous to him as anyone well catch him and the result will be the same his eyes glittered but aldrick why dont you take odiana out to make sure the horses are all right ill handle things in here and if theres killing to be done ill let you know who and where aldrick frowned down at him you sure about this in here by yourself what if you need help i wont fidelias assured him go on to the stables make it clear that youre looking for a bit of privacy im sure theyll let a couple of newlywed travelers have it aldrick arched his brows newlywed the water witchs eyes smoldered odiana flashed a smile to fidelias then turned to aldrick with a sway of her hips and took one of his hands in hers she kissed his fingers as she walked backward toward the doors to the hall ill explain it to you love lets go find the stables there will be hay there would you like to see the hay in my hair aldricks eyes narrowed and he let out a low and not unpleased sound ah he started out keeping hold of odianas hands i knew there was a reason i liked working with you old man just be listening fidelias warned quietly the witch nodded and replied keep a cup in your hands and drink in the cup ill hear then she and the swordsman vanished toward the stone stables no sooner had they left than fidelias heard a heavy tread on the stairs leading down into the hall and the steadholder appeared again his face set in something between a frown and a scowl he looked around and said sorry about that just had to take care of someone hurt ah said fidelias studying the man he stepped with the faintest trace of hesitation on his left side as though it pained him slightly to do so if he had been wounded as atsurak had indicated then the wound had been crafted shutwhich meant that a reasonably powerful watercrafter resided in the steadholt as well nothing too bad i hope the man shook his head and said nothing we cant handle he extended a hand to several seats by the fire sit down sit down let me get you a cup of something hot fidelias murmured a thanks and settled down by the fire with the large man steadholder bernard i assume just bernard sir please just del the steadholder halfsmiled del so what brings you out to garrison this late in the year del business fidelias replied i represent a group of investors who fronted several prospectors money to locate gems in the wilderness over the summer they should be coming back in with the weather turning worse and well see what theyve found bernard nodded i thought you had a couple more with you where did your friends go fidelias gave him a warm grin and a wink ah yes my guardsman is a newlywed and i let him bring his wife with him they went out to check on the horses the steadholder gave fidelias a polite smile to be young again eh fidelias agreed my days of creeping off to stables with blushing maids are long past the storms coming in i want to have everyone here in the hall just to be safe fidelias nodded im sure theyll be along in a little while the steadholder nodded see to it that they are ill have no one harmed while under my roof fidelias detected a slight edge to the words one the steadholder himself probably wasnt aware of his instincts twinged a low and subtle alarm lending an edge of tension to him but he nodded and smiled and said of course if youll excuse me then i need to make the rounds and make sure everythings secured before the storm comes down of course again thank you for your hospitality if i can be of any assistance to you let me know bernard grunted and rose his expression preoccupied fidelias watched the man carefully but could read little of him through his body language tense to be sure but wouldnt any steadholder be when facing a threat to his holders he carried his leg stiffly still as he moved out of the hall and into the courtyard and just before he left the big man glanced over his shoulder toward a staircase in the far corner of the hall fidelias watched him and waited until the steadholder had left the hall to glance at the staircase himself interesting a moment later a pretty young girl brought a steaming mug out to fideliass seat by the fire presenting it to him with a slight curtsey sir he smiled at her and accepted the mug thank you young lady but please call me del she smiled at him a winsome expression my name is beritte sirdel a lovely name for a lovely girl he sipped at the drink a tea he vaguely recognized mmmm wonderful i suppose youve had an interesting few days here with the storm and all thats happened she nodded folding her hands in front of her and inhaling just enough to let her bodice round out her young breasts between all the excitement yesterday and then last night its been one thing after another though i suppose it isnt anything compared to the life of a gem merchant sir his eyebrows lifted and he said letting a small smile touch his mouth i dont remember mentioning that to you beritte i thought i was alone with the steadholder her cheeks colored bright scarlet oh sirim sorry ive a little windcrafting you see and and you listened in he suggested we so seldom have visitors to bernardholt sir the girl said she looked up her eyes direct im ever so interested in new exciting people who are wealthy gem merchants fidelias thought wryly completely understandable though honestly from the things ive heard he leaned closer to her looking left and right was the steadholder really hurt yesterday the girl knelt down beside the chair leaning toward him just enough to let him see the curve of her bosom should he look down yes and it was terrible he was so pale that when fadefades our idiot sir the poor man first dragged him in here i thought the steadholder was dead and then kord and his sons went mad and the steadholders all set to fighting one another with their furies her eyes gleamed ive never seen anything like it perhaps later after dinner youd like to hear more about it fidelias nodded meeting her eyes that sounds very exciting beritte and the boy was he hurt as well the girl blinked at him for a moment expression confused and then asked blankly tavi sir is that who you mean id only heard there was a boy hurt as well oh i suppose you mean tavi then but hes no one and even though hes the steadholders nephew we dont really like to talk about him very much sir he and simple fade the boys an idiot as well oh hes clever enough i supposejust as fade is handy enough with a smiths hammer but hes never going to be much more than fade is she leaned closer to him so that her breasts pressed against his arm and whispered importantly hes furyless sir entirely fidelias tilted his head holding his cup where he could be sure his voice would strike the drink within it squarely ive never heard of such a thing do you think i could meet him beritte shrugged if you really want to he went up to his room when the steadholder brought him and that slave home i suppose hell be down for dinner fidelias nodded toward the stairs the steadholder had glanced at upstairs there do you know if the slave is up there as well beritte frowned at him i suppose theyll be down for dinner i expect im cooking tonight and im a very good cook sir id love to hear what you think of a new voice interrupted the girl confident and smooth beritte that will be quite enough from you youve chores in the kitchen attend to them the girl flushed an angry and embarrassed pink rose to give fidelias a swift curtsey and then fled the hall back toward the kitchens fidelias lifted his eyes to see a tall girlish figure wearing a dressing gown long dark hair spilled over her shoulders down to her waist her face was youthful with a pleasingly full mouth she carried herself with quiet confidence and he noted the threads of silver in her hair this would be the watercrafter then at once fidelias drew in his emotions carefully controlling them veiling them from her perceptions even as he rose to bow to her lady steadholder she regarded him with a cool expression her own features every bit as masked as he knew his own were i am the steadholders sister isana welcome to bernardholt sir a pleasure i hope i did not steal away the girl for too long as do i isana said she has a tendency to talk when she should listen there are many like her across the realm he murmured may i inquire as to your business in bernardholt sir the question was innocuous enough but fidelias sensed the trap in it he kept tight rein on his feelings and said blithely we seek shelter from the coming storm lady and are passing through on our way to garrison i see she glanced after the girl and said i hope you have no plans to make away with any of our young people sir fidelias let out a low laugh naturally not lady her eyes moved back to his and remained there steady for several long beats he regarded her in reply with a blank pleasant smile but where are my manners the woman said a moment sir she crossed to the fire and took from a shelf near it a pan some clean cloths she filled the pan from the pipe that passed through the rear of the fireplace the water steaming and moved back to him she knelt in front of him setting the pan aside and began unlacing his boots fidelias frowned though the gesture would have been common enough in a city it was rarely observed in the steadholts particularly those this far from civilization really lady this isnt necessary she looked up at him and he thought he caught a glimmer of triumph in her eyes oh but it is i insist sir it is to our very great honor that we treat our guests with courtesy and hospitality youre already doing enough he said she tugged his boot off and tossed it to one side the other soon joined it nonsense my brother would be horrified if i did not treat you with all the honor you deserve fidelias settled back with his tea frowning but unable to voice any particular protest against the ritual as she washed his feet people began to trickle into the hall by threes and fours and fives families mostly he noted the steadholt was a prosperous one though the seats around the fire were given a respectful space the rest of the large hall was soon filled with motion and sound and quietly festive talkthe mark of a folk who knew that they were safe while outside the thunder rolled the wind was rising and the storm chimes were clanging away in steady rhythm isana finished and said ill just have these brushed clean sir and send them right back to you she rose taking his boots in hand im afraid we can offer only clean blankets and a place beside the fire this night well have our dinner together and then turn in for the night fidelias glanced at the stairs and then back to the watercrafter simple enough then once everyone was sleeping even the suspicious watercrafter it would be an easy enough matter to slit three throats in the darkness and slip away before morning light everyone together at dinner he smiled at her and said that sounds per the doors to the hall abruptly slammed open and aldrick stormed in letting in the howling wind rain and sleet pounded down around his broad shoulders and across the threshold with him odiana clung to his side both looked disheveled straw littering their hair and clothing aldrick cut through the crowded hall and came straight to fidelias the holders scattering out of his way like sheep before a running horse fidelias aldrick breathed keeping his voice low someone has let our horses out they know fidelias let out a curse and looked toward the watercrafteronly to see her holding her skirts with one hand while she dashed up the far staircase his boots in her other bloody crows he breathed rising feet cold upon the floor ill get the horses and the steadholder the boy and amara are up those stairs he turned to aldrick feeling for the knife hidden in his tunic and said kill them chapter tavi eventually came to the conclusion that he was sulking it wasnt easily reached of course it took nearly ten minutes of staring at the wall in smoldering anger after his aunts departure before it occurred to tavi that she did not look at all well that in turn led to worrying about her and after that it became impossible to sustain a good sullen rage the anger slowly faded and left him feeling tired sore and hungry tavi sat up on his bed and swung his legs over the side he kicked his feet frowning while he thought about the events of the past day and what they meant to him he had neglected his responsibilities and told a lie and now he suffered for itand so did the people who cared about him his uncle had been wounded badly in his defense and now aunt isana looked as though the efforts of healing his uncles leg had damaged her health such things were not unheard of and even though bernard tried to hide it his uncle walked with a very slight limp it was just possible that he would keep it that the injury had done permanent damage to his leg tavi rested his chin in his hands and closed his eyes feeling foolish selfish childish he had been so focused on getting the sheephis sheep back on keeping his uncles respect that he had forgotten to behave in a manner that was worthy of it he had exposed himself and others to great risk all for the sake of his dreamthe academy if he had gotten to the academy as a result of his illconsidered choices would it have been worth it could he really have made a better life for himself knowing what he had traded away to get it you are an idiot tavi he mumbled to himself a true shining example of idiocy matters could be much worse for himmuch worse for his family as well he shuddered at the thought of his uncle dead on the ground or his aunt laying beside a healing tub with her eyes empty her body still breathing but already dead though things had not played out the way he had wished them to they could have been more disastrous though he ached in every muscle and his head felt light and feverish he went to the door he would find his aunt and uncle apologize to them and offer to make amends he had no idea what he would do but he knew that he had to at least try they deserved that much he had to earn the respect he wanted not through daring or cleverness but simply through hard work and reliability just as his uncle and aunt had tavi was about to open the door when there came a swift soft rapping at his window he blinked looking back across the dimness of his room outside the wind was rising and he had already put up the storm shutters perhaps one of the more mischievous wind furies had rattled the shutters the knock came again three quick knocks two slow three quick two slow tavi went to the window and unfastened the latch to the storm shutters they sprang open all but knocking him down and let in a torrent of cold misty wind tavi drew back several steps as someone slipped into the room lithe and nearly silent amara made a soft quiet sound and slipped entirely into the room then turned and shut the window and the shutters behind her she was wearing what looked like a pair of his uncles trousers belted about her slender waist with a heavy leather cord his tunic and shirt billowed on her as did the heavily padded jacket and cloak but she had secured them with more strips of leather so that she was quite evidently functional in them she wore pale slippers on her feet and what looked like several layers of socks over them in one hand she held a bundle that included an old leather pack of bernards his hunting bow a handful of arrows and the sword theyd recovered from the princeps memorium tavi she said get dressed in warm clothes bring extra socks some blankets food if you have any up here were leaving leaving tavi stammered keep your voice down the slave hissed tavi blinked and mumbled sorry dont apologize hurry we dont have much time we cant leave tavi protested the storms coming in it wont be as bad as the last one amara said and we can take more salt with us you have a smokehouse here yes salt for the meat of course but amara crossed to his trunks swung the first open and started digging hey tavi protested she threw a pair of heavy trousers into his face followed by three of his thickest shirts she followed that with his jacket from its peg on the wall and then his secondbest cloak get those on amara said no tavi said firmly im not leaving i just got back people got hurt trying to come and find me im not going to make them go through that again you cant expect me to put the people of my own steadholt in danger so that i can go running off with a fugitive slave amara went to the door and checked the latch making sure it was shut tavi we dont have time if you want to live come with me right now tavi blinked at her so startled that he dropped the clothes he had been holding whwhat if you dont leave with me right now you arent going to live through the night what are you talking about get dressed she said no he snapped not until i know whats happening her eyes narrowed and for the first time hed been near her tavi felt a sliver of fear quiver through him tavi if you dont get dressed and come with me i will knock you out wrap you in a blanket and take you with me tavi licked his lips nno you wont he said you couldnt carry me down through the hall and you wont be able to carry me out the window eitheror on the ground not with your ankle hurt amara blinked at him and then ground her teeth too clever she muttered this steadholt maybe every one in the valley is in danger i think you and i can help them tavi get dressed please ill explain while you do tavi swallowed staring at the young woman the steadholt in danger what was she talking about the last thing he needed was to go chasing off again to prove to everyone who mattered that he couldnt be trusted but amara had saved his life and if she was telling the truth all right talk he stooped down to recover his clothes and started shrugging into the shirts amara nodded and came closer holding the clothes for him helping him into them first of all im not a slave im a cursor and ive been sent to this valley at the command of the first lord himself tavi blinked up at her and then stuffed his arms into the sleeves to deliver mail amara sighed no thats just one of the things we do tavi i am the agent of the first lord he thinks this valley may be in danger and he sent me to do something about it but youre a girl she frowned at him and jerked the next shirt down over his ears roughly im a cursor and i think the first lord is right but what does this have to do with me with bernardholt youve seen the danger tavi i need to take you to garrison you have to tell the count there what you saw a cold feeling chilled tavi and he blinked up at her the marat he breathed the marat are coming arent they like when they killed the princeps i think so amara said my uncle saw them hes the one that should go the count would never believe that he cant amara said crafting trauma when he was healed he doesnt remember any of it how do you know that tavi demanded because i listened i faked passing out and i listened in on all the talk up here your uncle doesnt remember and your aunt is suspicious of me theres no time to explain it to themwe have to leave here and right now tavi tugged the heavy tunic on over the shirts his hands moving more slowly now why because downstairs are some men who are here to kill you me and anyone who has seen the marat but why would another aleran do that we really dont have time for that theyre the enemy they want to unseat the first lord and they want the marat to wipe out the steadholts in the valley so that the realm perceives the first lord as weak and ineffective tavi stared at her wipe out the valley but that would mean she regarded him her face drawn unless we take warning to the count unless the forces at garrison are ready to meet them the marat will kill everyone this steadholt and all the rest as well crows tavi whispered oh crows and furies youre the only one who has seen them the only one who i can use to convince the count to rouse garrison amara stalked back over to the window opened it again then turned to tavi and extended her hand are you with me they used a sheet from tavis bed tied to its leg to drop from his window to the courtyard below the wind whistled from the north bringing with it the stinging chill of true winter amara went down first then beckoned to tavi who tossed down a bundle thrown hurriedly together into the blankets from his bed amara caught it and then the boy swallowed and slithered down the sheet to the stones of the courtyard amara led them across the courtyard in silence no one was in evidence though the light and noise from the hall could be heard through its thick doors the gate door was open and they slid through it and out into the outbuildings full dark was getting close and shadows lay dim and thick over the cold ground tavi led them past the stables and over to the smokehouse the building shared a wall with the smithy where both could use the same chimney for a fire the sharp smell of smoke and meat hung around the smokehouse in a permanent cloud get the salt amara murmured to him just take the sack if theres one at hand or a bucket ill keep watch here and hurry tavi slipped inside where the fading twilight held little sway and fumbled through the dark to the shelf at the back of the smoke room he stopped to take down a pair of hams that had been hanging and dropped them into his makeshift bag the salt all rough crystals filled a large homespun sack tavi tried to lift it and grunted with effort then he put it back down took one of his blankets and tore off a couple of large sections he piled heavy salt crystals into them and twisted them shut tying them with several lengths of leather cord kept on hand for hanging the meats he had just picked them up and was heading back for the door when he heard a squealing sound outside the smokehouse there was a hiss of breath and a pair of heavy thumps tavi hurried outside his eyes wide his heart pounding in his chest there amara knelt with one knee on the chest of a fallen man a knife gripped in her hand and pressed to his throat stop tavi hissed get off of him he snuck up on me amara said she didnt move the knife thats fade hes no danger to anyone he wouldnt answer me you scared him tavi said and shoved at her shoulder amara shot him a look but didnt fall she took the knife from fades throat and rose back and away from the fallen slave tavi leaned down and took fades hand hauling the man to his feet he wore heavy clothes against the gathering cold including a woolen cap with flaps that hung down to his shoulders and dangled like the ears of a gangly puppy and secondhand gloves missing several fingers the whole side of the slaves face was slack with fear and he stared at amara with wide eyes backing up from her until his shoulders touched tavis chest tavi fade said tavi inside storm coming i know fade tavi said but we have to go theres no time for this amara said shooting a glance behind her if one of them sees us tavi stay fade insisted i cant me and amara have to get to count gram and warn him that the marat are coming shes a cursor and we have to go before some bad men try to stop us fade turned to blink his head slowly at tavi his face twisted in confusion and he asked tavi going tonight yes i have salt amara hissed lets go then no time fade frowned almost scowled fade too no fade tavi said you have to stay here going we have to travel light amara said the slave stays fade threw back his head and let out a howl like a wounded dog tavi choked and lurched toward the man covering his mouth with one hand quiet fade theyll hear us fade ceased howling but looked at tavi his expression steady tavi looked from fade to amara the cursor rolled her eyes and gestured at him to hurry tavi grimaced all right you can go but we have to leave right now fades mouth broke into a witless smile behind tavis hand and he started chortling he held up a hand to them dashed inside the smithy and emerged a few heartbeats later bearing a battered old rucksack on his back and muttering excited nonsense phrases to himself amara shook her head and asked tavi hes an idiot hes a good man tavi said defensively hes strong and he works hard he wont get in the way hed better not amara said she slipped the knife away into her belt and threw her bundle at fade im hurt hes not he carries mine fade dropped it and scraped a bow to amara as he picked up the bundle of blankets and appropriated gear he lifted that one to his other shoulder amara turned to lead them away from bernardholt but tavi put his hand on her shoulder these men wont they catch us if were on foot im not good with horses youre no earthcrafter is the slave tavi glanced at fade and grimaced no i mean he knows a little metal and he makes shoes for the horses but i dont think that hes an earthcrafter better we walk then she said one of the men after us is and he can make the horses do what he wants to on horseback theyll be faster thats why wed better get going hopefully theyll be here until morning meet me at the stable tavi said and hurried off toward it in the growing dark amara hissed at him but tavi ignored her moving to the stable doors and inside he was familiar with the animals of bernardholt the sheep milled sleepily in their pen and the cattle took up the rest of the room on the same side on the other the hulking gargants lay blowing lustily in their sleep in their burrowand behind them tavi heard the noise of restless nervous horses he slipped silently down through the stable before he heard a sound in the loft above him the storage space between the rafters and the peak of the roof he froze in place listening a tinny voice said from the loft between all the excitement yesterday and then last night its been one thing after another though i suppose it isnt anything compared to the life of a gem merchant sir tavi blinked the voice was berittes but it came as though through a long pipe distant and blurred it took him a moment to realize that it sounded the same as when his aunt spoke to him through rill a womans voice strange to tavi and near to hand murmured with a sort of languid laziness there you see love he has a drink now and were able to pay attention sometimes its nice to hurry a strange mans voice answered with a low growl all this hurrying when we kill them and finish the mission im going to lock you in a room in irons for a week the woman purred youre so romantic my love quiet i want to hear what hes saying they fell into silence while tinny voices came down to tavi on the floor he swallowed and moved very quietly forward past the spot in the loft the voices came from and down to the stalls where the strangers horses had been put though their gear had been removed the horses still wore their bridles and the saddles had been stood on end on the floor beside them ready to be thrown on and cinched rather than resting on the pegs on the other side of the stables and their blankets drying on the ground tavi crept into the first stall and let the horse smell him keeping a hand on the animals shoulder as he moved to its saddle and knelt beside it he drew the knife from his belt and quietly as he could started cutting through the leather of the saddles girth though the leather was thick his knife was sharp and he cut through it completely in only a moment tavi repeated the gesture twice more leaving the stall doors open and cutting the other two saddles to uselessness then he went back gathering up the horses reins keeping his motions as slow as possible and led them out of their stalls and back down the stables toward the doors out as he passed the spot in the loft where the strangers lay tavis throat tightened and his heart hammered in his chest people people he had never seen and did not know were there to kill him for reasons he could not fully understand it was all too strange almost unrealand yet the fear in him something instinctive and all too certain was very real indeed like a trickle of cold water gliding slowly down his spine he had led the horses past the loft when one of the beasts snorted and tossed its head tavi froze in place panic nearly sending him running fear hissed the womans voice suddenly below us the horses tavi jerked on the reins and let out a loud whistle the horses snorted breaking into an uncertain trot tavi let go of the reins to dash ahead to the stable doors and throw them open as the horses went through tavi let out a scream that warbled into a highpitched shriek and the horses burst out into a run there was a roar from behind him and tavi glanced over his shoulder in time to see a man even bigger than his uncle come crashing down from the loft a naked sword held in his fist he looked around him wildly and tavi turned and fled into the darkness someone seized his arm and he almost screamed amara clapped cold fingers over his mouth and dragged him into a run north and east toward the causeway tavi glanced around behind him and saw fade shuffling along under the weight of his burdens but no one else seemed to be following them good amara hissed he saw the flash of her teeth in the growing dark well done tavi tavi shot her a grin and one to fade as well and that was when the scream came to them from behind the walls of the steadholt proper clear and desperate and terrified tavi isana screamed tavi run run chapter tavi ran his muscles were sore and the myriad scratches felt horrible sending curling ribbons of pain through his skin but he was able to run for a while amara ran beside him in silence hardly limping at allbut after a quarter mile her motion became uneven and on her exhales she started letting out whimpers of sound tavi dropped his pace a bit to run beside her no she gasped you have to keep going even if i dont get to the count you have to but your leg im not important tavi amara said run we need to head east tavi said staying beside her well have to find a place to cross the rillwater but theres thick and twisty woods on the other side in the dark we could lose them there one of the men behind us she panted woodcrafter strong one not there tavi said the only one who has ever gotten along with those furies is my uncle and it took him years he showed me how to get through them amara slowed and nodded as they neared the top of a hill all right you come here she beckoned to fade who shuffled to her obediently she took the bundle from him and took out his uncles bow and the arrows with it she braced the bow against her leg and leaned hard on it bending it enough to string it then took it in hand and picked up the arrows i want you two to get into the woods keep going through them tavi swallowed what are you going to do amara took the sword from the bundle and slipped it through her makeshift belt im going to try to slow them here ill be able to see them coming here as well as anywhere but youre standing out here in the open theyll just shoot you she smiled grimly i think there will be a bad wind for it leave me some of the salt once that storm hits we should be free to start evading them a little more securely well stay here and help tavi said the cursor shook her head no you two get moving just in case things dont go well ill find you by morning but tavi amara said she turned to him frowning gently i cant protect you and still fight here these men are powerful crafters you cant do anything to help me the words hit him like a physical blow and he felt a surge of frustration helpless anger that raced through him and for a moment washed away the aches of his body i cant do anything wrong amara said theyll be using earth and woodcrafting to track younot me ill be able to ambush them and if i get lucky i might stop them altogether get moving and keep their attention on you wont their earthcrafter feel you tavi asked and if theyre using wood too you cant climb a tree to get off the ground amara glanced to the north when that storm gets here the furies in it she shook her head but i can take advantage of things now cirrus she closed her eyes for a moment and the wind began to rise around her it made the loose clothing on her billow and flap though tavi standing only a few feet away felt nothing amara spread her arms slightly and the wind gusted her completely off the ground for a momentand then settled into a whirlwind that threw up dust and debris and specks of ice in a cloud around her legs to the knee she hovered there momentarily then opened her eyes and drifted left and right experimentally tavi stared at her stunned he had never seen such a display of windcrafting you can fly amara smiled at him and even in the dimness her face seemed bright this this is nothing maybe after all this is over i can show you what real flying is she nodded those storm furies you have here are bad ones and theres not much time before they get here but this will keep fidelthe enemy from sensing me all right tavi said uncertainly youll be sure to find us amaras smile faded ill try but if i havent in a few hours then keep going yourself can you get to garrison sure tavi said i mean i think i will and uncle will be coming he can find us anywhere in the valley i hope youre right amara said he seems a good man she turned her back on tavi and fade frowning facing back the way that they had come she set an arrow to the bow get to garrison warn the count tavi nodded then dug into his bag and got out one of the bags of salt he threw it down not far from amara but not too close to the fury holding her in the air either she glanced back and down at the salt and then at tavi thank you good luck fade tugged at tavis sleeve tavi he said go yeah come on tavi turned and started down the hill picking up to a jog again fade kept pace with him the slave seemingly tireless and uncomplaining they left amara behind on the hilltop and the darkness of settling evening swallowed her from sight tavi took his bearings from the slope of the hill a pair of boulders he and frederic had once teased and before another quarter hour had passed they had found the edges of the wood and slipped into shadows of the pines and aspen and beneath the long fingers of the barren oak tavi slowed his pace to a walk then breathing in swift pants he held a hand to his side where a slow throbbing pain was starting to rise i havent ever done this much running all together he told fade getting cramps legions run march train fade said the slave looked behind them and the shadows fell over the cowards brand on his marred face his eyes glittered tavi in the legions run lots tavi had never heard so many words from the slave all together and he tilted his head to one side fade were you in the legions fades expression barely moved but tavi thought he detected a sense of deep slow pain there nonetheless fade coward ran ran from what fade turned away from tavi and started walking deeper into the woods making his way east tavi looked after him for a moment and then followed him they made good time for a while though tavi tried to get fade to talk with several other small questions he did not respond to them as they moved the wind continued to rise and it made the woods whisper and creak and groan tavi saw movement around him in the branches and the hollows of the treesthe furies of the wood restless as the animals before the coming storm skittering back and forth and watching silently from the shadows they did not frighten tavihe was as used to them as to the animals of the steadholt but his hand stayed close to the knife at his belt just in case soon the sound of running water came to them through the trees and tavi hurried forward taking the lead from fade they came out on the banks of the rillwater a small and swift river that rushed through the calderon valley from just east of garados and raced off into the mountains south of the valley all right tavi said we need to find the ford uncle marked so long as we start from there i can find our way through the woods and out the other side otherwise the furies there will twist us around and well get lost uncle said that when he was young a couple of people got lost in the twisty woods and never came out again he found them starved to death less than a bowshot from the causeway but theyd never found it fade nodded watching tavi i can get us through but we have to start with the path uncle made he chewed on his lip looking up and down the river and with this storm coming too here he dug into his makeshift pack and passed the second sack of salt back to fade hold on to that in case we need it dont drop it dont drop it fade repeated nodded solemnly tavi turned and started upstream this way i think they made their way along the stream and night settled over them entirely tavi could barely see to walk and fade stumbled and muttered behind him here tavi said finally heres where we cross see that white rock uncle had brutus set it there so it would be easier to find tavi slipped down the bare chill earth of the bank to the stream fade let out a yelp fade tavi turned around in time to see someone moving toward him in the dark something hit his face hard and he felt his legs go loose and relax he fell back into the swift shallow chilling flow of the rillwater blinking and trying to focus his eyes he tasted blood in his mouth bittan of kordholt leaned down enough to drag him up by the front of his shirt and hit him again another hot flash of pain tavi yelped and tried to throw up his arms to protect himself but the larger boys fists landed with a cool sadistic precision again and again enough kords voice rumbled get out of the damn water bittan unless you want to get drowned again tavi looked up blearily he could see kord hulking on the bank his lank and greasy hair swinging as he turned his head to look at the stream a form lay on the ground before him motionless fade bittan hauled tavi out of the water and threw him at the bank an ugly smile twisting his handsome face climb out yourself freak tavi climbed out of the water shivering even as the wind began to shriek and howl overhead the storm he thought numbly the storm was on them tavi moved to fade and found the slave still breathing though he didnt move he could see blood gleaming on fades scarred face bittan followed tavi up from the stream and kicked him knocking him forward and back to the ground looks like you were right pa kord grunted figured theyd send word to gram about that little fracas the other night didnt figure theyd send the freak and the idiot though arics voice came to them quietly tavi looked up to see the tall slender man a dark shadow a bit separated from the other two the boys smart pa he can write you have to write to file legal charges doesnt add up kord said maybe they would send him in good weather but not with this storm coming unless bernards dead pa bittan said spiteful maybe that bitch died trying to save him he looked like a dead man kord turned to tavi and nudged the boy with his boot well freak tavi thought furiously there had to be a way to stall for enough time for amara to catch up to them or for his uncle to find thembut what were they talking about a fracas the other night had something happened when his uncle came home wounded that had to have been it had they tried to kill bernard is that why they would be concerned with someone filing legal charges with count gram kord nudged him again and said talk boy or ill bury you right now tavi swallowed if i tell you will you let us go us kord asked warily aric said he means the idiot pa kord grunted depends on what you say freak and if i believe you tavi nodded and said without looking up a marat warrior injured uncle he got hurt protecting me and i got away one of the first lords cursors came to bernardholt and now im trying to get to count gram to warn him that the marat are coming and that he has to rouse the garrison and prepare to fight there was a moments stunned silence and then kord guffawed a quiet hoarse sound tavi felt a hand grip his hair and kord said even a freak should be smarter than to think something like that would fool me bbut tavi stammered his heart hammering with a sudden panicked terror its the truth i swear to all the furies its the truth kord dragged him down the bank and said im tired of your lying mouth freak then he shoved tavis head into the freezing water and bore down with all of his strength chapter amara tried to still the frantic pounding of her heart and to slow her breathing cirrus swirled and spun beneath her feet though to her the air beneath her felt almost as solid as the ground itself even so the wind furys best efforts moved her ever so slightly from side to side up and down and would make shooting impossible if she wasnt calm and focused the pain of her injured ankle and arm though lessened by isanas ministrations was by no means absent she tested the pull of the bow and felt it in her arm her left in which she held the heavy wooden weapon she would not be able to hold it drawn for longnot surprising since it was probably made with the thews of the enormous steadholder in mind shaking and unable to aim for long she would have to wait until the enemy was close before she shotand she would have to take down the swordsman first she would never defeat him with the blade she carried his experience and furycrafting would make him a living weapon unstoppable to someone not equally gifted if she had time fidelias would be her next target cirrus could defeat even her old teachers formidable woodcraftingenhanced archery his earthcrafting however would give him strength she could not hope to match it would be all he needed to shatter her defense and defeat her in an absence of other factors even with cirrus lending speed to her strikes she was only marginally his equal with a blade the sword was for the water witch though it would suit amara equally well to shoot the woman though she was not in open battle the threat the other two were she was dangerous nonetheless even though amara would have the freedom of concentration to smother the woman she could not likely accomplish it before if the witch could cross the distance between themand if she managed to touch her amara was done for of the three she was the only one amara could reliably overcome with the blade poor options she thought a poor plan she was unlikely to be able to shoot a second arrow even presuming the first arrow managed to strike down aldrick ex gladius a man who had faced some of the most skilled warriors aliveararis himselfand defeated them or at least lived to tell the tale but if they were allowed to catch up to the boy even if they came close he was certain to be killedand the boy was the only one whose testimony could convince the count at garrison to mobilize and raise the alarm amara stood facing the darkness behind the already departed boy and the slave with him and realized that it was very probable that she was about to die painfully her heart raced with a frantic terror she bent down to pick up a pair of arrows from the ground she slipped one through her belt and set one to the bow she checked the hilt of the sword with one hand reasonably sure that she could draw it forth without slicing her own leg off or cutting the belt that kept the clothes shed stolen from flapping like a banner she looked to the north and could feel the storm furies out there up by the ominous form of a mountain whose tip held the last purple light of sunset upon it like some balefully glowering eye the clouds moved down swallowing the mountains head as they did and amara could feel the freezing fury of the coming storm a true winter howler once it arrived presuming it didnt kill the boy it would make pursuit of him impossible she didnt have to win she only had to slow down those behind them so long as she provided a delay death was an acceptable outcome her hands shook then she waited she couldnt feel the earthcrafting move past beneath her but she saw ita barely perceptible wave in the earth a ripple of motion that flowed through the ground briefly unsettling it as a wave does water the wave flashed by and moved on behind her her feet hadnt come within a handsbreadth of the ground as it went past it couldnt have detected her she took a slow breath and blew on the fingers of the hand that would hold the string the arrow then she lifted the bow ignoring the twinge in her arm and willed herself forward and a bit down the slope ahead of her so that she would present no profile against the purpling sky or the stormlighted clouds she saw motion against the dark earth and remained as still as she could willing cirrus to hold her steady another pulse went by in the earth this one stronger nearer fidelias had crafted such a search before and she knew how effectively he could use it to find someone not wise enough to get his feet off of the ground the shape came closer though she could not tell who it was or how many there might be she drew the bow as tight as she comfortably could held with the strung arrow pointing at the ground the motion came closer and she could hear footsteps make out the shape of a large man the glint of metal in the darkness the swordsman she took a breath held it then drew aimed and loosed all in a single motion the bow thrummed and the arrow hissed through the darkness the shape froze one hand lifting toward her even as the arrow leapt across the yards between them she heard the wooden shaft shatter an abrupt crack of sound she reached for the other arrow at her belt but the man in the darkness hissed in a quiet voice and something caught her wrist in a sudden crushing grip amara looked down to find the arrows shaft wrapped around her wrist and just winding about the belt so that her hand was fastened to her middle she spun gathering momentum to throw the bow at her assailant thus freeing her left hand to make an awkward draw of the sword but even as she turned the bow in her hands abruptly warped and slithered around her arm more swift and lithe than a serpent it wasnt long enough to wrap about her torso as well but once about her arm it hardened straightening her limb until her hand was held well out and away from the sword at her waist amara turned her head to see the man rushing her and she flung herself straight up over his head cirrus assisting her she flipped in midair and managed to bring her heel down onto her attacker she missed her target the nape of his neck and her scything kick landed on his shoulder instead cirrus stopped her feet from touching the earth but even as she regained her balance a hand brutally strong wrapped around her ankle swung her in an arc overhead and brought her crashing down onto the frigid ground amara struggled but the impact had stunned and slowed her before she could escape the man had pinned her full weight of his body on hers one hand had closed around her throat and twisted her head aside to near the breaking point as easily as though she had been a weak kitten where is he bernard snarled if youve hurt that boy ill kill you amara stopped her struggling and willed cirrus away so that she lay quietly beneath the enraged steadholder she could see the darkhaired giant out of the corner of her eye dressed only lightly against the weather bearing a woodsmans axe which had been let fall before he seized her she had to struggle to breathe to speak no i didnt hurt him i stayed back to stop the men after him he and the slave went on ahead the granite grip on her head eased marginally men after him what men the strangers the ones who came in when you carried me into the hall theyll be after us im sure of it please sir theres no time the steadholder growled he kept her pinned with one hand and with the other drew the sword from her belt and tossed it aside then he patted at her waist until he found the knife shed stolen from fidelias inside her tunic and roughly tugged aside her layers of clothing to remove it as well only then did he let his grip on her jaw and throat ease i dont know who you are girl he said but until i do youre going to stay right here even as he spoke the earth curled up around her elbows and knees turf and roots twisting into place locking her limbs to the ground no amara protested steadholder my name is amara im one of the crowns cursors the first lord himself sent me here to this valley bernard stood up away from her and rummaged in a pouch at his side he took something from it then something else now youre not a slave eh no my nephews out in this mess somewhere and its your fault he is its because i led him from the steadholt that he isnt dead already so you say bernard said she heard water gurgle from a flask into a cup or a bowl where is he now amara tested the bonds of earth uselessly i told you he and fade went on ahead of me he said something about a river and a twisty wood fade went with him and these men chasing him who are they a traitor cursor aldrick ex gladius and a water witch of considerable skill theyre trying to kill anyone who saw the marat moving in the valley i think because they want a marat surprise attack to succeed crows bernard spat then he said raising his voice a bit isana did you hear a voice tinny and faint echoed up from somewhere near at hand yes tavi and fade will be at the rillwater ford we must get there immediately ill meet you bernard rumbled what about the girl isanas voice came a moment later as though she spoke under a great strain she means no harm to tavi im sure of that beyond that i dont know hurry bernard i will bernard said then he stepped back into her vision and drank away whatever was in the cup this man after you with the swordsman why did you expect him instead of me amara swallowed hes an earth and woodcrafter very experienced he can find the boy she lifted her head looking at him intently let me up im the only chance you have to help tavi he scowled why do you say that because you dont know these people amara said i do i can anticipate him what hes going to do next i know his strengths his weaknesses and you cant defeat his swordsman alone bernard stared down at her for the space of a breath then shook his head irritably all right he said prove it anticipate him tell me where he is amara closed her eyes trying to remember the geography of the region he knew i would expect him to follow directly thats his strength but he didnt follow he anticipated me and hes moving around to get ahead of the boy check the causeway the furies in the cobblestones hell have made for the road and be using those furies to help him get ahead of the boy so that he can cut him off she opened her eyes and watched the steadholders face bernard growled something quietly and she felt a slow silent shudder in the earth there was silence for a moment while the big man knelt and put a bare hand on the ground closing his eyes with his head tilted to one side as though listening to a distant music finally he let out a breath youre right he said or seem to be someones earthwaving through the road itself and fast horses i think its him amara said let me up bernard opened his eyes and rose decisively he recovered his axe gestured at the earth and amara abruptly found her limbs free the bow and the arrow returning to their original shapes unwinding from her arm she clambered to her feet again and recovered the sword and knife from the ground are you going to help me he asked amara faced him and let out a shaking breath sir i swear it to you ill help you protect your nephew bernards teeth flashed sudden in the darkness good thing youre not going after these people with wood from their own trees she slipped the sword through her belt i hope your shoulder doesnt hurt too much his smile widened ill make it hows your ankle slowing me she confessed then get your fury to lift you again he said he drew a piece of cord from his pouch ran it through the back of his belt and tied it closed in a loop he tossed the loop to her and said keep your body behind mine and stay low the wood will make my passage clear but dont go waving your head around or a branch might take it off amara barely had time to breathe her agreement before the ground itself rumbled and the steadholder took off at a bounding run the earth impelling him forward with every step she turned and ran to keep up with him but even in her best condition she would have been hard pressed to hold the pace she managed to take several steps to keep close to him one hand clinging to the loop of leather cord then leapt in the air calling to cirrus as she did the presence of her fury solidified beneath her feet and she flowed over the ground after the steadholder tugged forward by the cord if he noticed her weight dragging at him it did not show and the man moved through the night with perfect confidence and nearperfect silence as though even the withered grass beneath his feet conspired to cushion the impact and lessen the noise of his passing before she had gotten her breath back they had passed into the woods and amara had to duck her head to keep branches from slashing at her face she hunched down in the steadholders shadow once jerking her feet up as he leapt a fallen tree that cirrus hadnt quite managed to carry her feet over got them he said in a moment more at the ford fades on the ground tavis partly in the water and he snarled and kord is there kord amara demanded steadholder criminal hell hurt them we dont have time for this so sorry its inconvenient cursor bernard snapped i cant feel your friends theyve left the road he must be concealing his own passage amara said he never passes up a surprise attack it wont be long before he gets to the boy then we have to defeat kord and his sons first ill take kord hes the old one the other two are up to you crafters air and fire fire amara blurted but cowards the taller one is more dangerous hit them hard and fast over the next rise amara nodded and said i will cirrus the cursor gathered the air beneath her and with a rush of swirling winds swept herself from the ground through the stark branches of the barren trees and into the air above them chapter the waters of the little river were icecold swift tavis mouth went numb the moment kord pushed his head into the water and his ears tingled and burned with sensation tavi struggled but the steadholders grip was too strong fingers tangled tightly in tavis hair his greasy steadholders chain thumped against tavis shoulders kord pressed down brutally and tavi felt his face mash up against the rocks at the bottom of the river and then that inexorable pressure vanished tavi felt himself hauled back by the hair and thrown through the air to land upon the ground many feet away he came down upon something warm and living that proved to be a dazed fade tavi lifted his head blinking water from his eyes toward kord but someone moved between them blocking his view uncle tavi said bernard said get fade up and get him out of here tavi tavi scrambled to his feet hauling fade up with him and swallowed what are we going to do get clear ill handle things here bernard said then he turned his back to tavi keeping himself between kord and his nephew this time kord youve gone too far three of us kord growled as his sons took up a position on either side of him and one of you plus the fool and the freak of course id say that youre the one who has his neck stuck out bernard the ground in front of kord rumbled shifting and the thing that hauled itself up out of the earth its hide and limbs all of stone looked like nothing that tavi had ever seen it had the long body of a slive but its tail curled up over its back held in the air like a club its mouth was hideously elongated and filled with flintsharp jags of teeth as tavi watched it twisted its head to one side opened its jaws and let out a granitedeep rumbling growl beside kord bittan took the cover from a ceramic firepot red flames licked up from it as he did and they curled into the shape of a reared serpent hovering and ready to strike flaming eyes bright the tall and slender aric on kords other side steepled his fingers together and wind and bits of bracken swirled around him casting back his cloak in a shape vaguely like great wings dont do this kord bernard said the ground beside him stirred and then brutus thrust his way up out of the soil until the rocky hounds broad head rested beneath bernards hand emerald eyes focused on the kordholters brutus gave his great shoulders a shake sending earth and small stones skittering down off of his flanks in a miniature avalanche tavi saw bittan blanch and take a small step back youre digging yourself deeper into your own grave trying to take my land kord spat from me and my family what gives you the right bernard let out his breath in a sigh glancing upward for a moment dont play righteous with me slaver the storms almost here kord last chance if you back down right now you get to live to face grams justice instead of mine kords eyes flashed im a citizen bernard you cant just kill a citizen thats on your lands bernard said were on mine kords face went white you selfrighteous bastard he hissed he threw his hands forward and screamed ill feed you to the crows the stone beast before him lurched forward across the stony ground lizardquick even as it did something lashed out from aric the blurred shape vaguely reminiscent of a bird of prey as it sped toward bernard bittan hurled his firepot down into the nearest brush and even damp the wood went up in a sudden blaze the flameserpent within it swelling to twenty times its previous size in the space of a long breath bernard moved quickly he threw his hand toward arics attacking fury scattering a fistful of salt crystals through the air a whistling shriek went up from the air before him even as brutus lunged forward clashing against kords fury with a shockingly loud crunch of impact both furies blended into a mound of stone that sank into the earth where the surface of the ground twitched and bulged where the steadholders furies battled out of sight beneath it kord let out a bellow and came for bernard tavis uncle hefted his axe and swiped it at the other steadholder kord threw himself back and to one side and bernard followed him lifting the axe for another strike tavi saw aric draw a knife from his belt and head for bernards back uncle he shouted behind you and then a column of wind so furious and strong that it almost seemed a solid mass hammered down into arics back throwing him hard against the earth the young man let out a choked cry and began to rise but from the dark sky above amara dropped onto his back her stolen clothes flapping wildly in the sudden wind aric had time to let out a strangled shout and the winds gathered around the pair of them in a sudden shriek of sound tavi saw amaras arm lock beneath arics chin and then the pair of them were rolling around on the ground aric struggling to dislodge the girl from his back tavi turned in time to see kord strike his uncles arm knocking the axe from his hand the weapon tumbled end over end and vanished into the water of the river bernard didnt waste a moment but threw his balled fist into kords ribs a blow that lifted the other man from the ground and sent him tumbling bernard pursued him but kord rose up again with furyborn fortitude and the two met in a close grapple the earth quivering and shaking beneath them light and heat fell on tavi from one side and he turned to see bittan standing before a blazing column of brush well well bittan glowered looks like that leaves me to take care of you bittan raised his arms with an ecstatic cry and brought them down again the flames leapt up into a pillar that fell swift and bright and horrible toward tavi and fade tavi let out a yelp and dragged the slave to one side with him flame washed against the earth like water sparks and smoke billowing out from it heat rushing through the night tavi smelled burnt hair and regaining his feet tugged fade with him toward the water of the river fade he gasped fade come on come on bittans laughter rang out harsh in the ruddy light the fallen column of fire danced and writhed over the ground like an enormous serpent snaking its way between tavi and the dubious shelter of the rivers chilly waters the fire leapt from bush to bush and tree to tree behind bittan growing its crackling growl increasing to a sullen roar bittan tavi shouted its getting away from you youll kill us all i dont think youre in a position to lecture me on furycrafting freak bittan called he turned to the burning brush beside him scooped up a handful of blazing material and hurled it at tavi tavi threw up his cloak against it softening the impact of the burning brush but little licks of fire clung to the cloth he beat at them frantically i just cant decide bittan yelled his voice jeering whether you should smother or burn fade the unmarred side of his face swollen and already purple with bruising finally began to support most of his own weight blinking his eyes around him in confusion he pawed at tavis cloak making little mewling sounds his eyes sweeping around them around the flames i have an idea bittan said how about i fry the simpleton first then i can move on to you freak he gestured with a hand and from within the flames that same serpentshape coalesced it writhed for a moment curlingand then shot toward fades chest like a streak of sunlight fade let out a yelp and with more speed than tavi would have credited to the slave he leapt aside blundering into tavi the slaves momentum carried them both toward the fiery barrier between them and the water tumbling over one another fades back rolled against the ground as they went through the fire and the slave let out a shriek of pain clutching tightly to tavi the boy struggled to free himself they both toppled into the rillwater no bittan shouted he strode unharmed through the fires and down to the waters edge he lifted his arms again and sent another tendril of flame racing toward them tavi threw himself back against fade knocking them both under the waters surface fire splashed across the top of the water a distant roar and a violent light above them tavi stayed under the waters surface for as long as he could but he could hold his breath for no more than a few seconds he hadnt had a chance to get a proper breath before diving and the water was simply too cold he struggled further away from the near shore and bittans raging fury before he broke the surface coughing and spluttering he hauled fade along with him more or less by main strength afraid that the panicked slave might drown himself before realizing that the water wasnt deep enough bittan stood at the very edge of the water and let out a shout of frustration the flames behind him leapt skyward as he did you gutless croweaten little freak ill burn you and that gibbering fool to cinders tavi clutched at the floor of the river beneath him and seized up a stone the size of his fist you leave him alone he shouted and flung the stone at bittan it flashed across the intervening space and struck the bigger boy in the mouth bittan flinched back letting out a yowl and tumbled backward to the ground uncle tavi shouted uncle were in the water through a roil of smoke tavi saw his uncle draw back a fist and ram it hard into kords throat the other steadholder stumbled back with a choked shout but didnt lose his grip on bernards tunic dragging him down with him and out of tavis sight not far away amara rose away from an unmoving aric wincing and holding one forearm where blood wetted her sleeve arics knife it seemed had scored on her even if it hadnt kept her from throttling him she looked around and shouted through the smoke tavi get out of the water dont stop in there get out what tavi shouted why he had no warning at all wet supple arms abruptly twined around his throat and a throaty feminine voice purred in his ear because bad things can happen to pretty little boys who fall into the river tavi started to turn to struggle but he was hauled beneath the rivers surface with breathless speed and the arms at his throat tightened tavi tried to plant his feet on the rivers bed to force his head up above the water but somehow his feet never found purchase as though the rivers bed had been coated with slime wherever his feet touched so that they forever slipped and slid aside poor pretty the voice at his ear murmured perfectly clear he could feel the press of a strong but shapely body against his back it isnt your fault that you saw what wasnt to be seen its a shame to kill a pretty one but if youll just lay quietly and take a deep breath it will be over soon and youll still be pretty when they put you in a box i promise tavi struggled and writhed but it was useless against the soft subtle strength of that grip he could have wrestled her all day and never gained the upper hand he knew she was a watercrafter like his aunt and a strong one at that and the waters of the river itself were being used against him tavi stopped struggling which made his assailant let out a soft approving murmur cold lips pressed against his ear he was starting to grow dizzy but his mind raced furiously if she was a watercrafter like his aunt then she would have the same problems aunt isana did for all the advantages watercrafters enjoyed they had to put up with more than almost any other craft the disruption that their extra senses picked up from other people emotions impressions feelings tavi focused for a moment on his own helpless fluttering fear terror that made his heart race stole the dregs of air remaining in his lungs ever more quickly away from him brought him that much closer to drowning he dwelt on that terror let it build in him and added to it the frustrations of the day the despair and fury and hopelessness he had felt upon returning to bernardholt every emotion built on the next and he fed them all with a frantic fury until he could scarcely remember what his plan had been to begin with what are you doing hissed the woman that held him threads of uncertainty lacing through the throaty assurance of her voice stop it stop it youre too loud i hate for it to be too loud tavi struggled uselessly against her panic now overwhelming him in fact as well blind and numbing fear blending in with all the other emotions the woman let out a shriek and curled away from him releasing him and wrapping her arms around her own head tavi choked his lungs expelling whatever was left in them as he struggled toward the surface he only just managed to get his head out of water to take a single deep gasping breath before the water itself bubbled up around him sudden and enveloping and dragged him back under clever boy hissed the woman and tavi could see her now in the reflected light from the fires on the bank a beautiful woman of dark hair and eyes body lushly curved and inviting very clever so passionate now i cant hold you while you go i wanted to do that much for you but some people are never grateful water pressed about him as strong and as heavy as leather bonds pressure that shoved his limbs together wrapped him up like a parcel of bread terrified he struggled to hold on to that last breath for as long as he could the woman remained before him eyes narrowed spitefully foolish i was going to give you the raptures now i think ill just break that pretty neck she flipped a wrist the gesture dainty but the water around tavi suddenly slewed around his head and began twisting his jaw slowly to one side tavi struggled against it but the water seemed just a little bit stronger than he the pressure on his neck swiftly built and became painful the woman came closer eyes round and bright watching she didnt see the sudden motion in the water behind her but tavi saw his aunt isanas hand come out of the murk one hand seized the woman by the hair and the other raked abruptly across her eyes pink tinged the water and the woman let out a sudden piteous shriek isana appeared more fully thrusting both hands toward the woman palms out and she suddenly flew through the water and then up and out of it as though hauled away by a giant hand as soon as the woman sailed up and out of the rillwater the pressure on tavis neck eased and he found himself able to move his limbs isana moved to him and together they broke the surface of the river tavi gasping and choking my river isana snarled after the departed water witch isana called to fade who lunged through the water to tavi the slave drew one of tavis arms around his shoulders holding the boy up and out of the water tavi stared at his aunts hand where the nails seemed to have grown to twice their usual length like shiningedged claws isana took note of his glance and gave her hand a shake as though relaxing muscles cramped from sewing once twice and the nails appeared as they always had practically short and neatly groomedbut stained with spots of blood tavi shivered get him to the far shore isana instructed there are two more out here and matters arent settled between kord and bernard as yet tavi get through the woods when the storm comes youll be safe for a time bittan bloodymouthed appeared on the shore you barren witch he howled at isana he gestured and fire leapt toward them isana rolled her eyes and flipped a hand toward bittan a wave rose to meet the flames drowning them and continued forward to clutch at the young mans feet washing them out from under him he went down with a yelp spluttering and scrambled back away from the shore get through the woods isana continued get to aldoholt by the lake ill have word to him by then and hell either get you to gram or get gram to you hell protect you until then do you understand tavi yes maam tavi gasped but she leaned into him and pressed a kiss against his forehead im sorry tavi so sorry theres no time for questions now you must trust me i love you i love you too tavi said isana turned her head and the fires spreading on shore reflected in her eyes its spreading and the storm is nearly here i have to call down nereus or lilvia will whip those fires until they devour the valley she looked back to them and said tavi get away from the river as far away as you can head uphill take fade with you and keep a close eye on himi dont know what made you bring him along she shot a glance past tavi to the slave who offered a witless smile to isana and ducked his head she shook hers in response kissed tavis head again and said go quickly and with that she turned and vanished down into the waters of the river again tavi swallowed and tried to help fade as the slave moved out of the river to the far side and up onto the shore tavi looked back as he moved out of the water kord lay on the ground curled onto his side weakly struggling to get back to his feet bernard his face bruised and his tunic torn stood with amara at the white rock of the ford their backs to tavi facing the woods from the smoke and the shadows of the trees there limped a man middleaged barefoot and of innocuous height he swept his eyes around the firelit stream and then focused on the two people standing at the ford then past them tavi felt the mans eyes touch on him like cold smooth stones calmly weighing him assessing him dismissing him the man lifted a hand and tavi heard the tree nearest him buck and tremble and he turned in time to see it pitch forward toward him bernards head whipped around and he raised a fist as swiftly as the first a second tree uprooted itself and toppled landing hard against the first so that the two fell against one another each supporting the other from falling while tavi and fade stood trembling in the arched space beneath them impressive the man said he focused on bernard and abruptly a wave of earth lashed out toward tavis uncle bernard planted his feet on the ground teeth bared in a grimace and a second wave rose in front of him gathered momentum toward the strangers attack bernards efforts were evidently not enough the ripple in the rock tore through his own efforts and ripped apart the ground he and amara stood upon sending them both toppling tavi cried out for even as his uncle fell the stranger drew from beneath his cloak a short and heavily curved bow he set an arrow to the string and drew with a cool precision the shaft leapt across the stream toward tavi from the ground amara cried out and slashed her hand at the air the arrow flicked itself abruptly aside and rattled into the woods behind tavi the man let out a short frustrated noise and said pointless kill them from behind him stepped the man tavi had seen earlier sword again in hand quietly lethal intent in his eyes the swordsman glided forward toward amara and his uncle the blade catching the scarlet light of the fires raging around kord had regained mobility and hauled himself to one side he roused aric with a few kicks and started to fall back into the woods letting his son scramble after him as he tried to regain his senses but even as kord left there was a rattle in the blazing brush and bittan backed out of the middle of a blaze blinded and choking on the smoke he waved a hand before his face and found himself standing a few scant feet from the swordsman between the man and bernard tavi never even saw the swordsmans arm move there was a hissing sound and bittan let out a surprised choke and fell to his knees the swordsman moved past the boy tavi saw scarlet puddling around bittans knees and the boy fell limply over onto his side tavi felt his gorge rise in his belly fade let out a hiss of breath and clutched at tavis arm bittan aric choked no for a moment that tableau held the boy on the ground in a pool of his own blood scarlet firelight all around the swordsman blade extended to his side moving with patient grace toward the people standing between him and tavi then everything happened at once kord let out a bellow of raw and indiscriminate rage the earth rippled around him and lashed out toward the swordsman amara came to her feet her blade in hand she threw herself forward even as the swordsmans blade descended toward bernard intercepting it the earth heaved and threw them both to one side locked together in a closequarters struggle the innocuous looking man extended his hands toward the far side of the river and the trees groaned in response the air filling with the twist and crackle of branches of movement and the storm arrived one moment there was relative stillnessand the next a wall of fury and sound and power thundered down over them engulfed tavis senses blinded him and whipped the surface of the river to icy foam the flames bittan had started buckled for a moment beneath the winds onslaught and then as though the storm had sensed their potential they blossomed and bloomed spreading and growing with a speed as terrifying as it was amazing to tavi it almost seemed as though faces gibbered and shrieked in the wind around those flames calling them encouraging them fade let out a squeal cowering down against the winds and tavi abruptly remembered his aunts commands he seized the slave by the arm though still terrified for those behind him at the ford and dragged him into the twisting woods along the paths he knew even in the semidarkness away from the river they struggled forward together holding one another in the screaming frigid gale tavi filled with a sense of gratitude that there was another living human being there to touch he was unsure for how long they struggled away their path winding forward and then slowly uphill before he heard the flood waters they rushed forward nearly silent preceded only by a whispering sigh and the groans of a thousand trees stirred in their ancient earthy beds to the top of a hill tavi and fade struggled and he turned back to see dimly through the ferocity of the storm the dancing of the trees that some pentup tide had been loosed from up the stream of the rillwater the little river had exceeded itself and flooded its banks and those cold silent waters began to swallow bittans fires as swiftly as they had spread the waters rose and in that screaming cyclone of the furystorm tavi was uncertain how anyone even his aunt could survive such an onslaught of the elements terror rushed through him pounded through his veins with his blood darkness swallowed the land as the silent waters of the flooding river swallowed errant flame and in moments the werelightning of the furystorm flashed green and eerie to show tavi which way to go in silence he turned back to his path and stumbled forward leading fade twice windmanes swept toward them but tavis salt crystals though partly dissolved from their time in the water drove them away they made their way from the twisting wood an endless time later fade let out a sudden yelp and threw himself against tavi with a sob of fear forcing the boy down the slaves heavy body atop him tavi wriggled and struggled to get out from under fade but only managed to free his head enough to crane his neck over the man and to see what had frightened him around them stood a silent halfcircle of marat warriors unmistakable with their pale braids and powerful bodies clad even in this vicious weather only in a brief cloth at the hips each of them stood very tall and more broad in the shoulders than tavi could easily believe with dark serious eyes the same shade as the chipped stone tipping their broadhafted spears without expression the tallest of the marat stepped closer he put his foot on tavis shoulder and rested the tip of his spear against the hollow of tavis throat chapter fidelias twisted himself up and out of the chilling waters of the angry river frozen fingers clutching hard against the branch of the tree he had crafted within his reach he felt numb and his heart labored painfully against the shock of the cold water the cold beckoned him with a slow seductive caress encouraging him to simply sink into the waters relax let his troubles slip away into the darkness instead he secured a hold on the next higher branch and hauled his body up out of the water he huddled there for a few moments shaking struggling to gather his wits about him again while the furystorm raged around him winds hauling at his sodden clothes the one good thing about the flood he decided about the freezing water was that he could no longer feel the cuts on his feet hed done his best to ignore them while recovering the horses but the rocks and brush had been merciless to his skin the woman the watercrafter had been onto them from the beginning he decided clever getting his shoes like that shed been planning on the boy running and on hampering pursuit fidelias leaned against the trunk and waited for the waters to subside they did in rapid order proving more than anything else that the flood had been a deliberate crafting rather than a natural event he shook his head odiana should have given them warningbut perhaps she had been overmatched the locals were no amateurs at their furycrafting and had lived with the local furies for years they would know them be able to use them more effectively than even a crafter of fideliass own level of skill the steadholder for examplehe had been formidable in a direct fair confrontation fidelias was uncertain whether or not he could simply overcome the man best then to ensure that any future contact with the fellow discounted the possibility of a fair fight but then that was in general fideliass policy once the waters had receded back down into the rivers original bed fidelias slipped down from the tree grimacing as he got back to the ground the pitch of the winds had only increased since the storm had rolled over them and surviving in it had to be his first priority he knelt by the trunk of the tree resting a hand lightly on the sodden ground reaching out for vamma the fury responded to him at once vanishing into the deep earth for several moments before rising back up toward him fidelias cupped his hands and vamma returned providing what it had been sent to retrievea handful of salt crystals and a flint fidelias pocketed the flint and swept the salt into a pouch keeping a few pieces in hand then he rose noting how slowly his body responded and shook his head shivering the cold could kill him if he didnt get warmed up and quickly rising he dispatched etan to look for signs of his companions and vamma to search through the surrounding earth for signs of movement if the locals either the bernardholters or those they had been fighting were still at hand they might feel few compunctions about finishing the job the watercrafter had started fidelias had to hurl salt at a swooping windmane while he waited for his furies to return to him it didnt take long etan appeared within a few moments and led him forward through the blinding storm down along the path of the river several hundred yards downstream fidelias found aldrick the swordsman lay on the ground unmoving his fingers still locked around the hilt of his sword buried to its hilts in the trunk of a tree he had apparently managed to keep the flood from sweeping him away entirely but had not taken into account the threat the elements represented fidelias checked the pulse at the mans throat and found it there still strong if slow his lips were blue the cold if the swordsman was not warmed and quickly he would die fidelias debated allowing it to happen for a moment odiana remained an unknown quantity and as long as she had aldrick with her she would be difficult to move against without the swordsman fidelias could remove her at leisure and if fidelias was fortunate perhaps aldricks death would unhinge her entirely fidelias grimaced and shook his head aldrick could be arrogant insubordinate but his loyalty to aquitaine was unquestioned and he was a valuable resource besides which fidelias liked working with the man he was a professional and understood the priorities of operating in the field fidelias as his commander owed him a certain amount of loyalty protection convenient as it might be to him in the long term he could not allow the swordsman to come to grief fidelias took a moment to draw strength from the earth pouring into him in a sudden flood he jerked the sword from the trees trunk and peeled aldricks hand from its hilt then he picked up the man and slung him over one shoulder his balance wavered dangerously and he took a moment to breathe to steady himself before taking up the naked sword and turning with aldrick to march away from the river up out of the floodsaturated ground of the rivers course vamma shaped out a shelter from a rocky hillside and fidelias ducked into it and out of the storm etan provided ample kindling and wood and fidelias managed to coax a pile of shavings into flame using the flint and aldricks sword by slow degrees he built up the fire until the inside of the furycrafted shelter began to grow warm even cozy he leaned back against the wall his eyes closed and dispatched vamma and etan again as tired as he was there was still a job to do fidelias remained silent for a moment letting his furies gather information about those who still moved in the wild storm outside when he opened his eyes again aldrick was awake and watching him you found me the swordsman said yes blade isnt much good against a river mmmm aldrick sat up and rubbed at the back of his neck with one hand wincing gathering himself back together with the resilience of his craftand of comparative youth fidelias thought he wasnt young anymore wheres odiana i dont know yet fidelias said the storm offers considerable danger ive found two moving groups so far and i think theres at least one more that i cant pinpoint which one is odiana in fidelias shrugged one is heading to the northeast and one to the southeast i thought i felt something more directly east of here but i cant be certain northeast isnt anything aldrick said maybe one of the steadholts southeast of here there isnt even that turns into the wax forest and the plains beyond it and east is garrison fidelias said i know shes been taken or shed have stayed close to me yes aldrick rose we have to find out which group shes in fidelias shook his head no we dont the swordsman narrowed his eyes then how are we supposed to find her we dont fidelias said not until the mission is finished aldrick went silent for several seconds the fire popped and crackled then he said im going to pretend i didnt hear you say that old man fidelias looked up at him and said aquitaine assigned you to this personally didnt he aldrick nodded once youve been his right hand through most of this you know all the details youre the one who has handled the money the logistics yes whats your point what do you think is going to happen if the mission fails hmm if aquitaine is in danger of exposure do you think hes just going to give you a wink and a nod and ask you not to mention it where anyone could overhear or do you think hes going to make sure that no one ever finds your body much less what you know about what he is planning aldrick stared steadily at fidelias then tightened his jaw and looked away fidelias nodded we finish the mission we stop whoever is going to the local count send in the windwolves and turn the marat loose after that well find the girl to the crows with the mission aldrick spat im going to find her oh fidelias asked and how are you going to manage that you have many skills aldrick but youre no tracker youre in strange country with strange furies and hostile locals at best youll wander around lost like an idiot at worst the locals will kill you or the marat will when they attack and then who will find the girl aldrick snarled pacing back and forth within the confines of the shelter crows take you he snarled all of you assuming the girl is alive fidelias said she is quite capable if she has been taken i am sure she is well able to survive on her own give her that much credit in two days at the most well go after her two days aldrick said he bowed his head and growled then lets get started now we stop the messengers to the count and then we get her sit down rest weve lost the horses in the flood we can wait until the storm is out at least aldrick stepped across the space between them and hauled fidelias to his feet eyes narrowed no old man we go now you find us salt and we go out into that storm and get this over with then you take me to odiana fidelias swallowed and kept his expression careful neutral and then then i kill anyone that gets between me and her aldrick said it would be safer for us if we i couldnt care less about safe aldrick said times wasting fidelias looked out of the shelter at the storm his body ached in its joints groaned at the abuse that had already been heaped on it his feet throbbed where they were cut steady slow pain he looked back to aldrick the swordsmans eyes glittered cold and hard all right fidelias said lets find them chapter amara had never been so cold she swam in it drifted in it a pure and frozen darkness as black and as silent as the void itself memories images danced and floated around her she saw herself struggling against the swordsman she saw bernard on his feet and coming toward them and then the cold sudden and black and terrifying the river she thought isana must have flooded the river a band of fire settled around her wrist but she noted it as nothing more than a passing sensation there was just the darkness and the coldthe burning horrible purity of the cold pressing into her through her skin sensations blurred melted together and she felt the sound of splashing water saw the cold wind rippling across her soaked skin she heard someone a voice speaking to her but the words didnt make any sense and ran too closely together for her to understand she tried to ask whoever was speaking to slow down but her mouth didnt seem to be listening to her sounds came out but they were too cracked and rasping to have been anything she meant to say sound lessened and the cold lessened with it no more wind she felt a hard surface beneath her and lay there upon it abruptly and overwhelmingly tired she closed her eyes and tried to sleep but someone kept shaking her just as she was about to get some rest waking her up light came and an ugly unpleasant tingling in her limbs it hurt and she felt tears come to her eyes simple frustration hadnt she done enough hadnt she given enough shed already given her life must she sacrifice her rest as well coherence returned in a rush and with it pain so sharp and rending that she lost her breath and her voice in the same gasp her body curled into a ball had tightened into a series of cramping convulsions as though doing everything in its power to close itself off from the cold that had filled her she heard herself making sounds grunting noises guttural and helpless but she could no more stop making them than she could force herself to straighten her body she lay on stone that much she knew in the clothes shed stolen from bernardholtbut they were soaked through with water and crystals of ice were forming on the outermost layer of cloth there were sloped walls of rough stone around her that had stopped the howling winds a cave then and a fire that provided light and the warmth that had brought tingling pain flooding back into her body she was freezing she knew and knew as well that she had to move to get out of the clothes and closer to the fire lest she sink back into that stillness and never emerge from it she tried she couldnt fear filled her then not the rush of excitement or the lightning of sudden terror but slow cool logical fear she had to move to live she could not move hence she could not live the helpless simplicity of it was what stung what made it real she wanted to move to uncurl her body to creep closer to the firesimple things things she could do at any other time but for lack of that ability now she would die tears made her vision blur but they were halfhearted too empty of the fire of life to warm her something came between her and the fire a shape and she felt a hand huge and warmblessedly warmsettle on her forehead weve got to get those clothes off you bernard rumbled his voice gentle he moved closer to her and she felt him lift her like a child she tried to speak to him to help him but she could only curl and shudder and make helpless grunting sounds i know he rumbled just relax he had to struggle to get the shirts off though not muchthey were so large on her the clothes came away like layers of frozen mud until she wore only her underclothes her limbs seemed shrunken and wrinkled to her her fingers were swollen bernard laid her down again close to the fire and its heat flowed over her easing the cramped tension in her muscles slowly lessening the pain that had come with it her breathing began to be something she could control and she slowed her breaths though she still shivered here bernard said i got it wet but ive been drying it out since we got the fire going he lifted her and a moment later settled a shirt a little damp but warm with the heat of the fire over her he didnt bother to slip the sleeves on just wrapped her in it like a blanket and she huddled under it grateful amara opened her eyes and looked up at him she lay curled on her side he sat on his legs holding his own hands out to the fire and was naked above the waist firelight played over dark hairs on his chest over the heavy muscle of his frame and made soft lines of several old scars blood had dried in a line on his lip where a blow from the other steadholder had apparently split it and his cheek had already darkened with a bruise reflected by others on his ribs and belly yyou came after me she said moments later you pulled me out of the water he looked over at her then back at the fire he nodded once it was the least i could do you stopped that man only for a few seconds she said i couldnt have stood up to him for long hes a swordsman a good one if the river hadnt flooded when it did bernard waved his hand and shook his head not that one the one who shot the arrow at tavi you saved my nephews life he looked down at her and said quietly thank you she felt her cheeks color and she looked down oh youre welcome after a moment she said arent you cold some he admitted he nodded toward where several articles of clothing were spread on stones near the fire brutus is trying to spread some heat into the stones beneath them but he doesnt really understand heat too well theyll dry in a while brutus amara asked my fury the hound you saw oh she said here let me amara closed her eyes and murmured to cirrus the air around the fire stirred sluggishly and then the smoke and shimmering waves of warmth tilted moved toward the clothing amara opened her eyes to inspect cirruss work and nodded they should dry a little faster now thank you bernard said he folded his arms suppressing a shiver of his own you knew the men after tavi there was another too a watercrafter your sister threw her out of the river bernard snorted a smile touching his face she would i never saw that one i know them amara said she told him in brief about fidelias and the mercenaries and her fears for the valley politics bernard spat into the fire i took a steadholt out here because i didnt want anything to do with the high lords or the first lord either im sorry amara said is everyone all right bernard shook his head i dont know after that fight i cant push brutus too hard hes mostly making sure that other earthcrafter cant find us i tried to look but i havent been able to locate anyone im sure tavis well amara said hes a resourceful child bernard nodded hes clever fast but that might not be enough in this storm he had salt amara said he took it before he left thats good to know at least and he wasnt alone he had that slave with him bernard grimaced fade i dont know why my sister puts up with him do you own many slaves bernard shook his head i used to buy them sometimes give them the chance to earn their freedom lot of the families on the steadholt started that way but you didnt give fade that chance he frowned of course i did he was the first slave i bought back when i raised bernardholt but he spends the money on things before he saves up to his price or does something stupid and has to pay for repairs i stopped having the patience to deal with him years ago isana does it all now all his clothes get ruined and he wont stop wearing that old collar nice enough fellow i suppose and hes a fairly good tinker and smith but hes got the brains of a brick amara nodded then she sat up the effort of it left her gasping and dizzy bernards hand steadied her warm on her shoulder easy you should rest going into water like that can kill you i cant amara said i have to get moving to find tavi or at least try to warn the count at garrison you arent going anywhere tonight bernard said he nodded toward the darkness at one side of the cavern they huddled in where amara could distantly hear the howl of wind that storm came down and its worse than i thought it would be no ones moving tonight she looked at him frowning lay down he told her rest no sense in making yourself more tired what about you he shrugged ill be fine his hand pushed gently on her shoulder rest well go as soon as the storm breaks amara stopped struggling against the warmth easing into her with a sigh of relief and let his hand push her down his fingers tightened slightly and she felt the strength of them through her skin she shivered feeling at once a sense of reassurance and a sudden spasm of raw physical need that curled in her belly and lingered there making her heart speed up again her breathing quicken she looked up and saw in his face that hed seen her reaction she felt her cheeks color again but she didnt look away youre shivering he said quiet his hand didnt move she swallowed and said im cold she became acutely aware of her bare legs brazenly on display and curled them up toward the shirt his shirt that he had draped over her he moved then his hand sliding from her shoulder he stretched out on his side his chest against her shoulders so that she lay between him and the fire lay back against me he said quiet just until you get warm she shivered again and did feeling the strength of him the warmth of him she had an urge to roll onto her other side to press her face into the hollow of his shoulder and throat to feel his skin against hers to share that closeness that warmth and the thought of it made her shiver again she licked her lips are you all right he asked im she swallowed still cold he moved his arm lifted then draped across her careful strong drawing her back a bit more firmly against him better better she whispered she turned hips and shoulders so that she could see his face her mouth lay a breath from his thank you for saving me whatever hed been about to say died on his lips and his eyes focused on hers then on her mouth after a moment of aching silence he said you should go to sleep she swallowed her eyes on his and shook her head she leaned toward him then and her mouth touched on his his lips just a little rough soft warm she could smell him his scent like leather and fresh wind and she felt herself arch into the kiss slow and sweet he kissed her back gently but she could feel the faint traces of heat in it feel the way his mouth pushed hungrily at hers and it made her heart race even more swiftly he ended the kiss lifting his mouth away from hers his eyes closed he swallowed throat working and she felt his arm tighten on her for a moment then he opened his eyes and said you need to sleep but youre half frozen and youre afraid bernard said quiet im not going to take advantage of that her face colored and she looked away from him no i mean he laid his hand on her head and pressed gently down his other arm shifted moved beneath her head so that her cheek rested against it instead of her own just rest he said quietly sleep are you sure she asked despite herself her eyes blinked closed and refused to open again im sure amara he said voice a low rumble she felt against him as much as heard sleep ill watch im sorry she said i didnt mean to she felt him lean down to her and press his mouth against her damp hair hush we can talk about it later if you want to rest her cheeks still warm amara leaned back against his warmth and sighed sleep took her before she remembered drawing that breath in again the light woke her she still lay by the fire but the cloaks that had been drying now lay over her keeping her warm but for her back which felt as though it had just begun to cool bernard wasnt in sight and the fire had burned low but grey light shone from one side of the small cave amara rose wrapping the cloaks about herself and walked toward the mouth of the cave she found bernard there still shirtless staring out at a landscape shining in the predawn light ice coating every surface every branch of every tree sleetice mixed with snow lay over the ground softening everything with white making sounds seem closer granting the land the strange halfglowing light of winter amara stopped for a moment just to stare at the land and then at bernard his expression was hard alarmed steadholder she asked he lifted a finger to his lips eyes focused elsewhere head tilted to one side as though listening then his eyes snapped abruptly to the south at the stillshadowed trees that stood in silent glinting stillness there he said amara frowned at him but stepped closer wrapping the cloaks a little more tightly about herself against the cold outside winter had come in force with the storm she glanced at bernard and then at the trees he stared at so intently she heard it before she saw anything a low swelling sound that began to gather to grow closer it took her a moment to identify the sound to sort it out into something she could recognize crows the cawing of crows the cawing of thousands of crows even as she started to shiver they appeared black shapes against the predawn sky from the direction bernard faced flying low over the trees hundreds of them thousands flooded through the air like a living shadow blackening the sky flying north and east over the calderon valley moving with an uncanny certainty with a purpose crows she whispered they know bernard said oh furies they always know know what amara breathed where to find the dead he let out an unsteady breath they smell a battle amara felt her eyes widen theyre flying toward garrison i have to find tavi and isana get back to the steadholt bernard said she turned to him and took his arm no she said i need your help he shook his head my responsibility is for my holders i have to get back to them listen to me she said bernard i need your help i dont know this valley i dont know the dangers im afraid to take to the air in daylight and even if i got to your count alone he might not listen to me i need someone he knows with me i have to get him to react to this as strongly as possible if theres to be any chance of protecting the valley bernard shook his head this has nothing to do with me is it going to have anything to do with you when a marat horde comes down on bernardholt amara demanded do you think you and the people there will be able to fight them he looked at her uncertain she pressed him bernard steadholder bernard your duty is to your people and the only way to protect them is to warn garrison to rouse the legions you can help me do that i dont know bernard said grams a stubborn old goat i cant tell him ive seen the marat in the valley i dont remember it his watercrafter will tell him that but you can tell him what you have seen amara said you can tell him that you support me if i have your support hell have to take my credentials as a cursor seriously he has the authority to bring legion strength to garrison to protect the valley bernard swallowed but tavi he doesnt have anyone else to look after him and my sister im not sure she came through last night all right are either of them going to be all right if the marat exterminate everyone in the calderon valley bernard looked away back to the crows that still streamed overhead he growled you think someones watching the air theres a full century of knights stationed at garrison amara said with a pair of infantry cohorts to cover them they could stand off a dozen hordes i think whoever has arranged this has a plan to assault them and destroy them before the marat come the mercenaries bernard said yes then there might be more people trying to stop us from reaching garrison professional killers amara nodded silent watching his face bernard closed his eyes tavi he was quiet for a moment before he opened them isana ill be leaving them alone in this mess she said quietly i know what im asking you is terrible no he said no its duty ill help you she squeezed his arm thank you he looked at her and said dont thank me im not doing it for you but he covered her hand with his and squeezed quietly she swallowed and said bernard last night what you said you were right im afraid so am i he said he released her hand and turned to go into the cave lets get dressed get moving weve got a long way to go chapter isana heard a womans voice say wake up wake up someone slapped her face sudden and sharp isana let out a surprised sound and lifted her arms in an effort to protect her face that same voice continued just as before wake up wake up and slapped her at measured intervals until isana curled away from the blows rolling to get her hands and knees beneath her and to lift her head isana felt hot sweltering her skin had soaked with sweat and her clothes clung to her likewise damp light was in her eyes and it took her a moment to realize that she was on a dirt floor that there was fire all around her fire in a circle perhaps twenty feet across a ring of coals and tinder that smoldered and smoked her throat and lungs burned with thirst with the smoke and she coughed until she almost retched she covered her mouth with her shaking hand tried to filter out some of the smoke and dust in the air as she breathed someone helped her sit up hands brisk strong thank you she rasped isana looked up to see the woman shed seen in the rillwater strangling tavi she was beautiful dark of hair and eye curved as sweetly as any man could desire her hair hung in damp sweaty curls though and her face had been smudged with soot the skin in rows that reached across her eyes was bright pink shiny and new a small smile curved her full mouth isana hissed out a breath in surprise backing away from the woman looking around her at the fires a low ceiling smooth round stone walls not far beyond the ring of coals there was a door leading out and isana tried to stand and move toward it only to find that her legs would not obey her properly she stumbled and fell heavily onto her side near enough to the coals that her skin heated painfully she pushed herself back from the fire the woman helped dragging isana back with a cool efficiency nasty nasty the woman said you must be careful or youll burn she sat back from isana tilting her head to one side and studying her my name is odiana she said then and you and i are prisoners together prisoners isana whispered her voice came out in a croak and she had to cough painfully prisoners where whats wrong with my legs kordholt i think they called it odiana said youre experiencing crafting sickness when kord found you by the banks of the flood your head was broken they made me mend it you isana asked but you were trying to hurt tavi the pretty boy odiana asked i wasnt hurting him i was killing him theres a difference she sniffed and said it wasnt anything personal tavi isana said coughing again is tavi all right how should i know odiana said her tone faintly impatient you tore my eyes out woman the next thing i saw was that ugly brute then youre not isana shook her head kord took you prisoner she nodded once he found me after the flood i had just put my eyes back together odiana smiled ive never managed my nails like that before youll have to show me how its done isana stared at the woman for a moment then said we have to get out of here yes odiana agreed looking at the door but that seems unlikely for the moment hes a slaver isnt he this kord he is the dark haired womans eyes glinted i thought as much the thirst in her throat abruptly became too much for isana to ignore and she murmured rill i need water odiana let out an impatient sigh no she said dont be an idiot hes ringed us in fire dried us out your fury cannot hear you and even if it could youd not be able to dampen a washcloth isana shivered and for the first time since shed found rill she felt no quivering response to her call no reassuring presence of the water fury isana swallowed eyes shifting around the interior of the building meat hung from hooks on some of the walls and smoke lingered in the air a smokehouse then at kords steadholt she was a prisoner at kords steadholt the thought chilled her sent a quiver creeping along her scalp to the roots of her hair odiana watched her in silence and then nodded slowly he doesnt intend for us to ever leave this place you know i felt that in him before he brought us here im thirsty isana said hot enough to kill us in here i have to get a drink they left us two tiny cups of water odiana said nodding to the far side of the circle isana looked until she saw the pair of wooden cups and pulled herself to them the first she picked up was light empty she dropped it to one side her throat on fire and tried the second it was empty as well you were asleep odiana said calmly so i drank it isana stared at the woman in disbelief this heat could kill us she told her struggling to keep an even tone the woman smiled at her a lazy languid smile well it wont kill me ive drunk enough for two isana clenched her teeth together it makes the most sense anyway use it call your fury and send for help were far from any help holdgirl isana pressed her lips together then when one of them comes in odiana shook her head slowly and spoke in a cool passionless practical tone do you think theyve never done this before this is what slavers do holdgirl they left enough to keep us alive not enough to allow one of us full use of her fury id try it wouldnt work and theyd punish both of us so thats it isana said we dont even try odiana closed her eyes for a moment looking down then she said very quietly were only going to get one chance holdgirl im not a gi youre a child odiana hissed do you know how many slaves are raped within a day or so of capture the thought made isana feel cold again no do you know what happens to the ones who resist isana shook her head odiana smiled take it from me you only get to resist once and after that they make sure that you never want to try it again isana stared at the woman for a long moment then she said how long were you a slave odiana brushed her hair back away from her face with one hand and said voice cool when i was eleven our steadholder sold my fathers debt to a group of slavers they took all of us they killed my father and my oldest brother and the baby they took my mother my sisters me and my youngest brother he was pretty her eyes grew distant and she focused them on the far wall fire glowed in them reflection i was too young i hadnt begun my cycle or come into my furycrafting but i did that night when they took me passed me around the fire like a flask of wine it woke up and i could feel everything they felt holdgirl all of their lust and their hate and fear and hunger it washed through me into me she began to rock back and forth on her heels i dont know how you came into yours watercrafter when you first started feeling other folk but you must thank all the furies of carna that it wasnt like my awakening the smile crept back to her lips its enough to drive one mad isana swallowed and said im sorry but odiana if we can work together we can get killed together odiana said her voice becoming edged again listen to me holdgirl and ill tell you what happens ive done it before all right isana said quietly there are two kinds of slavers odiana said the ones in it for professional reasons and the ones who take it personally professionals work for the consortium they dont allow anyone to damage or use their merchandise unless its as discipline if they like you theyll invite you to their tent and give you nice food and talk and charm you its the same as a rape only it takes longer and you get a good meal and a soft bed afterward thats not kord no it isnt hes the other kind like the ones who took my family for him its knowing hes beating someone knowing hes breaking someone he doesnt want to deliver a highquality product ready to work or pleasure he wants us broken into pieces he wants us to be animals she smiled and said when he takes us thats just part of the process that he enjoys a bit more than the others isanas stomach quailed takes us she whispered hes the other woman nodded if he wanted to kill you youd already be dead he has other plans for you she sneered and i saw some of the other women he keeps at this place rabbits sheep he likes them helpless not fighting back she shivered and stretched her back arching sinuously her eyes closing for a moment she moved one hand to the throat of her blouse tugging at it pulling buttons open the sweaty cloth clinging to her are you all right isana asked odiana licked her lips and said i dont have much time listen to me for him the game is breaking you and to do that he has to make you afraid if you arent afraid he has no power over you if youre quiet and reserved you arent what he wants do you understand yyes isana said but we cant just stay here we survive for as long as you dont break odiana said to him im nothing but a pretty whore to be used you he wants broken as long as you remain in control of yourself he doesnt get what he wants what happens if i do break he kills you she said and he kills me because i saw you and he hides the bodies but it wont be an issue why not it wont odiana says one way or another hold out for a day thats all because i promise neither of us will draw breath for half an hour if you break thats why i drank both cups isana fought to take a breath and her head spun why you drank both cups have you ever tasted aphrodin holdgirl she stared at odiana no she said never odiana licked her lips smiling then it would have unnerved you wanting when you knew you shouldnt want at least i know what its like she stretched again unbuttoning her blouse lower showing the soft curves of her breasts she adjusted the fall of her skirt so that it bared one strong smooth thigh and ran a fingertip along it lets review our stratagem im going to make them happy and youre going to not care there thats simple isana felt her insides twist felt sickened as she stared at the other woman youre going to she couldnt finish it was too horrible odiana let her lips curve into a smile the act isnt unpleasant you know in and of itself its rather nice and i wont be thinking about them the smile grew a bit wider and the whites showed around her eyes ill be thinking of the pieces the pieces left when my lord catches up to them he will see to his duty and then he will come for me and there will be pieces she shivered and let out a soft gasp and there im happy already isana stared at the woman revolted and shook her head this could not be happening it simply could not be happening she with her brother had worked the whole of their adult lives to make the calderon valley a place safe for families for civilizationfor tavi to grow up this wasnt a part of the world she had worked to build this wasnt a part of what she dreamed tears welled in her eyes and she fought to restrain them to hold back the precious moisture before it fell without thinking she reached for rills help and did not find it tears trickled over her cheeks she hurt deep inside she felt horribly utterly alone with only a madwoman for company isana reached out for rill again desperate and felt nothing again she tried and again refusing to accept that her fury was beyond her reach she didnt hear the footsteps until they were immediately outside the smokehouse someone shoved the door open the hulking ugly shape of kord and those of a dozen other men stood silhouetted by the light of the circle of coals chapter being captured tavi thought was a twofold evil it was both uncomfortable and boring the marat hadnt spoken not to the alerans nor to one another four had simply held spear tips to tavis and fades throats while the other two trussed their arms and legs with lengths of tough braided cord they took tavis knife and pouch away and searched then confiscated fades battered old pack then the two who had tied them simply flung them over one of their broad shoulders and loped off into the storm after half an hour of jouncing against the marat warriors shoulder tavis stomach felt as though hed been belly diving from the tallest tree along the rillwater the marat who carried him ran with a pure and predatory grace moving along the land at a mileeating lope he leapt over a streambed and once a low row of brush evidently entirely unencumbered by the weight of his prisoner tavi tried to keep track of which way they were headed but the darkness and the storm and his awkward position mostly upside down made it impossible the rain turned into pelting stinging sleet blinding him almost entirely the winds continued to rise and grow colder and tavi could see the windmanes moving in the storm wild and restless none of them came near the marat war band tavi tried to mark where he was by the lay of the ground rolling by under his nose but the storm began coating it in a layer of plain monotonous white he had no way of getting his bearings by the kind of rock or earth beneath him no way to guide himself by the stars no way to orient himself upon the lay of the land though he tried for an hour more he gave it up as pointless that left him with only the fear to think about the marat had taken him and fade while they appeared outwardly much like alerans they were not truly human and had never shown a desire to be so and instead remained the primitive savages who ate fallen foes and mated with beasts though they lacked furycrafting of their own they made up for it in raw athletic ability courage that was more madness than virtue and vast numbers that dwelt on the unknown stretches of the wilderness that began on the easten side of the last legion fortification garrison when the marat horde had rushed into the valley killing the princeps and annihilating his legion to a man they had been driven out only through heavy reinforcements from the rest of alera and hard vicious fighting now they were back presumably to strike in secretand tavi had seen them and knew of their plans what would they do to him he swallowed and tried to tell himself that the pounding of his heart was the result of the battering he was taking on his captors shoulder rather than from the quiet terror that had taken up residence in him and slowly grew with every loping stride an endless time later the marat came to a gradual halt he growled something in a guttural swiftsounding tongue and took tavi from his shoulder lowering the boy to the ground and stepping firmly on tavis hair with one naked mudstained foot he put his hands to his mouth and let out a low grunting cough a sound that it did not seem possible for a humansized chest to make an answering cough rumbled from the trees and then the ground shook as huge heavy shapes dark in the storm and night stepped toward them tavi recognized the smell before he could make out the exact shape of the creatures gargants the marat who had carried tavi evidently the leader of the group slapped the nearest gargant on the shoulder and the great beast knelt down with ponderous gentility teeth idly working over several pounds of cud the marat again spoke to the others and then picked tavi up tavi looked around and saw a second marat lifting fade the marat carried him under one arm as he put a foot in the joint of the gargants foreleg and halfjumped up to the great beasts sloped back where he settled onto some sort of riding saddle consisting of a heavy mat woven of the same coarse cords as the ones that bound tavi made out of garganthair he tossed tavi bellydown over the mat and whipped a few more cords around the boy as casually as any muleteer packing his charges tavi looked up at the marat he had broad rather ugly features and his eyes were dark dark brown though he was not as tall as tavis uncle his shoulders and chest would make bernard seem positively skinny and slabs of heavy muscle moved beneath his pale skin his coarse colorless hair had been gathered back into a braid he looked down at tavi as he settled onto the gargant and the beast began to rise without any apparent signal from its rider the marat smiled and his teeth were broad and white and square he rumbled something in that same language and the other marat let out rough coughing laughs as they mounted their own gargants the great beasts rose and set out at a swift pace in a single file their huge strides eating up ground faster than tavi could run steady and tireless as the stars in the sky tavi could just make out fades shape tied on the gargant behind them he grimaced and wished he could at least be with the slave surely fade was terrifiedhe always was they rode for a length of time tavi could hardly guess at considering that he had been tied face down and he saw little more than one leg of the gargant and the snowy white ground rolling by beneath him a sudden low whistle broke the monotony tavi glanced toward the source of the sound and then up at his captor the marat shifted his weight slightly backward and the gargant slowed its steps by degrees coming to a ponderous halt the marat did not bother to have the gargant kneel but swung from a braided cord knotted every foot or so down from the saddle and gave a low whistle in answer from the darkness emerged another marat broad of shoulder and deep of chest panting as though from a run his expression seemed to tavi to be sickened even afraid he said something in the guttural marat tongue and tavis captor put a hand on the younger marats shoulder making him repeat himself once he had tavis captor gave a short whistle and another marat from down the row of gargants swung down from his saddle carrying what tavi recognized as a torch and a firebox of aleran manufacture the marat knelt holding the torch up with his thighs and with a stone struck sparks from the firebox and lit the torch he passed it over to tavis captor who kept his hand on the young marats shoulder and nodded to him tavi watched as the younger marat led his captor to a vague form in the snow tavi could see little of it other than that the snow over it had been stained with red the marat took a few paces more then a few more more lumps in the snow became evident tavis stomach twisted with a slow shock of understanding they were people the marat were looking at people on the ground people dead so recently that their blood still stained the newly fallen snow tavi looked up and thought he saw light from the marats torch reflected from water not far away the lake then aldoholt tavi watched the marat walk a quick circle the light of his torch at one point catching the sloped walls of the steadholt proper bodies lay in a line leading from the steadholt gates one by one as though the holders had made a lastmoment effort to run only to be dragged down one at a time and savaged into the snow tavi swallowed without doubt the holders were all dead people he had met people he had laughed with apologized topeople he knew ravaged and torn to shreds his belly writhed and he got sick trying to lean far enough over the side to sick up onto the ground instead of the gargants saddle the marat leader came back though he had passed the torch to the younger one in each of his hands he held a vague lumpy shape which tavi identified only as the marat got close to the gargant the marat leader held the shapes up in the light of the torch letting out another low whistle to his men firelight fell on the severed heads of what looked like a direwolf and a herdbane their eyes glassy the residents of the steadholt it seemed had not died alone and tavi felt a helpless little rush of vengeful satisfaction he spat toward the lead marat the lead marat looked up at him head tilted to one side then turned to the younger one and drew a line across his throat the younger dropped the torchs flame into the snow quenching it the marat leader dropped the heads and then swarmed up the knotted cord back onto the saddle he turned to tavi and stared at him for a moment then leaned over and touched a spot on the saddle that tavi hadnt been able to avoid staining when he got sick the marat lifted his fingertips to his nose wrinkled it and looked from tavi to the silent bloody forms in the snow he nodded his expression grim then took a leather flask from a tie on the saddle turned to tavi and unceremoniously shoved one end of the flask into his mouth squeezing water out of it in a rush tavi spluttered and spat and the marat withdrew the flask nodding then he tied the flask to the saddle and let out another low whistle the line of gargants moved out into the night and the spare marat swung up behind another rider further down the file tavi looked back to find his captor studying him frowning the marat looked past him back toward the steadholt his broad ugly features unsettled perhaps disturbed then he looked back to tavi again tavi puffed out a breath to blow the hair out of his eyes and demanded his voice shaking what are you looking at the marats eyebrows went up and once again that broadtoothed smile briefly took over his face his voice came out in a basso rumble i look at you valleyboy tavi blinked at him you speak aleran some said the marat we call your language the trading tongue trade with your people sometimes trade with one another the clans each have their own tongue to one another we speak trade speak aleran where are you taking us tavi asked to the horto the marat said whats a horto your people have no word tavi shook his head i dont understand your people never do he said without malice they never try what do you mean what i say the marat turned back to the trail in front of them idly ducking under a lowhanging branch the gargant swayed a bit to one side even as its rider did and the branch passed the marat by no more than the width of a finger im tavi he told the marat no the marat said you are aleran valleyboy no i mean my name is tavi its what i am called being called something does not make you that thing valleyboy i am called doroga doroga tavi frowned what are you going to do to us do to you the marat frowned best not to think about it for now but valleyboy be quiet doroga flicked a look back at tavi eyes dark with menace and tavi quailed before it shivering doroga grunted and nodded tomorrow is tomorrow he said turning his face away for tonight you are in my keeping tonight you will go nowhere rest after that he fell silent tavi stared at him for a while and then spent a while more working his wrists at the cords trying to loosen them so that he could at least try to escape but the cords only tightened cutting into his wrists making them ache and throb tavi gave up on the effort after an endless amount of squirming the sleet tavi noted had changed into a heavy wet snow and he was able to lift his head enough to look around him a little he couldnt identify where they were though dim shapes far off in the shadows nagged at his memory somewhere past the lake and aldoholt he supposed though they couldnt be heading anywhere but to garrison it was the only way into or out of the valley at that end wasnt it his back and legs were soaked and chill but only a while after he noticed that doroga glanced back at him drew an aleranweave blanket from his saddlebags and tossed it over tavi head and all tavi laid his head down on the saddlemat and noted idly that the material used in its construction was braided gargant hair it held his heat well once the blanket had gone over him and he began to warm up that coupled with the smooth steady strides of the beast were too much for tavi in his exhausted state he dozed off sometime deep in the night tavi woke wrapped in blankets he sat up blinking and looked around him he was in a tent of one kind or another it was made of long curving poles placed in a circle and leaning on one another at the top and over that was spread some kind of hide covering he could hear wind outside through a hole in the roof of the tent and pale winter sunlight peeked through it as well he rubbed at his face and saw fade sitting on the floor nearby his legs crossed his hands folded in his lap a frown on his face fade tavi said are you well the slave looked up at tavi his eyes vacant for a moment and then he nodded trouble tavi fade said his tone serious trouble i know tavi said dont worry well figure a way out of this fade nodded eyes watching tavi expectantly well not right this minute tavi said after a flustered moment you could at least try to help me come up with something fade fade stared vacantly for a moment and then frowned marat eat alerans tavi swallowed i know i know but if they were going to eat us they wouldnt have given us blankets and a place to sleep right maybe they like hot dinner fade said darkly raw dinner tavi stared at him for a minute thats enough help fade he said get up maybe nobodys looking and we can make a run for it they both stood up and tavi had just crept to the tents flap to peek out when the flap swung out letting a flood of pale sunlight in along with a slender marat youth dressed in a long leather tunic his hair had been pulled into a braid identical to dorogas though his body was far more slender and his features far finer sharper the youths eyes were an opalescent swirl of colors rather than the dark brown of dorogas his eyes widened upon seeing them as though surprised and a chipped dagger of some dark stone seemed to leap into his hands and swept at tavis face tavi leapt back fast enough to save his eyes but not quickly enough to avoid a swift hot pain high on his cheek tavi let out a yelp as fade whimpered and jerked frantically at tavis shirt dragging him back and unceremoniously to the floor behind himself the marat blinked at them startled and then demanded something in the guttural marat speech his voice high and tavi thought perhaps nervous im sorry tavi said urn i dont understand you from the floor he showed the marat his open hands and tried to smile though he supposed it looked rather sickly fade youre standing on my sleeve the young marat scowled halflowering the knife and demanded something else this time in a differentsounding tongue he looked from tavi to fade face twisting into revulsion as he studied fades scars tavi shook his head glancing at fade who moved his foot and warily helped tavi to his feet watching the young marat with his eyes wide the tent flap opened again and doroga entered he stopped for a moment staring at tavis face the burly marat growled something in a tone that tavi recognized extremely wellthough he normally heard it from his uncle after something had gotten complicated the youth spun to face doroga hands sweeping behind his back and hiding the knife doroga scowled and rumbled something that made color flush the youths cheeks the youth snapped something back to which doroga replied with an unmistakable negative slash of his hand together with the word gnah the youth thrust up his chin defiantly snapped something in terse terms and darted out of the tent past dorogas reach moving as quickly as a frightened squirrel doroga lifted a hand and rubbed at the side of his face with it then faced tavi and fade the marat studied them both with his dark eyes and grunted my apologies for the behavior of my whelp kitai i am called doroga i am the headman of the sabotha of the gargant clan you are alerans and my prisoners you are the enemy of the marat and we will partake of your strength fade whimpered in his throat and clutched at tavis arm hard enough to make it go numb you mean tavi asked after a moments silence that youre going to eat us i do not wish to doroga said but such is the decree of clanchief atsurak he paused for a moment eyes focused on tavi and said unless this judgment is contested by our laws you will give your strength to our people do you understand tavi didnt he shook his head doroga nodded listen to me valleyboy wethemarat prepare to move against the alerans of the bridge valley our law calls you enemy no one speaks otherwise so long as you are enemy of the marat you will be our enemy and we will hunt you and take you he leaned forward speaking slowly so long as no one speaks otherwise tavi blinked slowly wait he said what if someone says that im not an enemy doroga smiled showing his teeth again then he said we must hold trial before the one and discover who is correct what if i say were not your enemy doroga nodded and stepped back out of the tent you understand enough come outside valleyboy come out before the one chapter tavi glanced back at fade and then followed doroga out of the tent and into the blinding light of the first day of winter sunlight poured through crystalline skies to blaze over the snow that covered the ground in an almost perfect layer of white it took tavis eyes long seconds to adjust and for him to squint around him as he emerged from the tent fade clutching at his arm they stood among hundreds of marat marat men most of them as heavily built as doroga sat at cooking fires or watched casually hands near the hafts of spears or on chippedstone daggers or furyforged aleran blades like doroga they wore only a brief loincloth despite the weather and evinced no signs of discomfort though some of them wore cloaks of hide and fur that seemed more ornamental or martial than made with the intention of keeping their owners warm or dry children ran here and there dressed in the same long leather tunic dorogas whelp had worn and watched the strangers with obvious interest to tavis astonishment the women wore nothing more than the men and lean muscular legs naked strong shoulders and arms and other things a proper aleran boy was not supposed to see but wanted to anyway abounded tavi felt his face flush and he shielded his eyes furiously trying to pretend it was still the sun in them one of the young warriors nearby made a quiet comment and that same coughing laughter resounded around the camp which tavi saw was arranged down the slope of a long bald hill he felt himself flush further yet and glanced at fade the slave stood beside him no expression on his face his eyes somewhat distantbut he put his hand on tavis shoulder and squeezed as though reassuring himself that the boy was there doroga stood patiently waiting and then nodded toward the crest of the hill he started that way himself clearly expecting to be followed tavi glanced around them at the young warriors who watched him with studied disinterest and fingered their weapons tavi moved his eyes to where a couple of older marat women were chatting to one another and piling up wood beneath a roasting spit one of them turned to tavi and squinted at him holding up a weathered thumb then compared it to the length of the spit tavi swallowed and hurried up the hill after doroga fade close at hand at the top of the hill stood a dozen huge stones the size of a small house arranged in a loose circle some leaning upon others they were rounded any rough edges filed away by the winds and rains and seasons but had obdurately resisted the elements with no cracks apparent in their surfaces at the center of the stones was a pool with seven white stones spaced around it upon two of the stones sat marat tavi was struck at once by the difference in their appearance doroga huge and solid paced around to one of the stones on the way there he passed a lean marat woman her pale hair shaved on the sides to leave only a long silky mane atop her head she too wore only a loincloth though more than her nakedness tavi noted an aleran cavalry saber riding a legionissue belt at her hip and three badges tarnished silver falcons which spangled the belt her skin was shades darker than most of the marat and seemed weathered and tough and her dark eyes were cool appraising as doroga passed her she lifted a hand and the chief of the gargant clan lightly rapped his knuckles against hers doroga settled on the next rock folded his hands and glowered at the third marat on the hilltop tavi turned his attention to him the man was of moderate height and lean build his hair though maratpale grew in a wild bristling mane that fell to his shoulders and continued to sprout from his skin down past his ears and along the lines of his jaw his eyes were an odd shade of pale grey almost silver and he held himself with a slow restless tension the marat caught tavi looking at him and narrowed his eyes baring his teeth tavi blinked to see huge ripping canines more properly called fangs in the marats mouth a snarl bubbled from his throat and the man halfrose from his stone doroga rose and spat will the headman of the drahgaha defile the peace of the horto the fangtoothed marat glared from tavi to doroga his voice came out as a bubbling growl low harsh hardly understandable could a wolf speak tavi thought it would sound like this the headman of the sabotha has already defiled its sanctity with these outsiders doroga smiled the horto welcomes all who come in peace his smile widened a touch though perhaps i am mistaken do you believe that this is the case skagara the woman said without rising i believe he thinks you mistaken doroga skagara snarled toward the woman his eyes flickering warily between her and doroga stay out of this hashat i need neither you nor the kevrasha to tell me what i believe doroga rolled a pace toward skagara the big marat flexed his hands with an ominous crackling of knuckles this is between you and i wolf do you believe me mistaken skagara lifted his lips away from his teeth again and there was a long and tense silence on the hill at the end of it he let out a spiteful growl and looked away from doroga there is no need to bring this matter before the one enough then doroga said he continued staring at the other man and settled slowly back down onto his stone skagara mirrored him doroga then murmured we come before the one at this horto he turned his face up toward the sun eyes closing and murmured something in his own tongue the other two marat did the same speaking in a pair of distinctsounding languages silence reigned on the hilltop for the space of a score of heartbeats and then the marat together lowered their eyes again i am called doroga headman of the sabotha the gargant clan tavis captor said in formal tones i am called hashat headman of the kevrasha the horse clan stated the woman i am called skagara headman of the drahgaha the wolf clan skagara rose impatiently i see no need for this horto we have captive enemies among us let us partake of their strength and go to battle doroga nodded soberly yes these are our enemies so has spoken atsurak of the sishkrakha he turned his face to tavi and none have spoken against him tavi swallowed and stepped forward his voice shook but he forced the words out and they rang out with clarion strength among the great stones on the hilltop i am called tavi of bernardholt in the bridge valley and i say that we are no enemies of the marat there was a startled silence for the space of a breath there at the hilltop and then skagara leapt to his feet with a howl of rage from down the hill came the sudden angry shouts from dozens of throats male and female alike overridden by a chorus of the deep ringing howls of direwolves doroga came to his feet at the same time eyes blazing and though he remained silent the sudden basso bellows of dozens of gargants rolled like thunder through the winter sky in tandem with the more distant screams of uncounted horses marat sprinted to the stones at the hilltop though none of them stepped within their circle pressing close eyes wide and excited gripping weapons crowding to get close to seeand even so they split themselves into three separate groups slabshouldered heavily muscled marat of clan gargant clan wolf silent and fangtoothed and hungrylooking and clan horse tall and lean with their hair shaved into windtossed white manes the isolated hilltop transformed into the center of a seething mob excited murmurs brandished weapons and threatening glances tension and violence rode on the air like leashed lightning pentup and straining for release doroga moved then standing atop his stone and held his arms above his head silence he roared and his voice smothered sound atop the hill silence on the horto silence as a question is brought before the one tavi stared around him at the reaction his words had caused and discovered that he had turned and pressed his back to fade his limbs shook with reaction glancing over his shoulder he saw that fade had assumed that same distant expression as before eyes focused on nothing though he had clasped one arm across tavis chest fingers gripping the opposite shoulder steadily fade tavi whispered are you all right quiet tavi fade whispered back do not move silence stretched over the hill the sound of moaning wind the only noise from the corner of his eye tavi could see skagara crouched before his stone staring at tavi with something very like hatred some instinct warned tavi not to make eye contact that it would only set the marat into a killing rageand that all of clan wolf would follow their headman turning the ring of stones into a bloodspattered slaughterhouse tavi did not move he barely breathed wethemarat doroga said turning in a slow circle we are the oneandmany people under the one we prepare to march against the alerans we go to war at the words of atsurak of the sishkrakha atsurak the bloody his words spat the next words and tavi heard the insolent contempt in them atsurak the whelpkiller snarls bubbled in the throats of dozens of marat wolves on the hilltop and once again came the low harsh howls of direwolves from somewhere down the slope and out of sight doroga turned to face clan wolf without turning away from them no trace of fear showing in his face our law gives him that right if none step forward to call him mistaken to call him to the trial of blood his finger swung to point at tavi this aleran calls atsurak mistaken this aleran says that his people are no enemy of the clans he is not of the clans skagara snarled he has no voice here he stands accused with his people doroga shot back and the accused have a voice at the horto only if the headmen of the clans decide that they do said skagara i say he does not you say he does he narrowed his eyes and stared at hashat what says clan horse hashat only then unfolded from her relaxed slouch on her stone rising and facing skagara without speaking for a moment the wind tossing her mane out to the side like a banner then she turned took a step into dorogas shadow and folded her arms let the boy speak excited murmurs ran through the marat atop the hill fade tavi whispered what is happening fade shook his head dont know careful doroga turned to tavi and said speak your belief valleyboy bring it out before the one tavi swallowed he glanced back at fade and then slipped away from the slave standing as straight as he could manage he looked around the circle at the marat all staring at him with expressions of curiosity contempt hatred or hope mmy people he began and choked coughing his stomach fluttering so nervously that he abruptly became certain he was going to sick up again hah spat skagara look at him too afraid even to speak too afraid to bring what he believes before the one doroga shot the wolf headman a narroweyed glance then looked back at tavi and said valleyboy if you would speak now is the time tavi nodded swallowing a sour taste from his mouth and straightened again i am not your enemy he said his voice broke and he cleared his throat this time it came out stronger ringing clear among the stones again i am not your enemy my people have sought no quarrel with the marat since before i was born i dont know who this atsurak person isbut if he says that we want to hurt your people hes a liar the words rang among the stones and fell on an odd and puzzled silence tavi glanced over at doroga and found the gargant headman staring at him with his head cocked to one side liar doroga frowned and lowered his voice to a confidential murmur i do not believe atsurak has mated with any of yours if that is what you mean he does not lie with alerans no tavi said nervous flutters coming back into his stomach a liar hes telling lies doroga blinked again then nodded as though in sudden comprehension he raised his voice again and said you believe he speaks mistakenly yes tavi said wait no no a lie is different than a mistake but tavis words went unheeded as a shout rose up from the marat around the hilltop skagara leapt atop his rock and raised his arms for silence let him challenge let this aleran whelp test his beliefs before the one let him face the trial of blood with atsurak and end this matter skagara sneered toward tavi atsurak will split his belly open before he can scream atsurak is not here doroga said lifting his chin i am the eldest headman present and it is thus my duty to take up the challenge to atsuraks belief in his place skagaras eyes widened atsurak he said would not approve doroga bared his white teeth atsurak he repeated is not here i will defend his belief as is proper skagara growled as well the strength of doroga is well known he will break the aleran in the trial of his clan even as atsurak would do in a trial of blood that would be correct doroga said if i faced the trial myself this will not happen only you i or hashat may stand for atsurak skagara snarled unless doroga said i invoke the right of my heir to stand in my place in any trial before the one skagara stared at the gargant headman in stunned silence kitai rumbled doroga step into the horto the boy that had cut tavi before appeared nervously at the head of the crowdfrom behind the ranks of clan horse tavi noted doroga saw it as well and scowled get in here whelp kitai hesitated at the edge of the stones then hurried inside steps carrying him lightly over to stand on the ground beside dorogas stone doroga put his hand on kitais shoulder in this i ask you to stand for me will you kitai swallowed and nodded without speaking skagara snarled then draw the circle bare the contestants let the spawn of doroga show the strength of the sire the aleran is no match in a trial of strength even for your whelp doroga the trial of clan gargant is the trial of strength doroga said but kitai is not yet bound to a clan and the trial of clan fox the clan of my whelps mother is the trial of wits kitai may accept challenge in either and i decree that in this the fox trial best serves the interest of the marat hashat frowned at doroga as though she didnt fully understand but she said i second dorogas opinion let us bring the question before the one no skagara spat the fox clan is no more doroga spun toward skagara again and advanced a step on the other man his hands closed into fists with a rippling crackle of popping knuckles and his jaws bulged where he clenched them he came to a stop across the pool from the wolf headman shaking with a visible effort to restrain himself i think hashat said quietly that doroga believes you mistaken skagara i think he wishes to bring the matter before the one in the blood trial of the wolf clan skagara gave one glance to hashat and then stumbled back and off of his rock i will not forget this doroga he said voice strained high atsurak will know how you have perverted our laws for your purposes get out of my sight doroga said in a quiet dreadful voice skagara retreated behind an uneasy wall of warriors of clan wolf and down off of the hilltop uneasy talk broke out among the marat watching but doroga turned in a circle speaking to them go back down hashat and i will arrange the trial we will let the one help us decide what path we will walk the marat departed then peaceably though there continued to be much talk among them and though the wolves seemed to retreat down the hill cautiously many fangs bared low growls warning away those who came too near a few moments later tavi and fade stood with the three marat alone doroga gave his shoulders a shake and blew out a long breath very well the marat said hashat what do you think is an appropriate trial the horse headman shrugged her shoulders the usual for this horto kitai drew in a quick breath doroga grimaced you know what im trying to do the wolf is right about one thing you challenge tradition with this if not the law if you stretch things too much you will lose the support of your own clan and mine best i think if you stay close to tradition wherever you can now doroga looked at tavi then at kitai are they old enough tavi stepped forward wait just one second here i did what you said you wanted me to do doroga what have i gotten myself into hashat turned to tavi aleran you are alive and not a meal for that you should give your thanks to doroga and be silent tavi snapped i dont think so this place almost exploded today im being used i think its polite to at least tell me how and why hashat narrowed her eyes and laid a hand on the hilt of her saber but doroga shook his head no he is correct doroga moved back to his stone and sat down heavily valleyboy you have agreed to a trial of wits with kitai the victor in the trial will be considered to hold the favor of the one in the question you raised tavi frowned you mean if i win then im right and my people are not the enemy of the marat doroga grunted assent and my clan and hashats will refuse the leadership of atsurak who moves against your people tavis eyes widened youre kidding me half the marat horde just vanishes just like that he turned to look at fade his heart beginning to pound fade did you hear you havent won the trial kitai said spitting the words nor will you doroga frowned at his whelp and then said to tavi it is my wish that you should win i can take my people from this conflict but it may not be the desire of the one i know it isnt mine kitai said the young marat nodded to his father and then said to hashat is your offer still open the horse headman glanced at doroga then nodded to kitai of course kitai nodded at that and then stepped close to tavi multicolored eyes narrowed wits or strength it doesnt matter to me aleran i will beat you then he shot doroga an angry glance and stalked off down the hill tavi blinked but i would have thought hed want to help you he glanced at doroga the marat shrugged my whelp will try to defeat you as it should be it is a good trial before the one but tavi swallowed trial of wits what is it doroga said to hashat see to it that they are prepared then he turned and walked down the hill after his whelp hashat folded her arms over her chest and eyed tavi well tavi asked what am i supposed to do you will leave this night to return with the blessing of night from the valley of trees hashat said simply who returns with it first is the victor of the trial follow me the marat started off down the hill lean legs taking long steps blessing of night valley of trees right fine tavi turned to follow her but stopped as fade caught at his shirt tavi turned to the man frowning what is it tavi fade said you must not do this let me face the trial tavi blinked uh fade its a trial of wits remember fade shook his head valley of trees remember that the boy frowned turning to fade what do you remember it is what the marat call the wax forest fade looked past tavi to the retreating hashat his scarred face haunted one of you will surely die chapter fidelias stopped panting as he and aldrick emerged from the heavily forested regions northeast of bernardholt and reached the causeway that led down the valley and ultimately to garrison his feet though he had wrapped them in strips of his cloak and urged his furies to ease his way had worsened the pain alone was nearly enough to stop him even without the fatigue from too long spent walking casting back and forth in a fruitless effort to catch the wily steadholder fidelias sank onto a flat stone beside the causeway while the swordsman paced restlessly out onto the road i dont get it he said why dont you just zoom us along like before because we havent been on a road fidelias said from between clenched teeth riding an earthwave along a road is simple using one in the open countryside without intimate knowledge of the local furies is suicide so he can do it but you cant fidelias suppressed a sharp comment yes aldrick were crowbait fidelias shook his head were not going to catch him at this rate he left a halfdozen false trails behind him and waited until we bought one of them before he raised his wave and went if we had the horses we dont fidelias said bluntly he lifted his foot and unwrapped some of the cloth aldrick paced over to him he stared down at his feet and swore crows old man can you feel them yes aldrick knelt and unwrapped a bit more of the cloth assessing the injuries getting worse theres more swelling if you let this go youre going to lose them fidelias grunted theres still time we need to fidelias looked up to see etan dancing frantically in the nearest tree he cast his eyes down the road west of them aldrick fidelias said keeping his voice low two men on the road coming toward us legion haircuts both armed aldrick drew in a breath closing his eyes for a moment all right legionares no uniforms age young fidelias touched the stones of the road with one foot reaching out for vamma using the road to help them run moving fast theyve got some training in warcrafting how do we do it wait for me to say fidelias said lets find out whatever we can first he watched the pair of young men come running toward them along the road and managed a pained smile as they approached and slowed their pace morning boys he called have you got a minute to help a couple of travelers the young men slowed and fidelias took in the details as they came closer young both of themless than a score of years of age both were slender though one was tall and already seemed to be losing his hair to a receding hairline they shared similar long lean featuresbrothers perhaps both were panting though not heavily from their run along the road fidelias tried to smile again and offered them his water flask sir panted the taller of the young men accepting the flask much obliged you hurt asked the shorter he leaned a bit closer peering at fideliass feet crows youve really gotten them torn up the storm forced us off the road last night fidelias said there was a flood and i had to kick my shoes off to swim been walking without them all morning but i had to stop the young man winced ill bet he accepted the flask from his brother with a nod took a quick drink and offered it back to fidelias sir he said maybe youd better get off the road im not sure its safe here fidelias glanced at aldrick who nodded and made himself look busy redressing fideliass injured foot why do you say that son the taller of the pair answered theres been problems in the valley sir last night there was a big uprising of furieslocal furies from holders that is and my youngest brother spotted what he swears was a marat scout by our steadholtthat would be warnerholt sir a marat fidelias gave the young man a skeptical smile surely your brother was having some fun at your expense the warnerholter shook his head regardless theres been trouble in the valley sir me and my brothers came home to help my father with a local matter and it got out of hand there was a fight almost some killings and we saw smoke coming from out east near aldoholt put together with last night and this sighting we decided it would be best to put the word out fidelias blinked my so youre off to warn garrison of trouble the young man nodded grimly head back down the road the way we came a piece and look for a trail to the south it will take you to bernardholt wed best not stay here if youll pardon us sir sorry we cant help you thats all right fidelias assured him we all have a duty to do son he frowned staring at the younger of the two for a moment sir the young man asked youre about my height arent you aldrick wiped the blood from his blade and said you could at least wait until hes dead fidelias pulled the second boot from the shorter of the two men and sat down to pull them over his battered feet i dont have time im not sure that was necessary fidelias aldrick said if word is out its out doesnt seem to be much sense in killing them i didnt think youd mind fidelias said im good at killing doesnt mean i enjoy it every man enjoys doing what hes good at fidelias tightened the laces as much as he could wincing in pain it was necessary we have to stop anyone else from getting word to garrison or out the other end of the valley either but that steadholder has already got through hes only one man one report the local count wont want to commit everything based on that it will buy us time if we can keep anything else from getting through well make sure that garrison is off guard is he dead aldrick stooped over the barefooted boy for a moment hes gone you want me to signal the men yes fidelias stood up testing his weight on his feet they hurt they hurt abominably but the boots were a tolerable fit theyd hold together long enough and well have to get in touch with atsurak again things are falling apart we cant afford to wait any longer fidelias stepped over the bodies of the young men of warnerholt and glanced over his shoulder at the swordsman im starting the attack now chapter kord forced isana to watch what they did to odiana he had brought in a stool with him and he sat behind her within the ring of coals he made her sit on the floor in front of him so that they could both see as though it was some sort of theater event shes a tough one kord said after a long and sickening time knows what shes doing survivor isana suppressed the sickness in her stomach long enough to say why do you say that anything to take her mind from what was happening shes calculated there see how she fights just enough to get a man worked up then goes all liquid and helpless once hes on her she knows every man wants to think hes got that kind of power over a woman she makes them think what she wants toand shes barely been roughed up at all isana shuddered and said nothing its tough to break someone like that hardened shes a woman kord a person shes not an animal to be broken his voice carried something in it of an ugly smile has she been a slave before i dont know isana said i barely know her she saved your life you know kord said when we found you by the river i made her do it isana looked back at him and tried to keep the venom from her voice why kord dont get me wrong isana it isnt that i dont enjoy the thought of you dead i could be happy with that his eyes didnt waver from the scene before them glittering with something dark angry alien but my son is dead because of you and that mandates something more substantial dead isana said she blinked slowly kord you have got to understand this isnt about you it isnt about the hearing or warners daughter the crows it isnt kord said because of you we had to go to bernardholt because of you we had to run out into the storm because of you we had to watch and make sure no one went running to gram for helpand sure enough that little freak of yours did because of you bittan died he looked down at her showing his teeth well now im the strong one now im the one making the rules and im going to show you isana how low a woman can be brought before i finish what the river started isana turned to him kord dont you understand we could all be in danger bernard saw he struck her with a closed fist the blow drove her back and to the floor her body helplessly loose and unresponsive after a disorienting moment the pain started rippling up from her mouth her cheek she tasted blood on her tongue where shed cut herself on her own teeth kord leaned down and seized her hair jerking her face up to his dont speak to me like youre some kind of person you arent any more youre just meat now he gave her head a vicious little shake you understand that i understand isana grated that youre a little man kord she dragged in a breath enough to make the words cut you cant look past yourself not even when something is coming to crush you youre small no matter what you do to me youll still be small a coward who hurts slaves because hes afraid to challenge anyone stronger she met his eyes and whispered youve got me because you found me helpless youd never be able to do anything to me if you hadnt because youre nothing kords eyes flashed he snarled a mindlessly animal sound and hit her again harder stars flew across her vision and the dusty floor rose up to meet her she wasnt sure how long she lay there pain and thirst blinding her making her unaware of anything else but when she came to her senses again and sat up only kord and his son aric remained odiana lay in a heap on the floor not far away curled onto her side her legs drawn up her hair hiding her face kord tossed a flask down beside isana it made a soft slight gurgling sound as though it held only a tiny bit of water go ahead he told her nothing in that one i want you to see what happens isana took up the flask throat burning she didnt believe that kord had told her the truth but she felt faint weak and her throat felt as though it had been coated with salt she pulled the cap from it and drank almost before she realized what she was doing water warm but untainted flowed into her mouth half a cup perhapscertainly no more it was gone before it had done much to help her thirst but at least it had eased the maddening ache of it she lowered the flask looking up at kord aric kord said bring me the box aric turned toward the door but hesitated pa maybe shes right i mean with what tavi said at the river and all boy kord snarled cutting him off you bring me that box and keep your mouth shut you hear aric went pale and swallowed yes pa he turned and vanished from the smokehouse kord turned back to her the thing about all of this isana is that youre too naive to be as afraid as you should be i want to help you with that i want you to know whats going to happen this is useless kord isana said you might as well kill me when im ready kord walked over to odiana then reached down and seized her casually by the hair the woman whimpered and twisted her shoulders struggling feebly to get away from him kord gathered her hair up lock by lock until he held the length of it in his fist see this one here shes a hard case knows what shes doing knows the game how to survive it he shook her hair eliciting a whimper all the right sounds to make right girl with odianas face bowed facing away from kord isana could see her expression now the water witchs eyes were hard her expression cold distant but she kept her voice weak shaking pplease odiana whispered master dont hurt me please ill do anything you want thats right kord rumbled smiling down at the woman you will aric opened the door and entered carrying a long flat box of smooth polished wood open it kord told him let her see aric swallowed then he paced around in front of where kord held odiana by the hair and opened the box isana saw the contents a strip of metal a band perhaps an inch wide lay on the cloth within the box dully throwing back the light of the fires odianas expression changed the hardness vanished from her eyes and her mouth dropped open in an expression of something close to horror she recoiled from the box but was brought up short by kords grip on her isana heard her let out a whimper of pain and unmistakably of fear no she said at once her voice suddenly harsher high panicky no i dont need that you wont need it no dont i promise you wont need it just tell me what you want its called a discipline collar kord said to isana in a conversational voice furycrafted theyre uncommon this far north but useful sometimes she knows what it is i think you dont need it odiana said her voice high and desperate please oh furies please master you dont need that i dont need it no no no no aric put it on her kord jerked odiana up holding her weight up off the floor by her hair forcing her chin up the slender strength of her throat to be exposed odianas eyes still fastened on the collar widened white surrounding them she screamed it was a horrible sound one that welled deep in her throat and rose up through her mouth without regard for meaning for shape horrible and feral she turned and struggled even as she screamed her hands reaching toward kords face with desperate speed her nails left bloody weals down one of his cheeks and even as she got her feet underneath her she kicked one bare foot at the inside of his knee still holding her hair in one hand kord dragged her to one side off of her feet and with the other clutched her throat then with a casual surge of power doubtless drawn from his fury he lifted her clear of the ground by her throat so that her feet dangled and kicked below her torn skirts she fought him even so struggling wildly against him she raked at his arm with her nails when she couldnt reach his face but he held her expression never changing she kicked at his thigh his ribs but without any leverage the blows did nothing to deter the big steadholder she struggled grunting gasping making low animal sounds of fear then her eyes rolled back in her skull and she went slowly limp kord held her suspended for a moment more before he lowered her to the floor again and once more held her by the hair baring her throat aric the young man swallowed he flicked a glance at isana his expression strained difficult to read then he stepped forward and slipped the metal band about odianas throat it settled into place with a quiet sharp click she took a ragged breath and let out a little groan a desperate sound even as kord released her hair with a contemptuous jerk she fell onto her side her eyes clutched closed and lifted her fingers to her throat she began pawing and jerking at the collar desperate and clumsy kord drew a knife from his belt and pricked his thumb with it then grabbed odianas wrist in his huge hands and did the same to hers her eyes opened and saw him and once again she went wild letting out a little shriek and struggling against him with a confused and disoriented determination kord smirked with casual strength he forced her bloodied thumb to the collarand then pressed his own down beside it scarlet marking the metal odiana whimpered no frustration warping the word tears making her eyes shine then she shuddered her lips moved again but nothing intelligible came from them she shuddered again and her eyes lost focus her body relaxed the straining against kords hands easing slowly away once more her body shook this time accompanying it was a low gasp bonding kord said looking up at isana his eyes glittered his hands roved over the woman on the ground now casually intimate possessive this will take a few minutes to set in odiana gasped arching into kords touch her eyes empty lips parted her body moving in a slow languid roll all hips and back and bared throat the collar gleamed against her skin kord sat over her petting the woman like an overexcited animal in a few moments she was making soft cooing sounds curling toward him like a sleepy kitten there he stood up and said casually thats a good girl odianas eyes flew open wide then fluttered slowly closed again she gasped clutching her arms to her chest as though to hold something in and for perhaps half a minute she writhed that way letting out soft moans of unmistakable pleasure kord smiled he looked at isana and said quietly stupid little whore odianas body convulsed back abruptly arching into a bow she let out another screamthis one thin high somehow sickenedand flung herself onto her side she retched violently though there was little enough content in her stomach to come up onto the dusty floor her legs and arms jerked in frantic spasm and she lifted huge desperate eyes to isana her expression agonized pleading she reached toward the collar at her throat and spasmed again more violently thrashing and flailing and rolling dangerously close to the circle of coals isana stared at the woman in horrified confusion for a breath before she lurched forward unsteady herself and caught odiana before she could convulse into the ring of coals stop it isana cried she looked back at kord knew that her face was pale and desperately afraidand saw the glitter of satisfaction in his expression when she turned to him stop it youre killing her might be kinder kord said shes been broken before but to odiana he said voice smug good girl stay here and youll be a good girl do what youre told the frantic spasms eased out of the woman very slowly isana drew her back away from the coals and kept her arms around her her body between odiana and kord the womans eyes had lost focus again and she shuddered in slow waves in isanas arms what did you do to her isana asked quietly kord turned and walked toward the door what you need to learn is that slaves are just animals you train an animal by providing rewards and punishments rewarding good behavior punishing bad thats how you turn a wild horse into an obedient mount how you train a wolf into a hunting hound he opened the door and said casually same with slaves youre just more animals to be used for labor breeding whatever you just have to be trained kord left the smokehouse but his words drifted back to them aric build up the fire isana youll wear one tomorrow think about that isana said nothing stunned by what she had seen by odianas reaction to the sight of the collar to her condition now isana looked down at her and brushed some of the dark tangled hair from her eyes are you all right the woman looked up at her eyes heavy and languid and shivered its good now its good im good now isana swallowed he hurt you before when he called you she didnt say the words hurts odiana whispered yes oh crows and furies so much hurt id forgotten forgotten how bad it was she shivered again hhow good it was she opened her eyes and again they were wet with tears they can change you you can fight and fight but they change you make you happy to be what they want make it hurt when you try to resist you change holdgirl he can do it to you he can make you beg him to take you to touch you make you she turned her face away though her body was still wracked with the long shivering shudders of pleasure and turned her face from isana please please kill me before he comes back i cant be that again i cant go back shhhh isana said rocking the woman gently shhhh rest you should sleep please she whispered but her face had already gone slack her body begun to sag please she shuddered once more and then went completely limp her head falling to one side isana laid the woman down as gently as she could she knelt over her testing her pulse putting a hand to her forehead her heart still beat too quickly and her skin felt fevered dry isana looked up to where aric stood next to a hod for coal watching her when she looked up at him he ducked his head turning to the hod and began to dump coals into a bucket beside it she needs water isana said quietly after all of that she needs water or shell die in this heat aric looked at her again he picked up the bucket and without speaking walked to one side of the ring and started shaking fresh coals out of it and into the fire isana ground her teeth with frustration if she was only able to listen she might be able to gain important insight the boy seemed reluctant to follow his fathers commands he might be convinced to help them if only she could find the right words to say she felt blind crippled aric listen to me isana said you cant possibly think hes going to get away with this you cant possibly think that he will escape justice for what happened tonight he finished dumping out the bucket he walked back to the hod his voice toneless hes escaped it for years what do you think happens to every slave who comes through here isana stared at him for a moment sickened crows she whispered aric please at least help me get this collar off she reached down to odianas throat turning the collar about and trying to find the clasp dont aric said his voice quick harsh dont youll kill her isanas fingers froze she looked up at him aric chewed on his lip then said pas blood is on it hes the only one can take it off her how can i help her you cant aric said his voice frustrated he turned and threw the bucket at the wall of the smokehouse it clattered against it and fell to the floor he leaned his hands against the wall and bowed his head you cant help her the way hes left her anyone can tell her anything and shell keep feeling good as long as she does it she tries to resist and shell and it will hurt her thats inhuman isana said great furies aric how can you let this happen shut up he said just you shut up motions stiff angry he pushed off the wall and recovered the bucket and started filling it with coal again you were right you know isana said keeping her voice quiet i was telling the truth so was tavi if he told you that the valley was in danger that the marat may be coming again it could happen soon it could have begun already aric please listen to me he dumped more coal out onto the fires and returned to gather up more you have to get word out for your own sake if not for ours if the marat come theyll kill everyone of kordholt too youre lying he told her not looking at her youre just lying trying to save your hide im not isana said aric youve known me your whole life when that tree fell on you that winterfair i helped you i helped everyone in the valley who needed it and i never asked for anything in return aric added more coal to the fire how can you be a part of this she demanded you arent stupid aric how can you do this to other alerans how can i not aric said voice cold this is all i have i dont have a happy steadholt where people take care of each other i have this men who no one else would take live here women who no one would want to be hes my blood bittan he broke off and swallowed he was my blood too as stupid and mean as he could be he was my brother im sorry isana said and found that she felt it i never wanted anyone to get hurt i hope you know that i know aric said you heard what happened to heddy and you wanted what was right to happen to keep her safe and girls like her crows know they need it with pa around like some he shook his head isana fell silent for a long moment staring at the young man an understanding dawning on her then she said quietly it wasnt bittan that was with heddy it was you aric he didnt look at her he didnt speak it was you thats why she was trying to draw her father back from juris macto with yours she wasnt raped aric rubbed at the back of his neck we we liked each other got together when there was a meet or a fair her little brother found us too young to know what he saw i got out before he seen who i was but he went running to her father and how could she tell him shed been making time with one of kords sons he spat the words with disgust she didnt say much i guess and her old man made up his own mind what happened oh furies isana said sadly aric why didnt you say anything say what aric said flicking a hard glance at her tell my father that i loved a girl and wanted to marry her bring her here he gestured around the smokehouse with one hand or maybe i should have been all honorable and went to her father do you think he would have listened to me do you think for a second warner wouldnt have strangled me where i stood isana rubbed a shaking hand at her eyes im sorry aric im sorry weve all known that your father was that hed gone too far but we didnt do anything we didnt know things were this bad at his steadholt too late for all of that now aric dropped the bucket and headed for the door its not isana said wait just listen to me aric please he stopped his back still to her you know him she said hell kill us but if you help us get out ill help you i swear by all the furies ill help you get away if you want to ill help you settle things with warner if you do love the girl you might be able to be with her if you do the right thing help both of you that woman was trying to kill you last

stop him arics voice was tired you cant not here hes a citizen thats right and so is my brother bernard will call him to juris macto and hell win too we both know that she stood up facing aric and lifted her chin break the circle bring me water help us escape there was silence for a long moment hed kill me aric said then his voice numb hes said so before i believe him bittan was his favorite hed kill me and hed get the whole story and hed get heddy too not if we stop him aric it doesnt have to be this way help me let me help you i cant he said he looked back at her and said quietly isana i cant im sorry im sorry for you and for that girl but hes my only blood hes a monster but hes all i have the young man turned and left shutting the door to the smokehouse behind him isana heard several heavy bolts sliding shut on the outside thunder rumbled somewhere in the distance a growling sleepy leftover of the previous nights tempest inside the smokehouse the coals popped and simmered odiana breathed slowly quietly isana bowed her head staring at the woman at the collar about her throat she remembered odianas frantic pleas to kill her isana lifted her hand to her own throat and shivered then she sank back to the ground her head bowed chapter amaras ankle burned and ached and she fought to keep her labored breathing from turning into a panting gasp bernard running through the ice and snowcovered trees several yards ahead of her reached a small rise and vanished down the other side she followed him stumbling at the last pace and threw herself into the ditch behind the little rise with a crunching of snow and frozen leaves bernard put his hand on her back steadying her and lifted a hand to hold it in front of her mouth and block the wisps of vapor escaping with each exhalation his eyes went distant and then she felt him pull the veil over them shadows shifted and changed in subtle patterns over her skin as the trees around them sighed and rustled as though in a wind the frozen brush did not seem to move so much as to have simply grown into a screen over them and the sudden scent of earth and crushed plants flooded over them veiling even that much evidence of their presence only a few seconds later they heard hoof falls in the forest behind them and amara moved enough to peer over the rise at the direction in which theyd come wont they see our tracks she whispered in a rough gasp of breath bernard shook his head his face drawn weary no he whispered trees lost some leaves in some places grass stirred enough to move the snow in others and its all ice sleet shadows are helping hide more amara sunk slowly back down behind the rise frowning at him are you all right tired he said and closed his eyes theyre knights their furies are on unfamiliar ground but theyre strong starting to have trouble misdirecting them fidelias has pulled out all the stops if hes started a general hunt for us that means hell accelerate the plans for attack as well how close are we to garrison few hundred yards to the edge of the trees bernard said then half a mile of open ground anything at this end of the valley will be able to see us can you earthwave us across it bernard shook his head tired can we run it not with your leg bernard said and with them mounted theyd just ride us down and spit us amara nodded and waited until the sound of the riders had drifted away from them off in another direction half a mile if it comes to that i might be able to carry us those riders are using earth furies yes bernard nodded some wood either way well be away from them in the open and in the air and if they have knights aeris with them ill just have to be faster amara said she squinted up i still havent seen anyone it would be a strain to hold position overhead with so little wind unless they were so high in the air that the clouds were giving them coverand that would hide us as well bernard shivered and touched the ground with one hand hold on his voice had a strained note to it and he let his breath out again a moment later with a low groan in it theyre close we cant stay here any longer the earth is too hard difficult to hide us im ready amara said bernard nodded opening his eyes his face set in lines of grim and weary determination they rose and headed through the woods it only took a few moments to get to the end of the trees and to the open ground that led up to garrison the place was a fortress there two of the mountains that rose up all around them fell together into an enormous v at the point of the valley between them lay the grim grey walls of garrison stretching across the mouth of the valley and blocking entry into it from the lands beyond with expansive grim efficiency the wall stretched across the mouth of the valley from the marat lands beyond twenty feet high and nearly as thick all of smooth grey stone its walls surmounted by parapets and crenelation the gleaming forms of armored legionares stood at regular posts along the wall draped in cloaks of scarlet and gold the colors of the high lord of riva behind the wall stood the rest of garrison a blocky fortress laid out in a legion square with tenfoot walls a marching camp constructed of stone rather than of wood and earth fewer guards stood on the walls there though they were not absent outbuildings had grown up around the outside of garrison impermanent and slapdash structures that nonetheless had somehow managed to acquire the air of solidity that accompanied a small town the rear gates of garrison stood open and the causeway wound across the valley and up to them people drifted around walking briskly from building to building and moving in and out of the gates to the camp proper children scampered around in the ice and snow playing as they always did amara could see dogs horses a pen of sheep and the smoke of dozens of fires theres the gate she said right said bernard we head for that i know the men stationed out here for the most part we shouldnt have any trouble getting to gram just remember be polite and respectful all right amara said impatient i mean it bernard said grams got a quick temper and hes more than capable of tossing us into holding cells until he cools off dont test him i wont amara said can you tell if theyre getting any closer to us bernard shook his head grimacing then we go across keep your eyes open and if you see anyone coming well get into the air amara glanced across the plain and swept her eyes across the sky one last time winced as she put weight on her injured ankle and started off toward garrison at a limping lope bernard shuffled along several paces behind her his footsteps heavy the run seemed to take forever and amara nearly twisted her ankle again more than once as she turned her head this way and that watching for pursuit but for all their fear of being ridden down in the open ground they reached the outbuildings and then the guarded gates to garrison itself without incident a pair of young legionares stood on guard at the gates their expressions bored heavy cloaks worn against the cold spears held negligently in gloved hands one of them was unshaven strictly against legion regulations amara knew and the other wore a cloak that did not seem to be of standard legion issue either its fabric finer its colors unmatched hold said the unshaven guard in a flat tone state your name and purpose of your visit amara deferred to bernard glancing back at the steadholder bernard frowned at the two men where is centurion giraldi the one in the cloak gave bernard a blank look hey he said clodhopper in case you didnt notice were the soldiers here and citizens put in the other in a surly tone and citizens the guard in the fine cloak said so well ask the questions if thats all right with you state your name and the purpose of your visit bernard narrowed his eyes i suppose you boys are new to the valley i am steadholder bernard and i am here to see count gram both soldiers broke out in snickers yes well the unshaven one said the count is a busy man he doesnt have time for visiting with every scruffy clodhopper about every little problem that comes up bernard took a deep breath i understand that he said nonetheless i am well within my rights to request to see him immediately on a matter of urgency to his holdings the unshaven guard shrugged you arent a citizen clodhopper you dont have any rights that i know of amaras temper flashed her patience evaporating we do not have time for this she snapped she turned to the guard in the fine cloak and said garrison could be in danger of attack we need to warn gram about it and let him react as he thinks fit the guards glanced at each other and then at amara look at that the unshaven one drawled a girl and here i thought that was just a skinny boy his partner leered i suppose we could always take off those breeches and find out bernard narrowed his eyes the steadholders fist lashed out and the young legionare in the fine cloak landed in a senseless sprawl on the snow his unshaven partner blinked down at the unconscious young man and then up at bernard he reached for his spear but bernard spoke sharply and the weapons haft bowed then straightened again writhing out of the guards reach and bounding away the guard let out a short shriek and reached for his dagger bernard stepped close to the young man and clutched his wrist holding his hand at his belt son dont be stupid youd best go get your superior officer you cant do that the guard sputtered ill throw you in irons i just did it bernard said and if you dont want me to do it again youll go get your centurion then he gave the young man a stiff shove sending him clattering backward and falling into the snow at the base of the wall the guard swallowed and then bolted running inside amara looked from the guard in the snow to bernard and asked polite and respectful eh bernards face flushed they might be spoiled city boys but theyre legion by the furies they should treat women with more respect he rubbed at his hair and show more respect to a steadholder i suppose amara smiled but didnt say anything bernard flushed even brighter and coughed looking away the unshaven guard emerged from the guardhouse with a halfdressed centurion a young man little older than him the centurion blinked stupidly at bernard for a minute then gave the guard a terse order before stumbling back into the guardhouse to march off a moment later still only halfdressed several legionares gathered around the gate and to bernards relief he recognized a few of the men from previous visits to garrison a few moments later a grizzled old man dressed in a civilian tunic but with the bearing and mien of a soldier came walking briskly out of the gates wisps of white hair drifting around his bald pate steadholder bernard he said critically eyeing the steadholder you dont look so good he made no particular comment about the condition of the guard lying in the snow leaning down to rest his fingertips lightly on the young mans temples healer harger bernard responded did i hit him too hard cant hit a head that thick too hard harger muttered then cackled oh hell have a headache when he wakes up ive been waiting for this to happen new recruits harger stood up and paid little further attention to the young guard in the snow the better part of two whole cohorts down from riva herself citizens sons almost all of them not enough sense to carry salt in a storm among the whole lot bernard grimaced i need to get to gram fast harger harger frowned tilting his head to one side and studying bernard whats happened get me to gram bernard said harger shook his head grams been indisposed amara blinked hes sick harger snorted sick of rich boys who expect to be treated like invalids instead of legionares maybe he shook his head youll have to talk to his truthfinder bernard olivia get her on down here no harger said and grimaced liwies youngest came to term and she went back to riva to help with the birth now weve got centurion bawled a high nasal voice whats going on down here who is in charge of this gate what foolishness is this harger rolled his eyes weve got pluvus pentius instead good luck bernard harger stooped down and scooped up the unconscious young legionare tossing him over one shoulder with a grunt and then headed back inside the fort pluvus pentius turned out to be a slight young man with watery blue eyes and a decided overbite he wore the crimson and gold of a rivan officer though his uniform tended to sag around the shoulders and stretched a bit over the belly the officer slouched toward them through the snow squinting in disapproval now see here pluvus said i dont know who you people are but assaulting a soldier on duty is a realm offense he drew a sheaf of papers from his tunic and peered at them flipping through several pages then he turned and looked around him yes here it is a realm offense centurion arrest both of them and see them to the holding cells excuse me bernard interrupted but theres a more important matter at hand sir i am steadholder bernard and it is vital that i speak to count gram at once pluvus blinked up at them excuse me bernard repeated himself pluvus frowned highly irregular he consulted his pages again no i dont think the count is receiving petitions today he holds a regular court every week and all such matters are to be presented to him then and in writing at least three days ahead of time theres no time for that bernard blurted its vital to the safety of this valley that we speak to him at once you are his truthfinder arent you surely you can tell that were being honest with you pluvus froze peering up at amara over the pages he looked from her to bernard and back are you challenging my authority here farmer i assure you that i am fully qualified and can amara flashed bernard a warning glance sir please we just need to see gram pluvus drew himself up stiffly his lips pressed together impossible he stated flatly court is two days hence but we have not received a written petition to be filed for that date therefore you will have to submit your petition to me in lets see no more than six days time in order to be received by the count at next weeks courtand that is a matter entirely separate from an assault upon a legionareand a citizen at that centurion take them mto custody an older soldier with several younger legionares behind him stepped forward toward bernard sir under the authority vested in me by my rank and at the order of my commanding officer i place you under arrest please surrender your weapons and cease and desist any current furycraftings and accompany me to the holding cells where you will be incarcerated and your case brought before the count bernard growled and set his jaw fine he said and flexed his fists have it your way maybe a few more broken heads will get me to see gram that much faster the legionares came toward bernard but the centurion hesitated frowning steadholder he said carefully this shouldnt have to get ugly pluvus rolled his eyes centurion arrest this man and his companion you have no idea how much paperwork i have to do already my time is precious bernard amara said and laid a hand on his shoulder wait bernard faced the oncoming soldiers his brow darkening and the ground let out a faint tremble the soldiers stopped in their tracks their expressions nervous come on the big steadholder growled i havent got all day get out of my way thundered a voice from within the gates amara blinked startled at the tone a man in a rumpled and wine stained shirt thrust his way through the crowd watching the altercation he wasnt tall but had a barrel for a chest and a jaw that looked heavy and hard enough to break stones upon covered by a curling beard of fiery red his hair shorn short was of a similar color though patchy with batches of grey that made his scalp look like a battleground with troops in scarlet struggling to hold terrain against a greyclad foe his eyes were deep under heavy brows bloodshot and angry he walked barefoot in the snow and steam curled up from his footprints what in the name of all the furies is going on here he demanded voice booming bernard flame and thunder man what the crows do you think youre doing to my garrison oh said pluvus his pages fluttering nervously sir i didnt know you were out of bed yet that is sir i didnt know that youd be up today i was just taking care of this for you the man came to a swaying halt and planted his fists on his hips he glared at pluvus and then at bernard harger woke me out of a perfectly good stupor for this he snapped so it had better be good yes sir im sure that is pluvus waved a hand at the centurion arrest them go on now you heard the count i didnt say to arrest anyone growled count gram testily he squinted at bernard and then at amara his gaze sharp penetrating for all his bawling and staggering did you get yourself another woman bernard crows its about time ive always said theres nothing wrong with you that a good romp or two wouldnt take care of amara felt her cheeks flush with warmth no sir she said its not that the steadholder helped to see me safely here so that i could warn you highly irregular pluvus stuttered to gram pages fluttering gram irritably took the pages from pluvuss hand and said quit waving these under my nose there was a bright flash of light and heat and then fine black ashes drifted away on the cool wind pluvus let out a little yelp of distress now then gram said dusting his hands warn me warn me about what the marat bernard said theyre on the move sir i think theyre coming here gram grunted he jerked his chin at amara and who are you cursor amara sir amara felt herself lift her chin and met grams bloodshot gaze squarely without flinching cursor gram muttered he glared at pluvus you were going to arrest one of the first lords cursors pluvus stammered one of my steadholders pluvus stuttered bah growled gram ninny bring the garrison to full alert recall all soldiers on leave and instruct every man to get into his armor and fighting gear now pluvus stared but gram had already swept back around to bernard how bad are you thinking its going to be send word to riva bernard said quietly gram clenched his jaw you want me to call for a full mobilization is that what im hearing yes do you know what kind of fire is going to fall on my ears if youre wrong bernard nodded gram growled scouts deploy scouts and reconnaissance into the wilderness and make immediate contact with our watchtowers yyes sir pluvus said gram stared at him for a second then roared now pluvus jumped and then turned to the nearest soldier and started repeating versions of grams orders gram rounded on bernard now then i think youd better explain what kind of idiot you are hitting one of my soldiers a gliding caress of cold air slid over the back of amaras neck and made her shivera warning from cirrus she glanced behind her out toward the blinding white of pale sunlight on snow and ice she shaded her eyes but saw nothing cirrus stirred against her again another warning amara took a slow breath focusing on the area behind them she almost didnt see through the veil there perhaps no more than ten feet away was a disturbance in the air several feet off the ground a rippling dance of light like waves rising from a sunheated stone her breath caught in her throat and she sent cirrus out toward the disturbance with a whispered command her fury encountered a globe of dense air changed to bend light much as she herself used it to view things from afar in greater clarity amara took a breath and then forced cirrus against the globe sudden and quick there was a whoosh of expanding air as she dispersed the globe and abruptly three men in armor with drawn swords appeared hovering in the air amara cried out and the men their expressions startled hesitated for a faltering second before acting one flicked himself through the air toward her sword gleaming amara threw herself to one side sweeping her hands at the man to direct cirrus a roar of sudden wind washed up against her attackers flank shoving him wide of her guiding his course into one of garrisons stone walls the man tried to slow his advance but collided hard with the wall and dropped the blade in the impact the second of the men expression cool calm thrust his hands forward and a gale rose up immediately before the gates of garrison whirling snow and chips of ice into the air in a stinging cloud and hurling legionares from their feet driving them behind the gates for shelter the third took his sword in hand and shot toward bernards back amara tried to cry out a warning but bernards fatigue perhaps had made him too slow he turned and tried to dodge to one side but snow and ice betrayed his footing and he fell gram stepped in the way the flamehaired count jerked the sword from the stunned pluvuss belt and met the oncoming knight aeris headon steel chimed on steel and then the attacker shot on past gram get on your feet gram roared he spat as the snow and ice clouded his vision get the girl get inside the walls gram turned his body against the icy spray and shielded his palm against his side amara saw sudden fire kindle there and gram turned toward the second of the attackers and hurled a sudden roaring wall of flame back against the ice and snow the attacker screamed a horrible sound and the gale abruptly vanished something black and heavy fell smoking into the snow before the gates and the odor of charred meat filled the air amara dashed to bernards side helping the steadholder to his feet she didnt see the man who had attacked her until it was almost too late he rose and drew a knife from his belt eyes focused on her with a flick of his wrist and a sudden pinpoint burst of air the knife hurtled toward her whistling with its raw speed bernard saw it too and dragged her down out of the path of the knife it hit gram in the lower back such was the force of the furyassisted throw that gram was hurled several paces forward into the snow he went down at once without so much as a cry or a gasp of pain and lay still someone on the walls cried a command and a pair of legionares with bows loosed at the man at the base of the wall from almost directly above him arrows struck him hard one in the thigh and one in back of the neck its bloody tip emerging from the mans throat he too fell into the snow blood staining a quickly growing scarlet pool around him wheres the other one amara demanded she stood and swept her eyes over the sky she barely saw from the corner of her eye another flickering of light and air but when she focused on it it was gone tentatively she sent cirrus out toward it but her fury found nothing and after questing about aimlessly for a few moments amara gave up the effort its no good she whispered he got away bernard grunted and rose to his feet one leg held stiffly his face twisted with pain gram they turned to see pluvus and several legionares hovering over grams form in the snow the truthfinders face was pale healer he screamed someone get the healer the count is hurt get the healer legionares stood around him stunned staring amara let out a hiss of frustration and grabbed the nearest soldier you she said go get the healer now the man gave a nod and sprinted off you pluvus said his face twisted with distress anger and fear i dont know who those men were or what is going on but you must be in on it you came here to hurt the count this is your fault are you mad amara demanded those men were the enemy you have got to get this garrison ready to fight you cannot order me about like some kind of common slave woman shouted pluvus centurion he snapped eyes watering but with his voice ringing with authority you all saw what happened arrest these two and take them to the cells on charges of murder and treason against the crown chapter despite her exhaustion isana could not sleep she spent the night holding odianas head in her lap monitoring the womans fever with little else she could do for her pale light came through chinks in the walls of the smokehouse when a grey winter dawn rose over kordholt isana could hear animals outside men talking crude laughter despite the cold air drifting in from without the interior of the smokehouse remained broiling the ring of coals around the two women glowing with sullen heat her throat parched before began to simply ache agonizing and at times it felt as though she could not get enough air into her lungs so that she swayed and had trouble sitting up once when odiana tossed restlessly isana rose and went to the far side of the ring of coals her head spinning with heat and thirst she gathered her skirts and made to step over the coals a short leap to the far sideeven though she knew the door would be locked and bolted there might be a loose board in the wall or something she could use as a weapon in order to make an attempt at escape even as she lifted her foot though the ground on the far side of the coals stirred and the swift heavy form of kords fury rose up from the ground misshapen and hideous isanas breath caught in her throat and she lowered her foot again the malformed fury subsided and sank slowly back into the earth isana clenched her fists in her skirts frustrated then moved back over to odiana and took the womans head onto her lap again in her sleep the collared woman whimpered and stirred languidly her eyes rolling beneath their lids as she dreamt once she let out a pathetic cry and flinched and her hands spasmed toward the collar even in the womans dreams it appeared kords collar continued its assault on her senses her will isana shuddered the light waned shadows shifting over the floor by infinitely slow degrees isana let her head fall forward her eyes closed her stomach turned and twisted with worry tavi and bernard and fade where were they if they were alive why hadnt bernard followed her here had the ones attacking them been too much for her brother to handle bernard would never allow her to remain in kords handsnot while he lived could he be dead could the boy be dead as well surely he had escaped ahead of the flood surely he had evaded anyone who may have pursued him even after surely isana shook and gave no voice to the sobs that racked her no tears would fall her body had hoarded back all the moisture it could she longed for the freedom to weep at least but she did not have it she drifted that way head bowed sweltering and dizzy and thought of bernard and of tavi the grey of twilight was in the air when the bolt at the door rattled and aric entered he held a tray in his hands and he did not lift his face toward isana instead he walked to the circle of coals and stepped over setting the tray down there were two cups on the tray nothing more isana looked steadily up at aric he rose and stood there for a moment shifting his weight from foot to foot his eyes down then he said snows starting up again heavier isana stared at him and said nothing he swallowed and stepped back out of the ring of coals he went to the hod of coal and began scooping out buckets again to spread them over the smoldering ring fresh fuel how is she he asked dying isana said the heat is killing her aric swallowed he dumped out a bucket of coals onto the ring spilling some out sloppily and went for more the waters clean at least this time isana watched him for a moment and then reached for one of the cups she lifted it to her mouth and tasted though it was all she could do not to start gulping frantically the water was cool pure she had to steady herself with a deep breath and hold the cup in both shaking hands she drank slowly giving each sip time to go down isana only allowed herself half the cup the rest she gave to odiana halfhauling the woman into a sitting position and urging her to drink slowly which she did with a listless obedience she looked up to see aric watching her his face pale isana lowered the collared woman back down and brushed a few loose strands of hair back from her neck what is it aric theyre coming tonight he said my father theyre going to finish the odiana and then put the collar on you isana swallowed and couldnt stop the chill that went down her spine after dinner aric said he slopped more coals down its like a celebration for him hes handing out wine aric isana said it isnt too late to do something aric pressed his lips together it is he said theres only one thing left now without speaking he finished carelessly dashing coals onto the ring of fire around them kords entrance was presaged by a low tremble in the floor of the smokehouse then the big steadholder banged open the door with one fist and stepped inside glowering without a word he cuffed arics head hard enough to stagger the younger man against the wall where is that tar boy aric left his head down his body held in a crouch as though expecting to be hit again i havent got it done yet pa kord sneered at him placing his fists on his hips isana noticed the drunken sway to his balance as he did then you can just get it done while the rest of us eat and if you fall off the crowseaten roof in the dark thats your own affair dont go crying to me about a broken leg aric nodded yes pa kord growled something beneath his breath and then turned to isana better get that other glass of water before my new whore figures out its there odiana let out a soft noise curling in on herself kord watched her with a smirk on his face isana saw the ugly glitter in his eyes as he prepared to speak again and interrupted him kord shes nearly dead as it is leave her be kord narrowed his eyes at isana lips lifting away from his teeth he took a lurching step closer to her still giving orders he murmured well see tonight after im done with that one well see what its like well see who gives the orders and who takes them isana met his eyes steadily though his words made her heart thud with dull exhausted fear youre a fool kord she said what are you going to do about it huh youre nothing no one what are you going to do nothing isana said i wont have to youve already destroyed yourself its just a matter of time now kord flushed red and took a step toward isana his hands clenching into fists pa aric said pa shes just talking shes just trying to get to you it doesnt mean anything kord rounded on aric and swept his fist at him in a clumsy swat aric didnt dodge the blow so much as he let it catch his shoulder and throw him to the floor you kord growled chest heaving you dont tell me you dont talk to me everything you got you got because i gave it to you you will not disrespect me boy no sir aric said quietly kord got his breathing under control and shot isana another glare tonight he said well see the ground shook again as he turned and lumbered out coals sizzled in silence for a few moments then isana turned to aric and said thank you aric flinched at the words more than he had from his fathers blows dont thank me he said dont talk to me please he gathered himself to his feet and picked up the bucket still have to lay out the tar the ice didnt stick to the roof but i have to tar it tonight or hell feed me to the crows aric isana began be quiet aric hissed he shot a glance at the door then said to isana snows starting up again he left and bolted the door behind him isana frowned at him trying to puzzle out his meaning she took the second cup of water and took a bit more for herself then gave the rest to the semiconscious odiana outside the wind rose she heard men moving around the steadholt one of them walked past the smokehouse and banged on the walls letting out a few crude phrases odiana flinched and whimpered more raucous talk and rough laughter went up from somewhere nearbyprobably the steadholts great hall what sounded like a fight broke out ending in cheers and jeers and all the while it grew darker until only the red coals gave any light to the smokehouses interior there came a bang against the wall wood against wood then steps feet on a ladder someone set down a weighty object on the roof and then hauled himself onto it aric isana called quietly shhhh said the young man this is the one other thing isana frowned staring up she followed his weight as he moved from the edge of the slightly sloped roof up toward its crown directly over the circle without warning the naked blade of a knife sprang through the shingles dropping bits of tarstained wood and droplets of water in the blade twisted left and right opening a larger hole then it withdrew again aric proceeded around the roof slowly and isana could hear him slopping tar from a bucket he must have carried down onto the roof but every moment or so the knife would sink in again opening a small hole between shingles then it would withdraw he repeated the action several times and then without a word he clambered down from the roof again his feet crunched through snow and into the night it only took a few moments for isana to realize what aric had done the interior of the smokehouse was smoldering hot and its heat rose up to the roof above and warmed the materials there no ice had stuck to the roof the night before aric had said but if the roof hadnt been sealed properly swelling of the shingles and beams would set in after they had been soaked they would have to be sealed immediately in order to prevent leaks especially if the construction had been slipshod to begin with the roof would require fresh tar consistently to keep it closed against leaks against water droplets began to fall through the holes aric left with his dagger water that pattered to the floor first in the occasional drop and then as the snowfall evidently increased in a small steady trickle water isanas heart suddenly thudded with excitement with hope she leaned forward across the ring of coals and caught the nearest trickle of water in one of the empty cups it filled in perhaps a minute and isana lifted it to her mouth and drank deeply water coursing into her with a simple animal pleasure she filled the cup again and drank and again and then gave more to odiana as well the collared woman stirred at the first cup and then more at the second finally she was able to whisper what is happening a chance isana said weve been given a chance isana reached across to fill both cups again as the trickle came down a bit more steadily she licked her lips and looked around the circle of coals searching for what she thought would be there there where aric had slopped the coals in a particularly careless fashion a spot where no fresh coals had landed and only old grey softedged coals remained trembling with excitement isana reached out and poured the water over the coals they sizzled and spat she refilled the glasses and did it again and a third time a fourth with a final sputtering hiss the last of the coals went out shaking isana caught another cupful of water and reached out through it for her fury for rill the cup stirred and quivered and abruptly isana felt rills presence within the water a quivering life and motion swirling within it frantically isana felt tears springing to her eyes and a moment later felt rill gently easing them back from her felt the furys affection and relief at being in contact with her again isana looked up to odiana who had leaned out to catch another trickle of water in both cupped hands and who had a distant dreamy smile upon her face theyre talking about us odiana murmured so many cups theyre going to use me until the heat has killed me then it will be your turn isana i think she broke off suddenly her back arching with a little gaspthen flung the water away from her shaking her head and clapping her hands over her ears his voice no i dont want to hear him dont want to hear him isana turned to her and caught her by the wrist odiana she hissed we have to get out of here the darkeyed woman stared up at isana her eyes wide and nodded i dont know i dont know if i can the collar she nodded again its hard to think of doing things that wouldnt pplease him dont know if i can do them and if he speaks to me isana swallowed gently she drew odianas hands down from her ears and then placed her own over them he shant she said quietly let me odianas face paled but she nodded once isana reached out for rill and sent the fury down through her touch into odianas body rill hesitated once within refusing to respond isana had to focus with a sharp effort of will before isanas senses pressed through and into the other woman odianas emotions nearly overwhelmed her tension terrible fear rage frantic and near mindlessall of them trapped beneath a slow and steady pleasure a languid pulse that radiated out of the collar threatening at any moment to reverse itself into unspeakable agony it was like standing within the heart of a storm emotions and needs spinning past whirling by nothing steady nothing to orient upon with a slow shudder isana realized that rill had let her touch only lightly upon the water witchs emotions on the frantic whirl and spill of them in her mind she realized that rill had meant to protect her from exposure to what could all too easily spill over into her own thoughts her own heart isana frantically pushed that storm of the soul away from her struggled to focus on her purpose through the fury she sought out the other womans ears the sensitive eardrums with a sharp nearly frantic effort she altered the pressures of odianas body within her ears distantly isana heard odiana let out a pained gaspand then the drums burst another explosion of pain and wild emotionsglee and revulsion and impatience predominant isana withdrew her presence from the watercrafter as quickly as she could jerking her hands and her face away even after the contact had been broken the wild spill of odianas emotions remained flooding over her against her making it difficult to think to focus on the task at hand odianas voice came to her then very quiet very gentle you cant fight it you know she halfwhispered you have to embrace it one day theyre all going to come in holdgirl you have to let it have you to do otherwise is is mad isana looked up to see the water witch smiling a smile that stretched her mouth in something near a pained grimace isana shook her head and pressed the emotions away from her fought to clear her thinking tavi bernard she had to get free to get to her family they would need her help or at least to know that she was all right she hugged herself and struggled and slowly her thoughts began to clear we have to get out of here isana said i dont know how much more time we have odiana frowned at her youve put out my ears holdgirl i cant hear you can i but if youre saying we should go i agree isana nodded toward the floor on the far side of the ring of coals kords fury its guarding the floor out there she gestured and pointed at the ground odiana shook her head disagreeing her eyes fluttered for a moment and she gasped in a little breath fingertips moving to touch the collar i ill have all i can do just to go i cant help you she bowed her head and said just take my hand ill come with you isana shook her head frustrated outside a door banged open and kords drunken voice bawled its time ladies followed by a hoarse cheer from several throats panicked isana rose and took odianas hand she reached out to rill sent the fury questing about the roof of the smokehouse as the men grew closer gathering up all the liquid water the fury could find isana felt it inside her an instinctive awareness of what was there of the water in the snowfilled air the meltwater within the smokehouse and in the ground around it isana felt it and gathered it together in one place and then with a low cry released it water flooded down from the roof in a sudden wave that washed over the coals in a swirling ring the coals spat and hissed furiously and in seconds the air was filled with thick broiling hot steam without there was a cry and kords feet pounded closer the heavy bolt to the door slid back and it flew open with another flick of her hand isana sent the steam boiling out into kords face out to the men behind him cries and yowls filled the yard as men scrambled back from the door isana focused on the ground before them and at the edge of the nowguttered coals water condensed from the steam into a shining strip of liquid as wide as a plank she had never attempted anything like that before holding clear in her mind what she wanted rill to do isana took a deep breath and stepped out onto the plank of liquid there was a tension in it wavering but there and it held her weight without allowing her foot to sink through to the floor isana let out a low cry of triumph and stepped out onto the plank tugging odiana by the hand she led her to the door of the smokehouse and leapt out onto the earth without odiana faltering but staying close stop kord bellowed within the cloud of steam i order you to stop get on the ground bitch get on the ground isana glanced at odiana but the womans face was distant her eyes unfocused and she stumbled along in isanas wake if the collar forced a reaction to kords voice upon her she gave no sign of it rill isana hissed the nearest stream and with an abrupt clarity isana felt the lay of the land about them the subtle tilt down and away from the mountains and toward the middle of the valley to a tributary that fed eventually into one of the streams that ran down through garrison and into the sea of ice isana turned and ran over the cold ground now using rill only to help her know the way to the nearest water to keep her blood running hot through her bare feet to help them resist freezing she could only hope that odiana would have the presence of mind to do the same behind them kord bellowed to his fury and the ground to her right erupted with writhing vicious motion ice and frozen earth and rocks thrown into the air isana swerved her course to run over deeper snow more thickly crusted ice and prayed that she would not slip and break her leg it was only that coating of frozen water that gave her any sort of protection at all from the wrath of kords earth fury kill you bellowed kords voice behind them in the dark kill you find them find them and kill them bring the hounds her heart racing with fear her body alight with excitement and terror isana fled into the night from the sounds of mounting pursuit leading her fellow captive by the hand chapter what do you mean they missed fidelias snapped he gritted his teeth and folded his arms leaning back in the seat within the litter the knights aeris at the poles supported it as it sailed through low clouds and drifting snow and the cold seemed determined to slowly remove his ears from the sides of his head you really do hate flying dont you aldrick drawled just answer the question marcus reports that the ground team missed stopping the cursor from reaching count gram the air team saw a target of opportunity and took it but they were detected before they could attack the cursor again the two men with marcus were killed in the attack though he reports that count gram was wounded probably fatally it was a bungled assault from the beginning not an opportunity if they werent forewarned before they are now aldrick shrugged maybe not marcus reports that the cursor and the steadholder with her were subsequently arrested and hauled off in chains fidelias tilted his head at aldrick frowning then slowly he started to smile well that makes me feel a great deal better gram wouldnt have arrested one of his own steadholders without getting the whole story his truthfinder must be in command now aldrick nodded thats what marcus reports and according to our sources the truthfinder is someone with a patron but no talent house of pluvus hes young no experience not enough crafting to even do his job much less to be a threat in the field fidelias nodded mmm lucky accident it looks like there was a veteran that was going to be set out with nearly two cohorts tertius originally but the paperwork got done incorrectly and they sent out a green unit instead the crows it was an accident fidelias murmured it took me nearly a week to set it up aldrick stared at him for a moment im impressed fidelias shrugged i only did it to lessen the effectiveness of the garrison i didnt think it would pay off this well he wiped a snowflake from his cheek irritably i must be living right dont get your hopes up too far the swordsman responded if the marat lose their backbones all of this will be for nothing thats why were going out to them fidelias said just follow my lead he leaned forward and called to one of the knights aeris how much longer the man squinted into the distance for a moment and then called back to him coming down out of the cloud cover now sir we should be able to see the fires there the litter swept down out of the clouds and the abrupt return of vision made fideliass stomach churn uncomfortably once he could see how far down the ground was and beneath them spread out over the plains beyond the mountains that shielded the calderon valley were campfires there were campfires that spread into the night for miles hungh aldrick rumbled he stared down at the fires at the forms dimly moving around them for several moments while they sailed over them then turned to fidelias and said im not sure i can handle that many fidelias felt the corner of his mouth twitch well make that the backup plan then the litter glided to earth at the base of a hill that rose up out of the rolling plains at its top stood a ring of enormous stones each as big as a house and within that circle of stones stood a still pool of water somehow free of the ice that should have covered it torches rested between the stones their emerald flame giving strange heavy smoke it gave the place a garish light the snow on the ground gave the whole place an odd light and the pale nearly naked marat could be seen keeping out of the light of the nearest torches watching them curiously fidelias alighted from the litter and asked the same knight hed spoken to before where is atsurak the knight nodded up the slope top of the hill they call it a horto but its up there fidelias rolled his ankle frowning at the pain in his foot then why didnt we land at the top of the hill the knight shrugged and said apologetically they told us not to sir fine fidelias said shortly he glanced at aldrick and started up the hill the swordsman fell in on his right and a step behind him the slope made his feet hurt abominably and he had to stop once to rest aldrick frowned watching him feet yes when we wrap this up tomorrow ill go get odiana shes good at fixing things up fidelias frowned he didnt trust the water witch aldrick seemed to control her but she was too clever for his liking fine he said shortly after a moment he asked why aldrick the swordsman watched the night around them with neutral disinterest why what youve been a wanted man for what twenty years eighteen and youve been a rebel the whole time fallen in with one group after another and theyve all been subversives freedom fighters aldrick said whatever fidelias said the point is that youve been a thorn in gaiuss side since you were barely more than a boy aldrick shrugged fidelias studied him why why do you want to know because i like knowing the motivations of the people i work with the witch follows you shes besotted with you and i have no doubt that shed kill for you if you asked her to again aldrick shrugged but i dont know why youre doing it why aquitaine trusts you so why you havent worked it out youre supposed to be the big spy for the crown havent you figured it out yet analyzed my scars or poked into my diaries something like that fidelias halfsmiled youre honest youre a murderer a sellsword a thugbut an honest one i thought id ask aldrick stared up the hill for a moment then he said tonelessly i had a family my mother and my father my older brother and two younger sisters gaius sextus destroyed them aldrick tapped a finger on the hilt of his sword ill kill him to do that i have to knock him off the throne so im with aquitaine and thats all there is to it fidelias asked no aldrick didnt elaborate after a moment of silence he said how are your feet lets go fidelias said he started back up the hill again though the pain made him wince with every step perhaps ten yards short of the summit of the hill a pair of marat warriors male and female rose out of the shadows around the base of the stones at the top of the hill they came down toward them through the snow the man holding an axe of aleran manufacture the woman a dark dagger of chipped stone fidelias stopped short of them and held up his empty hands peace i have come to speak to atsurak the man stepped up close to him his eyes narrowed he had the dark heavy feathers of a herdbane braided through his pale hair i will not permit you to speak to atsurak outsider while he is at the horto you will wait until fideliass temper flashed and it was with a flicker of annoyance that he reached down into the earth to borrow strength from vamma and dealt the axewielding warrior a blow that lifted the marats feet up off the ground and stretched him out senseless in the snow without pausing fidelias stepped over the silent form of the fallen marat he limped up to the lean female warrior and said in exactly the same tone peace i have come to speak to atsurak the marats ambercolored eyes flicked up and down fidelias bright beneath heavy pale brows her lips lifted from her teeth showing canine fangs and she said i will take you to atsurak fidelias followed her up the rest of the hill and to the great stones there the smoke from the torches heavy and dark along the ground held a curious odor and fidelias found his head feeling a bit light as he stepped into it he glanced back at aldrick and the swordsman nodded nostrils flared seven stones smooth and round their surfaces protruding above the heavy smoke sat around a pool of water somehow unfrozen despite the cold the smoke seemed to sink into it and swirl beneath its surface leaving it shining and dull reflecting back the light of fires and the dull night glow of snow and ice scattered around the pool were perhaps a hundred other marat their hair plaited with herdbane feathers or else showing the shagginess of what fidelias assumed to be the wolf clan male and female they ate or drank from brightly painted gourds or mated in the sultry dizzying smoke with animal abandon in the shadows stood the tall silent shapes of the herdbane warbirds and crouched the low swift shapes of wolves on one of the stones lounged atsurak his bruises all but gone already the cuts bound in strips of hide and plaited grass aquitaines dagger rode through a strap at his waist the blade contained within a rawhide sheath and positioned to be clearly on display on either side of him curled a female marat warrior of the heavybrowed and fanged variety both were naked young lithe the mouths of all three were smeared with fresh scarlet blood and bound over the stone beside them was the shivering form of a young aleran woman still wearing the shreds of a farm wifes skirts and apron and still very much alive aldricks mouth twisted with disgust savages he murmured yes fidelias said we call them that because theyre savage aldrick the swordsman growled in his throat they have moved too soon there arent any aleran settlements on this side of the valley obviously fidelias stepped forward and said atsurak of clan herdbane i understood that our attack was to begin two dawns from now was my understanding in error atsurak looked up focusing on fidelias as an older woman also showing the signs of clan wolf rose from the smoke at the base of one of the stones coated liberally in blood and crossed to him she folded her arms casually over his shoulders amber eyes on fidelias atsurak lifted his hand to touch the womans without looking at her and said we celebrate our victory aleran he smiled and his teeth were stained scarlet have you come to partake you celebrate a victory you do not yet have atsurak waved a hand for many of my warriors there will be no chance to celebrate after so you broke our agreement fidelias asked you struck early the marat lowered his brows a raiding party struck first as is our custom we know many ways in and out of the bridge valley aleran not ways for an army but for a scouting party a raiding party yes he gestured toward the bound girl her people fought well against us died well now we partake of their strength youre eating them alive demanded aldrick pure corrected atsurak untouched by fire or water or blade as they are before the one as he spoke a pair of herdbane warriors rose to their feet and moved to the prisoner with casual almost disinterested efficiency they drew her up tore the clothes from her and bound her back down over the stone again belly up to the stars arms and legs spread atsurak looked over at the captive and mused through bloody lips we take more strength in this way i do not expect you to understand aleran the girl looked around frantic her eyes red with tears body shaking in the cold her lips blue please she gasped toward fidelias please sir please help me fidelias met her eyes then walked over toward the stone upon which she was bound matters have changed we must change the plans to suit them atsurak followed him with his eyes expression growing wary what change aleran sir the girl whispered up at him her expression desperate ugly with tears and terror sir please shhhh fidelias said he rested his hand on her hair and she broke down into quiet subdued sobs we have to move forward now the troops at garrison may be warned of our coming let them know atsurak said lazily leaning against one of the women at his side we will tear out their weak bellies regardless you are wrong fidelias said he raised his voice enough that all of the marat around the pool would hear you are mistaken atsurak we must strike at once at dawn silence fell over the hilltop abrupt deep almost as though the marat were afraid to breathe all eyes went from fidelias to atsurak you call me mistaken atsurak said the words low soft the younger of your people listen to the elder headman of clan herdbane is that not true it is then you young hordemaster listen to me i was there when last the alerans fought your people there was no glory in it there was no honor there was hardly any battle the rocks rose against them and the very grass beneath them bound their feet fire was laid on the ground and fire swept over them and destroyed them there was no contest no trial of blood they died like stupid animals in a trap because they grew too confident he twisted his lips into a sneer their bellies too full you dishonor the memory of brave warriors who died because they did not use what they had to fullest advantage snarled fidelias lead your people to death if that is your wish atsurak but i will be no party to it i will not waste the lives of my knights in an attempt to neutralize the knights of a forewarned and prepared garrison another marat a herdbane rose and snarled he speaks the words of an aleran the words of a coward i speak the truth fidelias said if you are wise young man you will listen to the older atsurak stared at him for several moments in silence then he exhaled and said the alerans fight as cowards let us force them to the trial of blood before they can prepare their spirits to hide behind we will attack at dawn fidelias let out a slow breath and nodded then this celebration is over atsurak looked at the captive shivering beneath fideliass hand almost please sir the girl whispered please help me fidelias looked down at her and nodded touching her mouth with his other hand then he broke her neck the sound sharp in the silence of the hilltop her eyes looked up at him in shock for a few seconds then went slowly out of focus and empty he let the dead girls head fall limply back onto the stone and said to atsurak now it is over be in position when the sun rises he walked back across the circle to aldrick working to hide the limp aleran snarled atsurak his voice heavy bestial fidelias paused without turning around i will remember this insult fidelias nodded just be ready in the morning without looking back he walked with aldrick back down the hill and toward the litter aldrick paced beside him silent scowling halfway down the hill fideliass belly rolled violently out of nowhere and he had to stop and squat down weight on his injured feet his head bowed what is it aldrick asked his voice quiet and cool my feet hurt fidelias lied your feet hurt aldrick said quietly del you killed that girl fideliass stomach fluttered yes and it doesnt even bother you he lied again no aldrick shook his head fidelias took a breath then another he forced his belly back under control and said she was dead already aldrick chances are shed just seen her family or friends eaten alive right there in front of her she was next even if we had taken her out of there in one piece shed seen too much we just would have had to remove her ourselves but you killed her it was the kindest thing i could do fidelias stood up again his head clearing slowly aldrick remained quiet for a moment then he said great furies ive no stomach for that kind of killing fidelias nodded dont let it stop you from doing your duty aldrick grunted you ready im ready fidelias said they started back down the hill together at least we got the marat moving his feet still hurt horribly but going back down the hill was easier than going up get the men ready well hit the knights at garrison just as we planned on the way here were down to the fighting then aldrick said fidelias nodded i dont think there are any major obstacles to the mission now chapter tavis teeth chattered together and he hugged himself beneath his cloak as he and fade were shown out of the tent they had been kept in he wasnt sure if it was the cold that made him shake or the sense of raw excitement that filled him made him eager to move and burn away the chill of the winter in motion mmmore snow tavi noted as he crunched along behind the silent form of doroga great white flakes drifted down in a calm heavy curtain already the snow had gone from a thin coating of ice on the ground the night before to a soft heavy carpet as deep as tavis ankles he slipped on a thin patch where the ice was barely covered but fade reached forward and caught his shoulder until he could regain his balance great doroga turned back toward them without stopping it is he said the snow and the darkness may help more of the keepers to sleep tavi frowned at the marat headman what keepers the keepers of the silence doroga said whats that you will see doroga said he kept pacing through the snow until he reached an enormous old bull gargant placidly chewing its cud doroga went to the beast and gave no visible signal but it knelt in any case and let him use the back of its leg to take a step up and seize the braided cord dangling from the saddle doroga swarmed up it easily and then reached down to help tavi and fade up behind him once they were mounted the gargant hauled itself lazily to its feet made a ponderous turn and started rolling forward through the snow for a time they rode through the night in silence and though the warmth of the beast and the riders on either side of him had chased the chill away tavi still shook excitement then he felt his mouth stretch into a smile so this thing were supposed to be getting tavi began the blessing of night doroga said what is it a plant a mushroom it grows in the heart of the valley of silence within the great tree uhhuh tavi said what good is it doroga blinked and looked back at him what good valleyboy it is good for everything valuable doroga shook his head you do not understand the meaning of the word in this he said fever poison injury pain even age it has power over them all to our people there is nothing of greater value tavi whistled do you have any doroga hesitated then shook his head why not it grows only there valleyboy and only slowly if we are fortunate one person returns every year with some of the blessing why dont you send more people doroga looked back at him for a moment then said we do tavi blinked then swallowed so uh i guess something happens to the ones who dont come back the keepers doroga said their bite is a deadly venom but they have a weakness what weakness when one falls the keepers swarm the fallen all of them they will not pursue anyone else until that one has been devoured tavi gulped this is the trial of my people before the one valleyboy it is newly night you will go into the valley of silence and return before dawn what if we dont come back before dawn tavi asked then you will not come back the keepers doroga nodded at night they are slow quiet no one escapes the valley of silence while the one fills the sky with light great tavi repeated he took a deep breath so where is your son doroga blinked up at the sky and then back to tavi my what kitai your son ah my whelp doroga said he moved his eyes back to the ground before them expression uncomfortable hashat brings kitai hes not riding with you doroga remained silent what tavi asked is he fighting with you hanging around with the horse clan doroga growled in his throat and the gargant beneath them let out a rumble that shook tavis teeth never mind tavi said quickly how far is it to this great tree and back doroga guided the gargant down a long slope and pointed forward see for yourself tavi strained to look over dorogas broad shoulders finally resorting to planting a foot on the broad back of the gargant bull and halfstanding with fade steadying him by his belt down a long slope of land dappled in patches of shadow next to round icecovered boulders the land fell off and down as abruptly as if some enormous hand had gouged out an inverted dome from the earth a low ridge rose all around the precipice which was a circle that stretched so wide in the falling snow that tavi could not see the majority of its curve or the circles far side a dull greenish light licked up at the edges of the pit from below and as the gargant plodded closer tavi could see its source the bottom of the pit a great bowl gouged into the earth was covered with a valley of treestrees the likes of which tavi had never seen before they rose up their trunks twisted and gnarled stretching many branches each high into the air like the reaching hands of a drowning man covering the trees was the source of the light tavi squinted and peered and it took his eyes a moment to sort out what he was seeing covering the trees was some kind of growth that gave off the faint menacing luminescence it seemed to cover the trees as might some kind of fungus but rather than simply existing as a light coating of some other plant it had grown over them in a thick gelatinouslooking mass as the gargant drew closer to the edge of the precipice tavi could see that the growth had runnels and areas that looked as though bubbles of air had been trapped beneath it and for all the world looked like melted wax had been dripped over the surfaces of the trees but for the desperately reaching branches high up in them layer upon layer until the whole resembled some fantastic bizarre work of art as far as he could see in the faint light of the glowing wax those odd trees writhed and twisted their branches and trunks hung in festoons and swirls of the waxy growth at the heart of the scene stood a single ancient tree barren trunk lifting high dead branches mostly worn away by time though there was nothing to hold to scale tavi thought that the spire of ancient dead wood had to be huge the wax forest tavi said quietly wow they didnt say it was so pretty danger fade said quietly danger tavi fade will go no tavi said quickly im the one who spoke im the one who has to answer the trial he glanced at doroga right doroga looked back at tavi and then glanced at fade too heavy he said tavi tilted his head what too heavy doroga repeated his weight will break the surface of the croach the wax it will alert the keepers as soon as he steps on it only our whelps or a small female can enter the valley of silence and live tavi swallowed again right then he said its got to be me fade frowned but fell silent the gargants slowseeming steps covered ground quickly and carried them down to the edge of the precipice there tavi saw hashat standing beside a large pale horse the wind tossing their white manes off to one side the lean marat woman with her long legs somehow a mirror of the big grey beside her the cool winter light gleamed on the captured eagle brooches on her sword belt over to one side seated at the edge of the precipice near a couple of lumps in the snow was kitai still dressed in his rough smock skinny legs dangling over the edge feet idly waving the wind pressed his hair back from the slender stark lines of his face and he had his eyes narrowed to slits against the drifting flakes of snow tavi scowled at the other boy and his face stung for a moment where he had been cut the previous morning doroga nodded wordlessly to hashat and clucked to his gargant the great beast let out a snort and rolled to a stop before lowering itself almost daintily to the ground doroga tossed down the saddle strap and used one hand to steady himself with it as he slid down tavi followed suit as did fade doroga said hashat coming toward them frowning are you ready doroga nodded once hashat said word is abroad the wolves were leaving as i left to bring kitai here they attack with the dawn tavi drew in a little breath and looked at fade the slave looked worried though his eyes werent focused on anything he just stared out over the wax forest doroga grunted then this will decide it if the aleran prevails we avoid the struggle atsurak will not be happy with you doroga the big marat shrugged he may not survive the day if he does he does that is yet to come hashat nodded then let us begin kitai doroga rumbled the figure at the edge of the precipice did not move doroga scowled whelp still he did not move doroga glared at hashat the maned marat turned her face away a little too late to hide her smile your whelp is growing up doroga they always get moody before they bond you know that doroga rumbled you just want kitai to be part of horse hashat shrugged her shoulders speed intelligence who wouldnt want that she lifted her chin and called kitai we are ready to begin kitai stood up idly dusted snow off of his smock and paced toward them his expression cool he stopped not a pace away from tavi glaring at the aleran boy tavi felt a sudden fear as his cut throbbed again and then set his jaw stubbornly he had never allowed a bully to frighten him hed been beaten often enough but hed never surrendered to fear he took a step closer to kitai eyes narrowed facing the other boys opalescent gaze with his own their eyes were on a level and the other boy did not seem to be much bigger than tavi was tavi folded his arms and stared at his opponent kitai seemed uncertain how to react to tavis stance and glanced at hashat doroga growled irritably you both know the trial the first to recover the blessing of night and return it to my hand will be the victor he turned to tavi aleran the blessing is shaped as a mushroom it has a flat head slender stalk and is the color of night it is located at the base of the great tree within its trunk black mushroom tavi said great tree fine got it kitai you are familiar with the trial the other boy nodded yes sire doroga turned to him and placed his huge hands on the boys slender shoulders he turned kitai to face him an effortless flexing of dorogas shoulders then be careful your mother would want you to be careful kitai lifted his chin though his eyes glittered bright my mother he said would have fetched the blessing and been back by now while you talked sire dorogas teeth showed suddenly yes he agreed one of his hands squeezed kitais shoulders and he released the boy to turn to tavi we will lower you down and wait until dawn once you begin there are no rules the results are all that matter you can choose not to face the trial now if you wish valleyboy and go back to your camp and be eaten doroga nodded yes regrettably tavi let out a nervous laugh yeah well ill take my chances with the keepers i think then we begin doroga turned to one of the lumps in the snow and dug into it with his huge hands uncovering a great coil of rope of a weave tavi had never seen before beside him hashat did the same with a second coil of rope tavi saw kitai step up beside him out of the corner of his eye the marat boy watched the two adults uncovering the rope and testing its length it is rope from the gadrimha from the ones you call the icemen made of the hairs of their females it will not freeze or break tavi nodded he asked youve done this before kitai nodded twice it wasnt for a trial before but i have gone in twice and returned with the blessing i was the only one who returned tavi swallowed are you afraid aleran arent you yes kitai said afraid to lose everything depends on this night for me i dont understand kitai sniffed when i return with the blessing before you i will have defended my sires honor in a trial before the one i will be an adult and may choose where i live and you want to live with hashat tavi said kitai blinked and looked at tavi yes tavi studied the other boy do you uh are you sweet on her kitai frowned pale brows coming together no but i wish to be a part of her clan to be free with her clan not to plod around with doroga and his stupid sabot he glanced aside to be sure no one was close apparently and confided m a low voice to tavi they smell tavi lifted his brows but nodded yeah i guess they do aleran kitai said my sire is right about one thing you have courage it will be an honor to face you in a trial but i will defeat you do not think that this will end in any other way despite whatever spirits are yours to call tavi felt a scowl harden his features kitais eyes narrowed and he stepped back a half pace one hand falling to the knife at his belt i dont have any tavi said and back at my steadholt we have a saying about counting your chickens before theyve hatched my people eat eggs before theyve hatched kitai said and stepped to ward the coiled ropes i thought you might make it out alive aleran thanks to your spirits but we will only need to use one rope before dawn tavi started to say something quick and heated back but fades hand gripped his shoulder abruptly tavi turned to face the slave fade frowned at him his scarred face hideous and concerned then he said be careful tavi and with that he took the pack that had been slung over his shoulder and dropped it onto tavis the boy let out a breath at the sudden weight fade uh maybe it would be better if i didnt take anything with me ill move faster without it marat stronger than tavi fade said faster thank you tavi said testily i needed that kind of encouragement fades eyes glittered with something like good humor and he ruffled tavis hair with one hand tavi smart there bag of tricks be smart tavi important tavi tilted his head to one side peering at the slave fade he asked the glitter faded from the mans eyes and he gave tavi his witless grin valleyboy doroga called there is no time to waste tavi said to fade quickly if i dont come back fade i want you to remember to tell aunt isana that i love her uncle too tavi fade nodded come back the boy blew out a breath whatever spark of awareness had been in the mans eyes was gone now all right he said and walked over to doroga he shrugged into the pack drawing the straps down to their smallest size so that it would fit closely to his back doroga was handling his rope tavi watched as the marat worked a loop into the end of it with the skill of a sailor and drew it tight the marat stood leaving the loop just touching the ground and in a moment of understanding tavi stepped forward and slipped his foot into the loop taking up the rope itself to hold it tight doroga nodded his approval to tavis right kitai had knotted the rope himself and stood at the edge of the precipice his expression impatient tavi walked awkwardly to the precipices edge and stared over it to a drop of several hundred feet down a nearly sheer surface his head spun a bit and his belly suddenly shook and felt light are you afraid aleran kitai asked and let out a low little laugh tavi shot the other boy a sharp glance and then turned to doroga who had secured the far end of the rope to a stake driven into the earth and looped it about a second such stake so that he could let the rope out gradually lets go tavi said and with that took a step back over the precipice and swung himself down into space doroga held the line steady and after a very short moment of terror tavi bumped against the wall and steadied himself holding on doroga began to lower the rope but tavi called up faster let it out faster there was a brief pause and then the rope began to play out quickly lowering tavi down the face of the cliff at a rather alarming rate from above there was a yelp and kitai swung out into space the boy plummeted down for several yards and tavi got the impression that when the rope finally did tighten and catch him that hashat had only just managed to do so kitai shot tavi a brighteyed angry glance and called something up the cliff in another tongue a moment later he too began to descend the cliff more quickly tavi used one foot and one hand to keep himself from dragging on the stone and found that it was more effort than he would have expected he was shortly panting but a swift glance up at kitai told him that he had thought correctly dorogas huge muscles had an easier time letting out the rope at a faster controlled rate than the more slender hashats did and tavi had gained considerable distance on the other boy as they descended as he came down closer to the lambent green glow of the crouch he shot a glance up at kitai and smiled fiercely kitai let out a sharp whistle and the line abruptly stopped playing out tavi stared up at him in confusion until the other boy drew his knife reached across to the rope that held tavi thirty feet over the floor of the bizarre forest below and with an answering smile used the dark glassy knife to begin swiftly slicing through tavis rope chapter tavi took one look at the thirty odd feet between him and the ground below then reached a hand up fumbling at fades pack he jerked the flap open and grabbed the first thing his fingers could reach though all the squirming made him twist and spin on the rope he squinted up as best he could and then flung it at the marat above him kitai let out a yelp and jerked back in a dodge a hunk of cheese smacked into the stone beside the marats head clung for a moment then dropped and fell toward the waxcovered ground below kitai blinked at the cheese and then at tavi his face twisting into a scowl doroga hadnt stopped lowering the rope and so the cut the marat had begun had already descended out of his reach kitai steadied himself against the cliff face then reached out with his knife and began slicing at the rope again foolish aleran kinder if you fell broke a leg and had to turn back rather than be devoured by the keepers tavi scrambled in the pack and found cloth wrapped around several biscuits he grabbed the first and hurled it at kitai so i could be eaten by your people instead kitai scowled not deterred this time a biscuit bounced off his outstretched arm we would at least not eat you alive stop that tavi shouted he threw another biscuit to no effect a thick strand of the braided rope parted with a whining snap and tavis heart lurched as the rope spun and swung from side to side he glanced below him another twenty feet to ground hed never be able to fall that far without hurting himself possibly too badly to continue another strand parted and tavi swayed wildly back and forth his heart hammering high in his throat arms and legs shaking with excitement tavi took one last glance down fifteen feet or a little more he slipped his foot out of the loop at the bottom of the grey rope and as quickly as he could he slipped down the rope gripping with his hands and letting his legs swing below him he reached the loop and with a gulp grasped onto it letting his legs swing out far beneath him the rope parted with a snap tavi plummeted between doroga lowering the rope from above and the few feet he had gained by letting himself farther down the rope the fall might have been little more than ten feet not much higher than the roof of the stables and he had jumped from there several timesalways into mounds of hay true but he had made the jump without fear he tried to remember to keep his legs loose to fall roll if he possibly could the fall seemed to take forever and when tavi landed it was a shock to his ankles knees thighs hips back all in rapid succession as he tumbled to the earth he landed on one side arms flailing wildly out and slapping down with him and his breath exploded out from him in a rush he lay for a moment without moving dimly aware that he was on the ground still clutching the loop in the end of the rope in his fist he regained his breath in a few moments becoming aware of a couple of incongruous facts as he did first there was no snow down here in the chasm of course he had seen no snow from above but the significance of it hadnt quite registered on him until he reached the ground it was warm humid nearly stifling he sat up slowly pushing himself up with his hands the ground beneath him or rather the greenly luminous wax beneath his fingers felt pleasantly warm and he let them rest against it for a moment letting his chilled fingers recover from the cold wind that had frozen them on the way down from the top of the cliff his ankles stung as though being prickled by thousands of tiny needles but the sensation faded after a moment leaving them feeling merely uncomfortable and sore tavi gathered himself to his feet the pack shifting about uncomfortably on his back and squinted at his surroundings what was beautiful from high above was once among it disorienting and a little disturbing the waxy growth the croach grew right up to the stone walls of the chasm and stopped there but for one place he could see where it had crept up the walls evidently to engulf a lone and scraggly tree trying to grow from a crack in the stone the luminous glow made shadows fall weirdly with one engulfed tree casting several ghostly weak shadows on the glowing floor of the forest beneath the croach the shadowy outlines of the trees themselves reminded tavi uncomfortably of bones beneath flesh tavi heard a scrabble on the wall and turned in time to see kitai drop the last dozen feet to the floor of the forest landing soundlessly absorbing the shock of landing on both feet and on his arms crouching for a moment on all fours pale hair and opalescent eyes wild and greenish in the quiet light of the croach his gaze darted left and right wary and his head tilted to one side listening focused on the lambent forest before him tavis temper flared fear and pain quickly becoming an outraged anger that made arms shake with the sudden need to avenge himself he rose and stalked silently toward kitai tavi tapped the marat on the shoulder and when kitai turned toward him he balled up his fist and drove it into the other boys ribs as hard as he could kitai flinched but didnt move quickly enough to evade the blow tavi pressed his advantage jerking the marats arm away from his flank and punching him again in the same spot as hard as he could kitai fumbled for his knife and tavi shoved him away as hard as he could sending the other boy sprawling onto the glowing surface of the croach kitai turned his opalescent eyes toward tavi and pushed himself up with his hands aleran he snarled my sires generosity is wasted on you if you want a trial of blood then kitai stopped abruptly his eyes going wide tavi prepared to defend himself blinked at the sudden change in the marat gooseflesh rippled up his arms silent he followed the marats gaze downto his own feet some of the oozing green light of the croach seemed to have spilled onto tavis boots he frowned and peered closer no when he had landed one of his heels must have driven into the croach and broken its surface like a crust of drying mud over a stillwet furrow whatever that glowing goo was within the wax it had splashed droplets onto the leather the droplets gjowed pale and green tavi frowned and shook them off he looked up to find kitai still staring at him eyes wide his mouth open what tavi asked what is it foolish aleran kitai hissed you have broken the croach the keepers will come tavi felt a chill roll over him he swallowed well i wouldnt have fallen if someone hadnt cut my rope im not that stupid kitai retorted his eyes moved past tavi flicking among the trees the croach beneath the ropes is very thick thats why we chose there to enter i once saw someone fall nearly six times the height of a man without breaking it tavi licked his lips oh he said he looked down at the forests glowing floor why did i break through it then kitai glanced at him and then paced over to the spot where tavi had landed crouching down beside it he touched the glowing fluid with his fingertips its thinner here i dont understand its never been like this tavi said looks like they were expecting company kitai turned to him his eyes wide body tense they knew where we were coming in and now they know that were here the marat boys eyes flicked left and right and he took several steps sideways toward tavi his back to the stone of the wall tavi backed toward the wall as well emulating kitai and almost tripped on an incongruous lump in the smooth surface of the croach tavi glanced down and then leaned over peering at it the lump was not large perhaps the size of a chicken it rose from the otherwise smooth floor of the forest in a hemisphere of greenish light with something dark at its core tavi leaned closer peering at the shadowed lump it stirred and moved tavi hopped back from it his breath catching in his throat that he gasped thats a crow theres a crow in there and its alive yes aleran kitai said with scarcely veiled impatience the crows are sometimes foolish they come down and peck at the croach and the keepers come for them and entomb them kitai cast his eyes to one side where several other lumps quite a bit larger lay only a dozen long strides from the ropes at the base of the cliff they can live for days being eaten by the croach tavi shuddered a cold sensation crawling down his spine like a runnel of melting snow you mean if these keepers get one of us a marat can live for weeks buried in the croach aleran tavi felt sick you dont rescue them kitai flashed him a look his eyes hard cool then in a few silent strides paced over to the crow he drew his knife reached down and slashed the blade over the surface of the lump with a swift curt motion he reached down for the crows neck and drew it from the clinging goo of the croach parts of the bird peeled and sloughed away like meat from a roast that had been cooked to tender perfection in a carefully tended oven it let out a rasping sound but its beak never attempted to close its eyes blinked once and then went glassy that takes only hours kitai said and dropped the remains back near the slit in the wax do you see aleran tavi stared at the ground sickened i i see kitai grimaced at him he turned and started pacing away following the wall of stone again we must move the keepers will come to investigate the break you made and put the rest of the crow back we should not be here when they arrive no tavi whispered i guess we sh in the trees tavi saw something move it was indistinct at first just a lump in the wax on the trunk of the tree but it shuddered and twitched with life tavi thought for a moment that a piece of the croach had broken from the tree trunk and would fall to earth it had a lumpy shape and coursed with the same luminous green fluid as the rest of the wax but as the aleran boy watched legs writhed free of the lumps sides something like a head emerged from a shelllike coating of the croach pale eyes round and huge all in all eight knobby manyjointed legs stretched free of the things body and then with a quiet horrible grace it paced down the trunk of the tree and across the floor of the forest to the break in the surface of the croach where greenish glowing fluid bubbled and seethed like blood in an open wound a wax spider a keeper of silence silent and strange and the size of a large dog tavi stared at it his heart pounding in his chest and felt his eyes widening he shot a glance to kitai who had also frozen and was staring at the keeper the creature bent down and spread wide a set of smooth mandibles at the base of its head it scooped up pieces of the crow and using its foremost set of legs tucked them back into the open wound in the croach then it hovered over the slash several of its legs working back and forth over it in swift methodical movements sealing the wax closed over the carcass tavi shot a glance back at kitai who motioned to tavi and then covered his own mouth with his hand a clear command to be silent tavi nodded and turned toward kitai the marats eyes widened in alarm and he held up his hands palms out to tell tavi to stop tavi froze behind him the quiet rustle of the keepers limbs over the wax had come to a halt from the corner of his eye tavi could just see it gather all its limbs beneath it again bobbing up and down in restless agitation it began to emit a series of high pitched chirrups not quite like a birds voice or anything else tavi had ever heard the sound made shivers slither down the length of his body after a moment the keeper appeared to go back to its work kitai turned toward tavi his motions very very slow graceful he gestured toward tavi with his hand every movement smooth and circular and rolling exaggerated then he turned and began to walk away silent and slow his steps flowing almost as though in a dance tavi swallowed and turned to follow kitai struggling to emulate the marat boys steps kitai walked before him close to the stone wall of the chasm and tavi followed until they were several dozen yards away from the keeper tavi felt its presence behind him bizarre and unworldly disturbing as the legs of a fly prickling along the nape of his neck when they were out of its sight he felt himself relaxing and moving closer to kitai out of reflex as different as the other boy might be he was more familiar more friendly than that buglike creature entombing the crow within the glowing wax kitai looked back over his shoulder at tavi and then past him eyes wide there was something in themtightly controlled terror tavi thought he thought that kitai looked a bit relieved to see tavi standing so close to him and the two boys exchanged a silent nod of acknowledgment to one another tavi felt the understanding between them without words needing to be said truce kitai let out a breath slowly you must be quiet he said whispering and move smoothly they see sudden motions tavi swallowed and whispered were safe if were still kitais face grew a shade paler he shook his head giving the gesture a circular accent to smooth it out theyve found even those who were still ive seen it tavi frowned they must have some other way of seeing smell hearing something kitai rolled his head in the negative again i dont know we do not stay where they are to learn of them he looked around and shivered we must be careful it called others will come to search they will be slow for now but the keepers will come tavi nodded and had to swallow and force himself to make the gesture slowly not in nervous jerks what should we do kitai nodded toward the ancient tree rising from the center of the forest we continue the trial aleran uh maybe we shouldnt i will continue aleran if you are too afraid to go on then stay his lips curled in a mischievous sneer it is what i would expect of a child i am not a child tavi hissed furiously im older than you what are you twelve years old thirteen kitai narrowed his eyes fifteen he hissed tavi stared at the other boy for a moment then started smiling he had to struggle not to break out into sudden laughter kitais scowl deepened what tavi rolled his head in a slow negative and whispered nothing nothing mad kitai said you people are mad with that he turned and glided deeper into the glowing forest tavi followed close behind him frowning struggling to keep the irrational laughter from his lips his steps silent after theyd put several dozen more yards between them and the keeper theyd seen he reached back and unslung the pack fade had pressed onto him from his shoulders he opened it and rummaged inside the pack contained two small jars of fine lamp oil firestones in their twochambered black box a small lantern a box of fine shavings to serve as tinder for a fire dried meat twisted into braids in a fashion odd to tavi two fine warm blankets several slender lengths of wood that could be fitted together into a fishing pole lines and fine metal hooks and at the bottom of the pack a cruel curved knife heavy and with a spiked guard that covered the knuckles it had a blade twice the length of tavis entire hand a combat weapon where had fade got something like that tavi wondered why had the slave had this pack stored with such efficiency inside his chambers presumably ready to go at a moments notice he had returned with the pack so quickly that he could not possibly have packed it it had to have been ready to go tavi shook his head and almost bumped into kitai who had come to a sudden stop in front of him he came to a halt close enough to the other boy that he could feel the nearly feverish heat of the marats body what is it he whispered kitai shivered and moved his head almost imperceptibly tavi looked to his left moving only his eyes a keeper squatted on a gnarled root that rose from the forest floor draped in a mantle of glowing croach not ten feet away tavi looked the other way seeking the nearest means of moving away from the keeper a second spiderlike creature sat on a low waxshrouded branch on level with tavis head it let out a highpitched chirrup bobbing up and down on its knobby limbs the first keeper answered it in a different pitch it too began to bob in fluid steady motions other chirrups sounded from around them out of sight many of them a great many tavi shuddered he hardly breathed as he whispered what do we do i kitai shivered again and tavi saw that the other boys eyes were wide panicked i do not know tavis eyes flicked back to the nearest of the two keepers it shook its head pale eyes peering this way and that twitching in independent motion a dark dot at their center the only thing that resembled a pupil then as tavi watched something strange happened the keepers eyes changed color right there before his own they changed from a pale shade of maggotwhite to something as bright orange as a candles flame in that instant the keeper went deathly still both eyes swung to orient on the boys and it let out a piercingly loud whistle something that sounded like a mad birds scream kitais breath caught in his throat and the boy leapt forward tavis eyes swept left and right and he saw what the keepers did very clearly the further keepers eyes swirled to orange as well and oriented immediately upon kitais form it too let out a shrill shrieking scream and mirroring the first started after the marat boy with a deceptively languid deadly grace in that moment tavi saw exactly how the keepers had detected them and how they might be able to thwart them kitai he shouted and then bounded after the other boy wait more shrill whistles went up all around them as tavi raced to catch up with kitai it was all but impossible the marat boy carried no pack and moved with the grace and speed of a terrified deer tavi could barely keep the marat in sight as he ranand all around him gathered the glowing orange eyes of the wax spiders standing out in sharp contrast to the green glow of the croach if kitai hadnt tripped on a sudden dip in the croach perhaps where one of the wax spiders had recently raised itself up out of it tavi didnt think hed have caught up to the other boy instead he swooped down and hauled kitai to his feet by the boys wild hair ow kitai hissed eyes wild shut up tavi said his voice sharp follow me kitai blinked in startled surprise and tavi gave the boy no time to argue with him he looked to his left and darted forward tugging the other boy forward a few steps to get him moving then sprinting as quickly as he could toward the rocky wall of the chasm a keeper suddenly appeared on the ground in front of them tavi stifled his fear and kept running at the creature the wax spider reared up onto its rear sets of legs as tavi approached but before he reached it the boy began a spin holding the heavy pack out in both arms the pack almost pulled him off balance but instead he took a pair of whirling steps and felt the weight of the pack slam hard into the creature the keeper was lighter than it looked the blow threw it to one side and slammed it hard into the wax surrounding a tree it crumpled into the impact legs curling up around it tavi ran on and behind him around them the chirps of the keepers grew louder more shrill filled with what tavi imagined must have been a chill and alien anger they reached the stony cliff face both of them panting tavi dropped the pack long enough to put both hands against the stone staring up and then to either side of the face studying the dark stone as best he could in the faint light of the glowing croach the ropes are far from here hissed kitai there is no escape for us we dont need escape tavi said he pressed his mouth to the stone and touched his tongue to it briefly then spat out the sour taste of lime this way he said he picked up his pack and continued on through the green light of the wax forest the rocky wall on his left he dug in the pack as he went they are surrounding us kitai said voice cool boxing us in we dont need to get much farther tavi said he tossed back one of the jars of oil to kitai hold that the marat caught the jar awkwardly then scowled at tavi as they both ran on what is this hold it a minute tavi said i have an idea orange eyes flickered on his right and tavi didnt see the keeper hurtling toward him until it was already halfway there kitais foot kicked at his own and sent him stumbling to the forest floor the spider hurtled over him missing him by a hair it landed on the wall its legs clinging to the nearly vertical surface then spun on all of its legs whistling its mandibles clicked and snapped against its carapace tavi watched as kitai drew his stone knife and hurled it the glassy blade entered the creatures head drawing a sudden fount of greenish glowing fluid mixed in with something dark and acrid smelling the keeper hurled its body out again but unguided it simply bucked in a high arch and landed on the ground twitching and convulsing kitai hauled tavi to his feet and said i hope it is a good idea aleran tavi felt himself quivering with terror and nodded jerkily yeah yeah so do i he started running again kitai close behind him the sound of trickling water came to tavi a moment later and he lengthened his strides leaping over another twisted root before him the rock wall had parted in a long narrow fissure water trickled out of it in a slow steady stream meltwater from the ambient heat of the croach at the base of the fissure was a long narrow pool an area where the croach had not grown over the bare earth the pool looked hideously dark and tavi could not see how deep it was we cannot climb this aleran panted kitai another shriek sounded from near at hand and kitai twisted in place body crouching in tension shut up tavi said give me the oil he took the jar from kitais hand jerked the broad cork out of its mouth he turned to the area behind himself and kitai and stomped hard on the ground several times breaking the surface of the wax and drawing out more of the sludgy glowing fluid more outraged chittering shrieks rose through the glowing forest what are you doing hissed kitai you show them where we are yes tavi said exactly he dumped the oil onto the croach into the depression his boots had made and took the firestone box into his hand he opened the two separate chambers and took the firestones into his hand kneeling beside the oil he looked up to see the glowing orange dots of dozens of eyes closing in on him with that same weird alien grace knobby legs rippling across the surface of the croach whatever you are doing kitai halfshouted hurry tavi waited until the eyes were close and then he reached down to the oil and struck the firestones together they sparked brightly glowing motes falling down into the spilled oil one of them found a spot where the oil was not deep enough to drown it and in a rush the whole of the small pool took sudden brilliant flame fire leapt up from the depression in the croach as high as tavis chest the boy recoiled from the flames grabbed kitai by the marat boys onepiece smock and hauled him toward the pool they tumbled into the cold water together and tavi pulled them both down the water was shallow no more than thigh deep and viciously chill tavi and kitai gasped together at the cold then the aleran boy stared at the keepers the wax spiders had gone mad at the kindling of the fire those nearest to him had fallen back and were scuttling in circles letting out high pitched shrieks others farther back had begun to bob up and down in confusion or fear letting out highpitched interrogative chirrups none of them seemed to see either of the boys in the pool it worked tavi hissed quick here he reached into the pack and drew out both blankets he shoved one at kitai then took his own and dipped it into the water a moment later he lifted it and draped it over his shoulders and head shivering a bit with the cold quick he said cover up kitai stared at him what are you doing he hissed we should run while we have a chance quick cover up why their eyes tavi said when they were close to us the color of their eyes changed they saw you and not me what do you mean they saw your heat tavi stammered lips shaking with the cold the marat your people feel like they have a fever to me youre hotter the spiders saw you then when i lit the fire you blinded them kitai said eyes widening so soak your blanket in the water and cover up clever kitai said with admiration in his voice with a quick motion he jerked the hem of his smock up out of the water in an effort to avoid wetting any more of it he tugged it over his hips then bent to dip the blanket in the water and shroud himself as tavi had done tavi stared at the marat in sudden shock kitai blinked back at tavi what is it i dont believe it tavi said he felt his face flush and he turned away from kitai drawing the soaked blanket further about his face oh crows i dont believe it dont believe what aleran kitai demanded in a whisper youre a girl chapter kitai frowned pale brows drawing together i am what youre a girl tavi accused no kitai said in a fierce whisper i am a whelp until they bond all marat children are whelps after i bond to a totemthen i will be a young female until then i am a whelp like any other your ways are not our ways aleran tavi stared at her but youre a girl kitai rolled her eyes get over it valleyboy she started to stand and move slowly up out of the water wait tavi hissed he lifted a hand to block her way what wait until theyve gone if you go out there now theyll see you but i am covered by the cold blanket and if you walk in front of that fire youll be the only cold thing there tavi said stay here and be still and quiet when the fire dies down theyll spread out to look for us again and well have our chance kitai frowned but slowly settled back into the water our chance to do what tavi swallowed to get inside to that big tree dont be foolish kitai said though there was a reluctant weight to her words the keepers are roused no one has ever gone to the tree and come out again when the keepers had been stirred from sleep we would die you forget im going to die anyway he frowned but it might be just as well i dont want to lead a girl into that kind of danger the marat girl scowled as if i am any less able to defeat you now than a few moments ago tavi shook his head no no it isnt that then what is it he shrugged beneath the blanket i cant explain it we justwe dont treat our women the same way we do our men thats stupid said kitai just as it is stupid for us to pursue the trial if neither of us comes back with the blessing the trial is inconclusive theyll wait until a new moon and hold it again you will be dorogas guest until then valleyboy you will be safe tavi frowned and swallowed thinking part of him had all but let out a shout of relief he could get out of this bizarre chasm with its alien creatures and return to the world above it wasnt a friendly one among the marat but it was living and he would at least be kept alive and unharmed until the next trial he could survive but the new moon wouldnt be for weeks the marat would move long before then attack garrison and then the steadholts in the valley beyond including his own home for a moment tavis imagination conjured up an image of returning to bernardholt to find it deserted thick with the stench of rotten meat and burned hair to open one of the swinging gates and see a cloud of carrion crows hurtle into the air leaving the bodies of people he had known his whole life ravaged and unrecognizable on the cold earth his aunt his uncle frederic beritte old bitte and so many others his legs started shakingnot with cold but with the sudden realization that he could not turn his back on them now if returning with that stupid mushroom meant that he would gain his family even a better chance to survive what was coming then he could do nothing less than everything in his power to retrieve it he couldnt back down now he couldnt run now even though it meant he might go into mortal danger he might wind up like that crow sealed into the croach devoured alive for a moment the pale colored eyes of the keepers haunted his mind there had been so many of them there still were gathered all around the nowguttering fire crawling mindlessly over one another in all directions their long knobby legs falling featherlight onto the surface of the croach their leathery shells made squeaking sounds as they crowded close rubbed against one another and they smelled something pungent and acrid and inexplicably alien even as he realized that he could smell them tavi felt the hairs on the back of his neck prickle up and his shivering increased in reaction i have to go tavi said youll die kitai said simply it cannot be done im going she shrugged and said it is your life to waste look at you you are shaking hard enough to rattle your teeth but her odd opalescent eyes stayed on him intent curious she didnt speak the question but tavi all but heard her ask why he took a shuddering breath it doesnt matter doesnt matter that im afraid i have to get that mushroom and get out again its the only thing i can do to help my family kitai stared at him in silence for a long moment then she nodded once an expression of comprehension coming over her features now i understand valleyboy she said quiet she looked around them and said i do not wish to die my family is not at stake freedom from my sire is useless to me if i am dead tavi chewed on his lip thinking then he said kitai is there any reason that we cant both get the blessing what happens if we both get back with it at the same time kitai frowned then it will be assumed that the one tells us there is merit in either sides argument she said the headman will be free to decide on his own wait tavi said his heart pounding faster you mean that youd get out from under your father and he would be free to lead your people away from the battle with mine kitai blinked at tavi and then smiled slowly by the one yes that was his plan all along she blinked her abruptly shining eyes several times and said fiercely the problem is that doroga does not seem to be clever no wonder my mother loved him then we work together tavi said he offered the girl his hand she glanced down at his hand frowned at him and then mimicked the gesture her hand was slim hot strong tavi shook and said it means we agree to work together very well kitai said what do you think we should do tavi shot a glance back to the keepers who were slowly randomly dispersing again crawling away in different directions and at different speeds i have a plan an hour later tavi covered with the soaked and chilly blanket moved in silence over the smooth surface of the croach his pace never varying he kept count to himself as he walked one pace per count he was near five hundred a keeper walked perhaps ten feet in front of him on a slow and steady pace toward the great tree at the center of the chasm tavi had followed it for several minutes without it turning to look at him or giving any indication that it sensed his presence he had become more confident that he had determined how the things would detect him so long as he was careful to be quiet and moved smoothly he was effectively invisible the enormous tree loomed closer and closer though the more tavi could see of it the less certain he was that tree was the right word to describe it though the rest of the forest was covered in a sheath of the greenly glowing croach this one tree smooth sided branchless straight was only covered to a height of ten or fifteen feet the trunk was enormous fully as big around as bernardholts walls it didnt look like it had any bark at alljust smooth wood that reached up to a height of more than a hundred feet before ending in round irregular edges as though the tree had been snapped off by some giant hand then had its rough edges smoothed by time at the base of the tree there was a cavernous opening a sloped and irregular triangle where the trunk parted allowing entrance to the interior tavi paused and watched the keeper he had been following it paced slowly into the trees interior and as it passed within another keeper moved out on the other side of the opening as though it were a tunnel in the causeway tavi stopped for a few moments and watched shortly the keeper hed been following or another like it came out of the tree in exactly the same place still another came creeping in from another direction and entered the tree in exactly the same manner as the first emerging again a few moments later the keepers must have been taking something into the tree but what something small if they were just scuttling in and out like ants in and out of their hills food water what did they carry tavi shook his head and touched the blanket with his fingertips though it was still cool it didnt feel as cold as it had a few minutes ago the air down here in the chasm was just too warm he had to hurry he knew because with each passing moment his method of concealment became less effective tavi struggled to calm the pounding of his heart what if these bugs were smarter than he thought what if they had only allowed him to come this far because they wanted him there anyway what if they just wanted to get him to a place where he could not escape and would then leap on him and devour him and what he thought could possibly be there inside that tree what would be there that the keepers would be carrying something to if they were like ants existing in a colony where some carried food and some fought and so on would they have a queen like ants did if so would she be inside the tree at the heart of their domain a dozen more questions flicked through tavis mind before he realized that he was doing nothing but wasting his time he didnt have any answers to any of the questions and he wouldnt get the answers standing in place all he would get would be warmer more vulnerable he kept counting in his head and reached five hundred tavi all but held his breath poised to flee if the plan went wrong though he knew that his chances of escaping from the heart of the chasm were slim indeed tavi waited and waited nothing happened he felt his heart begin to race as panic crept over him had kitai abandoned him and her own part of the plan had something gone wrong had she been found and killed before the time limit was up could she even count to five hundred what had gone wrong tavi remained still and kept counting deciding to give her another hundred counts before he fled then the stillness and silence of the wax forest dissolved into a symphony of whistling shrieks if tavi had not seen it happening he would never have believed that so many of the keepers could be so close to him without his knowledge of them they erupted from everywhere from every surface where the croach glowed ripping their way up out of the waxy forest floor dropping from the glowing branches of the twisted trees boiling out of the interior of the great tree trunk itself hundreds of them appeared and the air itself shook with their whistles and clicks and the squeak of shell rubbing on shell tavi froze panicked it was everything he could do to keep from bolting at the sheer speed with which they had appeared one of the keepers swept past him almost close enough to brush against his soaked cloak they all swarmed off in the same directionthat opposite of the one that lead back to the ropes to the world above kitai had done her job tavi decided she must have been keeping a slower count than tavi had she had used half of their remaining oil and the firestones to light a blaze that would draw the keepers if she was all right and had kept to the plan she would even now be huddled beneath her blanket moving for the ropes out the last of the keepers in sight fled vanishing into the glowing trees all that remained was for tavi to accomplish his part of the plan a lump crept up into his throat and his knees felt like someone had simply slipped the muscles and tendons out of them he thought that they might abruptly buckle and pitch him to the surface of the croach at any time he was so afraid he struggled to keep his breathing slow and quiet to make sure that his trembling didnt result in any twitches that the keepers would see as sudden jerky movement and stepped forward into the trunk of the tree inside the croach wasnt in a smooth layer on the floor and wallsit was spilled and dumped and heaped and piled like wheat in a granary great swirling loops of it twirled up the walls or wound intricately through one another like the guts of some great and glowing beast tavi stared at them for a moment in confusion and incomprehension it was beautiful in a bizarre alien waystrange and unsettling and fascinating he jerked his eyes from one of the more intricate structures and moved closer to a wall where it would be less likely for a newly entered keeper to simply bump into him looking around struggling to orient himself according to kitais description he paced deeper into the eerie stillness inside the tree around a mound of whirled croach that looked like an anthill and forward through a small field of lumpy croach which could have contained another thousand keepers silent beneath the surface he found the mushrooms in a ring at the center of the field just as kitai had said they grew at the base of a glowing mound twice the height of a man as big around as a small house the mound pulsed with greenish light and tavi thought he could see the shadow of something dark something slender within he drew closer a sensation of raw dread flowing over him like an icy bath even worse than the soaked blanket he wore as a cloak his knees grew weaker and his breathing despite his best efforts became ragged kitai was rather pretty he thought though she was a savage there was something about her face her eyes that he found intriguing if she wasnt dressed up in a ragged smock which really was shamefully short now that he thought about it she might look more like a girl less wild of course he had begun to see her without the smock if he had told her to get more into the water she might have taken it off altogether the thought made his cheeks burn but lingered in front of him enticing in its exotic appeal tavi shook his head abruptly what was the matter with him he had to be careful and get the blessing of night the dark mushrooms had some kind of spiny thorns on their undersides kitai had said which had pierced her hand once and left welts that lasted for months he glanced up and around him but saw no keepers that could be an illusion he knew there could be a dozen within arms reach but no matter how afraid he was tavi had to press on that was the history of his people after all the alerans had never let fear or the odds of failure deter them from overcoming prospering their oldest histories his uncle had once told him reached so far back into time that the hide and vellum and stone they had been scribed upon had worn away they had come to carna from another place a small hand of only a few thousand and had found themselves pitched against an entire world they had overcome the icemen the children of the sun and their stronghold in the feverthorn jungle had repelled the marat and the canim over the centuries to claim the land of alera as their own they controlled the seas around their home had walled out the icemen in the north overcome the marat through sheer savage fighting with their furies and their furycrafting the alerans dominated the world and no other race or peoples could claim mastery over them tavi shuddered and blinked his eyes several times he must have stood there his hand extended toward the first of the mushrooms for nearly a full minute not moving what was the matter with him the hairs on the back of his neck prickled up more sharply as he reached for the nearest mushrooms he hurried breath rasping picking one then another careful to put them into the pouch at his belt and then he thought he saw something in the great mound in front of him move tavi jerked his eyes up to it flinching and felt an immediate hot pain in the fingers of his hand the thorns on the next mushroom had pierced him he jerked his hand back and droplets of his blood flashed out and arced through the air sprinkling the glowing mound in front of him tavi stared at the mound the droplets of his blood on it the surface of the glowing croach abruptly pulsed bulged and then rippled beneath the droplets of his blood moving like the skin of some hideous enormous creature and making tavis own flesh crawl in response he watched as the droplets of blood vanished into the mound sinking into the surface of the croach like snowflakes into a stillmelted pond and the shadowy shape within the mound abruptly shuddered and moved a slow unwinding of limbs languid liquid as though from a sleeper that had after an endless passing of seasons finally awakened it moved and tavi felt its movement felt a vast bewildering awareness that swept over him like the gaze of some ancient and horrible beast terror flooded over tavi raw and hot rather than cold terror that set his limbs on fire and burned any thought from his mind save one escape tavi spun on his heel and heedless of the danger in revealing himself broke into a panicked sprint he would remember little of his run later one or two chirruping whistles perhaps echoed through the trees after him but they were sparse and he left them behind him his steps light on the surface of the croach terror lending him more speed than he would have credited to himself before that night he flicked one glance over his shoulder as he ran and saw something through the glowing trees at the base of the monolith the opening hed fled through he saw something tall glisteningalien it stood just within the central tree just behind the doorway tavi could not quite see it but he could feel it in a way both horribly intimate and beyond simple description the lowerpitched whistle that went out through the trees felt to tavi like some sort of hideous mocking laughter tavi fled and did not look back again he ran over the croach until his legs were burning and his limbs felt as though they would be ripped apart by the demands he placed on them he almost didnt see the strip of blanket that he had torn off and tied to a low tree branch before he left to mark his way back he headed for it and from that flag spotted the next and the next laying out his escape route back to the ropes at the base of the cliff aleran came a voice from before him kitai dropped from a tree branch ahead of him do you have it got two tavi yelped couldnt get any more kitai extended her hand and tavi shoved one of the mushrooms into it run go go go kitai nodded once then stooped to the ground tavi hesitated behind the girl dancing in place as he looked back over his shoulder hurry he panted hurry hurry hurry kitai drew out the firestones smoothly her expression cool and struck them together sparks fell from the stones onto the oilsoaked blanket that lay on the croach before them kitai watched the flames leap up then moved quickly reaching up to grab the end of the fishing line that tavi had soaked in the icy water before he left she jerked the line toward her hand over hand the other end of the line looped up over one of the higher branches of the tree up where living leaves grew above the grasp of the croach and then fell back down to where it was tied at one corner of the oilsoaked blanket kitai hauled the line in and the blazing blanket rose up into the trees branches and snagged among the living leaves fire leapt up from the tree in a blaze sudden and high and once again from the direction of the central spire whistling shrieks rose up in a solid wall of terrifying soundone underlaid this time by that deeper whistle one that overrode the shrieks and continued over the silence kitai stared at tavi her eyes suddenly wide what is that i dont know tavi said but uh i think uh i think i woke it up they looked at one another once more and in silent accord turned together and fled toward the ropes a few yards away toward the safety at the top of the cliffs to either side of him tavi saw the keepers flooding toward the fire through the trees closing on them in a carpet of glowing eyes and knobby limbs and leathery shells tavi had reached the ropes and kitai was only a few paces behind when something dropped down from one of the crouch shrouded trees above them something tall and slender and horribly fast whatever it was it wasnt a keeper because it reached out with one long limb and wrapped hardlooking chitmous fingers around kitais ankle hauling her to the ground the girl let out a scream of sudden terror and twisted in that grip tavi only saw what happened in bits and pieces he remembered turning to see something that he thought was like some kind of hideous wasp semitransparent wings fluttering in the glowing light of the crouch it bent over kitai weirdly humped shoulders flexing as its head whipped down as mandibles sunk into her thigh kitai let out a horrible scream and struck down at the things head with her fists once twice then her eyes rolled back in her head and her body started jerking and twisting in helpless spasm limbs flailing she kept trying to scream but the sound came out broken irregular the waspthing covered in the glowing slime of the croach lifted its head and let out a signalwhistle that echoed around the chasm like the tones of some vast bell it shook blood from its mandibles and tavi caught a flash of multifaceted eyes of some kind of yellowish fluid at the edges of kitais wounds valleyboy shouted a distant voice tavi looked up to see doroga one hand on the rope leaning far out over the cliff and even from so far below tavi could see that his face was anguished aleran you cannot save her come up tavi looked back and forth between doroga and the marat girl on the ground the horrible thing crouched over her twitching body terror rose through him a horrible taste in his mouth and he couldnt see couldnt seem to focus his eyes one hand tightened on the rope in helpless frustration kitai had saved his life she had trusted his plan to get them both out of the chasm alive he was the only one who could help her tavi let go of the rope he turned and ran not toward the thing crouched over kitai but past it around several glowing trees and to the one they had set on fire keepers crowded in all around him he could hear them coming through the forest toward him shrieks and whistles resounding tavi leapt up to the lowest branches of the tree hauling himself into them and started scrambling toward the top toward the fire halfway there he hauled himself up and found himself facetoface with a keeper which reared back from him in surprise its mandibles clacking against its shell tavi didnt have time to think his hand flashed to where hed put fades wickedly curved knife at his belt he slashed it at the creatures eyes it scuttled back from him tavi followed it wriggling forward thrusting the knife at the things face the keeper let out a shriek and fell backward out of the tree its limbs flailing it hit the ground twenty feet below with a crunch and a wetsounding splat and tavi looked down to see it writhing on its back legs flailing its broken body trailing glowing fluids out onto the forest floor tavi heard more keepers coming he hauled himself up higher into the tree until he reached a branch bare of the crouch slender and unable to support his weight farther out along the branch hung the burning blanket fire spread along it toward the trunk of the tree tavi hacked at the branch with the knife the steel biting into the soft wood then he gripped the knife in his teeth and hauled at the branch with both hands it swayed and then broke peeling away from the tree tavi scrambled down trailing the long branch with its flaming leaves the oilsoaked blanket and when he had reached the forest floor he ran toward kitai the thing crouched over her saw him coming and turned toward him with a hiss its mandibles spreading wide along with its chitmous arms though its eyes glittered and reflected the light of the fire from a thousand facets it had a horribly slimecovered unfinished look to it as though it hadnt finished becoming whatever it was to be halfborn halfalive the huge waspthing rattled its wings in a furious buzzing sound and whistled to the keepers around them tavi screamed and swung the branch in a broad clumsy arc fire trailing the thing hissed and drew back from the flames jerking its wings back sharply tavi seized on the advantage shoving forward with the branch and driving the hissing monstrosity back from kitais still form the girl lay pale and silent her eyes open but unmoving her chest heaving in labored breaths tavi slipped an arm beneath her and in a rush of terror hauled her up onto his shoulder he staggered beneath her weight but grasped the branch and spun about wildly swinging the blazing wood and leaves and blanket about him the creature leapt lightly away from him landing on the wall several yards down from the ropes horrible eyes focused intently on him oh crows tavi thought it knows it knows im going for the ropes if he didnt move he was finished even if the creature didnt leap on him he would shortly be drowning in keepers even his terrified strength was be ginning to fade his body to burn under all the effort he had to get kitai to the ropes at least he could tie her foot and doroga could haul her up doroga tavi looked up to the top of the cliff and saw dorogas pale form there staring down at them then the gargant headman shouted courage valleyboy and vanished back over the lip of the cliff there was still a chance shoving the branch in front of him along the ground he rushed toward the creature which scuttled nimbly up the wall a crablike sideways motion tavi looked above it to an outcropping of rock no good he had to get it to move toward him toward the ropes tavi ground his teeth in frustration on the blade of the knife oh furies kitai i hope this works gracelessly he dumped the girl onto the ground then leapt toward and grabbed the nearest rope and started climbing the creature let out a whistle and scuttled toward him he knew that he did not have a chance of escaping it or of fighting it there on the ropes but he took the knife from his teeth and swiped it at the thing it paused hesitating just out of his reach its horrible head tilted as though assessing this new threat doroga tavi screamed there it is there it is from above came a slow and tortured scream bellowing in dorogas basso filled with anger and defiance tavi would never have believed that a man could lift a boulder that large but doroga appeared at the top of the cliff again bearing a stone the size of a coffin over his head arms and shoulders and thighs bulging with effort he flexed the whole of his body a ponderous motion and the huge stone hurtled down toward the creature its head abruptly whirled on its neck whipping around to face directly behind it the creature moved its wings buzzing but it was not fast enough to wholly escape the plummeting stone it flashed by tavi missing him by the breadth of a few fingers the creature leapt away from the wall but the stone crushed against it sending it spinning out of the air to land on the ground many yards away the stone itself hit the ground and shattered chips of rock flying glowing slime from within the croach hurled into the air as from a fountain hot pain flashed along tavis leg and he looked down to see his trousers cut by a flying piece of stone blood on his leg from above came dorogas defiant howl of triumph a bellowing roar that shook the walls of the chasm the creature let out another whistle this one higher filled with fury and tavi thought with sudden fear it staggered but could not rise and instead began dragging itself back into the trees as the glowing eyes of dozens of keepers began to appear behind it tavi dropped the knife slid down the rope and ran to kitai he seized her and began dragging her back toward the ropes grunting with effort but moving quickly jerking her over the ground aleran she whispered opening her eyes her expression was pained weary aleran too late venom my father tell him i was sorry tavi stared down at her no he whispered kitai no were almost out it was a good plan she said her head lolled to one side eyes rolling back no tavi hissed suddenly furious no crows take you you cant he reached into his pouch fumbling through it as tears started to blur his vision there must be something she couldnt just die she couldnt they were so close something stuck sharply into his finger and pain flashed through him again the crowseaten mushroom had jabbed him with its spines the blessing of night fever poison injury pain even age it has power over them all to our people there is nothing of greater value weeping tavi seized the mushroom and started tearing off the spines with his fingers heedless of the pain shrieks rose all around him came closer though the stillblazing branch seemed to have confused some of the keepers to have temporarily slowed their advance tavi reached down and slipped an arm beneath kitais head halfhauling her up he reached down to the wound over her thigh and crushed the mushroom in his hand mustyscented clear fluid leaked out from between his fingers and dribbled over the wound mixing with blood and yellowish venom kitais leg twitched as the fluid touched it and the girl drew in a sudden breath tavi lifted the rest of the mushroom to her lips and pressed it into her mouth eat it he urged her eat it you have to eat it kitais mouth twitched once and then began to chew automatically she swallowed the mushroom and blinked her eyes slowly open focusing them on tavi time stopped tavi found himself staring down at the girl suddenly aware of her entirely aware of her in a way he never had been aware of anyone before he could feel the texture of her skin beneath his hand and felt the abrupt compulsion to lay his fingers over her chest to feel the beat of her heart beneath it slowly gaining in strength he could feel the surge of blood in her veins the fear and regret and confusion that filled her thoughts those cleared as her eyes focused on him widened and tavi realized that she had felt his own presence in the same way not moving her eyes from his kitai reached out a hand and touched his chest in response fingers pressed close to feel the beating of his heart it took tavi a frozen endless moment to separate the beating of his own heart the rush of blood in his own ears from hers they beat together perfectly in time even as he realized it his own heartbeat began to speed and so did hers bringing a flush of heat to his face one answered in her own expression he stared at the wonder in her eyes and saw that it could only be a reflection of that in his own the scent of her fresh and wild curled up around him through him like something alive the shape of her eyes her cheeks her mouth in that single moment he saw in her the promise of the beauty that would come in time the strength that had still to grow the courage and reckless resourcefulness that matched his own and flamed wild and true in her the intensity of it made his eyes blur and he blinked them tried to clear the tears from them only to realize that kitai was blinking as well her eyes filling with tears going liquid and blurry when tavi had blinked the tears away his eyes returned to hersonly to find not opalescent swirls of subtle shifting color but wide pools of deep emerald green eyes as green as his own oh no kitai whispered her voice stunned weak oh no she opened her mouth started to sit upthen shuddered once and slumped in his arms abruptly overwhelmed with exhaustion the frozen moment ended tavi lifted his dazed head to see the first of the keepers edging past the blazing blanket and branch tavi hauled himself to his feet lifting kitai and stumbled toward the ropes he stepped into the loop at the base of one then reached over to the other and wrapped it around his waist around her legs tying her to him even before he was finished doroga had started hauling the rope up the face of the cliff the other rope came in as well where hashat must have been pulling it along to keep it tight tavi held on to the rope and to kitai not really sure which one he held tighter he closed his eyes overwhelmed and did not open them again until he and kitai sat at the top of the cliff in the cold fresh clean snow when he opened his eyes again he sat with his back against a stone and idly noted the fresh earth beside him where doroga had uprooted the boulder and hurled it down a moment later he realized that kitai lay against his side beneath one of his arms warm and limp halfconscious he tightened his arm on her gently confusedbut certain that he wanted her to sleep to rest and to be right where she was tavi looked up and found hashat staring down at them wideeyed her expression bewildered and then by slow degrees becoming indignant she turned to doroga and demanded what are you going to do about this the headman veins still standing out on his arms and thighs tipped his head back and poured out a rich and rolling laugh you know as well as i hashat its done the horse headman scowled and folded her arms over her chest ive never heard of such a thing she said this is unacceptable this is doroga rumbled other matters are before us now hashat flipped her mane out of her eyes with a toss of her head i dont like it she said her tone resigned this was a trick you tricked me dorogas eyes glittered and a smile lurked at his lips but he said in a stern tone keep your mind on why we are here hashat the trial the marat woman said and turned back to tavi well aleran did you recover the blessing tavi shivered and felt abruptly stupid he had forgotten in all the excitement and confusion he had forgotten the trial he had forgotten that he had used the mushroom hed needed to win on kitai and though he may have saved the girls life he had lost the trial his own life was forfeit and the marat united would ride against the people of his home i tavi said he reached toward his pouchand felt warm fingers inside tavi looked down and saw kitai drawing her hand back out of his pouch her eyes blinked open once toward his and he felt more than saw the silent gratitude in them the respect for his courage but it was so stupid she whispered then she closed her eyes again wordlessly tavi reached inside his pouch and found the second blessing of night where kitai had left it he drew it out on fingers already pricked and bleeding and offered it to doroga doroga knelt down on both knees in front of tavi and accepted the blessing his expression grave he looked down at the mushroom then at kitais thigh the yellowish venom drying there his eyes widened with sudden realization then went back to tavi dorogas head tilted to one side staring at him and the boy felt certain that gargant headman knew exactly what had happened in the alien valley below doroga reached out and laid one huge hand on kitais pale hair for a moment eyes gentle then he looked back at tavi and said i loved her mother very much kitai is all i have left of her you have courage aleran you risked your life to save hers and in doing so you have saved not one but two whom i love who are my family the marat rose to his full height and reached down his hand to tavi you have protected my family my home the one demands that i repay you for that debt aleran tavi drew in a sharp breath and looked from doroga to hashat the horse warriors eyes gleamed with a sudden excitement and she drew in a breath laying one of her hands on the hilt of her saber come young man doroga said quietly my daughter needs to rest and if i am to repay you i have work to do will you come with me tavi took a breath and when he spoke his voice sounded to him to be deeper more steady than hed heard it before for once it didnt waver or crack i will come with you he took dorogas hand the huge marat headman showed his teeth in a sudden fierce smile and hauled tavi to his feet chapter amara took off her belt in pure frustration and used the buckle to rap hard against the bars in the tiny window of the cell shed been thrown into guard she shouted trying to force authority into her tone guard come down here at once wont do any good bernard said stretched out on the pallet against the far wall of the room they cant hear anything down here its been hours amara said pacing back and forth in front of the door what could that idiot pluvus be waiting for bernard rubbed at his beard with one hand depends how gutless he is she stopped to look at him what do you mean bernard shrugged if hes ambitious hes going to send out his own people to find out whats going on hell try to exploit the situation to his advantage you dont think he is not like that no odds are hes got gram put in a bed somewhere and hes dispatched a courier to carry word to riva informing them of the situation and asking for instructions amara spat out an oath there isnt time for that hell have thought of it hes got knights aeris around the perimeter of the valley to intercept any airborne couriers he the man at the ford the one who shot at tavi though his tone didnt change much bernards words held a note of bleak determination amara folded her arms over her chest and leaned against the door exhausted frustrated if it would have helped shed have started crying yes fidelias the bitter venom in her own voice surprised even her and she repeated the name more quietly fidelias bernard turned his head to look at her for a long quiet moment you know him she nodded once do you want to talk about it amara swallowed he is he was my teacher my patriserus bernard sat up frowning hes a cursor was amara said hes thrown in with someone a rebel she flushed her face heating i probably shouldnt say any more steadholder you dont have to he assured her and call me bernard as long as were stuck in a storage closet together i think we can skip the titles there wont be room for all of us she gave him a weak smile bernard then he was your friend this fidelias she nodded looking away from him quiet more than that amara flushed if hed have let it happen i was about thirteen when i started training with him and he was everything he didnt though he didnt she let her voice trail off he didnt want to take advantage of you bernard suggested at amaras flustered silence he said i can appreciate that in a man hes good she said i mean skilled one of the crowns best hes got more missions on record than any cursor alive and there are rumors of many more that were never recorded some of the things hes done are in textbooks hes saved the lives of thousands of people who never even knew he was there she swallowed and if youd asked me a week ago i would never have dreamed that there could be a man more loyal to the realm she heard her voice grow bitter again a patriot maybe thats the problem bernard said pensive amara frowned and looked at him what do you mean theres two kinds of bad men in the world i mean theres all kinds of ways for a man to go bad but when you get right down to it theres only about two kinds of men who will hurt others with forethought premeditation men that dont figure theres anyone else alive who matters but them and men who figure that theres something that matters more than anyones life even their own he shook his head first one is common enough petty small theyre everywhere people who just dont give a scorched crow about anyone else mostly the bad they do doesnt amount to much the second kind is like your patriserus people who hold something dear above their own lives above anyone elses theyll fight to protect it and kill to protect it and the whole time theyll be thinking to themselves that it has to be done that its the right thing to do bernard glanced up at her and said dangerous those very dangerous amara nodded yes hes dangerous who said bernard rumbled eyes steady that i was talking about fidelias amara looked up at him sharply it all comes down to people you cant have a realm or an ideal without people to believe in it support it the realm exists to protect people seems kind of backward to me to sacrifice people to protect it its just not that simple steadholder isnt it remember who taught you bernard said his voice gentle the words clear firm right now hes out there and he probably thinks hes doing the only thing he can crows he probably thinks hes doing the right thing that hes in a position to know when others dont and so its his choice to make and no one elses she pushed her hair back from her face how do i know that he hasnt made the right one bernard stood up and moved toward her he put a hand on her shoulder eyes earnest because a sound tree doesnt have bad roots amara no enterprise of greatness begins with treachery with lying to the people who trust and love you tears did burn her eyes this time and she closed them for a moment he tugged her a bit toward him and she leaned against his warmth for a moment his strength i dont know what else to do she told him ive done everything i can think of to try to avert whats coming it hasnt been enough and gaius had counted on her had entrusted her with this mission sometimes bernard rumbled the only smart thing to do is nothing sometimes you just have to be still and see how events begin to unfold before you move be patient she shook her head there isnt time for that she insisted we have to get someone down here you have to make them listen to me or bernard put both large hands on her shoulders gripped her lightly and pressed her shoulders against the heavy wood of the door then he leaned his weight against her trapping her there and lowered his mouth to hers in a kiss that managed to be abrupt and relaxed all at the same time amara felt her eyes widen in surprise his mouth was soft warm and she felt a surge of outrage did he think she was some vapid chattering child to be distracted with a kiss like a twittering schoolgirl granted his warmth his closeness were very comforting granted the gentle power of his hands and body was something that felt compelling reassuring and intimidating all at once and granted that the scent of him leather and the wind outdoors and something indescribably utterly masculine was something she felt she could take off her clothes and roll about naked in she lifted her hands to shove him away from her but found her palms just resting on the heavy muscle of his chest taking the measure of his strength his heat while her mouth turned farther up to his her lips parting pressing against his exploring and tasting him he let out a small hungry sound pressing closer to her his body to hers and her heart raced she was still annoyed with him of course and she had a job to do and regardless of how nice he might smell or feel or how her body responded so quickly to his she broke the kiss with a frustrated growl he drew away just a little his eyes searching hers what do you think youre doing she demanded her voice came out more quiet than she meant it to low i think i am locked in a small room with a beautiful woman bernard said evenly and i am kissing her i dont have time to kiss you amara said but her eyes focused on his mouth and her own lips felt a little pang of separation but you want to kiss me bernard said no amara said i mean this isnt the time no where did you plan to go he bent his head and placed a soft kiss upon the side of her throat mouth warm his tongue fluttered over her skin and lightning raced out through her limbs in response yearning more fierce than anything she had felt before she felt her body melt against his though she didnt really mean for it to she grasped at his hair and dragged his mouth back up to hers sudden and hungry kissing him pressing back against him with a kind of defiant abandon her hands sliding over his chest arms shoulders then she shoved against the wall with her hips pushing him away from it her body still close to his she kept him going back to the pallet until it hit the back of his knees and he dropped down onto it she never lifted her mouth from his following him settling astride his hips as he sat down his hands settled on her waist huge and strong and her hunger doubled on itself sudden irrational desire to feel those hands on her thighs her back her throat everywhere this is just a kiss she whispered against his mouth lips too hungry to touch his to spare much time for words thats all just a kiss she followed her urges trailing a line of kisses down over his jaw to the softer skin of his throat the beginning of the slope of one shoulder biting at his skin thats all he agreed though there was a groan hidden inside the words his hands tightened on her waist sliding down to her hips amara drew up sharply as her hips pressed against his focusing on his face struggling to clear her thoughts but it was hardit would be so much easier to get rid of her clothing his naked skin between them was what she wanted she wanted to feel his weight pinning her down feel the hot strength of him pushing into her to struggle and test her strength against his and to be overcome it was a fire inside of her a raw and primitive need something that could not be denied with a snarl of pure animal hunger she started tearing at his belt wait bernard said oh oh crows brutus you idiot he moved beneath her abruptly lifting her and dropping her unceremoniously on the pallet she landed with a thump bernard took a pair of swift steps away from her and held up his hand palm toward her motioning her to stop he frowned in concentration and muttered no brutus down and amara abruptly found herself staring at bernard from the pallet cold and hungry and panting body aching with fading need her clothing disheveled her hair mussed her lips swollen from the heat and intensity of the kisses she lifted a hand to her temple yyou you crafted on me i know bernard said his face flushing bright red i didnt mean to im sorry you earthcrafted me im sorry bernard said again quickly brutus is my fury is a strong one and he starts to thinking he knows whats good for me better than i do sometimes bernard sank down against the floor im sorry i didnt know he was doing it or i would have never i mean i he shook his head after a moment he said its been a long time and brutus just wanted to make something happen she stared at him for a long moment settling onto the pallet getting her breathing her feelings back under control she gathered her feet up and wrapped her arms around her knees staring down at her shoes the slippers isana had put on her feet at bernardholt you were married she said quietly ten years ago benard said the words quiet soft as though they were burrs that would tear at his mouth if he sent them out too quickly she died blight my daughters too and you havent she let it hang unspoken he shook his head been busy havent really wanted to be close to anyone until he drew in a breath until you kissed me last night guess it stirred up some things amara couldnt keep the wry tone from her voice i guess it did bernard flushed further and didnt lift his eyes she let out a tired laugh bernard its all right you didnt hurt me and shed enjoyed it wanted it she had to work to keep from blushing herself just the memory of the molten need of that kiss was enough to make her shiver doesnt make it right he looked up at her his eyes worried and she thought exquisitely vulnerable exposing how much he cared about what she would think you sure youre all right she nodded well the obvious parts of being locked up aside i dont think well have to worry about it too much longer thats why i wanted to steal a kiss i didnt mean that to happen but i wanted a chance to kiss you before before what bernard tilted his head to one side listen dimly outside amara heard a chime tolling the midnight hour change of the watch bernard said if pluvus follows the regulations hell go to his bed and appoint one of his senior centurions as the watch commander all right amara said what does that do for us it gets us a chance to talk to someone i know bernard said he rose head tilted as he listened and only a moment later the heavy door at the top of the cellar stairs rattled and banged open amara felt her heart race again will they let us out one way to know bernard said and stood by the door amara came up to stand beside him you wanted to kiss me he cleared his throat yes why i like you he said you like me color crept up his cheeks youre pretty and youre brave as anyone i ever saw and i like you she felt her mouth creep up at the edges and fought the smile then gave in to it looking up at him and rose onto her toes to plant a kiss on the roughness of his cheek he glanced down at her his gaze for just a moment showing that heated hunger that she had felt in his kiss sometime i think im going to get you alone when there isnt some kind of life threatening situation to interrupt me amaras tongue promptly stuck to the roof of her mouth which had as abruptly gone dry she tried to gather up enough of her suddenly scattered wits to respond but the sound of heavy boots on the stairs came first and a key rattled in the door the door opened and pluvus pentius faced them with a vacuous expression or rather that was amaras first impression the truthfinders head lolled forward on his neck and a moment later he let out a distinct snore the door opened farther and amara saw two men on either side of the snoozing truthfinder supporting his limp weight one she recognized the grizzled old healer from earlier in the day the other wore a centurions breastplate and helmet a roundfaced man of middle years with dark squinting eyes bernard said harger cheerfully i was just asking pluvus here if we shouldnt let you out and he said yes harger seized pluvuss hair and vigorously rocked his head back and forth see the boy cant handle his drink im afraid steadholder said the centurion his voice tense this could be worth my helm giraldi bernard stepped forward and clasped the mans shoulder good to see you hows rosalia worried giraldi said his squinting eyes moving from bernard back to amara bernard whats going on the marat are coming here and we think they have the support of a company of mercenary knights giraldi stared at bernard his mouth dropping open bernard thats crazy that couldnt happen alerans helping the marat i was half killed by a marat warrior near garados two days ago bernard said last night a group of crafters stronger than me tried to kill my nephew who had also seen them tavi great furies bernard there isnt any time i told gram and he believed me he ordered a full arming and mobilization scouts to be sent out messengers to riva for reinforcements before we were attacked by more of the same at the gates to garrison has it been done ive ordered my full century on watch and armed bernard and ive sent runners to the watchtowers to make sure the balefires will be lit if theres trouble but thats as much as i can do on my authority then do it on grams bernard said get the knights armed and ready and the rest of your legion armed out bring the local folk inside the walls and get word to riva without the support of the rivan legions it might not matter if we are ready to fight with an irritated growl giraldi shoved pluvuss weight onto harger who accepted it with a grunt bernard giraldi said you dont understand pluvus is bringing charges against you treason bernard he says you were a part of a plot to assassinate gram thats a load of slive droppings and you know it but im not a citizen giraldi said his tone quiet and off your steadholt neither are you with gram down how bad is he harger grunted not good bernard unconscious the knife got him low in the back hes not as young as he used to be and hed been drinking pretty heavy the past few weeks ive done as much as i can for him but we sent one of our knights aeris to bring a healer with more skill than me im a workhorse but this is delicate beyond me at least youve done that did he take any word of the attack giraldi made a frustrated sound bernard there hasnt been an attack there hasnt been any sign of an attack its coming bernard snapped crows and carrion you know what gram would do do it i cant giraldi snarled pluvus gave specific orders against a general arming at wild and unfounded rumor unless gram gives me orders himself i wont be able to do any more than i already have you dont think i want to bernard ive a wife and three children here i dont have the authority then ill giraldi shook his head you dont either there are men here who know you but there are a lot of new ones too those fools you met at the wall today harger let out a nasty chuckle giraldi shot the healer a hard look you flattened the son of a rivan lord bernard theyre insulted and they arent going to take any orders from you you dont have the rank to do this amara stepped forward and said i do the three men fell abruptly silent giraldi reached up and swept off his helmet a polite gesture excuse me young lady i didnt see you there miss i know that you want to help but but this is mans work amara asked none of us have time for that centurion my name is amara ex cursori patronus gaius his majesty has seen fit to grant me the honorary rank of countess which i believe entitles me to the same privileges of command as count gram well young lady in theory im sure that amara stepped closer to the centurion why are you wasting my time centurion you obviously believe that there is a threat or you wouldnt have armed your men stop getting in my way and tell me who i have to bring to heel to get anything done around here giraldi stared at her in baffled surprise then he looked at bernard and said is she telling the truth bernard folded his arms and eyed giraldi the centurion passed a hand over his closecropped hair all right your ladyship i suppose the first place to start would be pluvus harger drawled pluvus agrees with whatever the lass says dont you sir he took pluvuss hair and nodded his head back and forth there you have it im the doctor and in my medical opinion this man is of sound judgment sounder than when hes awake anyway giraldi swallowed nervously yes and then youd have to speak to pirellus your ladyship hes the knight commander of the garrison here if he goes with you the other centurions will follow his lead and their men with them pirellus pirellus of the black blade aye your ladyship strong metalcrafter he is fencer like ive rarely seen old blood old family that one he dont care much for these puppies we got but he dont care to be ordered about by a woman either your ladyship he gave finder olivia headaches like you never saw wonderful amara said drawing in a breath thinking then she turned to bernard i need my sword back bernards eyes widened dont you think killing him is a little extreme especially since hed cut you apart it wont come to that get it for me she turned to giraldi and said take me to him your ladyship giraldi said hesitantly i dont know if you understand he and the rest of the knights are abed already theyre gambling and wenching you mean amara said ive seen it before centurion take me to him ill have the sword countess bernard rumbled she looked back at him and flashed him a quick smile thank you steadholder healer perhaps the truthfinder needs a good bed i think he does at that agreed harger cheerfully he toted pluvus into the cell and dumped him unceremoniously on the bare palette the closest bed possible amara had to stifle the laugh that leapt to her throat and struggled to keep her expression stern centurion lead on come on bernard harger said i know where they put your stuff amara followed centurion giraldi up out of the basement of what turned out to be a storage building and into garrison itself laid out in the standard formation of a marching camp mutiny he muttered assaulting a senior officer abducting a senior officer misrepresenting the orders of a senior officer whats that centurion im counting how many ways ill be executed your ladyship look at it this way amara said if you live to be hanged well all be very fortunate she nodded toward the barracks that would customarily house the knights of a camp lights still glowed inside and she heard a piper and laughter from within this one yes lady the centurion said fine get to your men make sure they watch the signal towers and ready any other available defense of the walls the centurion drew in a breath and nodded all right do you think youll convince him lady the only question is whether or not he survives it amara said and her voice sounded cool to her very certain one way or another those knights will be ready to fight by the crown harger came panting up to them out of the dark blowing like an old but spirited horse he held the sword amara had claimed from the princeps memorium in his hand and offered her the hilt there you go the healer panted hope you work quick girlie one of the guards thought he saw a light from the furthest tower but it went out bernard took a horse out to see whats going on amaras heart skipped a beat bernard alone in that country the marat that close how far is the tower from here seven eight miles harger said centurion how long to move troops that far without furycrafting at night thats rough country lady maybe they could be here in three hours or a little more as a body light troops could do it a lot faster crows amara breathed all right get the rest of the troops out of bed centurion assemble them and tell them that the knight commander will address them in a few moments uh lady if he wont come leave that to me she slipped the swords scabbard through her belt holding it at her hip with her left hand and stalked toward the knights barracks her heart pounding in her throat she stopped outside the doors and took a breath to stabilize herself and clear her mind then she put her hand on the door and shoved it open hard letting it rattle against its frame the inside of the barracks was thick with the smell of wood smoke and wine furylamps burned in shades of gold and scarlet men played at draughts at one table stacks of coins riding on the game while groups threw dice at two others women most of them of an age to speak of their status as camp women draped on a mans arm here and there carried wine or sprawled on a sofa or in a chair drinking or kissing one girl a lithe young thing in a slaves collar and little more danced to the music of the piper before the fire casting a slender dark shadow there like some kind of exotic ornament amara took a breath and walked to the nearest table excuse me she said keeping her voice cool businesslike im looking for commander pirellus one of the men at the table looked up at her with a leer hes already had his girls for tonight lass though id be happy to fill your his eyes wandered suggestively time amara faced the man and said cooly im going to pretend i didnt hear that where is commander pirellus the mans face darkened with drunken anger and he straightened picking up a knife in his fist what you saying im not good enough for you you some kind of snob whore that only goes for rich boy citizens amara reached for cirrus and borrowed of her furys swiftness her arm blurred drawing the short guardsmans blade from its scabbard at her hip the sword leapt across the space between them before the startled soldier could react and amara leaned forward enough to let it dimple his throat the room abruptly went dead silent but for the crackle of the fire i am a cursor of the first lord himself im here on business and i have no tolerance for drunken fools drop the knife the soldier made a strangled sound holding up one hand to her palm out the other he lowered to the table and set the knife down amara could feel the ugly stares of the men around him focusing on her like the tips of a dozen spears about to be driven home her throat grew tight with fear but she allowed none of it to be seen on her face leaving her expression cool calm and merciless as an icy sea thank you amara said now where is pirellus amara heard a door open behind her and a calm almost languid voice said in a lazy parcian drawl hes having his bath but hes always at the disposal of a lady amara drew the sword from the throat of the soldier before her and with a glance of disdain turned her back on him to face the speaker he was a man taller than most his skin the dark golden brown of her own his nightblack hair worn long against legion regulations spilled down in a damp tangle around his shoulders he was lean with hard flat muscle and bore a slender curved sword of metal blacker than mourning velvet in his hand he faced amara with an expression of bland confident amusement on his face he was also dripping wet and as naked as a babe amara felt her cheeks start to heat and firmly kept herself from giving away her embarrassment you are pirellus knight commander of garrison a parcian girl pirellus said a wide white smile coming over his mouth it has been a very long time since i have sat down and entertained a parcian girl he inclined his head though his sword did not change its casually ready position at his side i am pirellus amara arched an eyebrow at him and looked him up and down id heard so much about you pirellus smiled confident i thought youd be she coughed delicately letting her gaze linger significantly taller the smile vanished with it amara would hope some of that arrogance put on some clothes commander amara said garrison is about to come under attack you will arm and prepare your men and address the members of the legions who are assembling outside even now attack pirellus drawled by whom may i ask the marat we believe they have the support of a company of knights possibly more i see he said his tone unconcerned now let me see ive seen you somewhere before im trying to remember where the capital amara said i went to some of your matches two years ago and was in a class you lectured at the academy thats right pirellus said smiling though you were dressed up like a woman at that time now i rememberyoure that little windcrafter girl who saved those children in the fires on the east side of the city that was bravely done thank you amara said stupid but brave what are you doing here schoolgirp im a cursor now pirellus ive come to warn you of an attack before you get buried in a marat horde how thoughtful of you and you are speaking to me instead of the garrison commander because i am speaking to you because you are the ranking capable officer the count is unconscious pluvus an idiotic politico and the watch commander a centurion without the rank to order a general mobilization you will order it and send to riva for reinforcements pirelluss brows shot up on whose authority on mine amara said countess amara ex cursori patronus gaius of alera pirelluss expression changed again to a scowl you got yourself a title for that little display and you think you can go where you please and order around who you like amara abruptly reversed her grip on her sword and laid it blade gleaming on the table beside her then she turned to face him and walked toward him stopping less than an arms length away pirellus she said keeping her voice to a low murmur id rather not be here and id rather not pull rank on you dont force me to push this as far as im willing to his eyes met hers hard stubborn dont threaten me girl youve got nothing to do it with in answer amara called upon cirrus again and struck the man with her open hand across his cheek a ringing blow that had landed and turned his head before he could avoid it pirellus stepped back from her blade coming up to rest pointing at her heart in pure reflex dont bother amara told him if you will not do what needs to be done i challenge you to juns macto here and now for negligence of duty treasonous to the realm she turned from him and reclaimed the blade turning back to face him blades i can begin when you are ready the commander had stopped and was staring at her intently youre kidding me he said youve got to be joking you could never beat me no amara said but im enough of a blade to make you kill me to win youd be killing a cursor in the execution of her duties commander whether im a man or woman whether im right or wrong about the coming attack you will be guilty of treason and we both know what will happen to you she lifted her sword and saluted him so if you are willing to throw your life away please call the duel and let us be about it or get dressed and make ready to defend garrison but one way or another you will hurry commander because i have no time to coddle your ego she faced him across the space of a pair of long steps her blade held up and did not blink at him her heart raced in her throat and she felt a drop of sweat slide down her jaw to her neck pirellus was a master metalcrafter one of the finest swordsmen alive if he chose to engage in the duel he could kill her and there would be little she could do to stop him and yet it was necessary necessary to convince him of her sincerity necessary for him to know that she was willing to die to get him to act that she would sooner die than fail in her duty to alera to gaius she stared at his eyes and focused on the task before her and refused to give in to her fear or to let it make the sword tremble at all pirellus stared at her for a moment his expression dark pensive amara held her breath the knight straightened slowly from his casual slouch he laid the flat of his blade across his forearm holding it in one hand and bowed to her the motion graceful angrily precise countess he said in the interests of preserving the safety of this garrison i will do as you command me but i will make a note of it in my report that i do so under protest so long as you do it amara said relief spun in her head and she nearly sat down on the floor youll see to the preparations then yes your ladyship pirellus said his words exquisitely barbed and courteous i think i can take care of things otto lets get something into the men besides tea wake everyone up camdon lass fetch me my clothes and armor one of the men at the draughts table and the collared dancer went running amara withdrew from the room and out into the town again sheathing her sword and taking deep breaths it was only moments later that she heard a tightly focused roar of wind and looked up to see a pair of halfdressed knights aeris hurtle into the night sky on different headings bound for riva she had no doubt she had done it finally garrison was readying itself for battle troops started assembling in the square at the center of town furylights glowed centurians barked orders and a drummer began playing fall in dogs barked and wives and children appeared from some of the other buildings even as other soldiers were dispatched to wake those in the outbuildings and to draw them into the protection of the towns walls it was in the hands of the soldiers now amara thought her part was done she had been the eyes of the crown its hands giving warning to aleras defenders surely that would be enough she found a shadow against one of the heavy walls of the town and leaned back against it letting her head fall back against the stone her body sagged with sudden exhaustion relief hitting her like a hard liquor making her feel heavy and tired so very tired she looked up at the stars now and then visible through the pale clouds overhead and found herself vaguely surprised that no tears fell she was too tired to cry drums rolled and trumpets sounded out orders different brazen tones calling to separate centuries and maniples of the legion men began to line the walls while others drew water in preparation for fighting fires watercrafters both legion healers like harger and homeskilled wives and daughters of the legionares made their way to the covered shelters inside the walls where tubs of water were filled and held in preparation to receive the wounded firecrafters tended to blazes on the walls while windcrafters of the knights at garrison took to the air above flying in patrol to warn and ward any surprise attack from the darkened night skies earthcrafters manned stations at the gates and walls their weapons nearby but their bare hands resting on the stone of the defenses calling on their furies to imbue them with greater obdurate strength the wind began to blow from the north bringing to amara the scent of the distant sea of ice and of men and of steel for a time as distant light began to brush against the eastern horizon all was silent tense anticipation settled over those inside the walls in one of the barracks buildings emptied now of men and filled with the children from the outbuildings and the town children sang a lullaby together the sound of it sweet and gentle amara pushed away from her darkened patch of wall and paced forward toward the gates that faced out into the marat lands beyond garrison the guards at the base of the walls stopped her but centurion giraldi saw her and waved her past them she mounted a ladder that led up to the battlements above the gate where archers and firecrafters had gathered the most thickly prepared to rain death down on anyone attempting to storm the gates of the town giraldi stood beside pirellus now decked out in armor of gleaming steel the parcian swordsman glanced at her and then out at the darkness theres been no sign he said no balefires lit by the watchtowers giraldi said quietly one of my men saw something earlier a scout went to look amara swallowed has he come back not yet lady giraldi said his expression worried not yet quiet said one of the legionares abruptly a lanky young man with large ears he leaned out one hand lifting to his ear and cirrus stirred gently against amara telling her of the windcrafting the young man was working to listen a horse he said a horseman lights said pirellus and the command echoed down the walls one by one furylamps brilliant and blue and cold lit along the walls casting a glare out onto the predawn darkness beyond for a long moment nothing moved on the snow and then they could all hear it the sound of galloping hoof beats seconds later bernard plunged into the light atop a hardridden grey with foam on its withers and blood on its flanks torn flaps of skin hanging from the terrified beast where something had raked at it even as bernard rode closer the horse bucked and screamed and amara could scarcely understand how the steadholder kept his seat and kept the animal streaking toward garrison open the gates bernard shouted let me in giraldi waited until the last possible moment before barking a command and the gates were thrown open and then shut again behind the frantic horse almost before it was through them a groom came to take the animal but it reared and screamed panicked bernard slid off the horse and swiftly away but the frenzied animal slipped on the icy stones of the courtyard and collapsed onto its side bleeding wheezing amara could see the long rents in the beasts flesh where knives or claws had torn at it get ready bernard panted turning and swiftly mounting the ladder to the battlements above the gates the steadholder his eyes wide face pale said the cursor was right theres a horde out there and about ten thousand of them are coming right behind me chapter amara swept her gaze out over the ground before the walls stark and white and cold in the bluewhite furylights and then looked back at bernard are you all right the big steadholder held up a hand to her his breathing still heavy and addressed giraldi and pirellus i couldnt get close enough to tell much light troops moving fast a lot of them had bows and i thought i saw some scaling poles giraldi grimaced and nodded once which clans wolf herdbane bernard said he leaned a shoulder against one of the battlements amara turned to a bucket of water hanging on a hook nearby and scooped out a drinking ladle passing it to bernard he nodded to her and drank the ladle away giraldi ill need a sword mail arrows if youve any to spare no pirellus said stepping forward giraldi you shouldnt have given this civilian a horse much less let him be on the walls when were expecting an attack bernard squinted at the knight commander young man how long have you been in the legions pirellus faced bernard squarely what matters is that i am in them now sir you are not it is the purpose of the legions to protect the people of the realm now get off the wall and let us do our job he stays amara said firmly centurion if theres any mail that might fit me have it brought as well giraldi turned and pointed a finger at one of the legionares on the wall the man immediately leapt down a ladder and dashed into one of the guardhouses both bernard and pirellus turned to blink at amara no bernard said i think not both men frowned at one another amara let out an impatient breath commander you have sent your knights aeris to bring reinforcements and those that remain are flying patrol overhead theyre under strength and may need whatever help they can get the steadholder is a furycrafter of considerable strength and has military experience he is within his rights as a citizen to stand in defense of his steadholt bernard scowled at amara and said i dont like it pirellus nodded i must agree countess you presumably do not have military experience beyond personal defense i dont like it either fortunately i do not need either of you to like it amara arched an eyebrow at bernard as the legionare came running back up both shoulders draped with coats of mail one arm loaded down with weaponry she took the mail he offered her a long vest of interlocking rings and took off her cloak to shove her arms into its padded undervest and then into the mail itself she started fumbling with the buckles only to have bernard push her fingers away and start cinching the buckles tight with practiced speed you shouldnt be up here he said because im a woman amara pulled a cloak on over her shoulders again and buckled on a belt with a clip for her swords scabbard because youre green unblooded its got nothing to do with you being a woman she glanced at him arching an eyebrow bernard shrugged tugging another buckle closed almost nothing here move your arms a bit so that this will settle by the time shed finished bernard had dumped his cloak in exchange for a mail shirt of his own and a steel cap whose flanges spread down over the back of his neck while the metal guard pressed down over his nose he strapped on the sword belt while his eyes swept the ground outside the walls then took up his bow quiet said the bigeared legionare again from down the wall he tilted his head for a moment then swallowed the man looked down the wall at pirellus and nodded sir here they come pirellus gave the man a nod then said to bernard and amara help if you wish then its your blood but stay out of my way he looked up and down the wall and said archers amara watched as centurions repeated the command down the length of the wall on either side of her and men stepped up to the battlements bows in hand arrows resting on quivers beside them they set arrows to the strings eyes focused intently at the edge of the area lit by garrisons furylights and held their bows halfraised tension made their forms gaunt the harsh lights behind them casting their eyes into shadow making them faceless amara heard a soldier not far away take in a deep breath and blow it out as though impatient for it all to be finished her heart pounded faster and she had to work to keep her breath from racing out of control the mail on her shoulders had a solid comforting weight to it but something about the smell of the metal set her on edge and made the hairs on the back of her neck stand up she put a hand on the hilt of the sword at her belt and felt her fingers shake she wrapped them hard around the weapons hilt to stop anyone from noticing bernard stared thoughtfully out at the darkness having not yet drawn an arrow to his bow he shrugged one shoulder as though trying to settle the mail on it more comfortably he took a step closer to her and said quietly afraid she frowned at him and shook her head even that gesture was too jerky where are they out there outside the light theyll come into it as soon as theyve massed for their charge ten thousand she pressed her lips together ten thousand dont focus on the numbers he said in that same low tone this is a simple solid defense we have the wall the light the ground in front of us they built garrison here because its the best point of defense anywhere in the valley it gives us an enormous advantage amara looked up at him again then up and down the length of the wall she couldnt stop her voice from shaking but there are so few legionares easy bernard rumbled thats all right pirellus has his most experienced troops on the walls career fighting men most of them with families behind them the compulsory terms are down in the courtyard as reserves these troops can fight ten times their number from this position with a good chance of victory even without the knights here pirellus and his men are the ones who are really going to win this battle the legionares just have to hold the horde off of them until the knights can bring their furies to bear on the marat well bloody their noses and as soon as we can determine who is leading them the knights will take him down theyll kill their hordemaster amara said it discourages new hordemasters bernard said or thats the idea once enough marat are dead and their leader is gone and theyve not managed to break our defense they wont have the stomach for any more fighting she nodded pressing her lips together all right what can i do to help look for their leader they dont wear anything much beyond what a normal warrior does so you just have to look for someone shouting orders near the center and when ive found him bernard drew an arrow and set it to the string of his bow finally point me at him they should come in any moment now good fortune cursor and you steadholder on her other side pirellus leaned a hand against a merlon and leaned a bit forward ready he whispered come on were ready they came without warning the marat surged forward thousands of screaming throats with one voice plunging into the cold furylight like a sudden living tide of muscle and bone their battle roar washed over amara deafening terrifying more sound than she would have believed could happen before she realized what she was doing she was screaming too shouting out her fear and defiance her sword in her hand though she didnt remember drawing itand beside her pirellus sword held high did the same archers he thundered voice stentorian on the wall loose and with the thrum of a hundred heavy bows death went flying into the ranks of the charging marat amara watched as the first rank of the enemy bucked and went down only to be crushed by those coming behind them twice more pirellus cried to the archers and twice more arrows flickered into their ranks sending marat sprawling and screaming but doing nothing to stop the tide of bodies flooding toward garrisons walls spears pirellus barked and along the walls the archers stepped back while legionares bearing heavy shields and long wickedly pointed spears stepped forward arrows driven by short heavy marat bows began to flicker over the tops of the walls and amara had to jerk her head to one side while a stonetipped shaft flew past her face her heart surged with terror and she crouched down enough to take her head from view as a prime target while pirellus in his helmet stood staring down at the oncoming marat ignoring the arrows that buzzed past him the ground shook as the marat reached the wall a physical trembling that traveled up through the stones to amaras feet she could see them a sea of wild inhuman eyes teeth that stretched into animals fangs and wolves ran beside them among them like great gaunt shadows the marat reached the wall where the gate suddenly shook with the blow of a tree trunk being held by a dozen hands used as a ram several long slender poles arched up into the air studded along their lengths with short spikes and once they came to rest against the walls marat began to climb the poles nimble and swift their weapons held in their hands while companions beneath them fired arrows up at the defenders on the walls it was too loud to be believed screams splitting the air making any kind of communication nearly impossible arrows flew thicker than raindrops in a storm their dark heads gleaming in the furylight shattering where they struck stone or good aleran steelbut amara watched as one grizzled old veteran pitched back from the wall the dark shaft of an arrow piercing his throat and another man dropped motionless in his tracks six inches of haft and fletching showing from the burst socket of his eye hold pirellus bellowed hold the legionares fought with ruthless efficiency regardless of the incredible grace of the marat rushing up the scaling poles they thrust home spears with deadly accuracy into marat flesh pale barbarians fell from the walls back into the savage throng beneath drawing further cries from those below again and again legion spearmen repelled the marat assaults shoving the scaling poles back down driving the warriors clambering up them back with cold steel the legionares fought together each man with his shield partner so that while one would engage the enemys weapon the other would drive a spear home with a short hard thrust at the vitals or a leg toppling the attacker from their precarious position atop the walls blood stained the aleran spears the legionares shields and armor and spattered thick on the battlements mute testimony to the courage of the marat attackers below amaras feet she could hear the steady thud and thump of the ram being driven at the gatesbut suddenly found herself whirling to the walls as a savageeyed marat swung himself up between two merlons from a scaling pole and swept a heavy wooden club at her head amara ducked the blow dodged a second swipe that came straight down at her shoulder and whirled to whip her blade across the marats heavy thighs opening the pale flesh in a sudden river of blood the marat screamed and toppled toward her club flailing amara moved lightly to one side thrusting her short blade at the marats ribs as he fell past feeling the weapon sink home the quivering twisting jerk of the marats scream something that coursed through the metal and into her hands halfrevolted exultant at having survived the exchange she let out a scream and jerked the sword back leaping back from the marat warrior as he tumbled limply down to the courtyard beneath the wall she looked up panting to find pirellus staring at her he nodded once and then called try to throw them back down the wall on the outside we dont want clutter where our own troops are moving around then he turned back to his study of the ground below almost absently frowning when a stone arrowtip shattered against the crest of his helmet amara chanced a look over the wall out at the chaos below and arrows whistled through the air toward her as soon as she did she jerked her head back and down to find bernard crouched next to her the steadholder too took a glance over the wall before halfrising to a crouch to lift his bow drawing the arrow back to his cheek he aimed for a breath then loosed the arrow which threaded its way between a pair of legionares to sink into the ribs of a marat with a steel axe who had gained the wall over a stunned legionare with a dent in his helmet the force of the arrows impact drove the marat back over the wall and he vanished as he fell spotted their general yet bernard called to her i cant see anything amara shouted they shoot whenever i look no helmet bernard said id shoot at you too thats a comfort thanks amara said wry and the steadholder grinned at her before standing up to loose another arrow into the crowd below and drop back down behind the wall again amara stood up to take another lookbut bernard caught her wrist dont he said theyre getting packed in down there keep your head down what in answer he nodded toward pirellus amara turned her head to look at the man and saw him point a finger off to one side at a pair of men standing behind heavy ceramic pots and three armored knights who stood behind them with no weapons in their hands firepots amara asked and bernard nodded she watched as pirellus lifted his sword and then dropped it a swift signal the two men with the firepotsearthcrafters surely for only they could lift the mansized pots of coals so easilyheaved them up and over the wall to crash down into the marat on either side of the gate pirellus signaled the three men behind them and the knights as one lifted their arms and faces to the sky crying out over the screams and din of battle the fire answered them in a roar that deafened amara and rattled her teeth against one another heat swept up and sudden brilliant light scarlet and murderous in contrast to the cool blue furylights a wind that roared upward lifting amaras hair up off her neck a column of fire shaped like some huge winged serpent rose above the battlements curled back down and crashed to the earth below the battlements mercifully shielded her from seeing what happened to the marat caught in the sudden storm of living flame but in the wake of that fire as its roar died away to echoes she heard them screaming men and wolves alike screaming in terror and in pain high and breathless there was madness in those screams frustration futility terror beyond anything that she had heard beforeand there was something else the sure and certain knowledge of death death as a release from an agony as pure and hot as the flames that had caused it a smell rose from the ground before the battlements in those silent moments after the scent of charred meat amara shuddered sickened a silence fell broken only by screams and moans coming from the ground below she rose and looked down over the ground before the walls the fire serpent had broken the marat sent them and their wolves howling away from the walls of garrison at a command from pirellus the archers stepped forward and sent arrows arching into the retreating barbarians with deadly accuracy dropping more to the earth clutching at the barbs piercing their flesh she couldnt see much of the ground immediately beneath the walls for which she felt silently grateful the smell of burned hair and worse nearly overwhelmed her until she bade cirrus to keep it from her nostrils and mouth she leaned a hand against the battlements and stared out at the bloodsoaked scorched earth littered with a carpet of palehaired bodies furies she breathed theyre not much more than children bernard stepped up beside her his face pale grim eyes hidden in shadows beneath his helmet young warriors bernard said their first chance to prove themselves in battle that was wolf clan one more to go amara glanced at him they send their youngest to fight to fight first then if they survive they can join the adult warriors in the main battle she looked back at the field and swallowed this is only a preliminary to them it isnt over not without getting the leader bernard said get some water in you you dont know how much you need it next one wont be so easy and indeed a legionare came around carrying a bucket and a thong threaded through the handles of tin cups passing water to each man on the walls more legionares younger troops from the reserves in the courtyard below came onto the walls to help carry down the wounded and bear them back to the watercrafters working at the tubs in the courtyard as usual those with functional and light injuries were treated first a round of swift crafting that bound closed bleeding wounds mended over simple broken bones and restored a whole if weary fighting man to the defense of the garrison the more seriously injured were remanded to the care of surgeons men and women skilled in more pedantic medicinal practices who labored to keep them alive and stable until one of the watercrafters had the time to attend to their injuries pretty much like we expected pirellus was saying on the wall somewhere nearby she focused on the conversation listening though the ram was a new technique for them they learn fast giraldi grunted children crows but i dont like this kind of bloodletting how are the men well enough for not having slept a full night light casualties on the northern side of the wall only injuries on the south good pirellus said get water to everyone and arrows to the archers make sure those new firepots get up here in one piece and get some food to my firecrafters they dont do as well on an empty belly you want something for that giraldi asked for what youre bleeding edge of my helmet pirellus said arrow drove it into my skin looks worse than it is you dont want it bleeding in your eye at the wrong time let me get a surgeon up here let the surgeons see to the men that are hurt pirellus said his tone firm get yourself some water too centurion aye sir amara frowned pensive and stood up walking a bit farther down the wall bernard sat there his back against the battlements frowning down at his hands somethings occurred to me amara said this doesnt make any sense bernard squinted up at her its like that your first battle she shook her head impatiently no not like that it doesnt make sense for the marat to do this to send a fraction of their force against us and the one least experienced and capable at that why should they fight us piecemeal when they could bring everyone against us at once marat dont think like we do bernard said you always get their raw recruits out in front sometimes theyre out like velites skirmishing in front of the larger masses of troops and sometimes theyre raiding parties that go out the night before but theyre always in front this is just another example they arent stupid amara said stubbornly how many of their young men died just now hundreds a thousand for what they killed half a dozen legionares and wounded more that will be back up on the walls in an hour at most pirellus stepped down the wall abruptly standing before amara arms akimbo you would have preferred it if they had killed more perhaps dont be stupid amara snapped i just think that there must be something else to what theyre doing she looked at bernard where are the knights we saw before the steadholder frowned at her but pirellus spoke before he could say anything indeed countess where are they i acknowledge that the marat are on the move but we have seen only one warband thus far with no hordemaster in evidence you will be quite the laughingstock if riva brings both his legions here only to find no marat to face amaras temper flashed and she faced pirellus ready to bring the man to task bernard stood up as though to get between them down the wall one of the brass horns sounded a call to arms a clarion note that clove through the cold furyht air and brought the veteran troops on the wall to their feet shields and weapons ready before its notes had died away sir snapped giraldi from the wall over the gates theyre coming again pirellus turned his back on amara and leapt up to his position over the gate out at the edge of the light the marat appeared again rushing forward m a howling mobbut this time their screams were punctuated not by the howling of the great dark wolves but by the metallic whistling shrieks of the giant predator birds that raced beside them as the pale tide charged toward the walls archers pirellus called again and once more in three humming whistling waves marat dropped to the ground the life driven from them by aleran shafts spears pirellus called and once again the legions squared up to face the marat but that was where the similarity to the charge of clan wolf ended there were no scaling poles this time no ram to assault the gates instead the first rank of the marat howling their defiance simply hurled itself at the walls and running at a furious pace leapt up to the top if amara had not seen it happen she would never have believed it possiblebut the marat without aid of any kind simply hurtled into the air grasped at the top of the fifteenfoot wall with one hand and hauled themselves up to fight the great birds stalking beside them leapt up too even higher furiously beating at the air with their stubby wings and holding themselves aloft just long enough to rake at the defenders atop the walls with their vicious talons driving aleran men back long enough for the young herdbane warriors to haul themselves onto the battlements and throw themselves forward into battle with a fearless even mindless abandon amara stared in startled horror as a marat hauled himself onto the wall not ten feet from her and his great bird landed beside him with a scream its beak slashing wildly at an upraised shield the marat lifted his knife and leapt at her shrieking while behind him another scrambled atop the wall in his place amara tried to dodge to one side only to realize that there was nothing but the empty air of the courtyard beneath her she sent out a frantic call to cirrus and as the marat rushed her took two steps out onto the empty air then sprang back to the stones of the wall behind him he stared at her stunned for a moment even as he spun to pursue her she thrust with the guardsmans blade flat of the weapon parallel to the ground and it sank home at one side of his chest sliding between ribs and coming out again smoothly something shrieked behind her and hot pain flashed across her back she threw herself forward and down over the fallen marat and turned her head to see the great herdbane lunge toward her dark eyes glassy and empty of anything like fear its beak flashing toward her eyes she threw up her hands willing cirrus out before her and the fury rushed out sweeping up the great bird and hurling it into a merlon it stumbled and spun to reorient on her but even as it did a heavyset legionare swept his sword at it in a powerful stroke and with earthborn strength swept the herdbanes head from its neck the legionare flashed her a smile then turned and hurled himself toward the newest arrival at the top of the walls amara struggled to her feet again fighting raged all along the wall and had spilled over into the courtyard behind the reserve troops after a startled moment had been ordered forward by their young officers and engaged those marat who either leapt from the wall or followed the bounds of their warbirds down into the courtyard more screams frantic and terrified and wild with battlerage whirled around her disorienting terrifying on the other side of the gate the marat had taken a section of the wall and held it tenaciously more of their number pouring in at every moment until pirellus himself entered the fray the goldenskinned parcian drew his dark sword and started what could only be described as a deliberate stalk down the length of the wall calling legionares out of his way as he went he met the first marat with a blow so swift that amara never saw it begin she only saw blood flicker out in an arc while the marat tumbled down to the earth below lifeless one of the great birds lost its talon when it raked at pirellus and its head followed it to the stones a breath later more marat threw themselves at the master metalcrafter both man and beast in a furious wave but the swordsman was their match every motion avoided a blow or enabled him to deal out a stroke of his ownand none failed to be lethal with a calculated precision pirellus swept down the occupied section of the wall brushing away the enemy like cobwebs and the legions flooded back into the space kicking bodies clear of the battlements fighting savagely to hold the regained section of the walls pirellus shook the blood from his sword expression neutral remote and pointed a finger again at the men with the firepots the earthcrafters removed the lids and prepared to hurl the pots over the battlements to the ground below the firecrafters behind them stood with their expressions distant mouths moving silently calling to their furies in preparation of the hellish storm they prepared to unleash on the enemy and that was when amara felt it when she felt the currents of air thrumming with tension heard with some part of her that she could not fully describe the rising tide of wind moving in the darkness above she turned her face up only to be blinded by the furylights mounted above the battlements veiling the skies abovebut all along the wall the winds rose whipping wildly back and forth amara thought she could hear cries above where garrisons few knights aeris should have been patrolling something sprinkled down from above and for a moment she thought that more rain had begun to fall but the sensation was hot not cold and when amara wiped at her cheek she saw blood smeared upon her fingers bernard she shouted theyre here she didnt have time to make sure she had been heard instead she called to cirrus and leapt into the air felt the roar of wind enfold her as she hurtled up above the battlements and into the darkened sky over the besieged fortress the air teemed with knights aerisduelling whirling pairs of men who swept through the skies in deadly combat as much between furies as men each trying to cut off the others flow of air or to wound their opponents badly enough with their blades to shatter their concentration and send them falling even as she watched one of the men in rivan colors whirled away from a flickering blade only to let out a sudden terrified scream and begin to plummet from the sky like a stone he fell past amara and onto the ground before the walls of garrison the thud of impact swallowed by the tumult beneath them amara swept her gaze around the sky picking out the shapes of airborne knights as much with cirruss senses as her own and found thirty at least three times the number of the fortresss defenders more graceful battles played out above and around her but their outcome was a foregone conclusion garrisons knights aeris would be driven from the skies or killed and the enemy would control all movement above the fortress amara spotted high and at the rear of the enemy positions what she had dreadedseveral litters borne by more knights litters that would carry more of the powerful furycrafters they had faced before even as she watched several knights formed an escort around three of the litters and the whole of the group dove toward the embattled fortress specifically toward the gates where pirellus and his knights directed the aleran defenses amara did not take time to consider her plan instead she gathered cirrus beneath her and sent herself hurtling up toward the oncoming litters a startled knight turned to face her in the air but with an almost casual gesture she flashed past him dealing him a blow that began a cut low on one of his legs and ran all the way up his back to his shoulder sheering through the leather leggings he wore and even biting through some of the mail upon his back he let out a cry and fell his focus fluttering with his pain dropping toward the earth like a leaf cut from a tree amara hurled herself forward and used a terrific rush of air to catapult her up then while her momentum still carried her toward the foe she gathered cirruss presence up before her and sent the fury lashing out at those supporting one of the litters she wasnt strong enough to cut all four of the knights bearing the litters from their furies and she hadnt even tried instead she had focused on the two forward knights intending only to cut off their wind for a few crucial seconds she succeeded the men let out startled cries and fell straight down taking the poles whose weight they supported with them and dumping a halfdozen screaming men inside the litter into the open air two of the men still wore their restraining straps and dangled precariously on the litter as the knights bearing it struggled to right it again but the others evidently anticipating a quick dismount upon the walls had already unstrapped those six plummeted toward the ground and though a few of the escorting knights plunged after them amara knew that they would never be able to save the men from a fall so close to the earth she felt dozens of eyes focus on her at once as her momentum carried her to the peak of its energy then let her begin to fall again she spun in the air faced down and kept her limbs in close to her body to keep from being slowed as she reached out to gather cirrus back to her and to reestablish her own windstream before one of the other knights of the air cut her off half a dozen windstreams converged on her at once and she clawed for air in frustrated terror even as the furylights of the fortress below loomed closer she got lucky so many of the enemy had moved to cut her off that she was able to use their own efforts against one another writhing the windstreams into a tangle and then altering the direction of her fall with her arms and legs cirrus gathered beneath her in a rush and she gained control of her fall just as another knight less reticent than the others swept toward her light gleaming on his drawn sword amara twisted to one side but he matched her fall and the sword swept at her she caught it on her own blade and pressed in close swordtosword struggling to gain control of the wind around them and turn it to her advantage her foe gripped her wrist and they began to spin wildly still falling amara shot a glance down at the courtyard welling up before her eyes and looked up to her foes face just as he did the same there was a mute moment of concord and then both pushed away from one another furies gathering beneath them in a roar attempting to slow their fall amara got one frantic look at garrison beneath her and guided her fall into a stack of hay bales beside the stables the bales solidly packed would have done little to break her fall without cirrus rushing currents both slowing the impact and scattering the bales into loose strands amara crashed through the topmost stack of bales and out onto the ground on the far side her foe more able than she or less tired landed neatly on the ground beside her and pivoted to drive his blade at her throat she caught the thrust on her own sword barely parrying the blade into the bale of hay beside her while her other hand dragged the short knife shed stolen from fidelias from her belt and drove it back into the windcrafters boot he fell back with a yelp then gestured with his hand expression murderous the wind roared and amara felt pressure pin her hard to the ground she struggled to move or to lift her sword but the mans fury kept her from doing it she reached for cirrus but she knew she had been too slow and she could only watch as he lifted his blade again there was a buzzing hiss and an arrow drove through the knights mail shirt where it crossed just beneath his throat the arrow drove him back a pair of jerking steps before he fell dead to the stones the pressure on amara abruptly eased and she could breathe again move again she started struggling to her feet but still dizzy from the fall and her efforts to control it had only got partway there when bernard reached her his bow still in hand and said crows and furies are you all right where are they coming in the gate amara gasped the firepots get them off the gate hurry bernards face went pale and he pelted off across the courtyard back toward the walls a marat dazed from a fall from the battlements above lifted a stoneheaded hatchet but bernard flicked a hand and the hatchets wooden haft abruptly spun in its owners grip the back of the stone whipping into the marats temple and sending him in a loose tumble to the ground amara felt a dull pain in her shoulder and back and it was too much effort to stand but she watched as bernard bounded up one of the ladders and onto the wall he took his bow in a twohanded grip and clubbed his way past a marat fighting a pair of legionares and ducked past the flashing claws of a wounded herdbane that lay on its side raking wildly with its remaining leg to reach pirelluss side he gripped the knight commanders shoulder and shouted to him over the din pirelluss face blanked with incredulity but bernard pointed up and pirellus turned in time to see the first of the other pair of litters sweeping down mailed knights aeris all around it his eyes widened and he shouted to his men on the walls even as a roar of wind sent men flat to the battlements and drove leaping marat back and away from the walls bernard lost his bow but stayed on his feet drawing on the strength of his fury amara knew he grabbed pirellus and another man beside him and dragged them forward and off the wall to fall into the courtyard beyond amaras eyes swept back up to the litters to see fidelias in one pointing down and calling something to one of the men in the other a tall thin man with pinched features the man stood up eyes closed and reached out his hand in answer the firepots waiting on the walls beside the firecrafters now pinned down by the gale winds above them exploded into blinding flame the firestorm swept over the walls above the gates where garrisons knights were pinned down scattered and whipped to a dangerous fury by the wind more of the flame nonetheless rushed out along the walls playing havoc with legionares marat and predator birds alike the fire went over the walls like a scythe sending men screaming to the ground running from the flames rolling frantically to put out their own burning bodies some even leapt off the battlements and into the savage marat horde waiting below amara watched in stunned horror as the litters swept down to the courtyard where a half a dozen disorganized legionares attacked the invaders aldrick ex gladius dismounted from the litter and with the knights aeris with him met them and drove them back fidelias stepped from the litter and walked to the gates as amara watched he glanced around him eyes quick and hard and then laid his bare palms against the heavy wood for perhaps half a minute he stood there eyes closed then he withdrew barked an order to his men and limped back to the litter aldrick and the others withdrew to the litter and the whole of the group swept up into the air again and out of sight amara regained her feet finally and recovered her sword she lifted her head to see what fidelias had done to the gates she saw them shudder then she saw dust fly from one of them and then the cruel rending talon of one of the herdbane ripped through the heavy beams of wood as though they were paper and tore its way back out again she could only watch in numbed horror as the marat howling like madmen hauled the gates of garrison to kindling before her eyes and began to pour into the fortress she swallowed her head still whirling her hand trembling as she gripped her sword and stepped forward to meet them chapter amara looked left and right as she approached the gate even as the marat began to tear their way through it to one side several of the young legionares stood stunned and horrified staring as the marat poured in to the other scorched bodies and badly burned men lay scattered as they had fallen from the walls above along with a dazedlooking bernard and pirellus gathering themselves together after the explosion on the walls and the fall after form up amara shouted toward the legionares but she wasnt sure the young men even heard her she singled out one of the young men in a centurions helmet and barked centurion hold the gate the young man in his fine cape looked from her to the gate to the shattered walls above eyes wide mouth trembling bback he stammered though it seemed that no one listened to him fall bback amara looked to the other side in desperation pirellus she shouted get up command the legion pirellus his helmet blasted from his head the hair on one side scorched nearly to his scalp stared at her in blank incomprehension the marat tore through the last fragments of the remaining gate and the first a burly young warrior wielding a stoneheaded axe shoved his way through there was no time for anything else if the marat gained control of the gates they would be able to pour into garrison and nothing would stop the weight of simple numbers from smothering the aleran defense though her head still spun and though the injury on her back still pained her amara threw herself toward the sundered gates she heard herself let out a shrill cry even as the marat warrior turned to face her and swept the axe in a great flat arc meant to shear her in half at the hips instead she reached out for cirrus and leapt throwing herself neatly over the axe and sweeping her blade out at eye level the fine steel of the blade bit into the marats face and he dropped to the ground with a scream even as one of the huge warbirds tore its way through the gates amara tried to dodge from its path but the beasts beak shot out and gripped her left arm in a sudden crushing grip pain flashed through her and she knew that only the mail had kept her arm from being snipped off at the elbow the bird shook its head violently left and right throwing amara about like a puppet until she slashed desperately at the base of the birds thick neck eliciting a brassy shriek and causing the bird to hurl her away from it another marat came through the gates but the wounded herdbane whipped around at the sudden motion snapping and lashing with its brassy beak driving the marat back amara let out a cry and drove forward thrusting with the guardsmans sword sinking it into the birds vitals and whipping it forth with a halftwist that sent the beast snapping and clawing its way to the ground in a welter of gore amara gasped for breath as the marat warrior came through aiming another cut at this one he dodged to one side making way for a second this one a lean young woman carrying an old aleran saber the marat female thrust at amaras face and the young cursor swept the blow asideonly to be hit hard in the flank and thrown to the ground by the first attacker she struggled and fought against him letting out a furious futile cry but he had gotten inside her guard and pinned her sword arm to the ground he lifted his fist his face emotionless and drove a blow into her mouth that stunned her for a moment left her silent then he said something in a guttural tongue satisfaction in the tone as his hand gripped her hair hard and he turned her head slightly toward the woman who lifted the old saber for a downward blow scalping me amara thought theyre taking my hair there was a sudden shriek highpitched and panicked the marat warrior leapt back and off amara even as his companion lifted her saber and engaged the furious reckless assault of one of the young legionares the young man hacked and chopped with his legion blade more in elemental fury and brutality than in any coherent assault and drove the pair away from amara he turned back to the other young legionares and amara recognized the young man who had been on guard at the gates the day before from the purpling bruise on his jaw come on he snarled to his companions are you going to stand there while a woman fights he turned back to his opponents with a cry of riva for alera and attacked again first one then two then several more legionares surged forward with sharp cries of fury joining together in a shieldwall that contained the tide of marat struggling to pour in through the shattered gates but the young legionares though they acted in concert began to be driven back step by steady step amara felt herself hauled back along the ground by one elbow and barely managed to keep hold of her sword she looked up dazedly to find healer harger crouching over her fingers touched lightly to her temples the arms broke he said a second later voice rough maybe some of your teeth too there are broken rings in the mail over your back that are cutting into it and something is sprained but youll live he shot a glance up at the embattled gate then gave her a quick smile and said bravely done girl shamed those city boys into the fight at last pirellus amara managed to gasp other side of the gate stunned hargers eyes widened great furies he lived through that bernard pulled him off the wall harger nodded tense and hauled her to her feet show me if anyone can do anything it will be pirellus amara gasped with the pain and saw the healer wince and draw in a quick breath of his own he steadied her and then she lead him forward around the slow pressure of bodies and the desperate thrust and hack of weapons at the gate to where shed seen bernard and pirellus moments before she found them bernard just now starting to stagger to his feet pirellus still on his hands and knees harger went to the knight at once touching fingers lightly to his temples then grunting and shaking the man roughly harger hauled back a hand to deliver a slap to the knight commanders face but pirellus caught the healers wrist as it swept toward him he shook his head once blinked his eyes looked up at the gates and then staggered to his feet to stare up at the walls then he spun looking around the courtyard and nodded to amara countess he said voice haggard that blast will have heated the stones but theyll cool quickly and marat will be coming over them even if we hold the gate amara swallowed what do we do move these legionares up to the walls pirellus said then who will hold the gate his chin lifted a fraction i will amara stared at him alone who will command the legion they wont need much commanding in this pirellus said theyll hold the walls and ill hold the gate or well all be dead in the next few moments how can they hold the walls they cant for long he said youll have to figure out something amara snapped what thats not a plan its all i have pirellus said countess i hope to the furies youre clever as well as brave if you dont find some way to get them off of us were dead right here right now and with that he nodded to amara and stepped toward the melee at the gate he paused halfway there to pick up a long heavy length of wood that had been one of the drawing traces of a cart crushed by falling debris he turned crisply and handed it to bernard as the dazed steadholder stood up what do you want me to do bernard said follow me pirellus said keep any strays off my back stay out of my way then he turned and walked into the struggle at the gate with a few harsh barked phrases he stepped up between the young legionares and drew his sword within seconds three marat warriors lay bleeding on the ground and their advance halted pirellus snarled orders at the young legionares and after a frantic halfmoment they moved breaking into a pair of elements and heading up the stone stairs to the battlements slopping buckets of water ahead of them to cool the heated stones as they went pirellus stood in the gates alone amara saw him set a grim polite little smile onto his lips he bowed to the marat standing just beyond the gate and then with the fingers of one hand beckoned them forward bernard gripped the heavy wooden pole and swallowed looking back at amara his eyes were a little wide and he drew in an unsteady breath but he turned back to the gate and stood perhaps ten feet behind pirellus standing steady amara felt a scream of frustration well up in her even as the marat again began to come through the gate by ones and twos the parcian swordsman met them more than a match and first one then another then another of the barbarians fell to the dark sword but even pirellus was not untouchable a pair of warriors came through together facing him pirellus neatly parried a thrusting spear and spun to thrust toward the other warriorand suddenly hesitated faced with a halfnaked young marat woman he did not pause for so long as the space of a breath before he lunged forward driving the dark sword between her breasts but that hesitation cost him the marat beside him swept the butt end of the spear at his leg striking the side of his knee with a crunch of impact and if bernard had not stepped forward to drive the young warrior to the earth with an overhand sweep of the thick wooden pole pirellus might have been killed instead the warrior grimaced moving with no more than a slight limp and continued what amara knew would ultimately be a hopeless if heroic defense of the gates harger came to her side his eyes sunken worried as they traveled up to the walls and amara looked to see the legionares there engaging the enemy heard the screams of the warbirds and of their marat masters lady harger growled what do we do amara wanted to scream at the man out of sheer frustration and fear even as she watched a young legionare fell from the wall screaming and clutching at his face blood pouring from his fingers he fell no more than a few feet away bernard barely dodged a suddenly thrust spear as he swept another marat from pirelluss flank how was she to know what to do she wasnt a military commander the abrupt destruction of garrisons knights had crippled their defenses she knew how was she to know how to overcome that loss amara drew in a sudden breath she wasnt she sheathed her sword and seized hargers sleeve healer take me to count gram he did so at once leading her to the center of the fortress where a pair of senior legionares stood guard before the door of a heavy practical structure of brick amara swept past them and into a building up a flight of stairs and into the counts bed chamber gram lay in his bed his head to one side his face grey eyes sunken there were flecks of some kind of white film on his lips and his broad capable hands lay limply on the sheets looking frail the skin as thin as parchment amara looked at the man and swallowed she knew that what she was about to do might kill him she did it anyway wake him up harger harger let out a shaking breath lady i can but it could i know it could kill him healer amara said but if the walls or the gate falls hell be dead either way we need him the garrison needs him i do not think that he would wish us to let them fall when he might be able to help harger looked at her for a moment and then shook his head the old healer sagged for a moment his face drawn no i dont suppose he would get him moving amara said quietly ill get the guards to help carry him she went downstairs to the two legionares there returning with them to grams bedchamber she found harger standing over the old count whose face was flushed with unnatural color gram dragged in a panting breath and opened his eyes squinting at her he grunted and said harger says my knights are gone just the green troops left yes amara said her voice tight theyre on the walls pirellus is alive but wounded holding the gates alone we need to get you out there no gram said dont bother wont do any good but sir fire gram croaked the enemy used the knights firepots against them made them explode on the walls gram closed his eyes are they all at the gates no amara said theyre up on the walls again too spread all along them cant be done gram said sighing even if i wasnt hurt even if we had more firepots cant call up that much fire that wide theres got to be something you can do amara said dropping a hand onto his nothing gram whispered cant burn something that wide not strong enough amara chewed on her lip what about another kind of crafting gram opened his eyes again what a firecrafting amara said the marat cant counter it with anything gram looked from amara to harger then back again fear he said fire i dont know if theyre afraid of fire no gram said his expression weakly irritated get fire get a torch you amara blinked at him me but im no firecrafter gram waved a hand impatiently cutting her off and fixing her with glittering eyes cant walk someone else has to carry are you afraid girl she nodded tightly once he cackled honest good get a torch and get ready to be brave braver than youve ever been maybe we can do something gram broke off coughing the sound weak his face twisting into a grimace of pain amara traded a look with harger then nodded to one of the legionares the man stepped out returning with a torch a moment later here girl gram whispered beckoning with one hand bring it close amara did kneeling down by the bed and holding the torch out to the wounded count gram closed his eyes and reached his bare palm into the flame amara winced almost drawing the torch away but gram did not stir or flinch and his flesh remained it would seem untouched by the fire amara felt it inside of her first a panicky little thrill that raced through her belly and thighs turned her legs watery and uncertain her hand started to shake and she lifted her other to hold the torch steady gram let out a slow quiet sound of pain and the sensation in her redoubled mindless and sudden fear so that she had to fight to keep from bolting from the room her heart abruptly raced pounding frantically the pain of her wounds seemed to increase and she suddenly could not get a breath girl gram rasped opening his eyes again listen to me get this out to the front out in front of all of the marat get it to where they can see it he let out a wheezing breath his eyes closing dont drop it and dont let the panic take you hurry amara nodded rising to feel her body trembling weak with fright steady harger said get out there hurry im not sure how long he can hold the crafting amara had to stammer twice before she managed to say all right she turned and walked from the chamber fighting to control her breathing to keep her paces steady even the fear flowed through her like winter ice cold little chips of it flowing in her blood making her heart skip painful beats she could barely keep her thoughts focused on the gates on carrying the torch without dropping itthough she struggled to remember that if she dropped it or if she surrendered to the fear and fled that grams efforts would be for nothing she felt herself begin to sob as she walked into the courtyard felt her body begin to weaken with the mindnumbing terror more than anything she wanted to turn away from the gate to flee to take to the air and leave their savage enemies far behind instead she kept on toward the gates growing weaker less steady by the step part of the way there she swayed and fell and her tears blinded her but she kept moving forward crawling on her knees and her wounded arm clutching at the torch and keeping it from falling to the ground suddenly from right in front of her someone screamed and she felt herself hauled to her feet with terrifying strength facing a towering giant with blazing eyes bearing a cudgel the size of a tree in one fist she fought against the terror against the sobs that choked in her throat bernard she said bernard the torch get me to the walls get me to the walls the giant scowled and roared something at her that had her choking down a hysterical scream then he simply picked her up under one arm and carried her to the stairs and up them to the frantic screaming panic of the battlements she felt herself come down on her feet again and she staggered forward toward the walls above the gates she could not think could not control herself over the last few feet she staggered forward screaming and sobbing bearing the torch aloft and certain that death was there for her breathing softly black wings rustling like those of the crows that waited waited somewhere in the predawn darkness to sweep down on the eyes of the dead somehow she gained the battlements over the gate and stood above them a sure and simple target for marat archers the torch held aloft it went up in a sudden furnace of sound and heat an abrupt river of roaring light that shot into the sky and lit the ground for a mile in every direction all of that terror all of that fear in her blossomed out with the torch poured out with the sudden raging flames swept out of her magnified a thousandfold onto the ground beneath there was an instant horrible stillness as the power of the firecrafting swept over the marat below and then a scream born in one moment from thousands of throats rose up into the air the pressure of the marat assault vanished more quickly than it had arrived the pale tide of marat warriors abruptly flooded back from the walls of garrison howling in terror joined by the whistling panicked shrieks of the fleeing warbirds the battered legionares defending the walls began to cheer as the marat were swept under by the firecrafting and broke and ran amara saw them go even as the terror flowed out of her poured out together with whatever strength she had left she staggered and nearly fell from the battlements only to be supported by bernard who had appeared behind her she leaned back against him exhausted and barely able to keep her eyes open while all around her aleran warriors threw defiant cheers after the fleeing enemy she closed her eyes and when she opened them again the sky was lighter she sat on the battlements wrapped in bernards cloak numb aching she swayed to her feet and looked up and down the wall and down into the courtyard below the wounded the dying and the dead lay everywhere healers and surgeons alike labored with the fallen with men burned so badly that they could hardly be recognized as human amara watched as one man let out a choking shriek and then stiffened a blackened hand curled into a claw the legionare with him himself sporting a scarletstained bandage drew a cloak over the mans head then with the help of another legionare he carried the body to a growing number of rows of corpses on the other side of the courtyard she turned and looked down the walls perhaps a dozen legionares stood along them young strained unwounded holding their spears at attention on the battlefield below the walls the crows had come for the dead they swarmed over them in a croaking black carpet wings flapping eyes glittering with glassy hunger uncaring of the loyalties of the fallen they hopped from body to body tearing at tongues eyes and when amara saw one of the bodies stir only to be buried in the winged beasts she felt her numb belly twist and turned away bernard appeared a moment later his face strained and handed her a ladle of cold water she drank its bad she said quietly bad he agreed even once we get the lightly wounded back on their feet the garrison lost twothirds there are only three knights still alive counting pirellus the gates are broken and theres no way to replace themand the enemy can jump the walls in any case hows gram harger says he isnt likely to wake up again before he dies that last crafting took too much out of him crows amara swore softly hes a brave man yes the marat are coming back then amara said soon she closed her eyes wearily what else can we do bernard said i dont know we should get the women and children out the mens families put them in wagons and send them toward riva as fast as they can go we cant those knights didnt just take out the gates some others got into the stables and panicked the horses it drew the attention of maybe half a dozen herdbane there arent any horses left amara looked up at him can they flee on foot ive talked to pirellus about it and giraldi even on the causeway the women and children cant run faster than the marat even if we hold on to garrison for as long as possible there just arent enough menand most of the families wont leave theyve decided that theyll stay and fight rather than be killed running pirellus is keeping their spirits up telling them that reinforcements are bound to come from riva no amara said numb i never thought theyd have so many knights aeris to use to cut off the valley i dont think anyone could have gotten through that many bernard nodded once weve sent out runners on foot to warn the steadholts were hoping to buy them some time if they head for riva right away they might make it out of the valley he let his voice trail off tiredly amara stood up beside him and leaned against him he leaned back and the two shared a long moment of silence in the predawn stillness you should go bernard said you can fly out of here you should take word to the first lord even if i could still fly amara said my duty is to do what i can to stop whats happening here to find out who began it bring those responsible to justice i couldnt just leave theres no reason for you to die here countess theres no point in this argument steadholder i cant fly not now im too tired she leaned her cheek against his shoulder he felt strong and warm and she took whatever comfort she could in that after a moment she felt him move an arm around her and she pressed closer to him im sorry bernard she said im sorry i wasnt faster i didnt do something differently im sorry about your sister your nephew he swallowed when he spoke his voice came out rough quiet nothing to be sorry for i just hope to the furies that theyre all right she touched his arm and they stood together quiet with the caws of the crows before them and the moans of the dying behind the sky lightened further and amara felt bernard draw in a sudden breath merciful furies she opened her eyes and looked out onto the plains beyond garrison now being lit as the sun rose over them and shone down upon a sea of pale bodies the marat thousands upon thousands of marat they stretched from horizon to horizon as far as the eye could see twenty thousand thirty fifty she had no way to accurately estimate numbers that vast she looked out at them as the horde poured slowly closer to garrison over the plains enough to drown the defenders of the little fortress enough to swarm over the calderon valley enough to rampage over the unprepared lands beyond and to destroy thousands of defenseless aleran communities she glanced up at bernard and then stepped forward away from him to lean one hand on the battlements watching the enemy come on youd better get pirellus she said quietly tell him to get ready chapter though they were not cold isanas feet were battered and bruised by the time she dragged the shambling odiana out of the rough undergrowth of the woodland and out onto the causeway that ran the length of the calderon valley she had barely caught her breath in the predawn darkness when she heard the drumming beats of running horses coming along the road swift and steady she seized odianas wrist and dragged her back toward the edge of the causeway but it was too late riders blazing along the furycrafted stones of the causeway were already upon them and all but ran them down before bringing their horses huge plunging shapes in the darkness rearing and fighting to a halt mistress isana gasped a startled young mans voice from the darkness what are you doing out here isana blinked up at the riders startled frederic yes maam the young man said he spoke quietly to the horse and then slid from the animals back keeping a hand on the reins furies maam but we didnt think wed see you again are you all right the other rider slid down and isana recognized steadholder roth from the pale white shock of hair drifting around his head he stepped to her at once and embraced her thank goodness isana we feared the worst she leaned against the old steadholder suddenly feeling the exhaustion in her arms and legs and had to have rills help to keep the tears from her eyes im all right it was a near thing but im all right who is this roth asked looking up past isana to squint at where odiana sat beside the road looking at nothing her expression listless its a long story ill take care of her but what are you doing out here outriding roth said and turned to nod back down the road from down the causeway came the drum of more hooves the rattle of cart wheels strained by the pace isana watched as more horses some pulling heavy farm carts others bearing riders came down the road toward them frederic let out a sharp whistle and waved his arms and the carts began to slow to a halt as they approached but what are you doing isana demanded roths expression looked very tired in the dimness isana the marat got into the valley yesterday sometime last night they attacked aldoholt and burned it down as far as we can tell no one made it out isana took a deep breath shocked she felt dizzy everyone roth nodded we saw the fires at dawn and warner and his boys went to check it out he sent them out to warn garrison and to riva the two heading for garrison were murdered we found them cut up not two miles back we dont know about the others oh no isana breathed oh furies poor warner then tonight frederic here was out in the fields working frederic nodded that big rock i didnt get it before the storm and i couldnt sleep and all so i was back there tonight mistress isana and these two men just fell out of the sky out of the sky knights aeris yes maam and one of them was all in black and one was in rivan colors maam and hurt so i hit the other one on the head with my shovel his voice had an anxious note to it as though he wasnt sure hed done correctly that wasnt wrong was it course not boy roth snorted he was a messenger from garrison isana sending to riva for reinforcements said a marat horde was on its way and someone wanted him dead pretty bad he had an arrow in him and theyd sent a knight to chase him to ground frederic here put a dent in the murderers noggin that wont come out for a while or wed have asked who sent him frederic ducked his head the wagons halted and a moment later otto and warner had both hurried up to them and each hugged isana otto with warm relief warner with stiff quiet determination so youre heading to garrison isana asked them warner nodded we sent messengers to riva through the woods where anyone watching from the air wouldnt be able to follow them but it will take them longer than by the air or the roads so were heading out to fill in the gap ourselves isana looked back at the wagons at the people filling them great furies warner you must have brought half of your holders a bit more otto said anxious he wrung his hands everyone able or who can do some useful crafting isana these people arent soldiers isana protested no warner said quietly but all the men have done their time in the legions isana if garrison falls theres nothing thats going to stop a horde from doing what it did to aldoholt to every steadholt between here and riva better for us to give our help and it not be needed than the other way around what about the children some of the older ones led the youngers into the back country beggars cave and such places theyll be safer there than in the steadholts until this blows over isana blew out a breath what about tavi my brother has anyone seen them no one said anything until frederic rubbed at his hair and said im sorry mistress no ones seen or heard from anyone that ran out the night of the storm we figured you all was dead or thatll do frederic roth said sternly the womans exhausted isana you and this girl get in the back of the lead wagon there otto get something warm in them and around them and well get moving again right otto said and took isanas arm he reached down for odianas but the woman flinched from him and let out a highpitched little sound ill do it isana told him and leaned down to touch odianas chin a broiling storm of emotion flowed up her from the touch and isana had to work to hold it away she lifted odianas face to hers and murmured only moving her lips get in the wagon odiana stared blankly at her but rose when isana tugged on her arm and climbed up into the wagon willingly enough settling in a back corner eyes flicking out from behind her tangled hair to watch the other holders in it isana climbed in beside her and a moment later the wagon began rattling down the causeway again someone passed her a heavy blanket which she draped over the both of them and a moment later a flask of something hot she drank some kind of spiced wine that burned in her belly but made her limbs feel warm and less tired she passed the flask to odiana who had to hold it in her hands for a long moment as though she had to work up the courage to drink and who curled up beneath the blanket and dropped into what seemed to be an exhausted sleep a moment after you look exhausted otto said from across the cart his face sympathetic try to get some rest well be in garrison soon but try isana passed him the flask and shook her head im not tired otto honestly ive too much on my mind but after she sat back again she leaned her head against the back of the cart and didnt wake up until the driver called back to otto holder there it is isana jerked awake and sat up enough to see ahead of the cart the morning was cold on her face and throat and the icy coating on the ground gleamed in the pale light of a dawn that was not far away smoke hung over garrison like a funeral shroud isanas heart lurched into her throat were they too late had the fort already been attacked she climbed up onto the drivers seat of the wagon even as the driver one of ottos holders began to cluck to the horses that pulled the wagon slowing them from their furyenhanced speed their breath steamed in the dim light as they approached isana saw a single young legionare on guard duty above the western gate of garrison a second look showed that he wore a heavy swath of bandages over his forehead and left eye and that those bandages were so recent that they were still spotted with blood a dark bruise discolored his cheek though it looked a day old at least as the group of wagons and horses closed the young soldier leaned out staring at them warner raised a hand to the guard hello the gate let us in the young man stammered sir you shouldnt be here the marat are attacking sir you shouldnt be bringing holders here right now i know the marat are attacking warner snapped weve come to help and everyone here has something they can do let us in the young legionare hesitated but there was a motion on the wall behind him and a man in a dented centurions helmet appeared holder warner giraldi warner said with a curt nod we heard you were having company and thought wed invite ourselves over to help you entertain them giraldi stared down at them for a moment and then nodded warner he said youd be better off turning around and heading for riva while you still can his words silenced every holder on the ground below isana stood up in the wagons seat good morning centurion have you seen my brother giraldi squinted down and then his eyes widened isana oh thank the furies your brother is here hes inside at the east gate isana the counts been badly wounded and livia is back in riva with her daughter harger and the legion crafters did what they could but they say without more skilled help he wont live isana nodded calmly she let her awareness slowly out toward giraldi gaining the sense of the mans emotions anger weariness and most of all despair hung on him like a coating of thick cold mud and isana shivered i take it the marat have already attacked just their vanguard giraldi said the rest of the horde will be here within the hour then wed best stop wasting time with talk giraldi open the gates i dont know if the count would the count has no say in this isana said and if the marat take garrison theyll be able to destroy everything we have weve the right to fight to defend our homes and families as well giraldi and every man here who is of age is a legion veteran open the gates giraldi bowed his head and nodded to the young legionare furies know we need the help do it the holders moved into garrison in short order and isana noticed that adult menthe veteransdrove all the wagons they pulled into the fortress as though part of the legion on duty there lining up their wagons in neat rows in the westernmost courtyard men started caring for the horses at once unhitching them and leading them to be watered and sheltered from the winter winds every legion camp was laid out identically enabling veterans and newly transferred units to be exactly aware of the operations and layout of any camp they came to even as some men picketed the horses others began forming up the veterans into files outside the armory and giraldi and another young legionare began to outfit them with shields swords spears breastplates helmets isana stepped down from the wagon holding odianas hand and leading the dazed woman who kept the blanket wrapped around her like a sleepy child harger isana called spotting the healer supervising a number of young women barely more than children really who were shredding bedsheets into bandages the old healer turned when he saw her a tired smile touching his face help he said well maybe we can make a fight of it after all she moved to him and embraced him quietly are you all right tired he said he looked around them and then said this is bad isana our wall isnt high enough and our knights went down in the first attack isanas throat tightened my brother a little banged up but well harger said isana weve got less than an hour by the time the sun rises youll be able to walk from here to the watchtowers on marat shoulders she nodded there see steadholder otto hes a strong crafter not too delicate because he mostly crafts injured livestock rather than people but he can mend broken bones better than anyone ive ever seen and he can do it from dawn to dark there are one or two other men at least as skilled as a legion watercrafter and many of the woman are better you have injured plenty harger said his eyes calculating really women better than a legion watercrafter see otto hell get our healers over to help yours youre in the eastern courtyard harger nodded blinking his eyes a few times then he clasped isanas shoulder thank you i dont know if it will do any good in the long run but there are men dying who wont have to now isana touched her hand with his and said where can i find bernard on the wall above the gate harger said isana nodded to him and started toward the far side of the fort she passed the commanders quarters and the officers barracks at the center of the fort then walked briskly past barracks after barracks she found the first bodies at the near side of the eastern courtyard in the stables dead horses lay inside crows already darting in and out of the stables doors their raucous cries rising from their darkened interiors more bodies littered the courtyard around hermarat and the great predator birds had been tossed into a rough heap at one side of the courtyard where they would be out of the way of the troops moving about inside legion casualties were laid out in neat rows on the other troops wrapped in their cloaks heads covered to keep the crows from their eyes the rest of the courtyard was filled with the wounded and the dying a bare scattering of legionares stood watch on the walls but there seemed to be so few of them isana walked forward stunned at the carnage she had never seen anything like it pain pressed on her sensed from the wounded like heat radiating out from an oven she shivered and folded her arms behind her odiana still following closely and holding her hand let out a small frightened whimper and did not lift her head isana she looked up to see her brother running toward her and she didnt fight either the tears that sprang to her eyes or the smile that touched her mouth he embraced her hugging hard and lifted her up off the ground as he did it thank the furies he rumbled i was so afraid for you she hugged him back hard tavi he froze for a moment and the motion sent ice running through her she leaned back taking his face between her hands what happened after the flood i lost him i couldnt track him in the storm i managed to get the cursor girl out of the water and then we came here was he alone isana asked not entirely if you count that fade was still with him i thought youd have found him after the flood she shook her head no i couldnt kord pulled me out of the river bernard her brothers eyes went flat its all right she assured him though she folded her hands over a little quiver of fear in her belly at the memory of kord s smokehouse his son aric helped us escape i got away from him and came here not alone isana said i had just reached the causeway when warner and the rest came down the road i rode here with them warner bernard said warner otto roth they brought all their holders here yours too theyve come to help those idiots bernard sputtered but his eyes glittered and he looked back toward the wall and the shattered gates leading into the fort a rough barricade had been shoved into place consisting of a pair of wagons upended barrels and bunks how many did he bring everyone isana said nearly five hundred people the women too isana nodded bernard grimaced i guess weve got it all resting on one throw then his eyes went past her to odiana whos this amara swallowed one of kords slaves she lied she saved my life thats a discipline collar on her bernard i couldnt leave her there he nodded glancing back at the walls again and let out a slow breath might have been kinder to its not going to be good isana frowned at him and then at the walls bernard do you remember when we had our holdraising of course he said everyone in the valley helped with that brought up the whole steadholt walls all in one day he blinked and turned to her his voice suddenly excited you mean that we could make the walls higher she nodded if it would help giraldi said they werent high enough it might bernard said it might it might he looked around there that centurion there hes the engineer see the braid on his tunic well need his help you tell him and im going to round up our earthcrafters bernard hurried off isana approached the man who glanced up blinked at her and then scowled at her from over a bristling grey mustache he listened to her without speaking while she told him of her plan impossible he said it cant be done girl ive forty summers centurion isana retorted and it must be done my brother is bringing our earthcrafters right now the centurion faced her more squarely his face and throat flushing a deep red holdfolk crafters he said this isnt a barn raising these are siege walls i dont see how that matters the man snorted in an explosion of breath these walls are made of layers of interlocking strata girl theyre hard flexible heavy and can stand up to any kind of pounding you care to dish out but you cant just make them higher once theyre in place like some pasture fence if you go toying with the wall youll disrupt the foundation and the whole thing will collapse we wont have a wall at all much less a taller one as i understand it isana said you might as well not have the wall as it stands in any case the man blinked at her for a moment then scowled and bowed his head snorting from beneath his mustache i understand that it might be difficult but its worth a try isnt it if it works we might be able to hold out against them if it doesnt isana shivered if it doesnt then id just as soon it didnt take too long in any case no the engineer said finally if there was a chance it might be worth the risk but these arent engineers theyre holders they dont have the kind of strength it takes youve never had to live in this valley have your isana said her voice wry not everyone with a strong fury wants to be a knight there are boys barely more than children in my steadholt who can tear boulders larger than a man out of the ground and as i see it we have nothing to lose the engineer eyed her impossible he said then it cant be done if i had a full corps of legion engineers it would still take me half a day to get that wall higher then its a good thing were not a corps of legion engineers isana said will you try a new voice cut into the conversation hell try isana looked up to see the cursor standing not far away wearing her brothers toolarge clothes and a borrowed tunic of mail she wore a sword at her hip and her left arm had been splinted amara looked tired and sported a bruise on throat abrasions on her chin but she regarded the engineer calmly coordinate with the steadholders make the attempt the engineer swallowed and then inclined his head to her in a bow as you wish countess the man turned and hurried away amara turned to face isana the slim girls expression quiet calm then she glanced past isana to where the water witch still stood wrapped in her blanket her expression distant and hissed a quiet curse she reached for her sword wait isana said stepping close and putting a hand over amaras dont but shes i know who she is isana said she isnt going to hurt anyone now she saved my lifeand a slaver put a discipline collar on her you cant trust her amara insisted she should be locked up but shes a knight herself a mercenary a murderer the cursors voice snapped with anger by all rights i should kill her right now i will not allow that isana said lifting her chin amara faced her quietly im not sure its your decision to make holder just then a tall darkskinned man with the look of a parcian his armor magnificent but stained with smoke and blood stepped over to them countess he said calmly the horde is nearly here id like you to stand with me see if you can spot their hordemaster amara glared at isana and turned to the parcian do you think killing him will do us any good now pirellus he smiled a sudden flash of white teeth as i see it it can hardly hurt and in any case id rather make sure that whatever animal is responsible for this he gestured around vaguely doesnt go back home to brag about it isana withdrew a pair of steps then calmly turned and led odiana away from the pair come on she murmured to the collared woman though she knew that odiana could not hear her theyre terrified and angry they wouldnt treat you fairly lets find someplace for you to be out of sight until we can get through this she hurried through the courtyard to one of the large warehouse buildings at the far side even as she opened the door and hurried in a group of holders bundled up in their homemade winter cloaks but wearing legion steel went tramping by in neat files heading for the gates another file led by bernard and the engineer speaking in hushed intent tones went past right behind them isana opened the door and led odiana into the warehouse the interior was dark and she could hear the scrabble of rats somewhere inside a rangy grey tomcat rushed past her legs and into the darkness intent on a meal crates and heavy sacks stood in neat ordered rows their contents clearly labeled it was too dim to see clearly so isana looked about until she found a furylamp and willed it to life lifting the clear globe in her hand and looking up and down the rows there she said and started to tug the woman forward continuing to speak in a low quiet tone hoping that the deafened watercrafter would at least find some comfort in the intent of the words bags of meal it will be softer than the floor and if you cover up you might be able to get some sleep youll be out of everyones way she hadnt taken a dozen steps when the door to the warehouse slammed behind her isana whirled holding the furylamp aloft shadows dancing and spinning wildly in the room kord dressed in a dirty cloak dropped the heavy bolt down over the reinforced door of the warehouse he turned to isana then eyes gleaming and smiled his teeth as grimy and smudged as the steadholders chain about his neck now then he said his voice quiet almost purring where were we chapter amara nodded to pirellus but will they be able to raise the wall pirellus shrugged againit cant hurt the wall isnt going to slow the marat down as it stands in any case nearby bernard and the engineer had led nearly a hundred men and women ranging in age from those below legion age to a wizened old grandmother who doddered along with the help of a cane and the arm of a brawny seriouslooking young man amara recognized from bernardholt are you sure it isnt a terrible risk we held it before amara pointed out against marat who had never seen a battle pirellus said halftrained green troops and we were nearly destroyed as it was dont fool yourself we got lucky there are five times as many of them out there now theyre experienced and they wont be operating in separate tribes his fingers drummed on the hilt of his dark blade and remember those knights are still out there amara shivered and abruptly looked behind her exactly which is why mistress isana we should she broke off abruptly whered she go pirellus looked around behind him then shrugged dont worry about it theres a very limited amount of trouble the woman can make in any case thats the advantage of certain death cursorits difficult to become impressed by further risks amara frowned at him but with this help doomed pirellus said flatly wed need three times that many troops to hold cursor what these holders are doing is admirable but unless one of their messengers got through to riva he shook his head without reinforcements without more knights were just killing time until sunrise see if you can spot the hordemaster and ill try to help them sort out the wounded and get more men back on their feet she started to speak to him but pirellus spun on his heel and walked back to the other courtyard his knee was swollen and purpling but he did not allow himself to limp another talent she envied in metalcrafters amara grimaced and wished she could will away the pain of her broken arm so easily or the fear that still weakened her knees she shivered and turned to walk toward the gates purposefully the barricade had been hastily removed as the earthcrafters had begun to set up for their attempt on the walls a squad of twenty legionares stood outside the broken gates in formation on guard lest any marat should try to slip through undetected the possibility seemed unlikely even as amara walked beneath the walls and out into the open plain beyond stepping around the grim and silent young men she could see the marat horde in the slowly growing light like some vast field of living snow marching steadily closer in no great hurry amara walked out away from the walls by several yards keeping her steps light and careful she tried not to look down at the ground the blackened remains of the marat who had perished in the first firestorm lay underfoot and all around grotesque and stinking crows flapped and squabbled everywhere mercifully covering most of the dead if she looked amara knew she would be able to see the gaping sockets of the corpses whose eyes had already been eaten away usually along with parts of the nose and the soft fleshy lips but she didnt the air smelled of snow and blood of burned flesh and faintly of carrion even through the screen cirrus provided her sense of smell she could smell it her knees trembled harder and she grew short of breath she had to stop and close her eyes for a moment before lifting them to the oncoming horde again she lifted her unwounded arm and bade cirrus make her vision more clear the fury bent the air before her and almost at once she could see the oncoming horde as though she stood close enough to it to hear their footsteps almost at once she could see what pirellus had meant though the fleeing elements of the marat horde had rejoined it half an hour before and been absorbed into the oncoming mass she could see the difference in the warriors now moving toward garrison without needing to engage them to understand part of pirelluss fears they were older men heavier with muscle and simple years but they walked with more of both confidence and caution ferocity tempered with wisdom she shivered women too walked among the horde bearing weapons wearing the mien of experienced soldiers which amara had no doubt that they were as near as aleran intelligence could determine the marat engaged in almost constant struggles against one anothersmallscale conflicts that lasted only briefly and seemed to result in few lasting hostilities almost ritual combat deadly enough though she focused on the horde grimly the dead behind the walls of garrison proved that as she watched them come on amara was struck by a sudden sense that she had not felt in a long time not since as a small child she had first been allowed out onto the open sea with her father in his fishing boat a sense of being outside a sense of standing balanced at the precipice of a world wholly alien to her own she glanced at the walls behind her eyes twinging as they refocused there stood the border of the mighty realm of alera a land that had withstood its enemies for a thousand years overcome a hostile world to build a prosperous nation and she stood outside it all but naked despite her armor the sheer size and scope of the rolling plains that lay beyond this last bastion of aleran strength made her feel suddenly small the voice that came to her whispered in the rustle of the lonely wind low indistinct never be intimidated by size itself i taught you better than that amara stiffened dropping the visioncrafting before her hand glancing around fidelias you always hold your legs stiffly when youre afraid amara you never learned to hide it oh and i can hear you the voice responded one of my men is crafting my voice to you and listening for your replies i have nothing to say to you amara whispered heated she glanced at the legionares too close behind her and stepped forward away from them so that they couldnt overhear she lifted her hand again focusing on the oncoming horde searching through their ranks for one who might be their leader useless fidelias commented you cant hold the walls and even if you do well break the gate again which part of i have nothing to say to you did you not understand she paused a moment and then added as viciously as she knew how traitor then listen fidelias said i know you dont agree with me but i want you to think about this gaius is going to fall you know it if he doesnt fall cleanly hell crush thousands on his way down he might even weaken the realm to the point that it can be destroyed how can you dare speak to me of the safety of the realm because of you her sons and daughters lie dead behind that wall we kill people fidelias said its what we do i have dead of my own to bury thanks to you if you like ill tell you about the families of the men you made fall to their deaths at least the dead inside had a chance to fight for their lives the ones you murdered didnt dont be too liberal with that particular brush apprentice amara abruptly remembered the men screaming falling she remembered the terror on their faces though she hadnt taken much note of it at the time she closed her eyes her stomach turned over on itself if you have something to say say it and have done i have work to do ive heard dying can be quite the chore fideliass voice noted i wanted to make you an offer no amara said stop wasting my time i wont take it yes you will fidelias said because you dont want the women and children behind those walls to be murdered with the rest of you amara stiffened she felt suddenly cold leave fidelias said you lead the women and children away ill have my knights see that the marat are delayed long enough to give you a safe lead no she whispered youre lying you cant control the marat dont be so sure fidelias said amara i dont like what has to be done but you can make a difference you can save the lives of innocent people of the realm you lead them if you dont personally then theres no deal there was silence for a moment before he said weariness in his voice you dont know what youre doing girl i dont want to see you die for it and if i can save the lives of some noncombatants while protecting you so much the better amara closed her eyes her head spinning the stench of the burned corpses of the carrion the crows had torn into came to her again she was a cursor a skilled fencer an agent of the crown a decorated heroine of the realmbut she did not want to die it terrified her she had seen the men the marat had killed and none of them had gone pleasantly she had joked before lightly that she would never want to end her life in less than a viciously bloody fashion as alive as she could possibly be but the reality of it was different there wasnt any consideration in it no abstract philosophy just glittering animal eyes and terror and pain it made sense she reasoned fidelias wasnt a monster he was a man like any other he had cared about her when they worked together almost more than her father had in some ways it was reasonable to assume that he did not want to see her die if he could avoid it and if she could save some more people if she could lead those who would surely die away from the coming struggle surely it would be worth it surely there would be no shame for her in fleeing no dishonor before the crown or before bernards memory it wouldnt be wrong fidelias was giving her a way out an escape amara fideliass voice said gently there isnt much time you must go quickly if you are to save them she abruptly saw the trap though she didnt understand it yet though she wasnt sure exactly where it lay she recognized what he had scattered out to blind herraw emotions fear the desire to protect the need to save her own pride he had played on them just as he had tried to put her into a raw emotional state of terror and grief when he had betrayed her before i must go quickly she said quietly i must go me or theres no deal she took a breath and said why would you want to make sure i was not a part of this battle fidelias why now instead of an hour ago why did you make this offer only after you saw me observing the enemy dont do this to yourself amara he said dont rationalize your way out of life dont let it kill those children she swallowed he was right of course perhaps she was being manipulated perhaps accepting his offer would mean that she had sacrificed some unknown advantage but could she really argue against that statement could she make some attempt to play at maneuvers against him here now when she would almost certainly die and when it would cost the lives of children run save them grieve with the crown over the valleys loss your purpose as a cursor is to save lives amara stay true to your purpose and let me stay true to my choice the crows croaked and swooped all around her she opened her mouth to agree but a sudden sound stopped her without warning the ground began to rumble low hard rhythmic she staggered and had to crouch to keep her balance she looked back at the walls of garrison a shout went up from the legionares who immediately marched forward away from the walls breaking into ragged formation as the pitching of the earth made them stagger left and right they came out to the same distance she stood at and turned to stare at the walls with her the walls of garrison heaved and shuddered like a sleeper stirring they rippled a slow wave rolling through the seamless grey stone and then with a screeching of breaking earth they began to grow amara stared at it in sudden wonder she had never seen any such feat done on such a scale before the walls rolled up higher like a wave approaching the shore they ground forward several paces toward the enemy until amara realized that they were growing thicker at the base to support the greater height the walls grew and the grim grey stone began to streak with ribbons of scarlet and azure twined within the rock the colors of alera proper and then with scarlet bound with gold the colors of the legions home city of riva the battlements grew higher and with an abrupt shriek of stone spikes erupted at the summit of the battlements and then sprang out all along the walls themselves long slender daggers of some dark stone that gleamed in the growing light the spikes spread as though they were tendrils sprung from some deadly vines beneath the surface of the wall and raced out over the ground before the walls as well rippling into place like blades of grass growing all in an instant their gleaming tips pointing out at the oncoming horde the crows dismayed flew into the sky in a sudden storm of black wings and raucous cawing circling around the field of battle like wreathes of panicked smoke the rumbling eased the walls of garrison stood thirty feet high and grim and bristled with razoredged daggers of the same black stone amara could now see that the marat used for their own weapons the ground itself lay ready to impale any attackers and in the stunned silence she heard fideliass voice whisper bloody crows the legionares beside her erupted into sudden cheers and she was barely able to hold back the shout of defiance that came to her own throat she snapped an order to the men to send them back inside and they began picking their way painfully across the field of spikes before the wall one of the men slipped and cut his leg drawing of all things a sudden and enthusiastic discussion about how sharp the spikes were and how well theyd cut him the loudest voice of praise was from the injured man more cheers rose up from inside the fortress and as amara watched more legionares crowded the wall and someone raised the banners of the legion and of riva into position above the gates within one of the musicians began to trumpet the call to arms and the legionares professional and holder alike answered it in a sudden roar that shook the stone of the hills framing the fortress amara spun back out to face the horde coming over the plains and hissed fight for what you want fidelias but it will not be handed to you the future of these men and women children and soldier alike is not cast in stone if you want the fortress then come and take it there was a long and terrible silence before fidelias responded and when he did his voice was calm even goodbye amara with the softest whisper of wind the contact faded amara turned and called to cirrus she stepped forward and leapt lightly over the field of spikes thirty yards or more landing in the gate ahead of the legionares returning from outside her heart pounded in swift hot defiance determination she tried not to notice that it made her broken arm throb as well with pain amara moved quickly into the courtyard and the shadows of the nowhigher walls had changed the perspective of the entire place it took her a moment to orient herself but she spotted bernard sitting at the base of the new wall with a group of jubilantfaced panting men talking shields and weaponry and breastplates lay near each man and one of the women had brought water to them as much seemed to have been tossed over their heads as down their throats and their tunics were splotched with water their breath turned to steam before smiling mouths pirellus stood nearby bernard and nodded to her when he saw her interesting pirellus said jerking his head back toward the wall its going to force them to use their scaling poles and to try to take the gate well be able to make a good fight of it at least incredible amara said grinning first at pirellus and then at bernard ive never seen anything like it bernard looked up with a tired smile of his own always amazing what you can do when you must pirellus asked did you spot anything no amara said but i believe our opposition was afraid that i would she told them in brief about the conversation with fidelias bernard frowned you know maybe we should get as many people as we can into the wagons and get them on the road again can we hold long enough to let them get away pirellus looked at the wall and then at the other side of the courtyard its a risk worth taking ill see to it he said shortly there wont be enough room for everyone but we could get the children out at least thank you amara told him pirellus nodded to her you were right last night he said i was wrong then he headed out across the courtyard steps steady despite his wounded leg bernard whistled and said to amara that cost him something i think nothing he couldnt do without anyway amara said her voice dry bernard those knights are still out there and theyre going to be coming in on us again i know bernard said but we dont have enough knights aeris to hold the sky we dont know when or where theyll come amara nodded to him but i think i have a good guess heres what i want you to do she laid out brief instructions for him and he nodded gathered up some more of the holders with him and hurried off to carry out her plan amara checked in with harger and then headed up onto the wall the battlements were crowded with men but she located giraldi standing soberly in position at the center of the wall over the gate centurion she greeted him countess how does it look he nodded out toward the oncoming marat hardly more than a mile away now theyve stopped he told her out past our best bow range even for these holder boys theyre waiting for what he shrugged sunrise maybe if they give it a few minutes the sun will be in our eyes when it comes up will it hurt us much he shrugged it wont help she nodded how long can we expect to hold them no telling with these things if we can keep them off the walls out of the gates a good long while long enough to give a group of wagons a running start he glanced at her the holders wagons amara nodded were loading them with the women and children right now giraldi looked at her steadily for a moment then nodded all right then well hold them long enough excuse me he turned and stepped back from the battlements to meet a panting legionare who had made his way down the wall amara followed him giraldi frowned and asked where are those canteens man the legionare saluted sorry sir theyre in the east warehouse and its already been secured already been secured giraldi growled how do you know door was locked giraldi frowned at the man well find harger and get him towhats that on your shoes hay sir where did you get hay in your boots legionare one of the holders threw it there sir theyre tossing it all over the courtyard what amara stepped in my orders centurion uh giraldi said he swept off his helmet and rubbed at his shortcropped hair with all due respect your ladyship what kind of idiot order is that if you put hay all over the courtyard itll make the prettiest fire you ever saw and among our own to boot for all we know theyre going to be shooting flame arrows over the wall its a calculated risk centurion that i cannot explain here lady giraldi began to protest from down the wall someone shouted sir amara and giraldi both turned to look down the wall a palefaced young legionare jerked his chin out toward the plains beyond the fortress here they come chapter amara rushed back to the battlements with giraldi beside her and watched as the marat horde beneath the droning yawls of huge hollowed animal horns began a determined advance moving forward at a steady trot with wolves and herdbane loping along beside them crows whispered one of the legionares beside amara she saw the man reach for his spear fumble it and drop it she flinched hand flashing out and batting the falling weapon away from her giraldi caught it in one scarknuckled hand steady he growled eyes on amara he passed the spear back to the legionare steady lads the horde grew closer the sounds of thousands of feet hitting the ground as they ran rose like far off thunder steady giraldi said he looked up and down the line and barked archers shields the legionares stepped up to the battlements in each crenellation stood a man with one of the huge legion wall shields behind each another legionare armed with a bow and a thick warquiver of arrows strung his bow and took position most of the archers were holders from the valley the marat grew closer the eerie droning of their horns growing louder more unnerving a restless shuffle went down the line of shieldmen steady giraldi commanded he glanced at the young holder in borrowed armor beside him you sure you lads can shoot that far the holder peeked around the edge of the shield of the burly legionare in front of him yes theyre in range giraldi nodded archers he growled fire at will all up and down the line archers set arrows to their bows their tips pointing up at the sky standing close to their shield man amara watched the nearest young man halfdraw his bow then bump his partner with his hip the legionare knelt lowering the shield and the archer drew as he lowered the bow took quick aim and loosed at the oncoming marat his partner stood up again swiftly bringing his shield back into position all along the wall the archers began shooting each man loosed an arrow every five or six breaths or even faster amara stood beside giraldi in the one crenellation not occupied by a shieldman and watched the arrows slither through the air and into the oncoming marat ranks the deadly aim of the aleran holders dropped marat and beast alike with equal ferocity littering the ground with fresh corpses making the eager crows swoop and dive in a swarm over the charging horde but still the horde came on the archers had begun shooting at close to six hundred yardsan incredible distance amara knew they had to have been woodcrafters of nearly a knights skill to manage such a feat for perhaps a minute there was no sound but the grunt of archers drawing bows legionares kneeling and standing again the droning blare of marat horns and the rumbling of thousands of feet but when the marat closed to charging range of the walls the entire horde erupted in a sudden shout that hit amara like a wall of cold water chilling terrifying in its sheer intensity at the same moment the war birds let out a shrill piercing shriek terrifying from one such beast but from the thousands below the sound almost seemed a living thing all its own at the same moment the sun broke the horizon across the distant plains a sudden harsh light that swept over the top of the battlements first and made archers flinch and squint as they attempted their next shot steady giraldi bellowed voice barely carrying over the din spears the shieldbearing centurions gripped their spears faces set in a fighting grimace below the marat charge hit the first razoredged defensive spikes the holders had crafted out of the earth itself amara watched closely her heart in her throat the leaders in the marat charge began to leap and skip among the spikes looking for all the world like children playing at hopping games behind them leapt their animals amara saw some of the marat with heavy knotted cudgels begin to strike the spikes from the sides shattering them the ones with clubs amara said tell the archers to aim for them the longer we can keep the spikes in place the harder it will be for them to pressure the gate giraldi grunted and relayed her order up and down the walls and the archers instead of firing into the enemy at random began to pick their targets scaling poles and ropes with hooks fashioned of some kind of antlers or bone began to lift toward the wall legionares thrust at the poles with the crossguards of their spears pushing them away and some drew their swords to hack at ropes as they came up while the archers continued to fire on the enemy arrows began to flicker up from the horde below short heavy arrows launched from oddly shaped bows one of the archers beside amara lingered in aiming his shot for too long and an arrow struck him through both cheeks in a sudden welter of blood the holder choked dropping surgeon amara yelled and a pair of men on the wall moved quickly to the fallen man dragging him down before going to work on removing the arrow amara stepped back to the battlements she swept her gaze over the enemy below but she couldnt see anything beyond a horde of marat and their beasts so many thousands of them that it was difficult to tell where one left off and the other began giraldi abruptly seized her shoulder and dragged her back from the edge not without a helmet he growled i cant tell whats happening amara panted she had to shout to make herself heard there are too many of them giraldi squinted out at the enemy then drew his head prudently back about half of their force is here theyre holding the rest back ready to bring them in when they get an opening are we holding them the walls are doing all right giraldi called back but the gate is our weak point they attack the walls only to keep most of our men busy up here there are too few men at the gate theyll force the barricade sooner or later why didnt they craft the gate closed cant giraldi reported engineer told me no foundation under it for extra wall and the interior surface is lined with metal from below them there came a crunching sound and a sudden chorus of mixed aleran war cries of riva for alera and calderon for alera giraldi glanced out over the field again they must have gotten part of the barricade down the hordemaster has ordered the rest of his troops in and theyre on the move theyll try to put pressure on the gate until the defense breaks giraldi grimaced if they dont repel this first thrust were done for amara nodded to him all right almost time then ill be back up as soon as i can she leaned out to look down into the courtyard below she could just make out the forms of a couple of legionares standing their ground almost within the gate itself spears thrusting there were shrieks and cries from below and amaras eyes caught a flash of motion a dark blade seen for only a second as its wielder spun it out behind him pirellus was holding the gate once more amara hurried to the nearest stairs and pelted down them to the courtyard looking around wildly hay from the bales she had crashed through earlier that morning lay scattered everywhere over the courtyard all but a few of the wounded had been pulled back to the west courtyard and the last of them were being loaded onto stretchers she started across the courtyard toward the stables as she did she saw pluvus pentius emerge from one of the barracks whitefaced and nervous one hand wrapped around the hand of a little boy whose hand stretched back behind to another child and so on until the truthfinder was leading half a dozen children across the courtyard amara hurried to him pluvus what are these children still doing here hhiding pluvus stuttered i found them hiding under their fathers bunks in the barracks crows amara spat get them to the west courtyard with the wounded theyre supposed to be fortifying one of the barracks to hold them and hurry yes right pluvus said his skinny shoulders tightening come on children hold hands and stay together amara dashed to the stables and found bernard sitting with his back to the wall just inside one of the doors his eyes halfclosed bernard she called the gate is under attack theyll be coming were ready bernard mumbled just say when amara nodded to him and turned focusing her attention on cirrus then sent him up and out into the sky feeling for the windcrafters she knew would be carrying fideliass rogue knights toward the fortress she felt it a moment later a tension in the air that spoke of a coming stream of wind amara called cirrus back and worked another sightcrafting sweeping the sky searching for the incoming troops she spotted them while they were still half a mile from the fortress dark shapes against the morning sky there she shouted theyre coming in from the west half a minute at the most all right bernard murmured amara stepped out into the open as the knights aeris with their transport litters swept down from the skies diving for the fortress a wedge of knights aeris flew before the litters weapons ready and the sun gleamed on the metal of their armor they headed toward the gate in a steep dive ready amara shouted and drew her sword ready she waited a pair of heartbeats more until the enemy reached the valleyside wall and passed over the western courtyard then the garrison commanders building she took a breath willing her hands to stop shaking loose all around her in the courtyard hummocks and lumps of scattered hay shook and shimmered and a full fifty holder bowmen covered with handfuls of hay and by the woodcrafting bernard had worked over them became vaguely visible as one they lifted their great bows and opened fire directly up at the underside of the incoming knights the holders aim proved deadly and their attack had taken the mercenaries completely by surprise knights aeris in their armor cried out in sudden shock and pain and men began to plummet from the skies like living hailstones the archers stood their ground shooting even as the stunned mercenaries began to recover one of the knights aeris who had not been hit began to weave the air into a shield of turbulence and arrows began to abruptly veer and miss amara focused on the man and sent cirrus toward his windstream the knight let out a cry of surprise and fell like a stone the second and third litters listed and began to spin out of control toward the ground while injured and surprised bearers struggled to keep them from simply dropping the first litter though one of its bearers had taken an arrow through the thigh made it through the withering cloud of arrow fire though it had to veer to one side and dropped onto the roof of one of the barracks on the opposite side of the courtyard knights aeris began to swoop and dive toward the courtyard attacking and though the holders archery had done well when the knights had not been prepared to face it the air shortly became a howling cloud of shrieking furies rendering the holders arrows all but useless fall back amara shouted and the holders began to withdraw harried by the airborne knights toward the stables the knights gathered together for a charge their intention evidently to take the courtyard and hold it and rushed at the retreating archers in a swift and deadly dive amara hurled cirrus at the opposing furies and though she was able to do little more than disrupt the formation of the knights aeris they broke off the charge swooping back up into the sky above the fortress enabling the archers to retreat into the carrionstink of the stables amara herself turned and pelted toward the legionares stationed outside the gate she caught a glimpse of the knight commander standing beside the makeshift wooden barricade the marat had managed to find two or three ways to crawl through it and pirellus danced from one spot to the next his blade and the spears of the two men backing him up keeping the marat at bay pirellus she shouted pirellus a moment lady he called and whipped his sword out in a blinding thrust the marat who received it died without so much as a struggle simply collapsing in the gap among the various wooden objects pirellus took a pair of steps back and nodded to the spearmen and to a few of the other legionares standing by the men moved forward to hold the barricade and pirellus turned to amara i heard you calling the mercenaries attacked two of their litters went down outside the walls she said and pointed but a third landed on the roof of that barracks pirellus nodded once very well stay here andcountess the black blade swept out and something shattered with a brittle sound amara who had begun to turn felt splinters of wood flickering against her cheek and the broken fletchmg of an arrow rebounded from her mail she lifted her eyes to the barracks and saw fidelias there calmly drawing another arrow to his stout short bow and taking aim even as behind him several men began to clamber down from the roof the former cursors thin hair blew in the cold wind and though he stood in the shadow of the newly risen walls amara could see his eyes on hers calm and cool even as he drew back the second shaft aimed and loosed pirellus stepped in the way of the shot cutting it from the air with a contemptuous slap of his blade and called to the men behind him fideliass soldiers were joined by the knights aeris who circled back above the fortress and then dove toward the gates pirellus dragged amara back to the stables and growled stay down even as he did amara could see the legionares form into a ragged rank that met the oncoming troops and the knights above with an uncertain tenacity fidelias on the barracks roof climbed down to the ground his eyes flickering over the hay scattered there he knelt into it there came a blurring in the air and then he simply vanished covered by a woodcraftmg of his own there amara cried grabbing at pirelluss arm the one who shot mehes covered with a woodcraftmg and headed for the gates she pointed at a flickering over at one side of the courtyard hardly visible behind the struggling legionares with their backs to the gate i see him pirellus replied he glanced down at amara and said the steadholder exhausted himself with that woodcrafting good luck then he rose and stalked out into din and whirl and scream of the fight in the courtyard amara looked behind her to find bernard sitting where she had left him his eyes open but not focused his chest heaving with labored breaths she went to his side and took her canteen from her belt pressing it against his hands here bernard drink he obeyed numbly and she remained beside him turning to watch the fight the legionares were having a hard time of it even as she watched a giant of a swordsman aldrick ex gladius closed in on the shieldwall swept one blade aside danced past another and killed a man in the center of the line with a sweeping cut that sheered through his helmet and skull dropping him to the ground on immediately senseless legs without pausing he engaged the two men on either side of the first one of the men moved quickly and got away with no more than a crippling thrust to his biceps the other lifted his shield too high in a parry and aldrick spun sweeping his leg off at the knee the man screamed and toppled and the mercenaries surged forward hard against the shields pirellus appeared among the legion ranks his black blade flickering one of the knights aeris his dive too low clutched at his belly with a sudden scream and tumbled to the courtyard one of the mercenaries on the ground wielding a fortypound maul in one hand as though it weighed no more than a willow switch swung his huge weapon at pirellus the knight commander slipped to one side with a deceptively lazy motion and his return blow struck off the mans hand at the wrist the maul fell heavily to the ground a third mercenary darted his blade at pirellus only to be parried and almost casually disarmed the sword tumbling end over end to rattle against the wall of the stable not far from amara fall back to the gate came aldricks bellow fall back the mercenaries retreated quickly dragging their wounded with them but a similar shout from pirellus caused the legion troops to halt their advance as well neither aldrick nor pirellus retreated leaving the two men standing a pair of long steps apart pirellus extended his blade toward aldrick and then swept it up before his face in a gliding salute which aldrick mirrored then the two men dropped into a relaxed on guard position aldrick ex gladius pirellus said ive heard about you the crown has a pretty bounty on your head ill be sure to check the wanted posters next time i go through a town aldrick responded do you want to settle this or do you need me to go through another few dozen of your legionares my name is pirellus of the black blade pirellus said and im the man who will end your career aldrick shrugged never heard of you kid youre not araris pirellus scowled and moved a sudden liquid blur of muscle and steel aldrick parried the parcians first thrust in a sudden shower of silver sparks countered with one of his own that proved to be a feint and whirled in circle blade lashing out pirellus ducked under it though the blow struck sparks from his helmet and clove away part of its crest to lie glowing and smoldering on the strawstrewn ground the two men faced one another again and pirellus smiled fast for an old man he said but you missed aldrick said nothing a heartbeat later a slow trickle of blood dribbled down from beneath the rim of pirelluss helmet and toward his eye the swordsman must have driven the helmets rim into the cut pirellus had taken earlier amara reasoned opening it again now aldrick smiled pirelluss face had gone sallow beneath his brown skin he lifted his lips at aldrick and came forward sword lashing out in swift blows high low high again aldrick parried him in showers of silver sparks the swordsman shifted onto the offensive himself blade sweeping in short hard cuts at the smaller warrior pirelluss black blade intercepted each blow sparks of a purple so dark as to hardly be visible exploding at each point of impact the blows drove the parcian back a number of steps and aldrick pressed forward ruthlessly as amara watched pirellus almost took down the swordsman he slipped beneath a cut slammed the swordsmans arm aside with his open hand and drove his blade at aldricks belly aldrick twisted aside and the parcians blade struck more dark sparks from aldricks armor cutting through it like paper the thrust missed though it drew blood in a long scarlet line across aldricks belly aldrick recovered parrying another thrust and another while pirellus followed him up with determined strokes the swordsman seemed to amara to be waiting for something it became apparent what in the next few seconds blood running over pirelluss eye forced him to blink it closed and he snapped his head to one side in an effort to clear it in that moment the swordsman moved aldrick slipped inside the parcians slow thrust and lashed out with his foot in a short hard kick a simple stomp as though hed been driving a spade into the earth but it wasnt a spade his boot hit it was pirelluss already wounded knee the bones broke with a clean sharp crack and aldrick drove his shoulder into pirelluss throwing him to one side the knight commanders face showed nothing but determination but as he stumbled he put weight on his knee and it simply could not support his body any longer he crumpled to the ground turning for another cut at aldrick as the swordsman stepped toward him aldrick parried the blow aside with casual power more indigo sparks erupting then with a step to one side and a swift cut he took pirelluss head from his shoulders blood spurted in an arch as the knight commanders body fell to the stones of the courtyard his head rolled to a stop several yards away his body lay twitching his sword arm even in death slashing left and right amara stared at the fallen knight in horror as her instincts screamed at her forced her to remember that fidelias was still on the move and had not been stopped she rose uncertain what she could do to stop what was happening in the courtyard aldrick turned on a heel and without even pausing began to stalk alone toward the legionares guarding the gates before he could reach them the wood of the barricade groaned let out a tortured scream and began to warp and writhe splinters and shards of wood exploded out sending legionares reeling back from them in stunned horror then the wood itself began to writhe and move the legs of tables twisting and clutching planks shattering the wagon letting out a tortured scream and then collapsing upon itself the marat on the other side began to shove hard against the barricade and without the hastily constructed stability of the various pieces the barricade itself began to wobble and crumble in fidelias appeared not far from aldrick and then turned to signal one of the knights in the air the man swept down and grabbed fidelias beneath the arms lifting him back to the roof of the barracks and aldrick ex gladius stepped over pirelluss fallen corpse to lead the other handful of mercenaries after them the legionares at the gate formed up to face the incoming marat but the invaders leapt on them with an unyielding savagery and began to drive the men near the gates back step by slow step amara rose and rushed into the stable to shout to the archers take up a shield and sword hold the gate men rushed about in the stables interior taking up weapons and rushing outside to join the defense at the gate when amara returned to bernard he had regained his feet whats happening their knights came in we bloodied them but they managed to weaken the barricade pirellus is dead she looked at him im not a soldier what do we do giraldi bernard said get to giraldi hell send more men to reinforce the gates go im not up to running yet amara nodded and fled sprinting across the courtyard and up the steps to the wall the fighting there was more hectic and she stepped over the body of a marat proof that they had gained purchase on the wall at least once giraldi she shouted when she reached the command area over the gates where are you a grim legion shieldman his face halfmasked in blood turned to her it was giraldi his eyes calm despite the bloodied sword in his hands countess you said you were looking for the hordemaster and there he is finally grunted giraldi there see it doesnt matter amara said her voice numb pirellus is dead crows giraldi said but his voice was too tired for it to be much of an oath just seems like someone should pay him back for this amara lifted her head something hot and hard and terrible pulsing in her belly the fear she realized had vanished she was too tired to be afraid too afraid to be afraid anymore there was a sort of relaxation that came with inevitability she realized a sort of mad silent strength which one is he there giraldi said pointing an arrow shattered on his shield and he didnt flinch as though he was too tired to let it bother him see the tall one with the birds all around him and the aleran spear amara focused on him and saw the marat hordemaster for the first time he was marching steadily through the ranks of marat hurling themselves against the walls his chin lifted an arrogant smirk on his mouth black feathers had been braided into his pale hair and several of the herdbane stalked behind him like some deadly guard of honor other troops went before chanting the hordemasters troops began to part for him crying out in a steady chant as they did atsurak atsurak atsurak amara brought up cirrus in a visioncrafting determined to learn this mans features to find him and at all costs to kill him for leading the horde against them this day she memorized the shape of his nose and cruel mouth the steady breadth of his shoulders beneath a thanadenthide cowl the amara caught her breath staring and willed cirrus to bring her vision even closer to the hordemaster riding at his hip through a thin braided twist of cord he used as a belt was the signet dagger of an aleran high lord its gold and silver hilt gleaming in the morning sun even as amara stared cirrus let her see the daggers hilt the crest wrought in steel upon it aquitaines falcon furies she breathed aquitaine aquitaine himself no one more powerful in the realm save the first lord aquitaines knights then aquitaine who subverted fidelias aquitaine who had attempted to gain knowledge of the palace from her in order to in order to kill gains he means to take the throne for himself amara swallowed she had to recover that dagger at any cost to bring such a damning piece of evidence before the senate would finish aquitaine and terrify anyone working with him into loyalty again she could prove who the true culprit behind todays vicious deaths had been and though she had thought she hated the hordemaster now striding toward the buckling defenses of garrisons gates she felt a sudden and furious rage against the man whose ambitions had engineered the events of the past several days but could she do it could she recover the dagger she had to try she now realized why fidelias had wanted her out of the fortress he had wanted to hide this very thing from her knowing full well that only she and perhaps two or three other people in the fortress would recognize the signet dagger for what it was she shook her head forcing her thoughts to focus to take one thing at a time giraldi we need reinforcements she stammered the gate is about to fall giraldi grimaced and as she watched his face fell the lines in it deepening making him look as though he had aged years in the space of a breath doesnt matter he said and jerked his chin toward the field below the fortress look amara looked and when she did the strength went out of her legs she leaned hard against the battlements her head swimming her heart pounding in light irregular beats no she breathed no its not fair out on the plain beyond the savage horde of marat below there had come another horde every bit as large as the first this one included elements of cavalry though she could make out little beyond that cavalry useless for taking a fortified position but the ideal troops for raiding into an enemys lands fast deadly destructive the sheer numbers of the newly arrived enemy had she knew abruptly changed the fight from a desperate battle to a hopeless one she looked up at giraldi and saw it in his eyes we cant win she said we cant hold against that he shook his head he took his helmet off and wiped sweat from his brow replacing it as arrows buzzed through the air she bowed her head her shoulders shaking the tears were hot and bitter a stoneheaded arrow shattered on the merlon above her but she didnt care amara looked up at the marat at atsurak about to take the gates at the enormous number of marat still fresh and unbloodied now moving quickly over the plains toward the fortress hold she told giraldi hold as long as you can send someone to make sure the civilians have started running tell the wounded to arm themselves to fight as best they can tell them she swallowed tell them it looks bad yes countess giraldi said his voice numb heh i always figured my last order would be pass me another slice of roast he gave her a grim smile turned to swing his sword at a climbing marat almost absently and headed off to follow her commands amara climbed back down off the wall taking absent note of the courtyard fidelias and his men were nowhere in sight probably gone again safely lofted up by their knights aeris at the barricade more marat had pushed through and though they had trouble advancing over the corpses fallen on the ground yet they came on despite the desperate cries of the alerans pitted against them she drew her sword the sword from the fallen guardsman in the princeps memorium and stared at its workmanship then she looked up at the marat pushing through the gates sure that in time she would see their hordemaster here to claim the fortress for himself bernard stepped up beside her still looking tired but holding a double bladed woodsmans axe in his broad hands do we have a plan the hordemaster i saw him i want to take him down she told him about the dagger at his waist the second horde coming on bernard nodded slowly if we get to him he said im going to try a woodcrafting on you take the knife and run get it back to the first lord if you can youre exhausted if you try to work another crafting it could k she stopped herself and took a slow breath pirellus was right bernard commented the good part of being doomed is that you have nothing left to lose then he turned to her slipping an arm around her waist and kissed her on the mouth with no hesitation no selfconsciousness nothing but a raw hunger tempered with a kind of exquisite gentleness amara let out a soft sound and threw herself into the kiss suddenly frantic and felt tears threaten her eyes again she drew back from the kiss far too soon looking up at him bernard smiled at her and said i didnt want to leave that undone she felt a tired smile on her own mouth and she turned from him to face the gates outside there came a blaring of horns deeper somehow more violent more angry than the first ones had been the ground began to shake once again and shouts and rumbles outside the walls rose into a tidal wave of sound that pounded at her ears her throat her chest she thought she could feel her cheeks vibrating from the sheer volume the final defense at the gate began to crumble the marat began to force their way into the courtyard their eyes wild weapons bloodied pale hair and skin speckled with scarlet one armed holder went down before a pair of enormous wolves and a marat fighting with nothing but his own teeth a great herdbane pinned a crawling aleran to the ground and with a birdlike bob of its head seized the alerans neck and broke it with a quick shake the marat poured in and there was sudden bedlam in the courtyard lines disintegrating into dozens of separate smaller battles pure chaos there amara said and jabbed her finger forward coming through the gate right now atsurak strode through the gates his beasts all around him with a casual motion of his captured aleran spear he thrust it through the back of a fighting legionare and then without watching the man die withdrew the spear to test its edge against his thumb several alerans rushed him one was torn to shreds by one of the huge birds another dropped to the earth before he got close to atsurak blackfeathered marat arrows sprouting from both eyes no one got within striking distance of the hordemaster bernard growled im going in first get their attention you come right behind me all right amara said and put her hand on his shoulder bernard gripped the axe and tensed to move forward sudden thunder shook the air in a roar that made what came before sound like nothing more than the rumbling of an empty belly screams frantic howling cries rose in a symphony the walls themselves shook just beside the gates they shook again beneath a thunderous impact and a web of cracks spread out through them again the thunder rammed against the outer walls and with a roar an entire section gave in alerans on the battlements had to scramble to either side stone tumbling down in huge and uneven sections dust flooding out light from the newly risen sun pouring through the dust in a sudden flood of terrible golden splendor through the sudden gap in the walls came a thunderous bellow and the vast shape of a blackcoated gargant a gargant bigger than any such beast amara had ever seen bloodied painted in wild and garish colors the beast seemed something out of a madmans nightmare it lifted its head and let out another bellowing roar and tore down another ten feet of wall with its vast digging claws the gargant bellowed again and shouldered its way through the wall and into the courtyard itself a marat warrior sat upon the gargants back pale of hair and dark of eye with shoulders so broad and chest so deep not even the largest breastplate could have fit him he bore a longhandled cudgel in his hand and with an almost casual sweep he leaned to one side and smote it down onto the head of a wolf clan warrior strangling a downed aleran dropping the marat to the earth with a broken skull atsurak bellowed the marat on the back of the maddened gargant his voice deep rich furious shook the stones of the courtyard atsurak of herdbane doroga of gargant calls you mistaken before wethemarat come out you murderous dog come and face me before the one whirling with insane grace the gargant spun to one side great forelegs rising together the beast brought his clawed feet down on top of a charging herdbane clan warrior simply smashing him flat against the courtyards stones at that though the din outside the walls continued to rise the battle in the courtyard fell into a sudden shocked silence as the great beast turned letting out another defiant bellow amara saw in the golden light pouring through the breached walls the boy tavi clinging to dorogas back behind him on the great gargant and behind the boy sat the scarred slave clutching at him and gibbering tavi looked wildly around the courtyard and when his gaze flicked toward them his face lit with a ferocious smile uncle bernard uncle bernard he shouted pointing at doroga he followed me home can we keep him chapter isana took a pair of quick steps back pressing odiana along behind her and lifted her chin ive always thought you a pig kord but never an idiot do you think youll get away with a killing right here in garrison kord laughed a rough sound in case you didnt notice theyve got bigger fish to fry i just walked right on in like all those other fools who came to die here it doesnt mean you can escape kord assuming that one of us doesnt get to you when you try it kord laughed again the sound of it dry rasping one of you which one would that be come here bitch isana faced him evenly and did not move kords face flushed red and dangerous i said come here she cant hear you kord i saw to that did you his eyes moved from isana to the huddling woman behind and beside her odiana flinched even at the glance haunted eyes widening no isana said though she knew the words were useless dont look but odiana glanced up at kord the murderous expression on his face a finger he jabbed at the ground in front of him were apparently enough to activate the discipline collar odiana let out a sudden breathless shriek and fell to the ground clawing at the collar even as she did she struggled against her own convulsing body to crawl closer to kord to obey the command hed given her isana reached down to hold her back but the sudden wave of terror and unbearable anguish that washed up through that touch nearly blinded her and she stumbled back and away kord let out a harsh laugh and took a step forward taking the womans face in his hands thats better he said you be a good girl im going to break your pretty neck and then put that collar on isana hold still odiana whimpered body still twitching and did not struggle against him kord no isana shouted the door suddenly rattled on its frame there was a hesitation and then it rattled again as though someone was trying to get in and hadnt expected to find it bolted kord whirled to face it desperate isana cast the globe of the furylamp in her hand at kord it struck the steadholder in the back of the head the furylamp shattered the spark imp inside it flashing into brilliant light for a moment and then gone the interior of the warehouse sank into darkness and kord began to curse viciously isana swallowed her terror and hurried forward through the darkness there was a horrible frantic moment of feeling in the dark listening for odianas whimpers and kords heavy snarling breathing her fingers found odianas hair first and she dragged the slave woman against her she got the woman to her feet and started dragging her farther back into the warehouse hoping that she moved in the right direction odiana began to whimper and isana clapped one hand firmly over the womans mouth dont do this isana growled kords voice from somewhere in the dark back toward the door youre just drawing things out we both know how this is going to end isana felt a ripple in the ground beneath the wooden floorboards but knew that kords fury would have difficulty locating them through the wood just as it had through the ice she continued to draw odiana deeper back into the warehouse until she bumped against the back wall she felt her way with her hands and though the predawn light was showing through cracks in the wall there still was not enough light to see she pressed the woman down into the dubious shelter between two crates then lifted odianas own hands and pressed them over the womans mouth the slave shook almost violently but managed to nod isana drew her hands away from the woman and turned to face the darkness come on isana kord said his voice more distant the collars not so bad once you put it on you wont have any more doubts you can see the good part of it too ill do that for you isana swallowed revolted and debated her options simplest was to shout for help there were hundreds of people within garrison surely some would hear her surely but at the same time she would be giving her position away to kord she did not know how long it might take help to break down the barred warehouse door but it surely would not take kord long to break her neck though it made her seethe with frustration she could do little but remain silent and try to find a way to escape the warehouse or to deal with kord directly she crouched in the darkness and struggled to think of other options the ground rumbled and shook for perhaps a minute and then there was a sudden round of cheers and blowing horns from outside useless she didnt know what had happened but she would never be heard over that din she had to find out where kord was and either circle out to open the door or attack him herselfand that would be mad even if she could find him he was far stronger than she she could loose rill on him but what if she wasnt fast enough no such a confrontation was a last desperate resort a calculated risk then she took a breath and tried to keep her voice monotone droning to better conceal the direction you think that will make me happy kord his reply came from much nearer to her perhaps down the same row of crates once i get that on you whatever i want makes you happy i suppose a man like you needs something like that she said moving back trying to circle around to another row to slip past him keep talking just going to make it sweeter when i get my hands on you his voice was on the move as well from outside there was a series of shouts a trembling in the ground as of thousands of feet striking it horns blew the signals to engage and isana knew that the garrison was under attack kord spoke again and his voice came from not ten feet away from her in the darkness so close that she could suddenly feel the cloud of rage and lust around him like a hot stinking mist see there bigger fish to fry leaves me all alone with you she didnt dare reply instead keeping her movements as quiet as she could she moved across the row to the far side to press against the crates there if she strained she could hear kord moving slowly down the row of crates within a long arms reach now but even more she could sense him against her the churning muck of his ugly emotions it drew even with her and she held her breath as it crept on past the pressure on her senses slowly changing as though something warm and moist brushed over her left cheek then her mouth then her right cheek as kord crept past but he hesitated there and isana held her own position had he sensed her somehow did he know she was there smell you kord murmured his voice very close smell you smells good makes me hungry isana held her breath he moved sudden and fast the sense of him flashing across her cheek mouth cheek again as he moved back toward the door she lost him after only a second he had moved beyond the range of what her crafting could feel but it came to her suddenly that she had a weapon he did not his fury might be able to lend him tremendous strength but he would not be able to use it to see his power could reach no farther than his own fingers but she could use her own crafting to locate him even in the total darkness if her reach had been longer how could she extend it by provoking him she realized by stoking his emotions to a brighter blaze he would radiate them more strongly make himself more easy to sense dangerous plan indeed but if she could pinpoint where he was she could slip past him to the door and go for help she moved first back to the far end of the rows picking another at random before she started down it and lifted her voice again do you know how we escaped kord kord let out a growling sound now several yards away some damn fool didnt patch the roof right were you too drunk to remember isana taunted gently you sent aric to patch that roof no kord growled wouldnt do that you did you hit his face right there in front of me and made him kords voice answered harsher panting moving closer happens it happens i get mad he understands no he doesnt kord isana said even more quietly he helped us escape he made holes in the roof so that meltwater would run in and give us our crafting back lying bitch kord snarled his fist lashed out against one of the crates and the solid wooden staves of its side broke with a heavy crunch at the same time fighting erupted from very nearby somewhere just outside the warehouse in the courtyard itself he hates you kord did he come with you is he here helping you youve got no sons now kord nothing to come after you bittan is dead and aric despises you shut up howled kord shut up before i break your lying head and the sense of his anger his mad blazing rage abruptly washed through the warehouse isana pleaded silently with rill to leave her even more open than usual to the emotions she felt him exactly where that rage was ten feet away on the next row of crates and pacing swiftly toward her isana moved silently trying to get past him and back to the door but as she came even with him one row over his steps stopped and he started reversing them toward the door oh no he growled no thats a trick make me mad and make me come chase you then you run while i find that slave bitch and break her bitch neck and you get away no no you arent smarter than me isana paced him silently frustrated unsure of how near she had to be to make him remain within the circle of her senses she kept the row of crates between them until they came to the end kord stopped and she felt the surge of hope and lust in him as well as he inhaled through his nose smell you isana smell your sweat youre scared she heard his knuckles crack he stood opposite her standing while she crouched she reached out her hand and felt the stack of crates that was between them one two three four high at least smell you kord purred youre close where are you isana made up her mind in a flash she turned to the top crate leaned against it and pushed with all her strength it felt like it took forever for the crate to tilt and then to fall carrying the two beneath with it but it could only have been a second the crates fell kord let out a short sharp cry and there was a shockingly loud crushing crunching sound of impact isana scrambled back to the door of the warehouse fumbling in the dark she found the bolt and threw it back then opened the door letting in pale morning light though the warehouse remained in the shadow of the walls she turned and looked back inside kord lay on his belly on the ground the wooden crates over him one of them had struck him between the shoulder blades and still lay half on him unbroken the other had to have clipped his head because there was blood on his face it lay over to one side the last had landed on his lower back buttocks and thighs it had broken open revealing the cracked and broken forms of heavy slate tiles used on the roofs of the buildings in the garrison isana drew in a breath the tiles were each made of a heavy fired ceramic and each of the crates had to have weighed close to three hundred pounds she watched as kord tried to move straining he snarled and muttered something and the earth beneath him stirred weakly he tried again but could not get out from under the crates he subsided to the floor again panting whimpering beneath his breath isana walked over to him and stood looking down at him she knelt and touched a fingertip to his temple willing rill to impress his condition upon her your legs are broken she said tonelessly so is your hip so is your back she felt a moment more and youre exhausted you must have been drawing on your fury to pursue us she drew her hand away you arent going anywhere kord bitch he snarled the sound weak finish it get it over with were you in my place you would break my head open she picked up one of the heavy tiles and ran a finger over its squared edge held up lengthwise and driven down it could indeed break a skull maybe with one of these crush my skull and kill me i had you beat he growled when i die im going to be thinking of it you in that circle scared out of your head you just remember that she stood up and dropped the slate then she walked down one of the rows what are you doing he growled when i get out of here isana went to odiana and took the womans hand she lifted the woman to her feet then covered her eyes with her hands odiana nodded weakly and hid her eyes in her own hands isana led her out stepping wide around kord who struggled to grab at her ankles and failed you arent getting out of here isana said i only know of one person offhand who could treat your injuries in time to heal you kord she isnt inclined isana stopped and looked down at him then stooped down he clutched at her ankle and she kicked his hand away with a contemptuous stop that she grabbed his steadholder chain and tore it off over his head then hit him with it hard across the mouth kord stared up at her the pain stunning him robbing him of speech she spoke to him in a detached clinical tone you dont feel your injuries kord but youll never walk again youll have to have someone clean you like an infant im not sure youll be able to sit up without help she turned and began to walk toward the entrance leading odiana with her but you will be able to face trial like that helpless stinking of your own waste youll go to trial before the count and everyone in the valley will see what you are ill see to that and then theyll kill you for what youve done outside deeper louder horns began to blare almost drowning out kords sudden vicious pathetic sobs isana you stupid bitch you cant do this you cant do this she swung shut the door behind them and said i cant hear you kord then the battle swept over her desperation and agony and wild exultation all blended together she struggled to merely remain standing and odiana clung to her helped her to keep her balance the two watercrafters could barely manage to hobble from the warehouse to the quiet spot between one of the barracks isanas newly opened senses that had served her so well in the darkness now incapacitated her and she sank to the ground to her knees curling her arms up over her head while she tried to tune down some of the emotions that pounded in her dimly she felt the ground shake again heard the bellowing of some enormous beast an equally enormous voice roaring a challenge by the time she lifted her head odiana was gone isana looked up to see one dirty foot vanishing up onto the roof of the barracks building she shook her head still dazed and moved until she could see the wild chaos of the courtyard and the gargant with its ferocious rider as it turned to flatten a marat warrior beneath its feet in a sudden rush of fierce anger and swiftly fading pain oh no she whispered her eyes opening wider lifting up to the gargants rider again and his passengers oh child what have you gotten yourself into my tavi chapter tavi swallowed his hands tightening on dorogas belt the gargant beneath them stirred restlessly but other than that the courtyard was nearly silent bodies lay everywhere tavi tried not to look at them but it seemed that everywhere he moved his eyes someone had died it was horrible the bodies didnt look like people should they looked misshapen and wrong as though some careless child had been playing with his wooden soldiers and idly thrown them away after breaking them there was blood and that made his belly shake but more than that there was a horrible sadness in seeing the torn and broken forms marat and aleran man and beast alike it seemed such a waste the courtyard had grown almost quiet in the gate and spread in a loose halfcircle around it were atsurak and his marat loosely grouped around the stables were the aleran defenders among them amara and his uncle atsurak stared at doroga and the big marats eyes were flat with cool hatred doroga faced atsurak steadily well murderer doroga demanded will you face me in the trial of blood or will you turn and lead your clan back to your lands atsurak lifted his chin once come die then dorogas teeth showed in a fierce smile he turned back to tavi behind him and rumbled get down young warrior be sure you tell your people what i said tavi looked up at doroga and nodded i cant believe youre doing this doroga blinked at him i said that i would help you protect your family he shrugged a horde stands in the way i did what is necessary to finish what i began climb down tavi nodded and doroga shook out the saddle cord fade swung down from the gargants broad back first and all but hovered beneath tavi as the boy came down doroga barely used the strap but landed lightly on the courtyard and stretched tendons creaking he spun the longhandled cudgel in his fingers and stepped toward atsurak tavi led fade around dorogas gargant stepping wide around its front legs and the wet splatter on the stones there tavis belly heaved about restlessly and he swallowed hurrying across the stones to his uncle tavi bernard said and enfolded the boy in a ribcreaking embrace furies but i feared for you and fade good man youre all right fade hooted in the affirmative there was the sound of running footsteps light on the stones and tavi felt his aunt isana unmistakably his aunt even if he did not see her wrap her arms around him and hug him tight to her tavi she said oh tavi youre all right tavi pressed up against his aunt and uncle for a moment and felt the tears in his eyes he leaned against them and hugged them back im all right he heard himself saying its all right im all right isana laughed and kissed his hair his cheek fade she said thank the furies youre all right after a moment amara said bernard theyre not looking if we rush the hordemaster now we can get to the knife no tavi said hurriedly he freed himself from the embrace looking at the cursor no you cant doroga explained this to me its a duel you have to let him have it amara looked at him sharply what duel what knife amara frowned the knife proves one of the high lords is behind this attack we can catch him if we recover it and keep him from doing something like this again what duel tavi tried to explain doroga and atsurak are both headman of their clans theyre equals atsurak cant order another clan to follow him as long as their headman stands up to him in a trial of blooda duel but no one had the courage to stand up to him before now doroga has challenged atsuraks decision to attack us before all of the rest of the marat if he defeats him in the trial then it breaks atsuraks power and the marat leave just like that amara demanded well yes tavi said defensively if doroga wins it means that the marat will understand that the one supports him and not atsurak the one what the one tavi said i think they think its some kind of fury that lives in the sun when they have a big decision they have a trial before the one they believe in it completely he felt his aunts hand on his shoulder and he turned to find her looking down at him earnestly her head tilted to one side what happened to you a lot auntie she smiled though there was a weary edge to it it shows are you sure you know what youre saying yes maam tavi said i know isana looked at bernard who looked at amara the cursor drew in a slow breath her eyes in turn moving to tavi tavi she said keeping her voice quiet why did doroga choose now to challenge this atsurak tavi swallowed um well its kind of a long story im not really sure i understand everything that happened myself doesnt really matter does it if hes here outside there were highpitched whistles sounding and the frantic howls of the marat and their beasts had subsided to a low rumble giraldi amara called up to the battlements whats happening crows take me called a panting voice back from the walls above the gates the marat were fighting one another then they all started blowing whistles and falling back from the fighting theyre drawing into tribes it looks like thank you centurion countess orders hold the walls amara responded but her eyes went back to tavi do not attack unless first attacked tavi nodded to amara this is what doroga told me would happen the marat tribes fight all the time theyre used to it the whistles are to call a halt to fighting and let the headmen talk bernard blew out a breath and looked at amara what do you think the cursor reached a hand up and pushed a few loose strands of hair back from her eyes staring at tavi i think your nephew here has managed to learn more about the marat than the crowns intelligence service steadholder tavi nodded they uh eat their enemies and anyone who shows up without permission is considered to be one he coughed it probably makes it sort of difficult to learn about them amara shook her head if we get out of this i want to know how you managed to not get eaten and wind up leading a marat horde of your own to save this valley fade let out a low apprehensive hoot of warning tavi looked at the slave and found him staring intently at the walls in the ragged hole in the fortresss walls shapes stirred several riders on horseback tall horse clan marat rode in tavi recognized hashat at once her pale mane flowing though fresh blood spattered her hair upper body and saber arm tavi identified her to amara and his uncle headman bernard demanded something in his tone offended shes a woman and shes not wearing a shirt amara let out a low whistle those eagles on her belt are from royal guardsman if theyre genuine she must have been part of the horde that killed princeps septimus shes nice enough tavi said she wont confront atsurak herself but shell follow dorogas lead i think theyre friends at the gate the marat stirred and parted to let the wolf headman in with a pair of rangy direwolves beside him a long clean cut marred the pale skin of his chest clotted with dark red the man looked around the courtyard and bared his teeth showing the long canines of his clan skagara tavi supplied wolf clan headman hes a bully hashat dismounted and stalked over to stand beside skagara she faced him the whole way with a dangerous little smile on her mouth skagara took a step back from her when she reached him hashats teeth showed and she made a point of examining the cut on his chest then she turned to face atsurak and doroga folding her arms one bloodied hand remaining near her saber skagara gave her a sullen scowl then did the same doroga leaned on his cudgel staring at the ground atsurak stood patiently spear loosely gripped in one hand silence and mounting tension reigned for several moments only the crows made any noise a low and steady cawing in the background outside the walls what are they waiting for amara asked tavi the sun tavi said doroga said they always wait for the sun to rise on the results of a trial he glanced up at the walls the angle of the shadows there i guess they dont think the fight will take very long the morning light swept across the courtyard as the sun rose higher the line of shadow described by the stillintact walls swept from west to east toward the two marat headmen doroga looked up after a time to the sunlight where it had barely come to rest on the head of his staff he nodded lowered the weapon with a grunt and advanced on atsurak the herdbane headman whirled his spear in a loose circle shrugged his shoulders and stalked toward doroga on catlight feet he moved swiftly his spears tip blurring as he thrust it at the other marat but doroga parried the blow to one side with the thick shaft of the cudgel then swept it in a short thrust at atsuraks head atsurak avoided the blow and whipped the spears tip toward dorogas leg the gargant headman dodged but not quickly enough and a line of bright scarlet appeared on his thigh the marat in the courtyard let out a low murmur someone among the herdbane said something in a grinding tongue and the warriors let out a rough laugh a low chatter began between the herdbane and wolf present are they betting on the fight amara asked incredulous tavi nodded yeah they do that doroga won his daughter betting on me what shhhh doroga drew back from the exchange with a grimace and glanced down at his leg he tried to put his weight on it but faltered and he had to swing the staff of the cudgel down to help support him atsurak smiled at that and spun his spear around again he began a slow deliberate stalk toward doroga circling the gargant headman forcing him to turn to face his enemy putting pressure on his wounded leg dorogas face twisted with a grimace of pain tavi amara breathed what happens if doroga loses tavi swallowed his heart pounding then the one has said that doroga was wrong and the rest of the clans follow atsurak like they would have before oh amara breathed can he do it five silver bulls on doroga tavi responded youre on atsurak rushed doroga abruptly the gargant headman whipped up his weapon and parried the spear aside but his return stroke was clumsy and drew him off balance atsurak dodged and immediately leapt in again once more doroga barely deflected the incoming stroke and this time it cost him his balance he fell to the stones of the courtyard atsurak pressed in for the kill but doroga swung the longhandled cudgel at the hordemasters feet forcing him to skip back to avoid it atsurak scowled and spat some harshsounding word then lifted the spear circled and darted in at doroga with deadly purpose the gargant headman had been waiting for atsuraks charge with an easy grace he swept the spear aside with one hand jabbing the tip into the stone then gripped the shaft in one huge fist he drove it back toward atsurak with almost casual power the spears butt striking the hordemaster in the belly and stopping him in his tracks doroga jerked the spear from his opponents grasp atsurak backed warily away sucking for his breath doroga stood up with a casual grace then he lifted his wounded leg and snapped the haft of the aleran spear tossing its bits to one side he tricked him tavi said gleefully hush amara said hes got him now bernard said doroga tossed the huge cudgel to one side it landed on the stones with a dull thump i remember the fox he said his voice very quiet then he spread his hands wide and with that same flat hardeyed smile he came toward the smaller marat atsurak paled but spread his own hands circling doroga he moved abruptly a darting motion reminiscent of one of the predator birds leaping and kicking high on dorogas chest doroga took the kick full on though it stopped him in his tracks and rocked him back a step but his hands flashed up to atsuraks ankle and caught his foot before the other could draw it away atsurak began to fall and dorogas shoulders knotted his hands twisting something in atsuraks leg broke with an ugly pop the hordemaster gasped and fell but kicked with his good leg at dorogas ankle the gargant chiefs foot went out from under him and he fell grappling with his foe tavi watched but could see that atsurak was at a disadvantage too serious to overcome overwhelmed by sheer physical power too hurt to get away it would only be a matter of time dorogas hands lifted and locked around the hordemasters throat atsurak locked his hands onto dorogas but tavi could see that it would be a hopeless effort tavi stared unable to look awaybut something drew his attention a faint motion in the background he glanced up and saw the marat all focused on the contest stepping closer eyes bright hashat was all but panting her eyes open too wide as she watched dorogas struggle beside hashat though tavi saw that skagara the wolf headman had taken a step back behind her vision he reached a hand back behind him and tavi saw one of the wolf warriors touch a stonetipped arrow into a small clay jar then pass it to skagara together with one of the short marat bows moving quickly the wolf headman drew the poisoned arrow and lifted the bow doroga tavi shouted look out dorogas head snapped up at tavi and then over at skagara doroga rolled and wrenched atsuraks form between himself and the wouldbe assassin tavi saw atsurak draw the aleran dagger with its gold hilt from his belt and slash wildly at dorogas hand the gargant headman cried out and fell back and atsurak rolled free of his grip kill them shouted the hordemaster his eyes blazing kill them as we did the fox kill them all doroga roared and rose to his feet charging toward atsurak without a breath of hesitation skagara loosed the poisoned arrow tavi saw it flicker across the brief distance between them and vanish into dorogas arm with a meaty crack the gargant headman went down hashat spun her saber flashing in the sun as she drew it and cut through skagaras bow and the wolf headmans throat in the same slash sending him to the ground in a sudden wash of blood the courtyard erupted into chaos the great herdbane birds near atsurak screamed as he turned to them and flicked a hand at doroga they charged the fallen gargant headman at the same time dorogas gargant bellowed and rolled forward to his defense outside the walls what had been hushed silence erupted once more into tumult and cacophony hashats clan charged forward toward the fallen doroga and atsuraks warriors did the same fade let out a wail and clutched hard at tavis shirt the knife he heard amara yell get the dagger the cursor started forward only to be stopped by the sudden press of marat warriors spears glittering with the same dark deadliness as the eyes of the herdbanes beside them the aleran troops fell into lines even as bernard grabbed at his sisters arm and amaras and dragged them both back behind the shields of the troops fade let out a screech of fear and turned to follow bernard mindlessly dragging tavi along fade tavi protested the knife screamed amara without the dagger its all for nothing tavi didnt stop to think he just dropped his weight lifting his arms up and slipping out of the toobig tunic he rolled to his feet looked around the courtyard wildly and then ran toward the downed atsurak the hordemasters warriors now either engaged the alerans or faced dorogas furious gargant and were far too occupied to notice the fleeting form of one rather small boy atsurak watched the melee around dorogas gargant the great beast had rumbled forward and crouched over dorogas fallen form swinging its huge head clawing kicking and bellowing at anyone who came close tavi licked his lips and saw dorogas fallen cudgel he picked it up though it was a strain prepared to give it one good swing at atsuraks head grab the knife and run back to his uncle instead there was a sudden rush of wind that threw up hay what was hay doing all over the courtyard and dust and blinded him all but throwing him down tavi shielded his eyes looking up to see several men in black tunics and armor wielding weapons of steel hovering over the courtyard one of them had his hand extended toward atsurak and must have been controlling the winds that buffeted the courtyard another knight aeris swept down and dropped the same innocuouslooking balding man tavi had seen before onto the stones of the courtyard the man stepped forward to the blinded atsurak and with a casual jerk on the mans hair and a short knife cut the hordemasters throat the hordemaster jerked and twisted wildly and the dagger flew from his hand skittering over the stones of the courtyard and landing in a clump of hay not far from tavi the dagger barked the man with the bloodied knife get the dagger tavi stared at the man standing over atsuraks jerking twitching form he had no doubt that this man would kill him just as quickly but he also knew that the man was not loyal to the crown that he had been pursuing amara and tavi and that he had tried to hurt his aunt and uncle two days ago tavi thought he might have let the man recover the dagger he might have turned and run he might have found someplace to hide until all of this was over two days ago tavi breathed i had a lot more sense then he darted forward seized the dagger where it lay and began to run there tavi heard the man yell hes got the dagger kill that boy chapter tavi ran for his life the courtyard was a mass of confusion and motion but he knew the one direction he had to go away from the man who had killed atsurak tavi spun dashed around a pair of struggling marat warriors and fled toward the other side of the fort he heard a roar of wind above him and then a sudden burst of it sent him tumbling along the ground tavi yelped and tried to make sure that he didnt stab himself to death with the knife in his hand rolling and bumping along the stones of the courtyard when he came to a stop he looked up to see a knight aeris in full armor diving toward him the spear in his hand held extended tavi clawed at his pockets even as the knight came on tavi hurled a handful of rock salt he had taken from bernardholts smokehouse at the oncoming knight and then dove frantically to one side the knight let out a sudden shout clawing at the airbut he dropped to the ground moving too fast skipped along for a pair of desperate steps and began to tumble end over end on the unforgiving stones tavi heard one of his limbs hit with a sharp crack of impact and the knight shrieked tavi regained his feet looking around him wildly more knights aeris had risen above the courtyard looking for him on the other side of a struggling knot of legionares the huge swordsman tavi had seen in the stable at bernardholt spotted him and came toward him sword lifting to clean any opposition out of his way the man who had killed atsurak was nowhere to be seen tavi ran away from the swordsman and down the length of the stables toward the center of the fort and the far gate surely there would be someone there who wasnt already hipsdeep in marat by now or a safe building that he could hide in tavi reached the end of the stables at the same time a bulky figure dressed in a halfbuckled breastplate and a helmet that hung down over his eyes plunged out of the doors of the stables shouting im coming im coming tavi slammed into the young man and both went to the ground the mans shield tumbled away wildly though he managed to keep a grip on the wellworn handle of a spade the man pushed his helmet back then gripped the spade in both hands raising it tavi shielded his head with his arms frederic he shouted fred its me frederic lowered the spade and stared tavi youre alive not for long he panted struggling to his feet theyre trying to kill me fred frederic blinked his helmet fell over his eyes tavi reached up to push it away and saw the next knight aeris swooping down at him as he did he reached into his pocket for more salt but in his haste he had turned the pocket inside out when he had drawn out salt before it had all fallen out as he ran tavi fred said the steadholder says im not to take that helmet off look out tavi said and bulled into his friend overbalancing the larger boy and taking him down the knight flashed past his sword reaching down and tavi felt a sudden hot sting on one arm frederic blinked at tavi and at the knight flying on past circling around again tavi he said stunned looking at the boys arm he cut you fred looked up at tavi eyes widening theyre trying to kill you i cant tell you how glad i am that youre here to tell me that tavi said wincing at the sudden flash of pain blood had stained his shirt but he could move his arm it isnt bad help me up frederic did his face showing his fear and confusion who are they i dont know tavi said but hes coming again tavi turned to duck into the buildingonly to see at the far end of the stables the unmistakable outline of the swordsman against the doors on the far side blade in hand cant get out that way tavi breathed he looked back around behind him the knight aeris had been joined by one of his companions and they had lined up for another charge fred we need thumper what but thumper doesnt know how to fight salt fred we need salt to throw at those windcrafters a lot of it but hurry fred the knights aeris hurtled toward them in a screaming torrent of wind tavi gripped at his knife and looked around wildly but there was no place to run frederic stepped forward in front of tavi his spade gripped in both hands he let out a yell that grew into a deepthroated roar and drew back the spade when he brought it around again it came straight over his head and down in a great swooshing arc that met the leading knight just before his sword could reach tavis friend the blow crumpled the knight as though he had been made of straw slapped him out of the air and to the ground in a single short violent motion tavi had no doubt at all that frederic had crushed the life from him frederic lifted his spade and swung wildly at the next knight as the man swerved to avoid him frederic missed but even as he swung tavi saw the light glittering on something shining on the blade of the spade hard white lumpscrystals of salt the salt swept through the knight aeriss windstream and the man let out a yelp tumbling to the ground and rolling with bonebreaking violence into the wall of one of the barracks fred stared at the two men his eyes wide panting he turned to tavi and stammered i already had my spade salted after i hit that first one when i was working on that boulder he blinked at the spade and then at tavi are you all right tavi swallowed and looked back over his shoulder at the interior of the stable inside someone had leapt out of the shadows at the swordsman there was a confused blur of outlines a short cryand then the swordsman continued toward them frederic swallowed gripping his spade tavi what do we do give me a minute tavi stammered im thinking without warning a marat warrior hurled himself at tavi plowing into his side and lifting him carrying him to slam painfully against the wall of the stable tavi let out a croaking shout and swung his knife weakly at the marat warrior a bloodsmeared member of clan wolf but the knife glanced off barely breaking the marats skin the warrior tore at tavi with his fangs drawing back just enough to slam him against the wall once and then again driving the breath from his lungs and stars into his vision fred loomed up behind the warrior shoved one brawny arm beneath his chin and wrenched the marat back from tavi hauling the marat off of his feet and eliciting a strangled scream of protest tavi fred shouted run tavi landed on the ground woozily and pushed himself to his hands and knees he looked up to see the swordsman still coming for him and turned the goldhandled dagger still clutched in his fist and started moving again staggering off into the wild melee of the courtyard tavi ducked the butt of a legionares spear slipped on a dark wetness he did not take the time to look at and scrambled forward a bloodied holder tavi recognized from rothholt turned toward him and lifted his sword but recognized tavi before striking and yelled something at him through the tumult and din wind roared over the courtyard once more and tavi looked back to see another knight aeris hovering eyes searching over the courtyard his gaze swept to tavi and stopped the mans eyes widened and he dived down toward him somewhere close tavi heard the scream of a horse and tavi turned toward it his eyes widening he slipped past a stout old holder hauling a wounded legionare back out of the main knot of combat in the courtyards center to find a knot of horses riders wielding spear and blade and forcing their way across the courtyard hashat tavi shouted the marats head whipped around white mane flying and she flashed tavi a fierce smile aleran she called her voice merry her eyes snapped into place above him and she hissed tightening her legs on the back of her horse the beast plunged forward all but bowling tavi over then reared tavi looked up in time to see the knight aeris that had been coming for him slash at hashat and miss only to have the marats saber whip across his face the man shouted clawing at his eyes but he managed to thrust himself up higher into the air bobbing drunkenly away from the courtyard one of the other warriors spun with one of the heavily curved marat short bows in his hands and loosed an arrow that felled the knight from the sky bah hashat shouted at the archer the man only grinned at her drawing another arrow she lifted the bloodied saber to her teeth and extended a hand to tavi up aleran tavi took her hand and was startled by the slender womans strength she hauled tavi up to the light cushion of a saddle the marat used wrapped one of his arms around her waist and shouted to the warriors near her in a tongue he could not understand together the horses turned and plunged toward the outer wall forcing their way through the crowd of screaming beasts and men what is happening tavi shouted your people have been forced back onto their wall hashat shouted she shrugged and tavi saw a number of loops of black cloth over her shoulder the dark sashes worn by the enemy knights wolf and herdbane were closest to the walls our people are fighting their way here through them but it might take time we are helping your people get onto the wall or to fall back to the other courtyard as tavi watched the butt end of a spear scythed through the air and took one of the mounted warriors of the horse clan from his saddle dropping him into a knot of herdbane warriors one of them plunged a glass knife into his throat and then as blood fountained from him grasped his pale mane and cut it from his head together with the scalp hashat seeing this let out a piercing scream of pure rage her horse rearing and plunging its hooves at the chest of the fallen herdbane warrior the man dropped screaming one side of his chest warped oddly one of the other marat raised his spear but hashat lifted a hand spitting a command the spearman nodded and whipped the spear down at the marat its tip leaving a long cut over the marats ribs he slashed again into an x and then the horses surged on what was that tavi asked he took ishavas scalp hashat snarled attempted to destroy his strength that is different than killing aleran why didnt you kill him because we will not lose ishavas strength we marked him after the fight aleran we will partake of that herdbane and let ishava rest tavi blinked and stared at hashat the horse headmans dark eyes gleamed with something hard and savage and she only smiled when someone hurled another spear at her and she had to raise up on her stirrups to cut it out of the air with her saber they reached the wall but the press of the combat had forced them to the northwest corner of the courtyard where part of the wall had collapsed when dorogas gargant had come charging through it doroga tavi shouted where is doroga out hashat responded we got him onto his gargant and sent him back to his people she looked around the courtyard and shook her head we cannot remain here long aleran the wolves and herdbane are being forced inside your walls by our people my friend tavi said fred tall boy carrying a spade hes back by the stables you have to help him hashat looked back at tavi expression dark then flashed him a brilliant smile i will help him now aleran stand up hold on to my shoulders hashat rode close to the crumbled section of the wall and looked up into the sun to see figures moving up there one of them dropped a rope down tavi stood up his arm throbbing where he had been cut his feet on the marat saddle his hand on hashats slender strong shoulders he shoved the goldhandled dagger through his belt and grabbed on to the rope hashat glanced up at him then kicked her horse into motion leaving him swinging in the air as whoever was up above began pulling the rope up fade tavi exclaimed fade let out a happy hoot and hauled tavi up onto the broken section of the wall the slaves scarred face twisted into a grotesque smile as he grasped tavis shoulders and then hurried him up onto the battlements away from the edge of the broken walls at the top several legionares crouched upon the battlements panting and exhausted none were unwounded they crouched with their backs against the crenellation their shields held between them and the courtyard below bernard crouched there too but rose to come to tavi and clutched at his arm fiercely tavi uncle wheres aunt isana bernard shook his head his face pale we got separated he took the boys shoulders and guided him up against the crenellation pressing him to crouch against the stone and kneeling with his own body between tavi and the courtyard tavi looked out at the battlefield outside the fortress awed he had never seen so many people much less so many people struggling to kill one another the battlefield outside was as confusing a jumble as the one in the courtyard but on a far grander scale gargants screamed and bellowed in the distance plowing a slow but steady path toward the walls while wheeling groups of mounted horse clan dashed and feinted everywhere engaging packs of wolf warriors or disorganized bands of herdbane with their uncontrollable warbirds great furies tavi breathed get your head down bernard rumbled he picked up a heavy legion shield and held it across his body facing the courtyard someone still stops to shoot an arrow once in a while what about aunt isana bernard grunted as something struck the metal shield with a hollow heavy thump were doing all we can boy stay down fade let out an alarmed cry from behind his shield and tavi looked back in time to see someone make a running leap from the other side of the gap in the wall amara landed on the battlements beside fade with a rush of wind and a grunt of effort and wormed her way behind fades shield at once panting tavi she said her eyes widening i never thought youd make it out of that i had help do you have it yes tavi said he turned the knifes handle toward her and passed it over amara took the dagger paling and shook her head i have to get this to the first lord bernard grimaced whats giraldi have to say were cut off amara said she wiped sweat from her brow and tavi saw that her hand was shaking horse and gargant are pushing the other marat into garrison they hold the west courtyard except for the wall east courtyard has pulled all its people back into buildings for defense giraldi thinks that dorogas people will drive a wedge between herdbane and wolf within the hour and theyll have to quit the field bernard blew out a breath an hour something else slammed against his shield shoving his shoulder into tavis we arent going to last that long my sister shes in one of the barracks in the east courtyard with gram giraldi said that he saw her go in with him good bernard rumbled good down the wall one of the legionares cried out tavi looked up and saw an arrow protruding from the mans upper shoulder it didnt look like a lifethreatening wound but within a few seconds the mans head rolled on his neck and he fell quietly to his side bernard grabbed tavis arm and crab walked down the battlements behind his shield keeping it over both of them he checked the mans throat and grimaced must have hit the artery hes gone then he frowned and leaned closer this isnt a marat arrow the next legionare on the wall abruptly jerked his head snapped back where a few scant inches of his helmet showed over his shield he blinked a few times and then blood ran down between his eyes and over one temple his eyes unfocused and then he toppled to his side as well the arrow piercing his helmet amara dragged fade down the wall and flicked a glance around his shield its him she hissed the third man crouched behind his shield tucking everything in closetoo close the next arrow slammed into the shield itself pierced it and went on into the mans chest at his ribs he let out a wheezing cry blood suddenly a froth on his mouth tavi stared in horror at the legionares dying on the wall beside him it had happened so fast it hadnt taken half a minute for the unseen archer to kill three men we have to get out of here the last of the legionares stammered he started to rise we cant stay here stay down you fool bernard shouted but the legionare turned to run down the wall toward the rope that lay coiled by the gap as soon as he rose he cried out and tavi saw a thick black arrow impaling the mans leg he fell to the ground with a shout landing on top of his shield the next arrow struck square against his ear the man folded quietly down as though going to sleep and didnt move again damn you fidelias amara shouted her voice raw tavi looked up and down the wall behind him the battlements abruptly ended at the gap doroga had crushed into the wall before him the battlements ran steadily along until they reached a wall of solid rock the builders of garrison had used the old granite bones of the hills on either side of the fortress to serve as its north and south walls and they were little more than a sharply sloped face of rock can we climb that can we get out that way with all those knights aeris amara shook her head we wouldnt stand a chance the courtyard itself tavi could hear seethed with the cries of marat and their beasts the occasional scream of a horse the snarling of wolves the whistling shrieks of herdbane even if they did climb down the rope they would only be falling from the frying pan and into the fire were trapped tavi breathed another arrow slammed into bernards shield its steel tip bursting through the metal lining and wood of the shield sharp point emerging for the width of several fingers and barely falling short of his temple bernard went white but his expression didnt change and he covered himself and tavi with the shield resolutely wind howled at the gap in the wall and tavi looked back to see the man who had ordered the knights aeris earlier being dropped off on the battlements by one of the airborne knights a moment later the huge swordsman landed next to him amara drew in a breath her face pale get away from here fidelias the innocuouslooking man regarded those crouching on the walls with a flat neutral gaze give me the dagger it isnt yours give me the dagger amara for an answer amara rose and drew the sword from her side she took the dagger from her belt and tossed it onto the stones behind her come take it if you can im surprised you didnt kill everyone while you had the chance i ran out of arrows the man said aldrick kill them the swordsman drew his blade and began walking down the wall amara licked her lips and held her guardsmans blade low parallel to her thigh tavi could see her hand trembling beside him he heard his uncle growl bernard jerked at the straps of the shield and loosened it from his arm then he handed the straps to tavi and said hold on to this bernard rose taking up the doublebitted axe and moved down the wall to stand beside amara tavi swallowed staring aldrick paused several feet away abruptly becoming absolutely still bernard shrugged one of his shoulders and then let out a shout and rolled forward axe sweeping across his body in a vicious arc at the swordsmans head aldrick ducked beneath the blow and the axe bit into the stones of one of the merlons shattering it into flying bits of rock and powder bernard spun using the momentum and brought the axe sweeping down in a blow meant to split the swordsmans body in two aldrick waited until the very last second to move and then hardly seemed to move at all he twisted his hips to one side drawing the line of his body away from the descending axe so that it whipped past his chest by the breadth of a hair as he did his sword rose the tip plunged into bernards flank just above the belt of his trousers bernard stiffened his eyes widening he let out a short harsh groan and his fingers loosened from the handle of the axe it fell to the battlements with a thump tavi stared in horror aldrick twisted the blade as he tore it back out of bernards flank then casually let him fall from the battlements toward the chaos of the courtyard below uncle tavi screamed amara reached out a hand toward him as he fell bernard fade let out a shriek dropping his shield and ran back to tavi clutching to the boy and gibbering incoherently aldrick flicked his weapon to one side and droplets of blood of his uncles blood splattered against the stones of the battlements amaras face set into a sudden mask of cold disdain crows take you fidelias she said in a cool quiet voice crows take you all tavi didnt see her strike so much as he saw a blur of color the same shade as the cloak the cursor wore she moved toward the swordsman with her guardsmans blade and the sword made the air whistle as it darted at aldrick the swordsman took a pair of quick steps back no surprise on his face no emotion he lifted his blade and caught amaras blow on it three more blows followed so fast that they chimed in what almost seemed a single tone but the swordsman stopped them all despite amaras sheer speed his blade close to his body his movements very short quick tavi crawled forward tears blurring his eyes lugging the huge shield and the sobbing fade with him he recovered the dropped dagger and shoved it through his belt again watching the battle helpless and terrified amara whirled and crouched and whirled again her blade whipping at aldricks throat knees and throat again the swordsman blocked each strike and then with a sudden hard smile his blade lashed out amara hissed and the sword tumbled from her hands falling to the stones near tavi aldrick whipped his blade in a horizontal line and amara let out a harsh cry staggering against the battlements her hair fallen around her face tavi could see blood on the mail around her belly amara turned toward aldrick unsteady on her feet and swung her arm at him in a strike the swordsman slapped her hand aside and his foot lashed out at her knee amara gasped and fell to the stone she struggled to rise again aldrick shook his head as though disgusted and slammed one heavy boot down onto amaras splinted arm she let out a cry and jerked she looked up at tavi her eyes not focused her face bedsheetwhite aldrick did not pause he drew back his blade crouching and with two hands swung it toward the paralyzed cursor tavi didnt stop to think he seized the fallen sword in his left hand and lunged forward from his knees toward the swordsman the guardsmans blade flicked out and found the gap between the swordsmans mail and the tops of his boots drawing an insignificant cut across the skin but it was enough to make aldrick divert the blow aimed for amaras neck to parry tavis clumsy thrust aside aldrick snarled his face suddenly suffused with scarlet anger making an old scar stand out white against his cheek he slammed his weapon against tavis tavi felt the jolt of it in his shoulders and chest and his arm went numb in a tingling wash of sensation from fingertip to elbow the sword flew off somewhere behind him he rolled back and tried to lift the shield to cover himself but the swordsman kicked it aside and it tumbled out of tavis grasp and into the courtyard below stupid boy aldrick said eyes cold give me the dagger tavi clutched his hand on the daggers hilt and started worming his way back along the wall you killed him tavi shouted his voice hoarse you killed my uncle and what happened to my odiana is your fault i should kill you right here aldrick growled give up you cant win go to the crows if i dont beat you someone else will have it your way the swordsman said he whirled the sword in his fingers and closed toward tavi lifting the blade eyes cold if araris valerian himself was here he couldnt beat me and you arent araris the swordsman brought both hands to the hilt of the sword and struck tavi saw the cold bloodied metal of the blade falling toward him and knew that he was about to die he screamed and lifted a hand knowing full well that it would do him no good but he was unable to do anything else the sword came down in the death stroke and met steel in a cold clear chime like a bell a cloud of silver sparks rained down where aldricks blade had met the steel of the guardsmans sword fade stood over tavi both hands on the hilt of the short blade his legs spread out wide knees bent his body relaxed the swordsman bore down on his weapon but fade seemed able to hold it away from tavi with little effort and after a scant pair of heartbeats fade twisted his body aldricks blade slid to one side and he skipped back from a counterstrokebut not fast enough fades sword whipped toward aldricks face and split the white scar there open anew blood flowing aldrick dropped back into a guard position watching fade his eyes wide his reddened face going pale no he said no fade took a step forward and stood between tavi and the other two men on the wall his voice came out quiet low steady stay behind me tavi tavi stared in shock he clutched the dagger and scooted back from the two men you arent aldrick snarled you cant be youre dead fade said you talk too much then he spun forward deftly stepping over amaras unmoving form his sword gliding toward the swordsman aldrick parried in a shower of scarlet sparks slid a thrust to his belly aside and cut at the slaves head fade dropped to a crouch and the blow struck cleanly through two feet of furycrafted battlement stone a chunk of stone the size of a big washtub slid down the wall and fell into the battle outside the fortress fade rose blade dancing and pressed the swordsman back down the battlements his ragged and unkempt hair flying about his head his scarred face set in an expression of cool detachment when his sword struck aldricks scarlet fire rained down and when he caught one of the swordsmans strikes clouds of silverwhite motes flew forth in a flash tavi saw aldrick begin to panic his movements becoming jerkier faster less elegant he retreated step by step and fade pressed him relentlessly the slave swept one blow at aldrick that missed altogether throwing up another shower of sparks as the blade cut through the stone near aldricks feet but the slave seemed to recover rapidly and he began to push aldrick down the wall once again tavi had never seen anything so graceful so terrifying as the two men clashing together though aldrick was the larger of the pair fade seemed more nimble his movements more fluid again and again blocking blows that might have killed him to miss by the barest margin he leapt over one strike ducked under another and thrust at aldricks belly once more the swordsman parried him aside spinning on his feet to reverse positions with fade on the narrow battlements so that he now stood with his back to tavi aldrick rained a pair of heavy blows down on fade who danced aside from one and slid the other off the guardsmans blade fade countered with a volley of cuts and thrusts too swift for tavi to follow and aldrick once again backed down the wall defending himself fades blade whipped at aldricks foot and missed slashing stone aldrick kicked the slave in the face with one heavy boot and fades face snapped to one side he turned the motion into an upward slash but that blow too missed aldrick altogether instead slashing through the massive merlon beside him aldricks sword darted down to fades wrist a swift cut that drew blood and threw the sword from the slaves hands and down into the courtyard below fade cried out and fell to his knees clutching the hand to his chest aldrick stood over fade panting white around the eyes and drew his sword slowly up behind him over he said finally over you lose fade said look where youre standing tavi looked down at aldricks feet at the deep slashes in the battlements where fades sword had cut through the stone aldrick looked down and his face went white the merlon beside him slid to one side along the upwardsweeping line fade had cut in it the stone falling with a ponderous grace to the weakened floor of the battlement it struck and the two slashes fade had made in the stone became a sudden myriad of crumbling cracks aldrick tried to step back but the stone beneath his feet gave way like a rotten board and with a howl aldrick ex gladius and a thousand pounds of stone went crashing down to the courtyard below fade closed his eyes for a moment panting then looked up at tavi the boy stared at him how fade moved one shoulder in a shrug aldrick has always thought in lines so i thought in curves tavi saw a movement behind fade and shouted fade look out the slave whirled but not before fidelias holding the rope they had used to climb to the wall had tossed a loop of it over fades head fidelias jerked on the rope and it tightened then the man planted his feet and hauled fade struggled but he had no leverage the rope hauled him off the battlement fidelias let go of the rope and fade fell out of sight the end of the rope had been tied off to one of the crenellations and the rope tightened with a sudden snapping jerk no tavi breathed fidelias turned toward tavi no the boy rose to his feet and threw himself at the man on the wall brandishing the dagger he leapt at fidelias knife extended fidelias caught tavi by his shirt and without any effort spun him around and threw him to the stones of the battlement tavi felt the rock hit his back with an impact that stole his breath and turned the steady hot sting of his wounded arm into a raging fire he let out a weak sound of pain and tried to struggle away from fidelias but within a few inches he felt the crumbling edge of the shattered battlement behind him he looked back and down on a drop into the hard jagged rubble of the fallen section of wall where marat and beasts fought in savage efficiency killing he turned back to fidelias clutching the dagger give me the knife fidelias said his voice quiet his eyes dead give me the knife or ill kill you no tavi wheezed you dont have to die boy tavi swallowed he squirmed out as far as he could on the broken battlements and heard the stones begin to crackle and groan beneath him stay away from me fideliass face twisted in anger and he jerked his hand in a sudden gesture the stone rippled as if it had been a sheet snapped by a holdwife and threw tavi a few feet toward fidelias stunning the boy fidelias reached for the knife tavi swept it at him in a desperate cut fidelias clutched the boys throat and tavi felt his breath cut off with a sudden jerk just as well fidelias said no witnesses tavis vision began to dim he felt his grip on the dagger begin to loosen fidelias shook his head and the pressure on tavis throat began to increase you should have given me the knife tavi struggled uselessly until his arms and legs seemed to forget how to move he stared up into fideliass hard eyes and felt his body going limp and so it was that he saw amara weakly stir and lift her head he saw her writhe lifting one knee beneath her and reaching back to draw a short small knife from her boot she clenched her jaw and shoved her broken arm beneath her her forearm across the floor lifting her body then in one motion she drew back the knife and flicked it at fideliass back a sudden jet of wind propelled the knife toward him tavi saw the man jerk suddenly startled surprise on his features he stiffened fingers loosening from tavis throat and reached a hand up toward his back his expression twisting with sudden agony you wanted a knife fidelias amara hissed theres the one i took from you fidelias his face blank frightened turned back to tavi and clutched at his hand at the dagger there was a frantic moment of scrambling and fidelias let out a gasping cry of pain tavi felt a hand around his wrist a sudden pressure heard the crack of breaking bones agony roared over him and he saw his hand dangle uselessly fidelias reached for the dagger and grabbed its hilt tavi seized fideliass belt and hauled with all of his strength and weight fidelias overbalanced let out a harsh croak and fell from the battlements to the sharpedged rubble of the gap in the wall tavi turned and looked down saw the man land on the stones with his feet under him tavi thought he heard bones break fidelias fell to the ground and a tide of marat washed over him tavi stared panting exhausted in more pain than he thought could exist in the entire world uncle bernard fade the tears welled up and he couldnt stop them couldnt stop himself from sobbing letting out ugly harsh little sounds he laid his cheek down on the stone and cried he felt amara crawl to him a few moments later the cursor dragged a shield with her she lay down beside tavi and used the shield to cover them both he couldnt stop sobbing he felt her hand pat clumsily at his back its all right tavi its all right she leaned her cheek against his hair shhhh youre going to be all right its over over tavi cried quietly until the darkness swallowed him chapter isana watched the battle on the shattered battlements with her heart in her teeth trapped on the second floor of a barracks building in the east courtyard and helpless to do anything to influence its outcome she saw her brother fall from the walls and through a haze of tears saw the cursor dropped to the battlements as well she screamed when tavi took up the fallen sword and faced the enormous swordsman and again when fade took up the old weapon and fought the man up and down the battlements she watched careless of the occasional buzz of a flying arrow as fade was hanged and thrown off the walls as tavi fought for the dagger and as the traitor cursor fell from sight she watched as tavi collapsed and as the wounded amara dragged her shield over both of themthen went still tavi she heard herself say tavi no oh furies she turned and ran out of the room down the stairs to the first level of the barracks a common room for the soldiers living there heavy iron shutters had been closed over the window but the iron bars that could be fastened shut over the door had been torn away from their hinges only moments before along with the heavy wooden door and now the doorway had been blocked with a pair of heavy tables leaving the upper half of the doorway open frederic stood in the doorway a legion shield strapped onto his left arm his dented spade clutched in his right hand one of the women of garrison stood with him a stout sternlooking matron with bare feet and a bloodied spear gripped in her hands the young gargant herders hair hung around his face damp with sweat and he bore a cut that would leave a long white scar leading from his jawline to his ear but his eyes were determined hard as isana came down the stairs another marat threw himself at the barricade stoneheaded hatchets in either hand the marat swung the first at frederic but the herder lifted his shield and the head of the hatchet shattered upon it the woman standing with him drove her spear viciously into the marats thigh and the warrior dropped his second hatchet in a blow aimed at the spears haft frederic shouted and thrust his spade at the marat the steel blade of the tool gouging roughly into the marats chest frederic jerked the spade back to him and with a roar leaned back and kicked the stunned marat in the belly the warrior went flying away from the furyassisted blow landing in a heap upon the stones of the embattled courtyard isana rushed to the doorway frederic ive seen tavi and bernard theyre hurt and ive got to help them frederic turned to her panting his handsome face speckled with droplets of blood but mistress isana theres marat running around everywhere out there and theyre lying wounded in it i need you to help me carry them out of the fight the woman with the spear nodded to isana go on we can hold the door for a while frederic frowned his expression torn youre sure thank you isana said and clasped the womans arm then she grabbed frederics theyre near the gate on the broken section of wall frederic swallowed and nodded so we just go to the other courtyard right yes frederic settled his grip on his spades handle and nodded all right then isana clutched tightly to frederics shoulder as he leaned forward took a quick look around the courtyard and padded swiftly toward the other side of garrison keeping near to the wall the carnage in the courtyard was like some kind of nightmarish slaughterhouse the marat roamed everywhere attacking buildings fighting with one another and with the aleran defenders a shrill scream cut across the courtyard terror filled in the doorway of the barracks building across the courtyard from them a pair of herdbanes appeared they dragged a wounded legionare out into the courtyard one on either arm and tossed him to the ground between them even as isana watched the legionares helmet tumbled off revealing warners bald head and exhausted face beneath warner isana cried warner looked up his face ashen and tried to sweep his sword at the nearest bird but the movement was listless as though he barely had the strength to move the terrible birds began to wrench the steadholder apart shrieking two marat their hair bedecked with dark herdbane feathers watched until warner had been savaged and lay still upon the earth then one of them stepped forward with a knife in hand and after a moments consideration removed the steadholders ears he said something to his companion that drew a rough laugh and then as the birds continued worrying the corpse the pair of them rose and walked into the barracks warner had been defending the cries within garrison were joined by othersthe screams of terrified children someones going to help them frederic breathed right mistress isana someones going to go help arent they isana looked between the far courtyard and the barracks while children screamed she came to her decision in the space of a breath for while tavi might be hurt he at least had a chance of survival if she did nothing those children would have none we are she said lets go frederic swallowed and nodded he shook her hand off of his shoulder and stalked forward sweeping his spade nervously in his hand isana followed him neither of the herdbanes took note of them until frederic swept his spade in a broad arc that ended at the neck of the larger one which broke with a brittle snap the bird went down immediately while the second turned toward frederic and lunged snapping at the gargant herders face frederic shuffled back and the bird followed him inside the barracks the children continued screaming isana waited until the remaining herdbane had stalked another few paces away from the door and then she darted inside mistress isana frederic called wait isana slipped inside the barracks to find the two marat facing a dozen children who hid behind several trunks and bunks knocked over and formed into a crude barricade some of the older children carried legion spears and thrust them viciously at the marat whenever they came close the marat spoke to one another in low voices evidently deciding how best to dig the children out from behind their barricade isana moved silently to the nearest marat reached out and touched his neck calling to rill as she did the marat jerked and let out a hoarse scream that wound down into a gurgle as water frothed from his nose his mouth the second marat spun one hardknuckled fist lashing out as he did isana felt it hit her high on the cheekbone and throw her to the ground she tried to scramble away but the marat caught her by the ankle and dragged her back she kicked at him but the warrior slashed at her leg with his knife a sudden line of screaming fire across her calf she felt him move felt his weight come down atop her and a rough hand tangled in her hair jerking her head back out of the corner of her eye she saw the glitter of a glossy stone dagger diving toward her throat she lifted an arm gasping and blocked the marats forearm with her own halting the blade a scant inch from her throat the marat grunted and bore down and she felt her arm forced to give way under the warriors greater strength isana twisted gasping calling for rill once again hoping that the first marat would remain incapacitated when she called rill from him her fury came flowing into her and isana drew rill in even as she sank the nails of her free hand into the marats forearm blood welled from the tears in the pale skin and isana sent rill flowing through those rents the marat gasped shuddering and the power of his arms began to wane he jerked and twisted and abruptly released both isana and the knife his body bucked and he fell back from isana back arched into a bow clutching at his chest isana shuddered and tried to shield herself from the sudden terror and panic in the marat but she did not release him from rills grip the marat heaved in breaths like a fish out of water but isana knew it would do him no good the fury had stopped the blood in his veins stopped the beating of his heart it was over in a minute isana found herself staring at a dozen frightened wideeyed children over the corpses of the marat warriors she had killed frederic appeared in the doorway panting a moment later the young holder had discarded his shield and instead carried a slender and halfdressed girl wearing a slaves collar and a dancers silks the girls leg had been bloodied and she leaned on frederic her face buried against his shoulder weeping mistress isana frederic gasped youre all right for now isana said she moved to frederics side and helped him draw the girl over to the little barricade frederic you must stay here and protect the children hold this building all right he looked up at her his face concerned but what about you ill manage isana said for a moment the terror and pain and panic of those around her seemed to rise up in a wave that threatened to drown her the corpses of the marat lay on the floor twisted and stiffening their expressions agonized she heard herself letting out a low unsteady laugh ill manage i have to get to him frederic swallowed and nodded yes mistress she fought to take a deep breath to control the emotions coursing through her hold the door frederic keep them safe then she walked out the door of the barracks as quickly as she could and started toward the far courtyard again the battle it seemed was winding down corpses and the wounded lay everywhere she watched as a herdbane marat came pelting around a corner only to be ridden down by a pair of marat on horses spears run through his back as he fled a bloodmaddened direwolf threw itself at one of the horses fangs ripping at one of its hind legs bringing the beast to ground while its rider leapt from its back and spun spear in hand to face the wolf isana pressed on past the command building where a grim grizzled legionare shouted to her to get inside she ignored him and pressed on into the easternmost courtyard here the fighting had been worst and the carnage was greatest not only had the dead been laid out here earlier in the day but now hundreds more bodies lay on the ground mostly marat though here and there the red and gold of a rivan legionares tunic stood out from among the pale barbarian bodies she could have walked to the far side of the courtyard without setting a foot on its stones she began to pick her way across the courtyard twice dodging aside as marat fled past her heading for the broken gates eyes wild and panicked she stayed out of their way and let them pass once several marat riding horses thundered through the corpses hooves crushing indiscriminately riding out the gate here and there the wounded stirred dragged themselves along or waited quietly to die the place was thick with the smell of blood with the septic stink of ruptured bellies and isanas head was swimming by the time she reached the broken section of wall where she had last seen tavi she had to crawl over a mound of rubble to reach the far side steeling herself for what she was afraid she would see her brother dead on the stones fade hanging at the end of a rope strangled or his neck broken tavi above bled to death instead she found bernard laying quietly against the base of the wall his mail shirt had been unbelted and rolled away from where the mercenarys sword had pierced him and the skin there was pink and smooth newly crafted whole she stumbled across the stones to her brothers side reaching for his throat she found his pulse slow and steady and strong tears blurred her eyes even as she heard movement and looked up to see fade rising from his seat not far away his throat was raw and abraded his sleeve stained with blood but the cut upon it had been crafted closed pink skin clean and almost glowing fade isana breathed how the slave turned his face up toward the battlements tavi he said voice thick with tension theyre with him up there gravel pattered down around her making isana look up odiana stood upon the wall staring down her expression detached dark eyes somehow empty hollow she moved one bare foot kicking at a coil of knotted rope beside her and it unwound falling down to bump against the wall beside isanas head come up odiana said what have you done with him isana demanded you know i cant hear you the water witch replied come up she vanished from the edge of the battlements isana looked at fade and reached for the rope the slave stepped closer his expression serious and put his hands on her waist lifting her as she began to climb isana reached the top of the wall to find odiana standing over the unmoving forms of tavi and amara both were pale still but breathing steadily isana went to tavis side at once reaching down to touch his face to brush an errant curl back from his eyes she felt herself sob in relief felt some easing in the terror and the fear of the past several days that demanded tears to fill the void she didnt bother to craft them away happily reunited odiana murmured there the woman turned to walk toward the rope evidently in preparation to climb back down it why isana asked her voice choked she looked up at the water witch you saved them why odiana tilted her head to one side eyes focused on isanas mouth why why indeed she shook her head you could have killed me at kordholt or simply left me behind you did neither you could have given me to the cursor girl you did not it deserved a reply this is mine i dont understand saving your life would have been a small grace i think saving the lives of your blood is another matter you love the boy as a son you love him so much it hurts my eyes the steadholder even the slave they are important to you so i give you their lives our scale is balanced do not expect it again isana nodded what about the girl odiana sighed i was hoping she would die out of general principles but shell live i neither helped nor hurt her take that as you would thank you the water witch shrugged and murmured with something like genuine warmth in her tone i hope that i never see you again isana and with that she descended the rope and once at the bottom walked briskly across the courtyard deeper into garrison eyes wary isana turned her back on the departing mercenary and knelt down to touch tavis forehead to send rill gently into the boy to assure her of his health she sensed that he was in pain and that he would need a more thorough crafting to put him to right but that the water witch had ensured that he would live to be treated there was a scraping of leather on stone behind her and fade hauled himself up the rope glowering at it reproachfully after tavi hes all right isana whispered hes going to be all right fade put a hand on isanas shoulder silently he is brave like his father isana glanced up at fade and smiled wearily the battle is it over fade nodded looking down over the courtyard the gates it is over then help me isana said we need to get them into a bed so that we can see to them what then fade asked then isana closed her eyes then we go home chapter fidelias woke in somewhere dark cool he ached everywhere he opened his eyes good odiana purred youre awake she leaned over him to rest fingertips lightly on his temples the cool pale metal of a discipline collar gleamed at her throat no more bleeding what happened fidelias asked she watched his mouth very closely as he spoke then answered i found my aldrick and then i found you were not out yet we need you to help us where are we in a warehouse in garrison my love is running an errand and then well go the dagger in your hand you wouldnt let it go fidelias lifted his hand and saw the dagger there where are the men already gone the door to the warehouse creaked open and aldrick wearing the tunic of a rivan legionare entered there isnt much time he said voice tense he limped to odiana and tossed down several bloody scraps of flesh attached to sweeping manes of fine white hair scalps the marat are sweeping the buildings for any stragglers theres one more circle to close odiana said smiling and lifted up the scalps she began to hum to herself and walked over toward a pile of fallen crates and spilled junk in the dimness of the warehouse fidelias rose and wavered on his feet gasping he looked down to find himself wearing a rivan tunic as well aldrick caught him though the swordsman himself seemed none too steady easy you were hurt pretty badly odiana stabilized you but youre going to need some serious attention fidelias nodded he tucked aquitaines dagger into his pouch and tied it shut all right he said how do we get out of here everythings still in chaos out there aldrick said the alerans are confused there are many wounded and some of the buildings are on fire the wolves fled and left the herdbanes to rot most of them fought to the death and theyre still flushing them out of attics and basements fidelias nodded the men banged up pretty well were going to be paying off a lot of death benefits if we can get out of garrison we should be able to rendevous with them can you stand yes fidelias squinted over toward odiana and limped toward her she crouched beside the nearly still form of a huge grimy holder broken crates lay all over him along with spilled slate shingles the man was obviously crippled and he was not conscious odiana was touching his hair with gentle fingers and smiled at aldrick as he and fidelias approached then she leaned forward and touched the mans head wake up master kord kord shivered and his eyelids fluttered open after a moment he shivered and focused on them fear touched his features odiana leaned down smiling and kissed his forehead aldrick rested the tip of his sword lightly against kords cheek take off the collar he said now kord licked his lips and whispered why should i aldrick pressed the tip of the sword into kords skin the man cringed away all right all right he reached up and fumbled at the collar odiana shivered as it came free holding it and staring at it we should go fidelias said odiana murmured one thing more master i have a gift for you before i leave wait kord stammered i did what you said i took the collar off odiana leaned down to look into kords eyes and murmured isana is too kind a person to kill you kord shes too good a person to kill you and you poor thing she kissed his forehead again so am i she took the scalps aldrick had brought and draped one of them over kords arm then tucked one through his belt and left the third wrapped about his wrist these are scalps of the horse clan odiana said they take scalping very seriously and theyre emptying the buildings one by one looking for enemies they should be here any moment poor master theyre going to tear the heart from your chest and eat it while it still beats youll get to see part of it she let out a sigh and turned to aldrick but we wont he shook his head but its a pretty morning at least time to go love odiana watched his mouth then thrust out her lower lip but stepped to aldricks side and rested her hand on his arm fidelias grimaced glancing down at the scalpdraped steadholder then he turned to walk away kord clutched at his ankle wait please dont leave me here dont leave me here for those animals fidelias paused long enough to grind his heel down on the mans fingers and then walked away wearily pulling up the woodcrafting that would shelter him aldrick and odiana from view while they slipped out of the battleravaged fortress they left the warehouse and saw a halfdozen of the horse clan dart inside weapons in hand in less than a minute kord began to scream long drawn out agonized terrified horrible screams odiana leaned her head against aldricks shoulder and murmured youre right my lord it is a lovely morning chapter tavi woke up in bed in a room in bernardholt used mostly when there were extra guests at hand he felt tired thirsty but except for a mild ache he did not hurt he moved his legs and felt some kind of short breeches on them i dont know why his uncles voice rumbled from a bed nearby she bent over me and i thought she was going to cut my throat then she crafted the wound shut instead said she didnt want me to bleed to death amaras voice held a frown did she say anything yes to tell isana that they were even tavi sat up and looked around his uncle sat in the bed beside him white bandages wrapped around him from where his belly showed at the edge of the sheets to under his arms he looked pale and bruises marred his shoulders and half of his face but he smiled when he saw tavi well well we thought youd sleep forever tavi let out a glad cry and threw himself across the space of beds at his uncle hugging him tightly bernard laughed careful careful im delicate his arms folded around tavi and hugged him back good to see you boy amara dressed in a blouse and skirts of rich brown smiled at him hello tavi he flashed the cursor a smile and looked back at bernard but how tavi asked how did you live odiana bernard said that water witch that attacked you in the river your aunt saved her from being killed by kord she was hiding among the corpses at the base of the wall she saved me fade too tavi shook his head i dont care who did it as long as youre all right bernard laughed again what i am he said is hungry you tavis stomach grew queasy not yet uncle amara turned to a pitcher nearby and poured water into a cup for tavi handing it to him drink up once you get liquid back in you youll be hungry right enough tavi nodded his thanks to her and drank his hand the one that had been broken felt a little weak and he switched the cup to the other youre all right too she smiled a wan expression alive some scars ill be all right im sorry tavi said i lost the dagger amara shook her head youve nothing to be sorry for tavi you stood against two men who have killed more people between them than anyone i know of it was very brave you shouldnt feel ashamed for not getting the dagger but without it aquitaine gets away with it you cant prove hes guilty right amara frowned id be careful what i said if i were you tavi if someone overhears you you may face prosecution yourself for slander but its the truth she halfsmiled not without the dagger without that its just a suspicion tavi frowned thats stupid amara laughed a sudden bright sound yes she agreed but look at it this way you saved the valley and who knows how many steadholts beyond it youre a hero tavi blinked uh i am amara nodded her expression grave i filed my report yesterday the first lord himself is coming out tomorrow to present several people with rewards for their courage tavi shook his head im not very courageous i dont feel like a hero amaras eyes sparkled perhaps you will later isana walked briskly into the room wearing fresh clothing and a crisp apron tavi she said her tone brisk get back into bed this instant tavi leapt for the covers isana frowned at bernard and you bernard you know i told you to make the boy stay in bed he grinned sheepishly oh right isana stepped over to her brother and touched his temples hmph well youre not going to cause chaos in here any longer get your lazy bones out of bed and go eat bernard grinned and leaned forward giving isana a kiss on the forehead whatever the watercrafter orders bah amara are you still feeling well no fever no nausea amara shook her head smiling and turned her back tactfully when bernard rose to pull on his trousers and a loose tunic moving stiffly im fine mistress isana you did a wonderful job good now get out the boy needs to rest bernard smiled and ruffled tavis hair then he stepped up beside amara and took her hand the cursor blinked and looked down at his hand then back up at his face she smiled and her cheeks flushed with color oh go on isana said and slapped bernards shoulder he grinned and the two walked out of the room they werent walking very quickly tavi noticed and they walked very close together isana turned to tavi and put her fingers on his temples then smiled at him how are you feeling thirsty maam she smiled and refilled his cup i was so worried tavi im so proud of what you have done everyone in the valley thinks youre quite the young hero tavi blinked at her and sipped at his drink do i you know have to do anything learn to make speeches or something she laughed and kissed his forehead just rest youre a brave person tavi and you think about others more than yourself when hard times come always remember who you are she rose there are some visitors coming but i dont want you to talk to them for very long drink your water and then get some more sleep ill bring up some food later this evening when youre ready yes maam tavi said he watched her walk toward the door and just before she left he asked her aunt isana who is araris valerian isana stopped in the doorway frowning she drew a breath he he was one of the royal guardsmen one of princeps septimuss personal bodyguards a famous swordsman did he die with the princeps she turned to face him and said very quietly very firmly yes tavi he died fifteen years ago do you understand but tavi isana sighed i need you to trust me please tavi just for a little while he swallowed and nodded yes maam isana smiled at him wearily here are your visitors remember dont talk for too long she slipped out a moment later doroga ducked his head to slip beneath the doorway and strode into the room the huge marat headman was dressed in his loincloth together with a cloak with a mantle of thanadent feathers and a garish pale red tunic aleran boots dangled in his belt though his own feet were bare and rings decorated every finger his left arm was in a sling swollen and discolored but he seemed in good spirits and smiled at tavi moving to his bed and crushing his hand in a friendly monstrous grip behind him walked kitai scowling dressed in a loincloth and wearing an aleran tunic carelessly stained with food and dirt her long pale hair had been pulled back into a neat braid revealing the delicate curves of her cheekbones and neck well young warrior doroga said i have paid you back for saving my whelp daughter kitai interjected i am not a whelp anymore father daughter doroga rumbled with an expansive smile you saved my daughter and i paid you back for it but then you saved me as well i find myself still in your debt i didnt do anything tavi said you shouted a warning to me tavi doroga said without it i would have died he squeezed tavis shoulders and tavi briefly thought something was going to break again thank you but what i did was small youre the one who did all the big things you led a horde against another horde sir a horde of your own people i set out to repay my debt to you doroga said finish what you set out to do it is part of being a man doroga smiled at him and rose kitai kitai scowled doroga frowned at her kitai rolled her eyes and snapped to tavi thank you for saving my life tavi blinked mildly at her um sure she narrowed her eyes dont think im going to forget it either tavi thought that it sounded a great deal more like a threat than a promise uh no i dont think that kitais scowl deepened though something around her eyes softened at the words i am going to learn to ride a horse she stated if it is all right with you uh sure whatever good thats great kitai tavi glanced at doroga hopefully doroga rolled his eyes and sighed then said we should go your headman wants to thank me tomorrow and kitai should wash her tunic kitai snapped whelps wear tunics it is foolish to make me wear this one i dont like it i dont want it why shouldnt i wear what the rest of the marat women wear you want to walk around here naked like that tavi demanded are you crazy dress like a normal person while youre here doroga abruptly smiled at tavi his face stretching into a broad grin good that is good kitai folded her arms and shot tavi a look that could have crumbled stones to dust tavi sank a bit under the sheets kitai made a sound of disgust and stalked out of the room doroga broke into a rumbling laugh and ruffled tavis hair in a gesture peculiarly like uncle bernards doomed young warrior doomed but her mother and i started off that way tavi blinked what we will see one another again doroga turned to go what tavi said again her mother what doroga wait doroga didnt slow rumbling out a low laugh as he left the room remember what i said tavi we will speak again tavi settled back on the bed scowling folding his arms pensive he had the definite impression that he had gotten in over his head somewhere along the way tavi frowned pondering finish what i started there was a gentle knock at the doorway and tavi looked up to see fades scarred homely face smiling in at him from the hall tavi fade said his tone happy tavi smiled hello fade come in fade shuffled inside eyes vacant carrying a long package of red cloth whats this tavi asked present fade said present tavi he offered the cloth bundle to him tavi reached out to take it and found it heavier than he expected he lay it on his lap and unwrapped the cloth from around it the cloth turned out to be one of the scarlet capes from the princeps memorium and wrapped within it in an old and travel worn scabbard was the battered old blade amara had carried from the memorium and that fade had used upon the wall tavi looked up at fade who smiled witlessly at him for you tavi frowned you dont have to keep up the act fade he said quietly for a moment something glittered in fades eyes above the cowards brand on his cheek he regarded tavi in silence for a moment and then gave him a deliberate wink for you he repeated in that same voice and then turned to go tavi looked up to see a man standing in the doorway he was tall broad of shoulder and long of limb his face did not look much older than his uncles but there was something about his faded green eyes that spoke of more years than were evident silver streaked his hair and a heavy cloak of plain grey fabric covered him except for what his hood revealed of his face fade drew in a sharp breath a princely gift the man murmured are you sure it is yours to give slave fade lifted his chin and tavi saw the slaves shoulders straighten for tavi the man in the doorway narrowed his eyes then shrugged his shoulders leave us i would speak to him alone fade glanced warily back at tavi and then nodded his head deeply to the stranger he shuffled out the door after giving tavi another witless smile and vanished into the hall the stranger shut the door quietly behind fade and moved to sit down on the bed beside tavis his green eyes never leaving the boy do you know me tavi shook his head the stranger smiled my name is gaius sextus tavi felt his mouth drop open he sat up straight stammering oh sir sire i didnt recognize you im sorry gaius held up a gloved hand in a soothing gesture no stay in bed you need your rest i thought you were coming tomorrow sire yes but i came here incognito this evening why i wanted to speak with you tavi it would seem that i am in your debt tavi swallowed i was just trying to get my sheep home sir thats all i meant to happen i mean after that everything just sort of got complicated gaius suggested tavi flushed and nodded exactly thats how these things happen i dont want to keep you up long so ill come to the point i owe you name your reward and youll have it tavi blinked at the first lord his mouth falling open again anything he asked within reason then i want you to help the holders who got hurt and the families of those who were killed winters coming on and its going to be hard for all of us gaius lifted both eyebrows and tilted his head to one side truly given anything to choose from that is your choice of rewards tavi felt his jaw set stubbornly he met gaiuss eyes with his own and nodded gaius murmured amazing the first lord shook his head very well ill have crown aid dispensed to those who suffered loss on a casebycase basis by the local count fair enough yes sire thank you let me add one thing more to that tavi my cursor tells me that you wish to attend the academy tavis heart thudded abruptly in his chest yes sire more than anything it might be difficult for someone with your limitations shall we say you will be in the company of the sons and daughters of merchants and nobles and wealthy houses from all over alera many of them strong crafters it may provide you with a great many challenges i dont care tavi blurted i dont care about that sire i can handle myself gaius regarded him for a moment then nodded i believe you can then if you will accept it it will be done i will give you patronage for your attendance at the academy and assist you in choosing your fields of study you will be academ tavi patronus gaius go to the capital the academy see what you can make of your life given a chance hmm tavis head spun and he felt his eyes fill with tears he blinked them many times trying to hide the tears sire sire you dont know what it means to me thank you gaius smiled and the skin at the corners of his eyes crinkled up as he did rest then tomorrow will be all ceremony and display but please know that you have my gratitude young man and my respect thank you sire gaius rose and inclined his head thank you academ ill see you tomorrow he left the room leaving tavi feeling a little dizzy the boy lay down on his pillow staring up at the ceiling his heart racing the capital the academy everything he had wanted he started to cry and to laugh at the same time and he hugged himself tightly because he felt as though if he didnt he might burst the first lord of all alera had told him thank you that he would see him tomorrow tavi stilled for a moment mulling over what had been said to him that day no he murmured theres something i need to do first need to finish what ive begun chapter fidelias sank into the warm bath in aching relief his eyes closing nearby lady aquitaine dressed only in a robe of pale silk placed aquitaines signet dagger into a coffer on her dresser and shut and locked it and my men fidelias asked all being cared for she assured him i repaired your watercrafters hearing and she and her man went to their suite she half smiled they deserve the time i think i failed fidelias said not entirely murmured lady aquitaine she tested the temperature of the water and then lay her fingers on fideliass temples without the dagger gaius has nothing but suspicions but he knows fidelias said he felt briefly dizzy as a slow wave of warmth pulsed over him his aches began to vanish into a molten cloud of blessed relief he knows aquitaine isnt working in secret any longer lady aquitaine smiled then she stepped around the tub and let the silk robe slip from her shoulders she slid into the water with fidelias and wrapped her arms around the mans shoulders you worry too much fidelias shifted uncomfortably lady perhaps i should go your husband is busy lady aquitaine purred she gestured and in the water shapes rose solid outlines as though dolls upon a tiny stage there were two figures there on a great bed in a wellappointed chamber writhing together in sensual completion then kissing slow heavy kisses there sweet lady aquitaines voice tinny and distant murmured are you feeling better attis a young womans voice whispered lazily contented so strong she shivered and began to sit up i should go nonsense lord aquitaine said hell be handing out rewards for hours yet you and i have time for more no she murmured i shouldnt but fidelias could hear the excitement in her voice you should aquitaine murmured there thats better such a lover the woman sighed and soon we can be together like this whenever you desire thats right aquitaine said and lady aquitaine the woman asked lady aquitaines lips split in a cool little smile she wont be a problem lord aquitaine said no more talking fidelias watched as gaius caria first lady of alera wrapped her arms around lord aquitaine and drew him closer to her you see lady aquitaine purred letting the images slide away into the water again we have more than one knife at his back she turned to fidelias her lips at his ear and he felt himself begin to respond with slow ardent hunger the story is not yet done gaius sextus first lord of alera descended to the calderon valley upon a winged steed of pure fire around him flew a full legion of knights aeris five thousand strong and the royal guard in their scarlet capes knights ferro and ignus knights aqua and terra and knights fauna all of them of ancient high blood trumpets announced their arrival and despite the vast numbers of men aloft the air hardly seemed to stir the first lord descended on bernardholt with a full legion in his train and the people of the calderon valley turned out to meet him amara stood foremost before the crowds and gaius dismounted the stallion of flame vanishing to a wisp of smoke as he did amara knelt as he approached her but he took her hand and raised her to her feet embracing her with gentle arms he wore the scarlet and azure of alera a blade at his side and carried himself with pride and strength though there seemed to be more lines of care worn into the corners of his eyes he stood up and looked down at her eyes smiling amara well done amara felt the tears touch her eyes and she straightened with pride thank you sire the legion settled behind them like hundreds of gleaming deadly dragonflies and amara stood a little straighter in her borrowed gown sire ill present them to you in the order i discussed in my report gaius nodded yes do im eager to meet them amara called out let frederic of bernardholt approach the crown there was a startled gulp from the crowd and someone pushed the tall brawny youth up out of the crowd to the general laughter of the holders frederic looked around folding his hands nervously then sighed and walked forward to amara and the first lord he began to bow then knelt then changed his mind and stood up to bow again gaius laughed and took the young mans hand and shook it firmly i am given to understand young man that you bested not one but two of the mercenary knights in single combat armed with only a shovel spade sir frederic corrected him then flushed that is uh i hit them yes sire and i am told that in the battle you defended a door of a building in the east courtyard protecting the children inside from harm at the hands of the marat yes with my spade sir sire sorry kneel young man frederic swallowed and did gaius drew his sword and it gleamed in the sun for courage loyalty and resourcefulness in the face of enemies of the realm frederic of bernardholt i do hearby dub thee a knight of the realm with all the responsibility and privileges therein you are from this day a citizen of the realm and let no man dispute your devotion rise sir frederic frederic stood up stunned but but all i know is herding gargants sir i dont know about that fighting and whatnot sire sorry sir frederic gaius intoned i wish all of my knights knew a skill so useful he smiled and said we will discuss in time your duties here frederic bowed clumsily yes sir thank you sir sire sir gaius gestured and frederic took a few dazed steps to one side amara called let bernard of bernardholt come forth bernard dressed in rich fabrics of brown and woodland green stepped forward from the crowd and dropped to one knee before gaius bowing his head gaius took bernards hand and raised him i understand you helped take over matters when gram was injured i only helped sire bernard said i did what anyone would have you did what anyone should have gaius said there is a difference a broad difference steadholder your courage in the face of such overwhelming danger is not overlooked once again gaius tapped his sword to either shoulder by the authority of the crown i do hereby dub thee bernard count of calderon bernards head snapped up and he blinked gaius smiled with all the responsibility and privileges therein and so on rise good count bernard stood up staring at gaius but gram is the count here gram is now a lord im afraid your excellency gaius lowered his voice with a glance around he has a comfortable assignment in the amaranth vale now while he recovers from his injuries i need someone who the local people respect and who i can trust to take over for him also someone who the marat will respect youre it bernards face slowly spread into a smile thank you sire ill do my best not to disappoint you you wont gaius said well need to keep in close touch at first the first lord glanced aside at amara and said i will have to appoint a special courier to be our gobetween ill see if i can find someone willing to come all the way out here bernard flushed and amara felt her own face heating at the same time thank you sire bernard said more quietly gaius winked he gestured and count bernard stepped to his left side to stand with sir frederic amara smiled and said doroga of the gargant clan of the marat step forward the crowd parted for the giant of a man and doroga strode over to gaius decked in gewgaws and rich clothing which holders and legionares had given to him he put his fists on his hips and looked gaius up and down then declared you arent old enough to be a headman gaius laughed the sound rich and rolling i look young for my age doroga nodded wisely ah perhaps that is it i am here to thank you headman doroga for what you did for my realm i didnt do it for your realm doroga said i did it for the young warrior and would do it again doroga lifted a finger and poked it lightly at gaiuss chest you be good to him or you and i will have words amara stared at the barbarian appalled but gaius only tilted his head to one side his lips quivering with the effort to restrain laughter then he took a step back and bowed to doroga to a sudden murmur from the legion and the holders i will do so name me a boon and if it is within my power i will grant it to you i owe favors to enough people already doroga sighed we done i think so yes good doroga turned and let out a piercing whistle and from around the hill came a sullen young marat girl on an enormous black bull gargant doroga walked over to her swung up onto the great beasts back and nodded to gaius before turning to ride away colorful gaius commented im sorry sire i didnt know that he would oh no cursor its perfectly all right who is next they ran through a number of legionares and holders who had performed bravely during the incident including a stammering pluvus pentius who had saved a handful of children from a wounded herdbane by clubbing it to death with his accounts ledger isana of bernardholt amara called finally please step forward isana came forward in a gown of dark grey her dark hair pulled back into a severe braid her chin lifted she walked forward and stopped before gaius for a long moment before performing a deep and graceful curtsy to him without lowering her eyes amara saw something cold there something defiant and she blinked at the hold woman gaius remained silent for a long moment studying isana finally he said in a very quiet voice i understand that your courage and bravery saved a great many lives there was only one i was truly concerned with sire gaius drew in a slow breath and nodded the boy your nephew sire nephew of course gaius glanced aside at amara and i am told you have ownership of a slave who likewise performed above and beyond anything expected of him isana inclined her head again i will purchase this slave from you isana looked up at gaius her expression strained im sure he isnt what you think sire let me be the judge of that in the meanwhile isana please kneel isana did her expression puzzled gaius once more drew his blade i dub thee steadholder isana with all the responsibilities and privileges therein there was a seconds silence and then a shocked murmur from the crowd of holders and from the legions behind gaius gaius murmured the first appointed female steadholder isanaholt it has a nice ring to it doesnt it isana flushed it does sire and your brother is going to be busy with his new duties someone needs to assume control i see no reason anyone could object to you rise steadholder amara smiled as isana stepped aside tavi of bernardholt please step forward there was an eager murmur from the crowd but no one stepped forward amara frowned tavi of bernardholt please step forward still no one did gaius arched an eyebrow and amara shot a helpless look at isana isana closed her eyes and sighed that boy gaius said are you sure he wanted this reward cursor yes sire amara said he told me he was trying to return some sheep so that he could use them to help him save some money for a semester at the academy thats why he stumbled onto things to begin with im not offering him a semester im offering him patronage he should be here isana blinked at gaius patronage to the academy my tavi the finest center of learning in all of carna gaius said he can study there grow learn all that he needs to lead a successful life isana said he doesnt need the academy for that yet that is his wish steadholder isana and that is his reward he will be tavi patronus gaius and be trained at the academy isana nodded and said yes sire but her expression was worried bernard frowned looking around for a moment then pointed and said sire there he is everyone turned to look to the north of bernardholt after a moments silence gaius asked that is this fade with him amara nodded yes sire gaius frowned i see cursor why wasnt the boy here he um he seems to be rather independently minded sire i see and why is he doing that instead of accepting his reward amara fought to keep a smile off of her lips sire hes a shepherds apprentice i suppose hes doing that because its what he set out to do and so the first lord of alera surrounded by subjects citizens and knights of the realm watched in silence while tavi drove home dodgers little flock of ewes and lambs the shaggyhaired fade loping along behind him about the author a martial arts enthusiast whose resume includes a long list of skills rendered obsolete at least two hundred years ago jim butcher turned to writing as a career because anything else probably would have driven him insane he lives with his wife his son and a ferocious guard dog
