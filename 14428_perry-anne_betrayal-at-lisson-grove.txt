anne perry betrayal at lisson grove chapter one thats him gower yelled above the sound of the traffic pitt turned on his heel just in time to see a figure dart between the rear end of a hansom and the oncoming horses of a brewers dray gower disappeared after him missing being knocked over and trampled by no more than inches pitt plunged into the street swerving to avoid a brougham and stopping abruptly to let another hansom past by the time he reached the far pavement gower was twenty yards ahead and he could see only his head with its flying hair the man he was pursuing was out of sight weaving between clerks in pinstripes leisurely strollers and the occasional early woman shopper with her long skirts getting in the way pitt closed the gap until he was less than a dozen yards behind gower he caught a glimpse of the man ahead just bright ginger hair and a green jacket then he was gone and gower turned his right hand raised for a moment in signal before disappearing into an alley to the left pitt followed after him into the shadows his eyes taking a moment or two to adjust the way was long and narrow bending in a dogleg a hundred yards down the gloom was caused by the overhanging eaves and the watersoaked darkness of the brick long streams of grime running down from broken guttering people were huddled in doorways others made their way slowly limping or staggering beneath heavy bolts of cloth barrels or bulging sacks gower was still ahead seeming to find his way with ease pitt veered round a fat woman with a tray of matches to sell and tried to catch up gower was at least ten years younger even if his legs were not quite as long and he was more used to this kind of thing but it was pitts experience in the metropolitan police before he joined special branch that had found west the man they were now chasing pitt bumped into an old woman and apologised before regaining his stride they were round the dogleg now and he could see wests ginger head making for the opening into the wide thoroughfare forty yards on they must catch him before he was swallowed up in the crowds gower was almost there he reached out an arm to grab at west in that moment west ducked sideways and gower tripped hurtling into the wall and momentarily winding himself he bent over double gasping to get his breath pitt lengthened his stride and reached west just as west dived out into the high street barged his way through a knot of people and disappeared pitt went after him and a moment later saw the light on his bright hair almost at the next crossroads he increased his pace bumping and banging people but he had to catch west west had information that could be vital the tide of unrest was rising fast all over europe and becoming more violent many people in the name of reform were actually trying to overthrow government altogether and create an anarchy in which they imagined there would be some kind of equality of justice some were content with bloodsoaked oratory others preferred dynamite or even bullets special branch knew of a current plot but not yet the leaders behind it or more urgently the target of their violence west was to provide that at risk of his own life if his betrayal were known where the devil was gower pitt swivelled round once to see if he could spot him he was nowhere visible in the sea of bobbing heads the bowler hats caps and bonnets there was no time to look longer surely he wasnt still bent double in the alley what was wrong with the man he was not much more than thirty had he been more than just knocked off balance was he injured west was up ahead seizing a break in the traffic to cross back to the other side three hansoms came past almost nose to tail a cart and four clattered in the opposite direction pitt fumed on the kerb to go out into the road now would only get him killed a horsedrawn omnibus passed then two heavily loaded wagons more carts and a dray went in the other direction pitt had lost sight of west and gower had vanished into the air there was a brief holdup in traffic and pitt raced across the road weaving in and out of the way of frustrated drivers he only just missed being caught by a long curling carriage whip someone yelled at him and he took no notice he reached the opposite side and saw wests bright head for an instant as he swung round a corner and made for another alley pitt raced after him but when he got there west had disappeared did you see a man with ginger hair pitt demanded of a pedlar with a tray of sandwiches where did he go want a sandwich the man asked eyes wide very good made this morning only tuppence pitt fished frantically in his pocket found string sealing wax a pocket knife a handkerchief and several coins he gave the man a threepenny bit and took a sandwich it felt soft and fresh although right now he didnt care which way he said harshly that way the man pointed into the deeper shadows of the alley pitt began to run again weaving a path through the piles of rubbish a rat skittered from under his feet and he all but fell over a drunken figure lying half out of a doorway somebody swung a punch at him he lurched to one side losing his balance for a moment glimpsing west still ahead of him now west disappeared again and pitt had no idea which way he had gone he tried one blind courtyard or alley after another it seemed like endless wasted moments later before the familiar figure of gower came out of one of the side alleyways leading to the yard of a public house pitt gower clutched at his arm this way quickly his fingers dug into pitts flesh making him gasp with the sudden pain together they ran forward pitt along the broken pavement beside the dark walls gower in the gutter his boots sending up a spray of filthy water pace for pace they went round the corner into the open entrance to a brick yard and saw a man crouching over something on the ground gower let out a cry of fury and darted forward half crossing in front of pitt and tripping him up in his eagerness they both fell heavily pitt was on his feet in time to see the crouched figure swing round for an instant then scramble up and run as if for his life oh god gower said aghast now also on his feet after him i know who it is pitt stared at the heap on the ground and saw wests green jacket and bright hair blood streamed from his throat staining his chest and already pooled dark on the stones underneath him there was no way he could possibly be alive gower was already pursuing the assassin pitt raced after him and this time his long strides caught up before they reached the road who is it he demanded almost choking on his own breath wrexham gower hissed back weve been watching him for weeks pitt knew that but only the mans name was familiar he had never seen wrexhams face but there was no time to explain that now there was a momentary break in the stream of vehicles they darted across the road after wrexham who thank heaven was an easy figure to see he was taller than average and in spite of the mild weather he was wearing a long palecoloured scarf which swung in the air as he twisted and turned it flashed through pitts mind that it might be used as a weapon it would not be hard to strangle a man with it they were on a crowded footpath now and wrexham dropped his pace he almost sauntered walking easily swiftly with loping strides but perfectly casual could he be arrogant enough to imagine he had lost them so quickly he certainly knew they had seen him because he had swivelled round at gowers cry and then run as if for his life perhaps he was trusting to his very appearance of normality to make him invisible they were now walking at a steady pace eastwards towards stepney and limehouse soon the crowds would thin as they left the broader streets behind if he goes into an alley be careful pitt warned now beside gower as if they were two tradesmen bound on a common errand he has a knife hes too comfortable he must know were behind him gower glanced at him sideways his eyes wide for an instant you think hell try and pick us off we practically saw him cut wests throat pitt replied matching gower stride for stride if we get him hell hang he must know that i reckon hell duck and hide suddenly when he thinks were taking it easy gower answered wed better stay fairly close to him lose sight of him for a moment and hell be gone for good pitt agreed with a nod and they closed the distance between them and wrexham who was still moving with no apparent concern never once did he turn or look back pitt found it chilling that a man could slit anothers throat and see him bleed to death and a few moments after be walking in a crowd with outward unconcern as if he were just one more pedestrian about some trivial daily business what passion or inhumanity drove him in the way he moved the fluidity almost grace of his stride pitt could not detect even fear let alone the conscience of a brutal murder the blood from which must be on his clothes wrexham wove in and out of the thinning crowd twice they lost sight of him that way gower gasped waving his right hand ill go left he swerved round a windowcleaner with a bucket of water almost knocking the man over pitt went the other way into the north of an alley the sudden shadows momentarily made him blink half blind he saw movement at the end and charged forward but it was only a beggar shuffling out of a doorway he swore under his breath and sprinted back to the street just in time to see gower swivelling around frantically searching for him that way gower called urgently and set off leaving pitt to catch up now it was pitt who saw him first and gower who had to catch up wrexham had crossed the road just in front of a brewers dray and was out of sight by the time pitt and gower were able to follow it took them over ten minutes to close on him without drawing attention there were fewer people about and two men running would have been highly noticeable with fifty yards distance between them wrexham could have outrun them too easily they were in commercial road east now in stepney if wrexham did not turn they would be in limehouse perhaps the west india dock road if they went that far they could lose him amongst the tangle of wharfs with cranes bales of goods warehouses and dock labourers if he went down to one of the ferries he could be out of sight between the ships at anchor before they could find another ferry to follow him ahead of them as if he had seen them wrexham increased his pace his long legs striding out his scarf flying pitt felt a flicker of nervousness his muscles were aching his feet sore in spite of his excellent boots his one concession to sartorial taste even wellcut jackets never looked right on him because he weighted the pockets with too many pieces of rubbish he thought he might need his ties never managed to stay straight perhaps he knotted them too tightly or too loosely but his boots were beautiful and immaculately cared for even though most of his work was of the mind outthinking outguessing remembering and seeing significance where others didnt he still knew the importance of a policemans feet some habits do not die before he had been forced out of the metropolitan police and victor narraway had taken him into special branch he had walked enough miles to know the price of inattention to physical stamina and boots suddenly wrexham ran across the narrow road and disappeared down gun lane hes going for the limehouse station gower shouted leaping out of the way of a cart full of timber as he dashed after him pitt was on his heels the limehouse station was on the blackwall railway less than a hundred yards away wrexham could go in at least three possible directions from there and end up anywhere in the city but wrexham kept moving rapidly his feet clattered on the stones past the way back up to the station instead he went on down gun lane turned left on three colt street then swerved right on ropemakers fields still loping in an easy run pitt was too breathless to shout and anyway wrexham was no more than fifteen yards ahead the few men and one old washerwoman on the path scattered as the three running men passed them wrexham was going to the river as pitt had feared at the end of ropemakers fields they turned right again into narrow street still running they were only yards from the rivers edge the breeze was stiff off the water smelling of salt and mud where the tide was low half a dozen gulls soared lazily in circles above a string of barges wrexham was still ahead moving less easily now tiring he passed the entrance to limehouse cut he must be making for kidney stairs the stone steps down to the river where if they were lucky he would find a ferry waiting if there were none waiting he would see that before he began down and he would keep on running there were two more sets of stairs before the road curved twenty yards inland to broad street at the shadwell docks there were more stairs again he could lose his pursuers on any of them gower gestured towards the river steps he shouted bending a moment and gasping to catch his breath he gestured with a wild swing of his arm then he straightened up and began running again a couple of strides ahead of pitt pitt could see a ferry coming towards the shore the boatman pulling easily at the oars he would get to the steps a moment or two after wrexham in fact pitt and gower would corner him nicely perhaps they could get the ferry to take them up to the pool of london he ached to sit down even for that short while wrexham reached the steps and ran down them disappearing as if he had slipped into a hole pitt felt an upsurge of victory the ferry was still twenty yards from where the steps would meet the water gower let out a yell of triumph waving his hand high they reached the top of the steps just as the ferry pulled away from underneath the shadow of the wall wrexham sitting in the stern they were close enough to see the smile on his face and he half swivelled on the seat to see them then he faced forward speaking to the ferryman and pointing to the further shore pitt raced down the steps his feet slithered on the wet stones and he only just regained his balance he waved his arms at the other ferry the one they had seen here hurry he shouted gower shouted also his voice high and desperate the ferryman increased his speed throwing his full weight behind his oars and in a matter of seconds he swung round next to the pier get in gents he said cheerfully where to after that boat there gower gasped choking on his own breath and pointing to the other ferry an extra halfcrown in it for you if you catch up with him before he gets up horseferry stairs pitt landed in the boat behind him and immediately sat down so they could get underway hes not going to horseferry he pointed out hes going straight across look lavender dock gower scowled sitting in the seat beside pitt what the hell for shortest way across pitt replied get up to rotherhithe street and away where to nearest train station probably or he might double back best place to get lost is among other people they were pulling well away from the dock now and slowly catching up with the other ferry there were fewer ships moored here and they could make their way almost straight across a string of barges was still fifty yards downstream moving slowly against the tide the wind off the water was cold without thinking what he was doing pitt hunched up and pulled his collar higher around his neck it seemed like hours since he and gower had burst into the brickyard and seen wrexham crouched over the bloodsoaked body of west but it was probably little more than ninety minutes their information about whatever plot for violence west had known was gone with his death pitt thought back to his last interview with narraway sitting in the office with the hot sunlight streaming through the window onto the piles of books and papers on the desk narraways face had been intensely serious under his greying mane of hair his eyes almost black he had spoken of the gravity of the situation the rise of the passion to reform the old imperialism of europe violently if necessary it was no longer a matter of a few sticks of dynamite an assassination here and there there were whispers of the overthrow of governments by force of the mobilising of armies of people willing to sacrifice their own lives and other peoples to create a new order a whole new world some things need changing narraway had said with a wry bitterness no one but a fool would deny that there is injustice but this would result in anarchy god alone knows how wide this spreads at least as far as france germany and italy and by the sounds of it here in england as well the rest of europe went mad in fortyeight and it was over a couple of years later with all the old tyrannies back in place as strong as ever the barricades came down the reforms were overturned and everything reverted to the old ways pitt had stared at him seeing a sadness in him he had never imagined before with amazement he realised that narraway regretted the death of those dreams perhaps even more the death of the passionate idealistic and naive men and women who had sacrificed their lives in pursuit of them narraway had shaken his head as if awakening himself this is a different breed pitt and the tide of victory is with them now but not the violence we dont change that way in britain we evolve slowly well get there but not with murder and not by force the wind was fading the water smoother they were nearly at the south bank of the river it was time to make a decision gower was looking at him waiting wrexhams ferry was almost at the lavender dock hes going somewhere gower said urgently do we want to get him now sir or see where he leads us if we take him we wont know whos behind this he wont talk hes no reason to we practically saw him kill west hell hang for sure he waited frowning do you think we can keep him in sight pitt asked yes sir gower did not hesitate right the decision was clear in pitts mind stay back then well split up if we have to the ferry hung back until wrexham had climbed up the narrow steps and all but disappeared then scrambling to keep up pitt and gower went after him they were careful to follow now from more of a distance sometimes together but more often a sufficient space between them that a casual onlooker would have taken them for strangers merely travelling in approximately the same direction but wrexham seemed to be so absorbed in his own concern now that he never looked behind him he must have assumed he had lost them when he crossed the river indeed they were very lucky that he had not with the amount of waterborne traffic he must have failed to realise that one ferry was dogging his path at the railway station there were at least a couple of dozen other people at the ticket counter better get tickets all the way sir gower urged we dont want to draw attention to ourselves from not paying the fare pitt gave him a sharp look but forebore from making the remark on the edge of his tongue sorry gower murmured with a slight smile once on the platform they remained close to a knot of other people waiting neither of them spoke as if they were strangers to each other the precaution seemed unnecessary wrexham barely glanced at either of them nor at anyone else the first train was going north it drew in and stopped most of the waiting passengers got onto it but not wrexham pitt wished he had a newspaper to hide his face and appear to take his attention he should have thought of it before i think i can hear the next train gower said a minute or two later almost under his breath it should be to southampton eventually we might have to change the rest of what he said was cut off by the noise of the engine as the train pulled in belching steam the doors flew open and passengers poured out pitt struggled to keep wrexham in sight he waited until the last moment in case he should get out again and lose them then he and gower boarded a carriage behind his he could be going anywhere gower said grimly his fair face was set in hard lines his hair poking up where he had run his fingers through it one of us had better get out at every station to see he doesnt get off at the last moment and we lose him of course pitt agreed do you think west really had something for us gower went on he could have been killed for some other reason a quarrel those revolutionaries are pretty volatile could have been a betrayal within the group even a rivalry for leadership he was watching pitt intently his blue eyes staring so hard it was as if he were trying to read inside pitts mind i know that pitt said quietly he was by far the senior and the decision was his to make gower would never question him on that it was little comfort now in fact rather a lonely thought he remembered narraways certainty that there was something planned that would make the recent random bombings seem trivial in february of last year a french anarchist had tried to destroy the royal observatory at greenwich with a bomb thank heaven he had failed in june president carnot of france had been assassinated in august a man named caserio had been executed for the crime just before christmas french army officer alfred dreyfus had been convicted of treason but that was simply a scandal of persecution and prejudice in january of this year dreyfus had been sentenced to life imprisonment on devils island everywhere there was anger and uncertainty in the air it was a risk to take the chance of following wrexham but to seize on an empty certainty was a kind of surrender well follow him pitt replied do you have enough money for another fare if we have to separate to be sure of not losing him gower fished in his pocket counted what he had as long as it isnt all the way to scotland yes sir please god it isnt scotland he smiled with a twisted kind of misery you know in february they had the coldest temperature ever recorded in britain nearly fifty degrees of frost if the poor bastard let off a bomb to start a fire you could hardly blame him that was february pitt reminded him this is april already were pulling into a station ill watch for wrexham this time you take the next yes sir pitt opened the door and was only just on the ground when he saw wrexham get out and hurry across the platform to change trains for southampton pitt turned to signal gower and found him already out and at his elbow together they followed trying not to be conspicuous by hurrying they found seats but separately for a while to make sure wrexham didnt double back and elude them disappearing into london again but wrexham seemed to be oblivious of them as if he no longer even considered the possibility of being followed he appeared completely carefree from the serene expression on his face he could have spent a perfectly normal day pitt had to remind himself that wrexham had followed a man in the east end only a matter of hours ago and quite deliberately cut his throat and seen him bleed to death on the stones of a deserted brickyard god hes a coldblooded bastard he said with sudden fury a man in pinstripe trousers on the seat opposite put down his newspaper and stared at pitt with distaste then rattled his paper loudly and resumed reading gower smiled quite he said very quietly we had best be extremely careful one or the other of them got out briefly at every stop just to make certain wrexham did not leave this train but he stayed until they finally pulled in at southampton when at last he left it was still without appearing to have any concern that he was being followed gower looked at pitt puzzled what can he do in southampton he said they hurried along the platform to keep pace with wrexham then past the ticket collector and out into the street the answer was not long in coming wrexham took an omnibus directly towards the docks and pitt and gower had to race to jump onto the step just as it pulled away pitt almost bumped into wrexham who was still standing he only just avoided his face by turning away suddenly as if catching sight of someone he recognised deliberately he looked away from gower they must be more careful neither of them was particularly noticeable alone gower was fairly tall lean his hair long and fair but his features were a trifle bony stronger than average an observant person would remember him pitt was taller rather gangling perhaps less than graceful and yet he moved easily comfortable with himself his hair was dark and permanently untidy one front tooth was a little chipped but visible only when he smiled it was his steady very clear grey eyes people did not forget together one would have to be extraordinarily preoccupied not to be aware of seeing them in london and now again here in southampton accordingly pitt moved on down the inside of the bus to stand well away from gower and pretended to be watching the streets as they passed as if he were taking careful note of where he was as he had at least half expected wrexham went all the way to the dockside without speaking to gower or doing more than glance at him for an instant pitt followed well behind wrexham he trusted that gower was off to the side as far out of view as possible wrexham bought a ticket on a ferry to st malo across the channel on the coast of france pitt bought one as well he hoped fervently that gower had sufficient money to get one too but the only thing worse than fetching up alone in france trying to follow wrexham without help would be to lose him altogether he boarded the ferry a smallish steamship called the laura and remained within sight of the gangplank he needed to see if gower came aboard but more importantly to make sure that wrexham did not get off again if wrexham were aware of pitt and gower it would be a simple thing to go ashore again and leave them on their way to france completely trapped while he returned on the next train to london pitt was leaning on the railing with the sharp salt wind in his face when he heard footsteps behind him he swung round then was annoyed with himself for betraying such obvious alarm gower was a yard away smiling did you think i was going to push you over he said amusedly pitt swallowed back his temper not this close to the shore he replied ill watch you more closely out in midchannel gower laughed looks like a good decision sir following him this far could get us a real idea of who his contacts are in europe we might even find a clue as to what theyre planning pitt doubted it but it was all they had left now perhaps but we mustnt be seen together were lucky he hasnt recognised us so far he would have if he werent so abominably arrogant gower was suddenly very serious his fair face grim i think whatever he has planned is so important his mind is completely absorbed in it he thought he lost us in ropemakers fields dont forget we were in a totally separate carriage on the train i know but he must have seen us when we were chasing him he ran pitt pointed out i wish at least one of us had a jacket to change but in april at sea without them wed be even more conspicuous he looked at gowers coat they were not markedly different in size even if they did no more than exchange coats it would alter both their appearances slightly as if reading the thought in his eyes gower began to slip off his coat he passed it over and took pitts from his outstretched hand pitt put on gowers jacket it was a little tight across the chest with a rueful smile gower emptied the pockets of pitts jacket which sat a little loosely on his shoulders he passed over pitts notebook handkerchief pencil loose change half a dozen other bits and pieces then the wallet with pitts papers of identity and his money pitt similarly passed over all gowers belongings gower gave a little salute see you in st malo he said turning on his heel and walking away without looking back a slight swagger in his step then he stopped and half turned towards pitt smiling id keep away from the railing if i were you sir pitt raised his hand in a salute and resumed watching the gangway it was just past the equinox and darkness still came quite early they put out to sea as the sun was setting over the headland and the wind off the water was distinctly chill there was no point in even wondering where wrexham was let alone trying to watch him if he met with anyone they would not know unless they were so close to him as to be obvious and it might look like no more than a mere casual civility between strangers anyway it would be better to find a chair and get a little sleep it had been a long day full of exertion horror hectic running through the streets and then sitting perfectly still in a railway carriage as he sat drifting towards sleep pitt thought with regret that he had not had even a chance to tell charlotte that he would not be home that night or perhaps even the next one he had no idea where his decision would take him he had not very much money with him sufficient for one or two nights lodging now that he had bought a train ticket and a ferry ticket he had no toothbrush no razor certainly no clean clothes he had imagined he would meet west learn his information and then take it straight back to narraway at his office in lisson grove they would have to send a telegram from st malo requesting funds and saying at least enough for narraway to understand what had happened poor wests body would no doubt be found but the police might not know of any reason to inform special branch of it no doubt narraway would find out in time he seemed to have sources of information everywhere would he think to tell charlotte pitt wished now that he had made some kind of a provision to see she was informed or even made a telephone call from southampton but to do that he would have had to leave the ship and perhaps lose wrexham he dared not make himself conspicuous and who would be waiting for gower to get home worrying with surprise he realised that he did not even know if gower was married or living with his parents pitt was drifting into sleep having tried to reassure himself that he had had to stay away all night before and charlotte would not be frantic perhaps no more than concerned when he awoke with a jolt sitting upright his mind filled with the picture of wests body head lolling at an angle blood streaming onto the stones of the brickyard the air filled with the smell of it sorry sir the steward said automatically passing a glass of beer to the man in the seat next to pitt can i get you something how about a sandwich pitt realised with surprise that he had not eaten in twelve hours and he was ravenous no wonder he could not sleep peacefully yes he said eagerly yes please in fact may i have two and a glass of cider yes sir how about roast beef sir that do you please what time do we get into st malo about five oclock sir but you dont need to go ashore until seven unless o course youd like to thank you inwardly pitt groaned they would have to be up and watching from then on in case wrexham chose to leave early he could be on the next train to paris and they would never see him again to oversleep would be a disaster since pitt had nothing with him for a night away from home that meant he had no alarm clock either better bring me two glasses of cider he said with a wry smile would gower think to ask the arrival time pitt had no idea where he was and did not want to attract attention by looking for him later perhaps wrexham would be able to sleep as soundly and as long as he wished he could not imagine such a man being disturbed by the nightmares of conscience pitt slept on and off and he was awake and on edge when he saw gower coming towards him on the deck as the ferry nosed its way slowly towards the harbour of st malo it was not yet dawn but there was a clear sky and he could see the outline of medieval ramparts against the stars the walls must have been fifty or sixty feet high at the least and looked to be interspersed with great towers such as in the past would have been manned by archers perhaps on some of them there would have been men in armour with cauldrons of boiling oil to tip on those brave enough or foolish enough to try climbing ladders to scale the defences it was like a journey backwards in time he was so enthralled with the sight that he was jerked into reality by gowers voice behind him i see you are awake at least i assume you are it was a question not sure pitt replied that looks distinctly like a dream to me did you sleep gower asked a little you gower shrugged not much too afraid of missing him do you suppose hes going to make for the first train to paris it was a very reasonable question paris was a cosmopolitan city a hotbed of ideas philosophies dreams both practical and absurd it was the ideal place to meet for those who would change the world the two great revolutions of the last hundred years had been born there that of marat danton and robespierre of charlotte corday the guillotine and the end of the great kings of france had reigned here with terror and dreams that had changed the world and there was the revolution of which had died almost without trace probably pitt answered but he could get off anywhere he was thinking how hard it would be to follow wrexham in paris should they arrest him while they still had the chance in the heat of the chase yesterday it had seemed like a good idea to see where he went and more importantly who he met now when they were cold tired hungry and stiff it felt a lot less sensible in fact it was probably absurd wed better arrest him and take him back he said aloud then well have to do it before we get off gower pointed out once were on french soil well have no authority even the captain here is going to wonder why we didnt do it in southampton his voice took on a note of urgency his face grave look sir i speak pretty good french ive still got a reasonable amount of money we could send a telegram to narraway to have someone meet us in paris then there wouldnt be just the two of us maybe the french police would be pleased for the chance to follow him too pitt turned towards him but he could barely make out his features in the faint light of the sky and the dim reflection of the ships lights if he goes straight for the town well have no time to send a telegram he pointed out itll take both of us to follow him i dont know why he hasnt noticed us already actually that thought had troubled him through the night both he and gower were above average height in st malo they would be even more conspicuous not only would their language betray them but the cut of their clothes and the fact that they were obviously strangers wrexham could hardly be so blind as not to notice them in the clarity of daylight we should arrest him he told gower with regret faced with the certainty of the rope he might feel like talking faced with the certainty of the rope hed have nothing to gain gower pointed out pitt smiled grimly narrawayll think of something if what he says is worth enough he might not go for the train gower said quickly moving his weight to lean forward a little we were assuming hell go to paris perhaps he wont maybe whoever hes going to meet is here why come to st malo otherwise he could have gone to dover and taken the train from calais to paris if that was where he wanted to be he still doesnt know were on to him he thinks he lost us in ropemakers fields lets at least give it a chance the argument was persuasive and pitt could see it might be worth waiting a little longer right he conceded but if he goes to the railway station well take him he made a slight grimace if we can he might shout for help that hes being kidnapped we couldnt prove he wasnt do you want to give up gower asked his voice was tight with disappointment and pitt thought he heard a trace of contempt in it no there was no uncertainty in the decision special branch was not primarily about justice for crimes it was about preventing civil violence and the betrayal subversion or overthrow of the government they were too late to save wests life no i dont he repeated when they disembarked in the broadening daylight it was not difficult to pick wrexham out from the crowd and follow him he didnt go as pitt had feared to the train station but into the magnificently walled old city they did not dare lose sight of him or pitt would have taken time to look with far more interest at the massive ramparts as they went in through a vast entrance gate which would have allowed several carriages to pass abreast once inside narrow streets crisscrossed each other the doors of the buildings flush with the footpaths dark walls towered four or five storeys high in uniform greyblack stone it had a stern beauty he would have liked to explore as if in those few yards they had stepped back in history knights on horseback would have ridden these streets or swaggering corsairs straight from plunder at sea but they had to keep close to wrexham he was walking quickly as if he knew precisely where he was going and not once did he look behind him if he were out of their sight for more than a few seconds they could lose him a knock at any of the entrances and he would disappear it was perhaps fifteen minutes later when they were further to the south when wrexham stopped he knocked briefly and was let into a large house just off a stonepaved square which was actually little more than a doubling of the width of street to perhaps thirty feet across a slender tree decorated it softening the harshness of the lines and giving it grace and character pitt and gower waited for nearly an hour moving around trying not to look conspicuous but wrexham did not come out again pitt imagined him having a hot breakfast and a wash and shave and clean clothes he said as much to gower gower rolled his eyes sometimes its a lot easier being the villain he said ruefully i could do very well by bacon eggs sausages fried potatoes then fresh toast and marmalade and a good pot of tea then he grinned sorry i hate to suffer alone youre not pitt responded with feeling well do something like that before we go and send a telegram to narraway then find out who lives in number seven he glanced up at the wall rue stmartin itll be hot coffee and fresh bread gower told him apricot jam if youre lucky nobody understands marmalade except the british dont they understand bacon and eggs pitt asked incredulously omelette maybe it isnt the same pitt said with disappointment nothing is gower agreed i think they do it on purpose after another ten minutes of waiting during which wrexham still did not emerge they walked back along the way they had come they found an excellent cafe from which drifted the tantalising aroma of fresh coffee and warm bread gower gave pitt a questioning look definitely pitt agreed there was as gower had suggested thick homemade apricot jam and unsalted butter there was also a dish of cold ham and other meats and hardboiled eggs pitt was more than satisfied by the time they rose to leave gower had asked the patron for directions to the post office he also enquired as casually as possible where they might find lodgings and if number seven rue stmartin was a house of that description adding that someone had mentioned it pitt waited he could see from the satisfaction in gowers face as they left and strode along the pavement that the answer had pleased him belongs to an englishman called frobisher he said with a smile bit of an odd fellow according to the patron lot of money but eccentric fits the locals idea of what an english upperclass gentleman should be lived here for several years and swears hell never go home give him half a chance and hell tell anyone whats wrong with europe in general and england in particular he gave a slight shrug and his voice was disparaging number seven is definitely not a public lodging house but he has guests more often than not and the patron does not like the look of them subversives he says but then i gathered he is pretty conservative in his opinions he suggested we would find madame germaines establishment far more to our liking and gave me the address he looked extraordinarily pleased with himself in honesty pitt could only agree well send a telegram to narraway then see if madame germaine can accommodate us youve done very well thank you sir gower increased very slightly the spring in his step and even started to whistle a little tune rather well at the post office pitt sent a telegram to narraway staying st malo friends here we would like to know better need funds please send to local post office soonest will write again until they received a reply they would be wise to conserve what money they had left however they would find madame germaine trusting that she had vacancies and would take them in could be a while gower said thoughtfully i hope narraway doesnt expect us to sleep under a hedge wouldnt mind in august but aprils a bit sharp pitt did not bother to reply it was going to be a long and probably boring duty he was thinking of charlotte at home and his children jemima and daniel he missed them but especially charlotte the sound of her voice her laughter the way she looked at him they had been married for fourteen years but every so often he was still overtaken by surprise that she had apparently never regretted it it had cost her her comfortable position in society and the financial security she had been accustomed to as well as the dinner parties the servants the carriages the privileges of rank she had not said so it would be heavyhanded but in return she had gained a life of interest and purpose frequently she had been informally involved in his cases at which she had considerable skill although far less often since he had moved to special branch where so much of the work was secret she had married not for convenience but for love and in dozens of small ways she had left him in no doubt of that dare he send her a telegram as well in this strange french street with its different sounds and smells a language he understood little of he ached for the familiar but the telegram to narraway was to a special address if wrexham were to ask the post office for it it would reveal nothing if pitt allowed his loneliness for home to dictate his actions and communicate with charlotte he would have to give his home address that might be a weakness for which he would pay at the very least in anxiety at most in real fear and perhaps even death he should not let this peaceful street in the april sun and a good breakfast erase from his mind the memory of west lying in the brickyard with his throat slashed open and his blood oozing out onto the stones yes well do that he said aloud to gower then we will do what we can discreetly to learn as much as possible about mr frobisher it was not difficult to observe number seven rue stmartin it was near the towering wall of the city on the seaward side only fifty yards away there was a flight of steps up to the walkway around the top it was a perfect place from which to stand and gaze out to sea at the everchanging horizon or watch the boats tacking across the harbour in the wind their sails billowing careful to avoid the rocks which were picturesque and highly dangerous in turning to talk to each other it was natural for them to lean for a few minutes on one elbow and gaze down at the street and the square one could observe anybody coming or going without seeming to in the afternoon of the first day pitt checked at the post office there was a telegram from narraway and arrangements for sufficient money to last them at least a couple of weeks there was no reference to west or the information he might have given but pitt did not expect there to have been he walked back to the square passing a girl in a pink dress and two women with baskets of shopping he climbed up the steps on the wall again and found gower leaning against the buttress at the top his face was raised to the westering sun which was gold in the late afternoon he seemed to have his eyes shut and be smiling up into the light he looked like any typical young englishman on holiday pitt stared out over the sea watching the light on the water narraway replied he said quietly not looking at gower well get the money the amount hes sending he expects us to learn all we can thought he would gower did not turn either and barely moved his lips he could have been drifting into sleep his weight relaxed against the warm stone theres been some movement while you were gone one man left dark hair very french clothes two went in his voice became a little higher more tightly pitched i recognised one of them pieter linsky im quite sure he has a very distinctive face and a limp from having been shot escaping from an incident in lille i think the man with him was jacob meister but thats only a guess pitt stiffened he knew the names both men were active in socialist movements in europe travelling from one country to another fomenting as much trouble as they could organising demonstrations strikes even riots in the cause of various reforms but underneath all the demands was the underlying wish to overthrow the establishment the backbone that dominated society linsky in particular was unashamedly a revolutionary the remarkable thing was that their ideological differences were so intense it was extraordinary to see them together the whole socialist movement was as passionate and idealistic as a new religion there were the founders who were viewed almost like apostles of the creed dissenters were heretics there were divisions and subdivisions and the rivalries had all the fervour of evangelism they even used these religious terms to speak of them pitt let out his breath in a sigh i suppose youre sure about meister as well gower was motionless still smiling in the sun his chest barely rising and falling as he breathed yes sir absolutely ill bet that has something to do with what west was going to tell us those two together has to mean something pretty big pitt did not argue the more he thought of it the more certain he was that it was indeed the storm narraway had seen coming and which was about to break over europe if they did not prevent it well watch them pitt said quietly also trying to appear as if he were relaxed in the sun enjoying a brief holiday see who else they contact gower smiled well have to be careful what do you think theyre planning pitt considered in silence his eyes almost closed as he stared down at the painted wooden door of number seven all kinds of ideas teemed through his head a single assassination seemed less likely than a general strike or even a series of bombings otherwise a group would not need to gather in the past assassinations had been accomplished by a lone gunman willing to sacrifice his own life but now who was vulnerable whose death would really change anything permanently strikes gower suggested interrupting his thought europewide it could bring an industry to its knees possibly pitt agreed his mind went to the big industrial and shipbuilding cities of the north or the coalminers of durham yorkshire and wales there had been strikes before they were always broken and the men and their families suffered demonstrations gower went on thousands of people all out at once in the right places could block transport or stop some major event like the derby pitt imagined it the anger the frustration of the horseracing and fashionable crowd at such an impertinence he found himself smiling but it was with a sour amusement he had never been part of the society that watched the sport of kings but he had met many of them during his police career he knew their passion their weaknesses their blindness to others and at times their extraordinary courage forcible interruption of one of the great events of the year was not the way to persuade them of anything surely any serious revolutionary had long ago learned that but what was gower moved drawing his attention to the fact that he had not replied meisters style maybe he said aloud but not linskys something far more violent and more effective gower shivered very slightly i wish you hadnt said that it rather takes the edge off the idea of a week or two in the sun eating french food and watching the ladies going about their shopping have you seen the young girl from number sixteen with the red hair to tell you the truth it wasnt her hair i noticed pitt admitted grinning broadly gower laughed outright nor i he said i rather like that apricot jam dont you and the coffee thought id miss a decent cup of tea but i havent yet he was silent again for a few minutes then he turned his head what do you really think they have planned in england sir beyond a show of power what do they want in the long run the sir reminded pitt of his seniority and therefore responsibility it gave him a sharp jolt there were scores of possibilities a few of them serious there had been a considerable rise in political power of leftwing movements in britain recently they were very tame compared with the violence of their european counterparts but that did not mean they would remain that way james keir hardie had stood for parliament in scotland and lost but three years ago he had stood for a workingclass district just outside london and become the independent labour partys first elected member pitt had never met him but charlottes brotherinlaw was a member of parliament and he had said keir hardie was a remarkably decent man just possessed of a few political notions jack did not agree with gower was still staring at pitt waiting his face puzzled and keen i think a concerted effort to bring about change would be more likely pitt said slowly weighing the words as he spoke change gower said quizzically is that a euphemism for overthrowing the government yes perhaps it is pitt agreed realising how afraid he was as he said it an end to hereditary privilege and the power that goes with it dynamiters gowers voice was a whisper the amusement completely vanished another blowing up like the gunpowder plot of the early s i cant see that working pitt replied it would rally everyone against themwe dont like to be pushed theyll need to be a lot cleverer than that gower swallowed hard what then he said quietly something to destroy that power permanently a change so fundamental it cant be undone as he said the words they frightened him something violent and alien waited ahead of them perhaps they were the only ones who could prevent it gower let out his breath in a sigh he looked pale pitt watched his face obliquely as if he were still more absorbed in enjoying the sun thinking of swivelling round to watch the sailing boats in the harbour again they would have to rely on each other totally it was going to be a long tedious job they dare not miss anything the slightest clue could matter they would be cold at night possibly hungry or uncomfortable always tired above all they must not look suspicious he was glad he liked gowers humour his lightness of touchthere were many men in special branch he would have found it much harder to be with thats linsky now coming out of the door gower stiffened and then deliberately forced his body to relax as if this sharpnosed man with the sloping forehead and stringy hair were of no more interest than the baker the postman or another tourist pitt straightened up put his hands in his pockets quite casually going down the steps to the square after him chapter two in the early evening of the day that pitt and gower had followed wrexham to southampton victor narraway was sitting in his office at lisson grove there was a knock on his door and as soon as he answered one of his more junior men came in yes narraway said with a touch of impatience he was waiting for pitt to report on the information from west and he was late narraway had no wish to speak to stoker now stoker closed the door behind him and came to stand in front of narraways desk his lean face with its highbridged nose was unusually serious sir there was a murder in a brickyard off cable road in shadwell in the middle of the day are you sure i care about this stoker narraway interrupted yes sir stoker said without hesitation the victim had his throat cut and the man who did it was caught almost in the act knife still in his hand he was chased by two men who seem to have followed him to limehouse according to the investigation by the local police then narraway interrupted him again impatiently stoker im waiting for information about a major attack of some sort by socialist revolutionaries possibly another spate of dynamitings then suddenly he was chilled to the bone stoker west sir stoker said immediately the man with his throat cut was west it looks as if pitt and gower went after the man who did it at least as far as limehouse probably across the river to the railway station from there they could have gone anywhere in the country theres been no word no telephone call narraway felt the sweat break out on his body it was almost a relief to hear something but where the hell was pitt now why had he not at least placed a telephone call the train could have gone anywhere even on an allnight train to scotland he could have got off at one of the stations on the way and called then another thought occurred to him dover or any of the other seaports folkestone southampton if he were on a ship then calls would be impossible that would explain the silence i see thank you he said aloud sir say nothing to anyone for the time being yes sir thank you thats all after stoker had gone narraway sat still for several minutes to have lost west with whatever information he had was serious there had been increased activity lately known troublemakers coming and going more often than usual a charge of expectancy in the air he knew all the signs he just did not know what the target was this time there were so many possibilities specific assassination such as a government minister an industrialist a foreign dignitary on british soil that would be a serious embarrassment or the dynamiting of a major landmark he had relied on pitt to find out perhaps he still might but without west it would be more difficult and of course it was not the only issue at hand there were always whispers threats the air breathed suspicion and betrayal all the time it was the purpose of special branch to detect it before it happened and prevent at least the worst of it but if pitt had gone to some distant part of the country after the murderer of west or worse still across the channel and had had no time to tell narraway then certainly he would not have had time to tell his wife either charlotte would be at home in keppel street waiting for him expecting him and growing more and more afraid with each passing hour as the silence closed in on her narraway glanced at the longcase clock standing against the wall of his office its ornate hands pointed at quarter to seven on a usual day pitt would have gone home already but she might not begin to be anxious for another hour or two he thought of her in the kitchen preparing the evening meal probably alone her children would be occupied with studies for the following days school he could picture her easily in fact the picture was already there in his mind unbidden beauty was very much a personal thing a matter of taste the ability to see beyond the obvious into some element of the passions or dreams where the essence of a person was hidden some would not have found charlotte beautiful they might have preferred a face more traditional daintier less challenging narraway found such faces boring there was a warmth in charlotte a laughter he could never quite forget and he had tried she was quick to anger at times far too quick to react many of her judgements were flawed in his opinion but never her courage never her will someone must tell her that pitt had gone in hot pursuit of wests murderer no better leave out the fact that west had been murdered pitt had gone in hot pursuit of a man with vital information possibly across the channel and been unable to telephone her to let her know he could call stoker back and send him but she did not know him she did not know anyone else at lisson grove headquarters it would be the courteous thing to tell her himself it would not be far out of his way well yes it would but it would still be the better thing to do pitt for all his initial ignorance of special branch ways and his occasional political naivety was one of the best men narraway had ever known there was an honesty in him that was exasperating at times reflecting his origins as a gamekeepers son he had been educated in the household of the manor side by side with the masters son but never his social equal it had produced a man by nature a gentleman and yet with an anger and a compassion narraway admired he found himself puzzlingly protective of pitt against the envy of those who had preceded him in special branch but whom he had overtaken in skill narroway tidied his desk locked away anything that might be confidential left his office and caught a hansom within minutes he gave the driver pitts address in keppel street narraway saw the fear in charlottes eyes as soon as she opened the door to him he would never have called merely socially and she knew that the strength of her emotion gave him a startling twinge of envy it was a long time since there had been anyone who would have felt that terror for him im sorry to disturb you he said with rather stiff formality events did not go according to plan today and pitt and his assistant were obliged to pursue a suspected conspirator without the opportunity to inform anyone of what was happening the anxiety eased out of her eyes warmth coming back flushing the soft honey colour of her skin where is he she asked he decided to sound more certain than he was wests murderer might have fled even as far as scotland but france was far more likely france he replied of course he could not telephone from the ferry and he would not have dared leave in case the man got off as well and he lost him im sorry she smiled it was very thoughtful of you to have come to tell me i admit i was beginning to be concerned the april evening was cold a sharp wind carrying the smell of rain narraway was standing on the doorstep staring at the light beyond feeling the warmth he stepped back deliberately his thoughts the temptation the quickening of his heart frightening him there is no need he said hastily gower is with him an excellent man intelligent and quite fluent in french and i dare say it will be warmer there than it is here he smiled and the food is excellent she had been preparing dinner that was clumsy thank goodness he was far enough into the darkness that she could not see the blush rise up his face it would be absurd to try to repair his clumsiness it would be better to ignore it i will let you know as soon as i hear from him if this man they are following goes to paris it may not be easy for them to be in contact but please dont fear for him thank you i wont now he knew that was a polite lie of course she would fear for pitt and miss him loving always included the possibility of loss but the emptiness of not loving was even greater he nodded very slightly just an inclination of his head then wished her good night he walked away feeling as if he were leaving the light behind him it was the middle of the following morning when narraway received the telegram from pitt in st malo he immediately forwarded him sufficient money to last both himself and gower for at least two weeks he thought about it as soon as it had been sent and knew he had been overgenerous perhaps that was an indication of the relief he felt to know pitt was safe he realised with surprise the effort it had cost him not to allow the fear into his mind he would have to go back to keppel street to tell charlotte that pitt had been in touch he had returned to his desk after lunch when charles austwick came in and closed the door behind him he was officially narraways nextincommand although in practical terms it had come to be pitt austwick was in his late forties with fair hair which was receding a little and a goodlooking but curiously unremarkable face he was intelligent and efficient and he seemed to be always in control of whatever feelings he might have now he looked very directly at narraway deliberately so as if he were uncomfortable and attempting not to show it an ugly situation has arisen sir he said sitting down before he was invited to im sorry but i have no choice but to address it then do so narraway said a little hastily dont creep around it like a maiden aunt at a wedding what is it austwicks face tightened his lips making a thin line this has to do with informers austwick said coldly do you remember mulhare narraway saw from the gleam of oblique satisfaction in austwicks pale eyes that it was something to do with narraway himself and in which he was vulnerable he recognised the name with a rush of sadness mulhare had been an irishman who risked his life to do what he thought was the right thing in giving information to the english it was dangerous enough that he would have to leave ireland taking his family with him narraway had made sure there were funds provided for him of course i do he said quietly have they found who killed him not that itll do much good now he knew his voice sounded bitter he had liked mulhare and had promised him that hed be safe that is something of a difficult question austwick replied he never got the money so he couldnt leave ireland yes he did narraway contradicted him i dealt with it myself thats rather the point austwick said he moved position slightly scuffing the chair leg on the carpet narraway resented being reminded of his failure if you dont know who killed him why are you spending time on that now instead of current things he asked abruptly if you have nothing to do i can certainly find you something pitt and gower are away for a while somebodyll have to pick up pitts case on the docks oh really austwick barely masked his surprise i didnt know no one mentioned it narraway gave him a chill look and ignored the implied rebuke austwick drew in his breath as i said he resumed this is something that i regret we have to deal with mulhare was betrayed we know that for gods sake narraway could hear his own voice thick with emotion his corpse was fished out of dublin bay he never got the money austwick said again narraway clenched his hands under the desk out of austwicks sight i paid it myself he had done but indirectly for good reasons which he would not tell austwick but mulhare never received it austwick replied his voice conflicted with a mixture of emotions we traced it narraway was startled to whom where is it it is in one of your bank accounts here in london austwick answered narraway froze suddenly with appalling clarity he knew what austwick was doing here and held at least a hazy idea of what had happened austwick suspected or even believed that narraway had taken the money and intentionally left mulhare to be caught and killed was that how little he knew him or was it more a measure of his longsimmering resentment his ambition to take narraways place and wield the razoredged power that he now held went in and out again he said aloud to austwick we had to move it around a little or it would have been too easily traceable to special branch oh yes austwick agreed bleakly around to several places but the trouble is that in the end it went back again back again it went to mulhare narraway corrected him no sir it did not go to mulhare it went back into one of your special accounts one that we had believed closed austwick said it is there now if mulhare had received it he would have left dublin and he would still be alive the money went around to several places making it almost untraceable as you say but it ended up right back where it started with you narraway drew in his breath to deny it and saw in austwicks face that it would be pointless whoever had put it there austwick believed it was narraway himself or he chose to pretend he believed it i did not put it there narraway said though he thought it would not change anything the betrayal of mulhare was repugnant to him and betrayal was not a word he used easily i paid it to terence kelly he was supposed to have paid it to mulhare that was his job for obvious reasons i could not give it directly to mulhare or i might as well have painted a bullseye on his heart can you prove that sir austwick asked politely of course i cant narraway snapped was austwick being deliberately obtuse he knew as well as narraway himself that one did not leave trails to prove such things what he would be able to prove now to justify himself anyone else could have used to damn mulhare you see it calls into question the whole subject of your judgement austwick said half apologetically his bland face grave it would be highly advisable sir for you to find some proof of this then the matter could be let go narraways mind raced he knew what was in his bank accounts both personal and for special branch use austwick had mentioned one that had been presumed closed no money had passed through it for some time but narraway had deliberately left a few pounds in it in case he ever wished to use it again it was a convenience ill check the account he said aloud his voice cold that would be a good idea sir austwick agreed perhaps you will be able to find some proof as to why the money came back to you and a reason poor mulhare never received it narraway realised with the first chill of fear that this was not an invitation it was a comparatively lowkey warning to him but it was in earnest it was even possible that his position at special branch was in jeopardy certainly he had created enemies over the years both in his rise to leadership and even more so in the time since then there were always hard decisions to make whatever you did could not please everyone there had to be sacrifices both of ideals and of people they were dealing with lives the movements and the tides of history there was no room for sentimentality he had employed pitt as a favour when pitt had challenged his own superiors and been thrown out of the metropolitan police to begin with he had found pitt unsatisfactory he lacked the training or the inclination for special branch work but he had learned quickly and he was a remarkably good detective persistent imaginative and with a moral courage narraway admired and he liked the man in spite of his own resolution not to allow personal feelings into anything professional he had protected pitt from the envy and the criticism of others in the branch that was partly because pitt was more than worthy of the place but also to defend narraways own judgement but he admitted it nowit was also for charlottes sake without pitt he would have no excuse to see her again ill attend to it he answered austwick at last as soon as i have a few more answers on this present problem one of our informants was murdered which has made things more difficult austwick rose to his feet yes sir that would be a good idea i think the sooner you put peoples minds at rest on the issue the better it will be i suggest before the end of this week when circumstances allow narraway replied coolly circumstances did not allow early the following morning narraway was sent for to report to the home office directly to sir gerald croxdale his political superior the one man to whom he was obliged to answer without reservation croxdale was in his early fifties a quiet persistent politician who had risen in the ranks of the government with remarkable swiftness not having made great speeches or initiated new laws nor apparently having used the benefit of patronage from any of the more noted ministers croxdale seemed to be his own man whatever debts he collected or favours he owed were too discreet for even narraway to know of let alone the general public he had made no individual initiatives that were remarkable but probably far more important he had made no visible mistakes insiders spoke his name with respect narraway had never seen in him the passion that marked an ambitious man but he had noted the quick rise to greater power and it earned in him a deeper if reluctant respect morning narraway croxdale said with an easy smile as he waved him to a brown leather armchair in his large office croxdale was a big man tall and solid his face was far from handsome in any traditional sense but he was imposing his voice was soft his smile benign today he was wearing his usual wellcut but unostentatious suit and perfectly polished black leather boots he could have been the second son of any of the great families in the country narraway returned the greeting and sat down not comfortably but a little forward listening bad business about your informant west being killed croxdale began i presume he was going to tell you a great deal more about whatever it was that is building up among the militant socialists yes sir narraway said bleakly pitt and gower were only seconds too late they saw west but he was already terrified of something and took to his heels they caught up with him in a brickyard in shadwell only moments after he was killed the murderer was still bending over him he could feel the heat of the blood in his cheeks as he said it it was partly anger at having been so close and yet infinitely far from preventing the death one minute sooner and west would have been alive and all his information would be theirs it was also a sense of failure as if losing him were an incompetence on the part of his men and so of himself deliberately he met croxdales eyes refusing to look away he never made excuses explicit or implicit croxdale smiled leaning back and crossing his long legs unfortunate but luck cannot always be on our side it is the measure of your men that they kept track of the assassin what is the news now ive had a couple of telegrams from pitt in st malo narraway answered wrexham the killer seems to have more or less gone to ground in the house of a british expatriate there the interesting thing is that he has seen other socialist activists of note who croxdale asked pieter linsky and jacob meister narraway replied croxdale stiffened straightening up a little his face keen with interest really then perhaps not all is lost he lowered his voice tell me narraway do you still believe there is some major action planned yes narraway said without hesitation i think wests murder removes any doubt he would have told us what it was and probably who else was involved damn well you must keep pitt there and the other chap whats his name gower yes gower too give them all the funds they need ill see to it that that meets no opposition of course narraway said with some surprise he had always had complete authority to disburse the funds in his care as he saw fit croxdale pursed his lips and leaned further forward it is not quite so simple narraway he said gravely we have been looking into the matter of past funds and their use in connection with other cases as i dare say you know he interlaced his fingers and looked down at them a moment then up again quickly mulhares death has raised some ugly questions which im afraid have to be answered narraway was surprised he had not realised it had already gone as far as croxdale and before he had even had a chance to look into it more deeply and prove his own innocence was that austwicks doing again damn the man they will be he said now to croxdale i kept certain movements of the funds secret to protect mulhare his enemies would have killed him instantly if theyd known he received english money isnt that rather what happened croxdale asked ruefully narraway thought for a moment of denying it special branch knew who had killed mulhare but it was only proof they lacked the deduction was certain in his own mind but he did not need another moral evasion his life was too full of shadows he would not allow croxdale to provoke him into another yes we failed him narraway croxdale said sadly yes how did that happen croxdale pressed he was betrayed by whom i dont know when this socialist threat is dealt with i shall find out if i can if you can croxdale said gently do you doubt it you have no idea who it was here in london no i havent but you used the word betrayed croxdale persisted i think advisedly so does that not concern you urgently narraway whom can you trust in any irish issue of which god knows there are more than enough the european socialist revolutionaries are our most urgent concern now sir narraway also leaned forward there is a high degree of violence threatened men like linsky meister la pointe corazath are all quick to use guns and dynamite their philosophy is that a few deaths are the price they have to pay for the greater freedom and equality of the people as long of course as the deaths are not their own he added drily does that take precedence over treachery within your own people croxdale asked with quiet tense amazement he left it hanging in the air between them a question that demanded answering narraway had seen the death of mulhare as tragic but less urgent than the threat of revolution he knew how he had guarded the provenance of the money knowing those of whom mulhare was afraid he did not know how someone had made the funds return to narraways own personal account above all he did not know who was responsible or whether it was incompetence or deliberately done in order to make him look a thief im not yet certain it was betrayal sir perhaps i used the word hastily he kept his voice as level as he could still he heard a certain roughness to it he hoped croxdales less sensitive ear did not catch it croxdale was staring at him as opposed to what incompetence narraway replied we covered the tracks of the transfers very carefully so no one in ireland would be able to trace the money back to us we made it seem like legitimate purchases all the way or at least you thought so croxdale amended but mulhare was still killed where is the money now narraway had hoped to avoid telling him but perhaps it had always been inevitable that croxdale would have to know maybe he did and this was a trap austwick told me it was back in an account i have ceased using he replied i dont know who moved it but i shall find out croxdale was silent for several moments yes please do and with indisputable proof of course quickly narraway we need your skills on this wretched socialist business it seems the threat is real ill look into the money as soon as we have learned what wests killers are planning and prevented it narraway answered with a chill inside him with a little luck well even catch some of them and be able to put them away croxdale looked up his eyes bright and sharp suddenly he was no longer an amiable rather bearlike man but tigerish the passion in him like a coiled spring only masked by a superficial ease do you imagine that the sacrifice of a few martyrs to the cause will stop anything narraway if so im disappointed in you idealists thrive on sacrifice the more public and the more dramatic the better i know that narraway was stung by the misjudgement i have no intention of giving them martyrs indeed i have no intention of denying them social reform and a good deal of change but in pace with the will of the majority of the people in the country not ahead of it and not forced on them by a few fanatics weve always changed but slowly look at the history of the revolutions of fortyeight we were about the only major country in europe who didnt have an uprising and by where were all the idealists from the barricades where were all the new freedoms so bloodily won every damn one of them gone and all the old regimes back in power croxdale was looking at him intensely his expression unreadable we had no uprising narraway went on his voice dropping a level but the heat of feeling still there no deaths no grand speeches just quiet progress a step at a time boring perhaps unheroic but also bloodless and more to the point sustainable we arent back under the old tyrannies as governments go ours is not bad thank you croxdale said drily narraway gave one of his rare beautiful smiles my pleasure sir croxdale sighed i wish it were so simple im sorry narraway but you will solve this miserable business of the money that should have gone to mulhare immediately austwick will take over the socialist affair until you have it dealt with which includes unarguable proof that someone else placed it in your account and you were unaware of it until austwick told you it will also include the name of whoever is responsible for this because they have jeopardised the effectiveness of one of the best heads of special branch that we have had in the last quartercentury and that is treason against the country and against the queen for a moment narraway did not grasp what croxdale was saying he sat motionless in the chair his hands cold gripping the arms as if to keep his balance he drew in his breath to protest and saw in croxdales face that it would be pointless the decision was made and final the trap had him like an iron gin on an animals leg and he had not even seen himself step into it im sorry narraway croxdale said quietly you no longer have the confidence of her majestys government or of her majesty herself i have no alternative but to remove you from office until such time as you can prove your innocence i appreciate that that will be more difficult for you without access to your office or the papers that are in it but you will appreciate the irony of my position if you have access to the papers you also have the power to alter them destroy them or add to them narraway was stunned it was as if he had been dealt a physical blow suddenly he could barely breathe it was preposterous he was head of special branch and here was this government minister telling him he was dismissed with no warning no preparation just his decision a word and it was all over im sorry croxdale repeated this is a somewhat unfortunate way of having to deal with it but it cant be helped you will not go back to lisson grove of course what the word slipped out leaving narraway more vulnerable than he had intended and he was furious with himself but it was too late there was not even any way to conceal it without making it worse you cannot go back to your office croxdale said patiently dont oblige me to make an issue of it narraway rose to his feet horrified to find that he was a trifle unsteady as if he had been drinking he wanted to think of something dignified to say and above all to make absolutely certain that his voice was level completely without emotion he drew in his breath and let it out slowly i will find out who betrayed mulhare he said a little hoarsely and also who betrayed me he thought of adding something about keeping this as a special branch fit to come back to but it sounded so pettish he let it go good day outside in the street everything looked just as it had when he went in a hansom cab drawn up at the kerb half a dozen men here and there dressed in striped trousers he started to walk without any very clear idea of where he intended to go his lack of direction was immediate but he thought with a sense of utter emptiness that perhaps it was eternal as well he was fiftyeight half an hour ago he had been one of the most powerful men in britain even though very few people knew it he was trusted absolutely he held other mens lives in his hands he knew the nations secrets the safety of ordinary men and women depended on his skill his judgement now he was a man without a purpose without an income although that was not an immediate concern the land inherited from his father supported him not perhaps in luxury but at least adequately he had no family alive now and he realised with a gathering sense of isolation that he had acquaintances but no close friends his profession had made it impossible during the years of his increasing power too many secrets too much need for caution it would be pathetic and pointless to indulge in selfpity if he sank to that what better would he deserve he must fight back someone had done this to him it made sense only if it were deliberate and regrettably he could think of a score of people who might be responsible and a score of reasons the only person he would have trusted to help was pitt and pitt was in france chasing socialist reformers with violence in their dreams he was walking quickly up whitehall looking neither right nor left probably passing people he knew and ignoring them no one would care in time to come when it was known he was no longer in power they would probably be relieved he was not a comfortable man to be with even the most innocent tended to attribute ulterior motives to him imagine secrets that did not exist whitehall became parliament street then he turned left and continued walking until he was on westminster bridge staring eastward across the windruffled water he could not even return to his office to look through the piles of papers he had and begin to search for anomalies figures that did not add up anything that would tell him where to look for the enemy who for reasons of greed hatred or divided loyalties had betrayed mulhare and in doing that betrayed narraway also then another thought that was far uglier occurred to him was mulhare the one who was incidental damage and narraway himself the target of the treachery as that thought took sharper focus in his mind he wondered bitterly if he really wanted to know the answer who was it that he had trusted and been so horribly mistaken in he was letting himself hate and there was no time for such selfindulgence anger a small amount of it was good it fired the energy to fight back to deny discouragement weariness even the awful void of being alone he turned and walked on over the bridge to the far side and took a hansom giving the driver his home address when he reached his house he poured himself a quick shot of single malt whisky his favourite macallans then he went to the safe and took out the few papers he had kept here referring to the mulhare case he read them from beginning to end and learned nothing he did not already know except that the money for mulhare had been returned to the account within two weeks he had not known because he had assumed the account dormant there was no notification from the bank it was close to midnight and he was still sitting staring at the far wall without seeing it when there was a sharp double tap on the window of the french doors opening onto the garden it was a rhythm that only a persons knuckles could make it startled him out of his reverie and he froze for an instant then got to his feet the speed with which he did it moving away from the glass and the light made him realise how tense he was the tap came again and he looked at the shadow outside he could just see the features of a mans face beyond unmoving as if he wished to be recognised narraway thought for a moment of pitt but he knew it was not he he was in france and this man was not as tall he must concentrate think he had allowed this blow to stun him in a single act they had removed from him almost all that mattered to him his purpose his value in other peoples eyes and perhaps in his own as well and also a great deal of his pleasure the man at the window was stoker he should have known that straight away it was ridiculous to be standing here in the shadows as if he were afraid he went forward and unlocked the french doors and opened them wide stoker came in holding a bundle of papers in a large envelope half hidden under his jacket his hair was damp from the slight drizzle outside as if he had walked some distance narraway hoped he had and taken more than one cab to make following or tracing him difficult what are you doing here stoker he said quietly for the first time this evening drawing the curtains closed it had not mattered before and he liked the presence of the garden at twilight the birds the fading of the sky the occasional movement of leaves brought some papers that might be useful sir stoker replied his voice and his eyes were perfectly steady but there was a tension in his body in the way he held his hands that betrayed to narraway that he knew perfectly well the risk he was taking narraway took the papers from him and glanced down at them riffling through the pages swiftly to see what they were then he felt the breath tighten in his chest and his own fingers clumsy they referred to an old case in ireland twenty years ago the memory of it was powerful for many reasons and he was surprised how very sharply it returned it was as if he had last seen the people only a few days ago he could remember the smell of the peat fire in the room where he and kate had talked long into the night about the planned uprising he could almost bring back the words he had used to persuade her it could only fail and bring more death and more bitterness with it he could bring back with exactness that still hurt the look in her eyes the lamplight on her skin the sound of her voice when she spoke his name and the guilt even with his eyes open in his mind he could see cormac oneils fury and then his grief he understood it they all had reason to hate narraway but for all its vividness it had been twenty years ago he looked up at stoker why these he asked this case is old its finished the irish troubles are never finished stoker said simply our more urgent problem is here now narraway replied and possibly in europe socialists stoker said drily theyre always grumbling on its a lot more than that narraway told him theyre fanatic its the new religion with all the fire and evangelism of a holy cause and just like christianity in its infancy it has its apostles and its dogma and its splinter groups quarrels over what is the true faith stoker looked puzzled as if this were all true but irrelevant the point is narraway said sharply they each consider the others to be heretics they fight each other as much as they fight anyone else thank god stoker said with feeling so when we see disciples of different factions meeting each other in secret working together then we know that it is something damned big that has healed the rifts temporarily narraway heard the edge in his own voice and saw the sudden understanding in stokers eyes stoker let out his breath slowly how close are we to knowing what theyre planning sir i dont know narraway admitted it all rests on pitt now and you stoker said softly weve got to sort this money thing out sir and get you back narraway drew in his breath to answer and felt a sudden wave of conviction so profound a helplessness a loss an awareness of fear that no words were adequate stoker held out the papers he had brought we cant afford to wait he said urgently i looked through everything i could that had to do with informants money and ireland trying to work out whos behind this this case seemed the most likely also im pretty sure someone else has had this out lately why just the way it was put back stoker answered untidy no the opposite very neat indeed now narraway was afraid for stoker he would lose his job for this in fact if he were caught he could even be charged with treason himself all sorts of possibilities raced through his head including that of a deliberate trap even if it were he wanted to read the pages but not with stoker present if this were the act of personal loyalty it seemed or even loyalty to the truth he did not want stoker to take such a risk it would be better for both of them for him not to be caught where did you get them he asked stoker looked at him with a very slight smile better you dont know sir narraway smiled back then i cant tell he agreed wryly stoker nodded that too sir there was something about stoker calling him sir that was stupidly pleasing as if he were still who he had been this morning did he value the respect so much how pathetic he swallowed hard and drew in his breath leave them with me go home where everyone expects you to be come back for them when its safe sorry sir but they have to be back by dawn stoker replied in fact the sooner the better it will take me all night to read these and make my own notes narraway argued but he knew as he said it that stoker was right to have them absent from lisson grove even for one day was too dangerous then they could never be returned anyone with two wits to rub together would look to narraway for them and then to whoever had brought them to him he had no right to jeopardise stokers life with such stupidity it was poor thanks for his loyalty if that was what it was perhaps it wasnt he might have his own entirely different reasons but narraway clung to the thought that it was loyalty he needed it to be that and a belief in the truth ill have them read before dawn he promised three oclock you can return then and ill give them to you you can be at the grove before light and away again or you can go and sleep in my spare room if you prefer it would be wiser no chance then of being caught in the street stoker did not move ill stay here sir im pretty good at not being seen but no risk at all is better wouldnt do if i couldnt get back narraway nodded so stoker understood the risk he was taking perhaps it was as well never underestimate the enemy he himself was only just beginning to taste the power of this one up the stairs across the landing to the left he said aloud help yourself to anything you need stoker thanked him and left closing the door softly narraway turned up the gas a little more brightly then sat down in the big armchair by the fireplace and began to read the first few pages were about the mulhare case the fact that a large sum of money had been promised mulhare if he cooperated it was paid not as reward so much as a means for him to leave ireland and go not as might be expected to america but to southern france a less likely place for his enemies to seek him mulhare had not received the money according to austwick instead he had remained in ireland and been killed narraway still did not know exactly what had gone wrong he had paid the money out at least he had completed all the paperwork to have it paid and had checked that it had gone then it now seemed inexplicably it had reappeared someone had evidently intervened so that the end result had been the exact opposite from what narraway had instructed and mulhare had been murdered in the very way hed feared the papers also referred to a twentyyearold case that he would like to have forgotten it was at a time when the passion and the violence were even higher than usual charles stewart parnell had just been elected to parliament he was a man of fire and eloquence a highly active member in the council of the irish home rule league and everything in his life was dedicated to that cause there was a sudden resurgence of hope that ireland might at last throw off the yoke of domination and govern itself again the horrors of the great potato famine could be put behind them freedom beckoned of course was before narraway had become head of special branch he was simply an agent in the field at that time in his midthirties wiry strong quickthinking and with a considerable charm with his black hair and almost black eyes his dry wit he could easily have passed for an irishman himself when that assumption was made as it was he did not deny it one of the leaders of the irish cause then had been a man called cormac oneil he had a dark brooding nature like an autumn landscape full of sudden shadows storms on the horizon he loved history especially that handed down by word of mouth or immortalised in old songs he knew half of it was probably invented but he believed in the emotional truths the remembered grief he was a man built to yearn for what he could not have narraway thought of that wryly remembering still with regret and guilt cormacs brother sean and more vividly kate beautiful kate so fiercely alive so brave so quick to see reason so blind to the wounded and dangerous emotions of others in the silence of this comfortable london room with its very english mementoes ireland seemed like the other side of the world kate was dead so was sean narraway had won and their planned uprising had failed without bloodshed on either side there had been nothing spectacular just a quiet fading cold as a winter dusk that was narraways victory nobody even knew it had happened even charles stewart parnell was dead now too just three and a half years ago october of a heart attack but it was his wild disastrous affair with mrs oshea that had brought about his fall and home rule for ireland was still only a dream and the anger remained narraway shivered here in his warm familiar sitting room with the last of the embers still glowing the pictures of trees on the wall and the gaslamp shedding a golden light around him the chill was inside beyond the reach of any physical ease perhaps of any words either any thoughts or regrets now was cormac oneil still alive there was no reason why he should not be he would barely be sixty perhaps less if he were he could be the one behind this god knew after the failed uprising and sean and kates deaths he had cause enough to hate narraway more than any other man on earth but why wait twenty years to do it narraway could have died of accident or natural causes any time between then and now and robbed cormac of his revenge could something have prevented him in the meantime a debilitating illness not twenty years long time in prison surely narraway would have heard of anything serious enough for a term so long and even from prison there was communication perhaps this case had nothing to do with the past or could it be that cormac really understood that narraway was only fighting for his own country his own beliefs as they all were and this vengeance was not personal so much as against england perhaps this was the time when special branch would be most vulnerable if narraway were taken from it and his work discredited the present stakes for cormac might be incidental only an exquisite touch that added to the flavour perhaps it had to do with the socialist revolution planned by the european anarchist reformers who would sweep away the old order with its corruption and inequality the only way they believed would work with violence he closed the papers and put them back in the envelope stoker had brought then sat quietly in the dark and thought about it the old memories returned easily to his mind he was walking again with kate in the autumn stillness fallen leaves red and yellow frozen and crunching under their feet she had no gloves and he had lent her his he could feel his hands ache with the cold at the memory she had laughed at him for it smiling eyes bright all the while making bitter jokes about warming the hands of ireland with english wool when they had returned to the tavern sean and cormac had been there and they had drunk rye whiskey by the fire he could recall the smell of the peat and kate saying it was a good thing he didnt want vodka because potatoes were too scarce to waste on making it he had not replied even thirty years on the ruin of the famine still scarred the land nothing he could say would heal it or excuse it there were other memories as well all sharp with emotion torn loyalties and regret wasnt it wellington who had said that there was nothing worse than a battle won except a battle lost or something like that was the record accurate as far as he had told anyone sanitised of course robbed of its passion and its humanity but the elements that mattered to special branch were correct and sufficient then something occurred to him maybe an anomaly he stood up turned the gaslight higher again and took the papers back out of the envelope he reread them from beginning to end including the marginal notes from buckleigh his superior then he had not studied them the first time he read it because he knew exactly what they said and had no desire to be reminded his own lies had been believed too easily even if they were largely lies of omission but then the operation had been on buckleighs orders so he had to accept it morally he was also to blame narraway found what he feared something had been added it was only a word or two and to anyone who did not know buckleighs turn of phrase his pedantic grammar it would be undetectable the hand looked exactly the same but the new words added altered the meaning only slightly but enough to cast doubt on buckleighs acceptance of narraways account once it was only the addition of a question mark that had not been there originally another time it was a few words that were not grammatically exact a phrase ending with a preposition buckleigh would have included it into the main sentence who had done that and when the why was not obscure to him at all it was to raise the question of his role in this again to cause the old ghosts to be awakened perhaps this was the deciding factor that had forced croxdale to remove him from office doubts were enough if they were sufficiently serious one did not wait for proof that might never come he read through the papers one more time just to be certain then replaced them in the envelope and went upstairs to waken stoker so he could leave well before dawn narraway knocked on the spareroom door and heard stokers voice answer him by the time he had opened the door stoker was standing beside the bed in the light from the landing it was clear that the quilt was barely ruffled one swift movement of the hand and it was as if he had never been there stoker looked at narraway questioningly thank you narraway said quietly the emotion in his voice more naked than he had meant it to be it told you something stoker observed several things narraway admitted someone else has been judiciously editing the account since buckleigh wrote his marginal notes altering the meaning very slightly but enough to make a difference stoker came out of the room and narraway handed him the envelope stoker put it under his jacket where it could not be seen but he did not fold it or tuck it into his belt so the edges could be damaged it was a reminder of the risk he was taking in having it at all he looked very directly at narraway austwick has taken your place sir already yes sir mr pitts over the channel youve no friends at lisson grove any more at least not wholl risk anything for you its every man for himself stoker said grimly im afraid theres no one for sure wholl help mr pitt either if he gets cut off or in any kind of trouble i know that narraway said with deep unhappiness over the fact that he could no longer protect pitt also from the envy or distrust of those who were part of the establishment before narraway took him on stoker hesitated as if he would say something else then changed his mind he nodded silently and went down the stairs to the sitting room he felt his way across the floor without lighting the gaslamps he opened the french doors and slipped out into the wind and the darkness narraway locked the door behind him and went back upstairs he undressed and went to bed but lay awake staring up at the ceiling he had left the curtains open and gradually the faintest softening of the spring night made a break in the shadows across the ceiling the glimmer was almost invisible just enough to tell him there was movement light beyond only a matter of hours had passed since austwick had come into narraways office narraway had thought little enough of it a nuisance no more then croxdale had sent for him and everything had changed it was like going down a steep flight of stairs and finding the last step was not there you were plunged into a void arms flailing and there was nothing at all to catch on to he lay until daylight realising with a pain that amazed him how much of himself he had lost he was used to getting up whether he had slept or not duty was a relentless mistress but suddenly he knew also that she was a constant companion loyal appreciative above all never meaningless without her he was naked even to himself let alone to others he was accustomed to being not particularly liked he had had too much power for that and he knew too many secrets but he had never before not been needed chapter three charlotte sat by the fire in the parlour alone her armchair opposite pitts it was early evening the children were in bed there was no sound except now and then the settling of ashes as the wood burned through occasionally she picked up a piece of the mending that was waiting to be done a couple of pillowcases a pinafore of jemimas more often she simply stared at the fire she missed pitt but she understood the necessity of his having pursued whoever it was to france she also missed gracie the maid who had lived with them since she was thirteen and now in her twenties had finally married the police sergeant who had courted her so diligently for years charlotte took up the pinafore and began stitching the hem where it had fallen doing it almost as much by feel as by sight the needle clicked with a light quick sound against her thimble jemima was thirteen and growing tall very quickly one could see the young woman in her that she would shortly become daniel was nearly three years younger and desperate to catch up charlotte smiled as she thought of gracie so proud in her white wedding gown walking down the aisle on pitts arm as he gave her away tellman had been desperately nervous waiting at the altar then so happy he couldnt control the smile on his face he must have thought that day would never come but charlotte missed gracies cheerfulness her optimism her total candour and her courage gracie never admitted to being beaten in anything her replacement mrs waterman was middleaged and dour as a walk in the sleet she was a decent woman honest as the day kept everything immaculately clean but she seemed to be content only if she was miserable perhaps in time she would gain confidence and feel better it was sincerely to be hoped charlotte did not hear the doorbell ring and was startled when mrs waterman knocked on the parlour door the older woman immediately came in her face pinched with displeasure theres a gentleman called maam shall i tell him that mr pitt is not at home charlotte was startled and her first thought was to agree to the polite fiction then her curiosity intruded surely at this hour it must be someone she knew who is it mrs waterman a very dark gentleman maam says his name is narraway mrs waterman replied lowering her voice although charlotte could not tell if it were in disgust or confidentiality she thought the former show him in she said quickly putting the mending out of sight on a chair behind the couch without thinking she straightened her skirt and made sure she had no badly straying hair poking out of her rather loose coiffure her hair which was a rich dark mahogany colour slithered very easily out of control as the pins dug into her head during the day she was apt to remove them with predictable results mrs waterman hesitated show him in please charlotte repeated a trifle more briskly ill be in the kitchen if you need me mrs waterman said with a slight twist of her mouth that was definitely not a smile she withdrew and a moment later narraway came in when charlotte had seen him two days ago he had looked tired and a little concerned but that was not unusual this evening he was haggard his lean face holloweyed his skin almost without colour charlotte felt a terrible fear paralyse her robbing her of breath he had come to tell her terrible news of pitt even in her own mind she could not think the words im sorry to disturb you so late he said his voice was almost normal but she heard in its slight tremor the effort that it cost him he stood in front of her his eyes were so dark they were black in the lamplight but curiously she could read the expression in them perfectly he was hurt and there was an emptiness inside him that had not been there two days ago he must have read her fear how could he not it filled the room he smiled thinly i have not heard from thomas again but there is no reason to believe he is other than in excellent health and probably having better weather than we have he said gently although i dare say he finds it tedious hanging about the streets watching people while trying to look as if he is on holiday she swallowed her mouth dry relief making her dizzy then what is it a ghost of amusement lit his eyes for an instant then vanished oh dear am i so obvious it was more candid than he had ever been with her before almost as if they knew each other well she was surprised and yet it did not feel unnatural yes she admitted im afraid you look dreadful can i get you something tea or whisky that is if we have any now that ive offered it im not sure that we do the best of it might have gone at gracies wedding oh yes gracie this time he did smile and there was real warmth in it changing his face i shall miss seeing her here she was magnificent all five foot of her four foot eleven if we are honest charlotte corrected him with answering warmth believe me you could not possibly miss her as much as i do i hear intense feeling in your voice he remarked moving to stand a little closer to the fire although the evening was not cold you do not care for mrs lemon waterman she corrected him but lemon would suit her i dont think she approves of me perhaps we shall become accustomed to one another one day she does cook well and you could eat off the floors when she has scrubbed them thank you but the table will do well enough narraway observed she sat down on the sofa standing so close to him in front of the fire was becoming uncomfortable you did not come to enquire after my domestic arrangements and even if you had known mrs waterman she is not sufficient to cause the gravity i see in your face what has happened she was holding her hands in her lap and realised that she was gripping them together hard enough to hurt she forced herself to let go there was a moment or two with no sound in the room but the flickering of the fire as if he had not framed in his mind what he meant to say she waited the anxiety growing inside her again her fingers finding each other and locking he drew in his breath then changed his mind he looked away from her into the heart of the fire i have been relieved of my position in special branch they say that it is temporary but they will make it permanent if they can he swallowed as if his throat hurt and turned his head to look at her the thing concerning you is that i have no more access to my office at lisson grove or any of the papers that are there i will no longer know what is happening in france or anywhere else my place has been taken by charles austwick who neither likes nor trusts pitt the former is a matter of jealousy because pitt was recruited after him and has received preferment in fact if not in rank which has more than equalled his the latter is because they have little in common austwick comes from the army pitt from the police pitt has instincts austwick will never understand and pitts untidiness irritates his orderly military soul he sighed and of course pitt is my protege was how can one believe and disbelieve something at the same moment charlotte was stunned so her brain did not absorb what narraway had said and yet looking at his face she could not doubt it she felt an uprush of pity for him and turned away so he would not see it in her eyes then she realised what he had said about pitt and austwick and she understood why he had come specifically to tell her she knew he was watching her im sorry he said quietly she understood what he was apologising for he had made pitt unpopular by singling him out preferring him confiding in him now without narraway he would be vulnerable he had never had any other profession but the police and then special branch he had been forced out of the police after his long struggle against the inner circle he could not go back there it was narraway who had given him a job when he had so desperately needed it if special branch dismissed him where was there for him to go there was nowhere where he could exercise his very particular skills and certainly nowhere where he could earn a comparable salary they would lose this house in keppel street and all the comforts that went with it mrs waterman would certainly no longer be a problem charlotte might well be scrubbing her own floors indeed it might even come to her scrubbing someone elses as well pitt would hate that for her more than she would for herself she could imagine it already see the shame in his face for his own failure to provide for her not the near luxury she had grown up in nor even the amenities of a workingclass domesticity she looked up at narraway wondering now about him she had never considered before if he were dependent upon his salary or not his speech and his manner the almost careless elegance of his dress said that he was born to a certain degree of position but that did not necessarily mean wealth younger sons of even the most aristocratic families did not always inherit a great deal what will you do she asked then was aware how intrusive that sounded and that it might be a painful question certainly it was one to which she had no right to expect an answer she could feel the heat mounting up her cheeks would apologising make it better or worse how like you he replied both to be concerned for me and to assume that there is something to be done now she felt foolish isnt there he hesitated the silence between them was full of all sorts of memories and emotions yesterday he had been pitts superior a man with enormous power today he had no authority possibly even no income beyond a few weeks did he have friends people he could call on or might he be too proud to do that she had known him through pitt since pitt had joined special branch but she was sharply aware now how superficial that knowledge was what of his past what was his life beyond the branch perhaps there was not much she knew that in the last case pitt had made an enemy of the prince of wales perhaps that enmity extended to narraway as well remembering the circumstances she could only believe that it must there may be many other enemies people do not forgive knowledge of the intimate and painful kind that narraway possessed she looked at his face in the lamplight and then lowered her eyes she was not sure what she wanted to say only that silence was of no use to pitt or to narraway himself what are you going to do she asked him again to help pitt theres nothing i can do he replied i dont know the circumstances and to interfere blindly might do far more harm not about thomas about yourself she had not asked him what the charge was or if he was wholly or partially guilty suddenly that omission seemed so enormous she drew in her breath to say something to amend it then she felt inexcusably clumsy and ended saying nothing the ashes settled even further in the fire several seconds passed before he answered i dont know he admitted his voice hesitant for the first time in her knowledge i am not even certain who is at the root of it although i have at least an idea it is all ugly she had to press onward for pitts sake is that a reason not to look at it she said quietly it will not mend itself will it he gave the briefest smile no i am not certain that it can be mended at all would you like a cup of tea she asked he was startled i beg your pardon you look uncomfortable standing there in front of the fire wouldnt sitting down be better he turned slightly to look behind him at the hearth and the mantel and took a step sideways you mean i am blocking the heat he said ruefully no she smiled actually i meant that i am getting a crick in my neck staring up and sideways at you for a moment the pain in his face softened thank you but i would prefer not to disturb mrs whatever her name is i can sit down without tea unnatural as that may seem waterman she supplied yes of course i was going to make it myself provided of course that she will allow me into the kitchen she doesnt approve ladies of the social order she is accustomed to working for do not even know where the kitchen is although how i could lose it in a house this size i have no idea she has come down in the world narraway observed it can happen to the best of us charlotte watched as he sat down elegantly as always crossing his legs and leaning back as if he were comfortable i think it may concern an old case in ireland he began at first meeting her eyes then looking down awkwardly at the moment it is to do with the death of a presentday informant there because the money i paid did not reach him in time for him to flee those he had betrayed he said the word crisply and clearly as if deliberately exploring a wound his own not someone elses i did it obliquely so it could not be traced back to special branch if it had been it would have cost him his life immediately watching his face charlotte had no impression that he was being deliberately obscure she waited there was silence beyond the room no sound of the children asleep upstairs or of mrs waterman who was presumably still in the kitchen she would not retire to her room with a visitor still in the house my attempts to hide its source make it impossible to trace what actually happened to it narraway continued to the superficial investigation it looks as if i took it myself he was watching her now but not openly she saw the apprehension in his eyes it was there just for a moment then gone again she tried to keep all expression from her face what did she believe of him she did not know but for pitts sake she could not afford to allow doubt you have enemies she said his body eased so minutely it was barely visible just an alteration in the way the fabric of his suit stretched across his shoulders he was not a large man average height slender wiry the bones of his hands resting on his knee were lean in fact his hands were beautiful she had not noticed them before yes he agreed i have no doubt many i thought i had guarded against the possibility of their injuring me it seems i overlooked something of importance or someone is an enemy whom you did not suspect she amended that is possible he agreed i think it is more likely that an old enemy has gained a power that i did not foresee you have someone in mind she leaned forward a little the question was intrusive but she had to know pitt was in france relying on narraway to back him up he would have no idea narraway no longer held any office yes the answer seemed to be difficult for him again she waited its an old case it all happened more than twenty years ago there was a roughness in his voice and he had to clear his throat before he went on theyre all dead now except one she had no idea to what he was referring and yet the past seemed to be in the room with them but one is alive she probed do you know or are you guessing i know kate and sean are dead he said so quietly she had to strain to hear him i imagine cormac is still alive he would be barely sixty why would he wait this long i dont know she studied him as he sat in pitts chair opposite her he was uncomfortable yet he made no move to go nor even to defend himself from her enquiries but you believe he hates you enough to lie to plan and connive to ruin you she insisted thoughts chased each other across his face she could not guess what they were yes i have no doubt of that he has cause charlotte realised with surprise and pity that he was ashamed of his part in whatever had happened she hoped she would never have to know what it was so what will you do she asked again you have to fight he smiled and she knew it was because he assumed she was concerned that he protect pitt she was but that was not all nor had it been uppermost in her mind when she had spoken she felt a heat burn up her face nurse your wound for a few hours then gather yourself together and think what you wish to do now he really smiled showing a naturalness of humour she had not seen in him before is that how you speak to your children when they fall over and skin their knees he asked quick sympathy a hug and then briskly get back up again i havent fallen off a horse mrs pitt i have fallen from grace and i know of nothing to get me back up again the colour was even hotter in her face now you mean you have no idea what to do he stood up and straightened the shoulders of his jacket yes i know what to do i shall go to ireland and find cormac oneil if i can i shall prove that he is behind this and clear my name i shall make croxdale eat his words at least i hope i will she stood also have you anyone to help you whom you can trust no his loneliness was intense just the one simple word then it vanished as if selfpity disgusted him not here he added but i may find someone in ireland she knew he was lying to cover the moments slip ill come with you she said impulsively you can trust me because our interests are the same his voice was tight with amazement as if he did not dare believe her are they of course she said rashly although she knew it was the absolute truth thomas has no other friend in special branch than you the survival of my family may depend upon your being able to prove your innocence the colour was warm in his cheeks also or perhaps it was the firelight and what could you do he asked observe ask questions go where you will be recognised and cannot risk being seen i am quite a good detective at least i was in the past when thomas was in the police force and his cases were not so secret at least i am considerably better than nothing he blushed and turned away i could not allow you to come i did not ask your permission she retorted but of course it would be a great deal pleasanter with it she added he did not answer it was the first time she had seen him so uncertain even when she had realised some time ago with shock that he found her attractive there had always been a distance between them he was pitts superior a seemingly invulnerable man intelligent ruthless always in control and knowing so many things that others did not now he was unsure able to be hurt no more in control of everything than she was she would have used his christian name if she had dared but that would be a familiarity too far we need the same thing she began we have to find the truth of who is behind this fabrication and put an end to it it is survival for both of us if you think that because i am a woman i cannot fight or that i will not then you are a great deal more naive than i assumed and frankly i do not believe that you have some other reason either you are afraid of something i will find out some lie you need to protect or else your pride is more important to you than your survival well it is not more important to me she took a deep breath and should i be of assistance you will not owe me anything morally or otherwise i care what happens to you i would not like to see you ruined because you helped my husband at a time when we desperately needed it but what is far more urgent at the moment i will come in order to save my own family every time i think i know something about you you surprise me narraway observed it is a good thing you are no longer a part of high society they would never survive you they are unaccustomed to such ruthless candour they would have no idea what to do with you you dont need to be concerned for them i know perfectly well how to lie with the best if i have to she retorted i am coming to ireland with you this needs to be done and you cannot do it alone because too many people already know you you said as much yourself but i had better have some reasonable excuse to justify travelling with you or we shall cause an even greater scandal may i be your sister for the occasion we dont look anything alike he said with a slightly twisted smile halfsister then if anybody asks she amended of course you are right he conceded his voice was tired the banter gone from it he had been bruised to the heart and he knew it was ridiculous to deny the only help he had been offered but you will listen to me and do as i tell you i cannot afford to spend my time or energy looking after you or worrying about you is that understood and agreed certainly i want to succeed not prove some kind of point then i shall be here at eight oclock in the morning the day after tomorrow to take us to the train and then the boat bring clothes suitable for walking for discreet calling upon people in the city and at least one gown for evening should we go to the theatre dublin is famous for its theatres no more than one case i shall be waiting he hesitated a moment then let out his breath thank you after he had gone charlotte went back to the front parlour and a moment later there was a knock on the door come in she said expecting to thank mrs waterman for waiting up tell her that nothing more was needed and she should go to bed mrs waterman came in and closed the door behind her her back was ramrod stiff her face almost colourless and set in lines of rigid disapproval one might imagine she had found a blocked drain im sorry mrs pitt she said before charlotte had had time to say anything i cannot remain here my conscience would not allow it charlotte was stunned what are you talking about youve done nothing wrong mrs waterman sniffed well i dare say i have my faults we all do but ive always been respectable mrs pitt there wasnt ever anyone who could say different nobody has charlotte was still mystified nobody has even suggested such a thing and i mean to keep it like that if you understand me mrs waterman stood if possible even straighter so ill be going in the morning im sorry about that i dare say itll be difficult for you which i regret but ive got my name to think of what are you talking about charlotte was growing annoyed mrs waterman was not particularly agreeable but they might learn to accept one another she was certainly hardworking diligent and totally reliable at least she had been so far with pitt away for an indefinite period of time and now this disastrous situation with narraway the last thing charlotte needed was a domestic crisis she had to go to ireland if pitt were without a job they would lose the house and in quite a short time possibly even find themselves scraping for food he might have to learn a new trade entirely and that would be difficult for a man in his forties also with all the effort he would put into it it would still take time it was barely beginning to sink into her mind just how serious it would be the embarrassment the shame of it had not even begun to take shape how on earth would daniel and jemima take the news no more pretty dresses no more parties no more hoping for a career for daniel he would be fortunate not to start work at anything he could find in a year or two even jemima could become somebodys kitchen maid the tears stung in her eyes you cant leave she said aloud her tone angry now if you do then i cannot give you a letter of character that was a severe threat without a recommendation no servant could easily find another position their reason for leaving would be unexplained and most people would put the unkindest interpretation on it mrs waterman was unmoving im not sure maam if your recommendation would be of any service to me as to character that is if you understand me charlotte felt as if she had been slapped no i do not understand you i have no idea what you are talking about she said tartly i dont like having to say this mrs waterman replied her face wrinkling with distaste but ive never before worked in a household where the gentleman goes away unexpectedly without any luggage at all and the lady receives other gentlemen alone and after dark it isnt decent maam and thats all there is to it i cant stay in a house with such goingson charlotte was astounded goingson she could feel the heat rise up her face and was furious with herself it must look like the flush of guilt not anger mrs waterman mr pitt was called away on urgent business without time to come home or pack any luggage he went to france in an emergency the nature of which is not your concern mr narraway is his superior in the government and he came to tell me so i would not be concerned if you see it as something else then the goingson as you put it are entirely in your own imagination if you say so maam mrs waterman answered her eyes unwavering and what did he come for the second time did mr pitt give a message to him and not to you his lawful wedded wife i assume charlotte wanted to slap her it was an awful feeling ridiculous and undignified she knew exactly why men hit each other sometimes however she had never heard of a decent woman slapping her maid she would probably be arrested and charged with assault this was a nightmare with a great effort she forced herself to become calm mrs waterman mr narraway came to tell me further news concerning my husbands work none of which is your concern and i cant imagine why you believe that i owe you some kind of explanation for it some work for her majesty is extremely discreet and he does not discuss it with me which is as it should be i do not intend to tell you any more about it than that if you choose to think ill of it or of me then you will do so whatever the truth is because that is who you are now it was mrs watermans face that flamed dont you try to cover it with nice words and highandmighty airs she said bitterly i know a man with a fancy for a woman when i see one it was on the edge of charlottes tongue to ask sarcastically when mrs waterman had ever seen one but it was perhaps an unnecessarily cruel thought mrs waterman was exactly what charlottes grandmama used to call a vinegar virgin in spite of the courtesy mrs in front of her name you have an overheated and somewhat vulgar imagination mrs waterman she said coldly but i cannot afford to have such a person in my household so it might be best for both of us if you were to pack your belongings and leave first thing in the morning i shall make breakfast myself and then see if my sister can lend me one of her staff until i find someone satisfactory of my own her husband is a member of parliament and she keeps a large establishment i shall see you to say goodbye in the morning yes maam mrs waterman turned for the door mrs waterman yes maam i shall say nothing of you to others good or ill i suggest that you return that courtesy and say nothing of me you would not come out of it well i assure you mrs watermans eyebrows rose slightly charlotte smiled with ice in her eyes a servant who will speak ill of one mistress will do so of another those of us who employ servants are well aware of that good night mrs waterman closed the door without replying charlotte went to the telephone to speak to emily and ask for her help immediately if possible she was a little surprised to see her hand shaking as she reached for the receiver of the instrument and took it off its hook on the wall when the voice answered she gave emilys number it rang at the other end several times before the butler picked it up mr radleys residence may i help you he said politely im sorry to disturb you so late charlotte apologised it is mrs pitt calling something of an emergency has arisen may i speak with mrs radley please im very sorry mrs pitt he replied with sympathy mr and mrs radley have gone to paris and i do not expect them back for two or three weeks is there something i may do to assist you charlotte felt a sort of panic who else could she turn to for help her mother was also out of the country in edinburgh where she had gone with her second husband joshua he was an actor and had a play running in the theatre there no no thank you she said a little breathlessly im sure i shall find another solution thank you for your trouble good night she hung up quickly before she heard him reply she stood in the quiet parlour the embers dying in the fire because she had not restoked it she had until tomorrow evening to find someone to care for daniel and jemima or she could not go with narraway and if she did not then she could not help him he would be alone in dublin hampered by the fact that he was known there by friend and enemy alike his face and his bearing were sufficiently unusual that he would not be forgotten even in twenty years anyway twenty years or fifty hate did not ever forget sometimes it carried on down generations an evil heritage like the propensity for some disease pitt had said little to her about the affair at buckingham palace but she knew as much from the things he left out as from what hed told her that his solution of the crime had embarrassed the prince of wales by making very obvious his personal weaknesses worse than that it had exposed his error in front of the assembled courtiers and of course unforgivably before his mother queen victoria it would be no use whatever to pitt having the queen appreciate him for a few minutes if the prince of wales were his enemy for years that pitt had been narraways man from the beginning his protege had bred envy and in some cases fear with narraway gone it would be only a matter of time before pitt too was dismissed or worse than that met with an accident then another thought occurred to her ugly and even more imperative if narraway were innocent as he claimed then someone had deliberately reorganised evidence to make him look guilty they could do the same to pitt in fact it was quite possible that if pitt had had anything whatever to do with the case then he might already be implicated as soon as he was home from france he would walk straight into the trap only a fool would allow him time to mount a defence still less to find proof of his innocence and at the same time presumably their guilt but why was it really an old vengeance against narraway or did narraway know something that his enemy could not afford to have him pursue whatever it was whatever narraway had done or not done she must protect pitt narraway could not be guilty that was the only thing of which she had no doubt now she must find someone to look after jemima and daniel while she was away oh damn mrs waterman the stupid creature charlotte was tired enough to sleep quite well but when she woke in the morning the previous evening all flooded back to her she remembered that not only had she to make breakfast herself not an unfamiliar task since in the early days of her marriage she had done it always but then she had to see mrs waterman on her way and explain to daniel and jemima at least something of what had happened it might be easier to jemima but how would daniel at ten grasp enough of the idea at least to believe her she must make sure he did not imagine it was in any way his fault then she must tackle the real task of the day finding someone trustworthy with whom to leave her children and do it instantly put in such simple words the thought overwhelmed her she stood in her nightgown in the centre of the bedroom floor cold with failure and yet she must go she must fight for a future better than pitt going from place to place trying to find a job for which he was suited and for which someone would hire him it would humiliate him he had commanded men in bow street required all manner of people to answer his questions gone into great houses through the front door not at the back like a beggar standing here shivering would achieve nothing she might as well get dressed while she weighed it up a white blouse and a plain brown skirt would be fine she was going to do chores after all when charlotte went downstairs mrs waterman was waiting in the hall her one suitcase by the door charlotte was tempted to be sorry for her but the moment passed there was too much to do for her to relent even if mrs waterman wanted her to this was an inconvenience there were disasters on the horizon good morning mrs waterman she said politely i am sorry you feel it necessary to go but perhaps in the circumstances it is better you will forgive me if i do not draw this out i have to find someone to replace you by this evening i hope you find yourself suited very soon good day to you im sure i will maam mrs waterman replied and with such conviction that it flashed across charlottes mind to wonder if perhaps she already had sometimes domestic staff especially cooks found a cause to give notice in order to avail themselves of a position they preferred or thought more advantageous for themselves yes i imagine you will land on your feet charlotte said a trifle brusquely mrs waterman gave her a cold look drew breath to respond then changed her mind and opened the front door with some difficulty she dragged her case outside then went to the kerb to hail a cab charlotte closed the door as jemima came down the stairs she would be charlottes height by the time she was a woman and from the softer lines of her body and the air of confidence as she walked that was not far away wheres mrs waterman going she asked its breakfast time there was no point in evasion she is leaving us charlotte replied quietly at this time in the morning jemimas eyebrows rose they were elegant slightly winged exactly like charlottes own it was that or last night charlotte answered did she steal something jemima reached the bottom stair are you sure shes so terribly good i cant believe shed do that shed never be able to face herself in the glass come to think of it perhaps she doesnt anyway she might crack it jemima that is rude and most unkind charlotte said sharply but true she added i did not ask her to leave it is actually very inconvenient indeed daniel appeared at the top of the stairs considered sliding down the banister saw his mother at the bottom and changed his mind he came down the steps in a selfconsciously dignified manner as if that had always been his intention is mrs waterman going he asked hopefully shes already gone charlotte answered oh good is gracie coming back no of course she isnt jemima put in shes married shes got to stay at home and look after her husband well get someone else wont we mama yes as soon as weve had breakfast and youve gone to school i shall begin looking where do you look daniel asked curiously as he followed her down the passage to the kitchen it was shining clean after last nights dinner mrs waterman had left it immaculate but not a thing was started for breakfast not even the stove was lit it was still full of yesterdays ashes and barely warm to the touch it would take some time to rake it out and lay it light it and wait for it to heat too long for a hot breakfast of any sort before school even tea and toast required the use of the stove charlotte controlled her temper with difficulty if she could have been granted one wish other than pitt being home it would have been to have gracie back just her cheerful spirit her frankness her refusal ever to give in would have made it easier but she wasnt and charlotte could never be anything but happy for her that at last she had achieved the dreams that had once seemed impossible to her im sorry she said to daniel and jemima but well have to wait until tonight for something hot itll be bread and jam for us all this morning and a glass of milk she went to the pantry to fetch the milk butter and jam without waiting for their response she was already trying to find words to tell them that she had to leave and go to ireland except that she couldnt if she didnt find someone totally trustworthy and how could she do that in half a day it would have to be a matter of thinking of someone they could stay with as an absolutely final resort she could take them to emilys home for the servants to look after until charlotte could get back from ireland or pitt from france or even emily herself from paris she came back with the milk butter and jam and put them on the table jemima was setting out the knives and spoons for the jam daniel was putting the glasses out one at a time charlotte felt a sudden tightening in her chest how could she have contemplated leaving them with the disapproving mrs waterman blast emily for being away now when she was so badly needed she turned and opened the bread bin took out the loaf and set it on the board with the knife thank you she accepted the last glass i know its a little early but we had better begin i knew mrs waterman was going i should have been up sooner and lit the stove i didnt even think of it im sorry she cut three slices of bread and offered them they each took one buttered it and chose the jam they liked best gooseberry for jemima blackcurrant for daniel like his father and apricot for charlotte she poured the milk why did she go mama daniel asked for once charlotte did not bother to tell him not to speak with his mouth full his question deserved an honest answer but how much would he understand he was looking at her now with solemn grey eyes exactly like his fathers jemima waited with the bread halfway to her mouth perhaps the whole truth briefly and without fear was the only way to avoid having to lie later as more and more emerged if they ever found her lying to them even if they understood the reason their trust would be broken mr narraway your fathers superior called a few evenings ago to tell me that your father had to go to france without being able to let us know he didnt want us to worry when he didnt come home you told us jemima interrupted why did mrs waterman go mr narraway came again yesterday evening quite late he stayed for a little while because something very bad had happened to him he has been blamed for something he didnt do and he is no longer your fathers superior that matters rather a lot so he had to let me know jemima frowned i dont understand why did mrs waterman go cant we pay her any more yes certainly we can charlotte said quickly although that might not always be true she went because she didnt approve of mr narraway coming here and telling me in the evening why not daniel put his bread down and stared at her shouldnt he have told you and how does she know is she in the police as well pitt had not explained to his children the differences between the police detecting any type of crime and special branch a force created originally to deal with violence sometimes treason or any other threat to the safety of the country but this was not the time to address that no charlotte said it is not her concern at all she thought i should not have received any man after dark when your father was not here she said it wasnt decent and she couldnt remain in a house where the mistress did not behave with proper decorum i tried to explain to her that it was an emergency but she did not believe me if she did not have more urgent problems that would still have rankled daniel still looked puzzled but it was clear that jemima understood if she hadnt left anyway then you should have thrown her out she said angrily thats impertinent she was immediately defensive of her mother and impertinent was her new favourite word of condemnation yes it was charlotte agreed she had been going to tell them about her need to go to ireland but changed her mind perhaps this was sufficient to deal with at one time and there was no need to alarm them before she had worked out some way of keeping them safe and cared for but since she did leave of her own will it doesnt matter may i have the butter please daniel he passed it to her whats going to happen to mr narraway is papa going to help him he cant jemima pointed out hes in france she looked questioningly at charlotte to support her if she was right well who is then daniel persisted there was no escape except lies charlotte took a deep breath i am if i can think of a way now please finish your breakfast so i can get you on your way to school and begin looking for someone to replace mrs waterman but when she put on an apron and knelt to clear the ashes out of the grate in the stove then laid a new fire ready to light when she returned finding a new maid did not seem nearly as simple a thing to accomplish as she had implied to daniel and jemima it was not merely a woman to cook and clean that she required it was someone who would be completely reliable kind and if any emergency arose who would know what to do who to contact and would do so if she were in ireland who would they ask for help was she even right to go which was the greater emergency should she ask any new maid if she could find one to call greataunt vespasia if she needed help vespasia was close to seventy although she might not look it and certainly had not retired from any part of life her passion courage and energy would put to shame many a thirtyyearold and she had always been a leader in the highest society her great beauty had changed but not dimmed but was she the person to make decisions should a child be ill or there be some other domestic crisis such as a blocked drain a broken tap or if the coal ran out the chimney was on fire and so on gracie had risen to all such occasions at one time or another charlotte stood up washed her hands in water that was almost cold and took off her apron she would ask gracies advice it was something of a desperate step to disturb her newfound happiness so soon but it was a desperate situation please heaven gracie was at home it was an omnibus ride but not a very long one to the small redbrick house where gracie and tellman lived they had the whole of the ground floor to themselves including the front garden this was quite an achievement for a couple so young but then tellman was twelve years older than gracie and had worked extremely hard to gain promotion to sergeant in the metropolitan police pitt still missed working with him charlotte walked up to the front door and knocked briskly holding her breath in anticipation if gracie were not in she had no idea where she could turn next but the door opened and gracie stood just inside five foot tall with her smart boots on and wearing a dress that for once was nobody elses castoff altered to fit her there was no need to ask if she was happy it radiated from her face like heat from a stove mrs pitt yer come ter see me samuel int ere nowes gorn already but come in an ave a cup o tea she pulled the door open even wider and stepped back charlotte accepted forcing herself to think of gracies new house her pride and happiness before she said anything of her own need she followed gracie inside along a linoleumfloored passage polished to a gleaming finish and into the small kitchen at the back it too was immaculately clean and smelled of lemon and soap even this early in the morning the stove was lit and there was wellkneaded bread sitting in pans on the sill rising gently it would soon be ready to bake gracie pulled the kettle over onto the hob and set out teapot and cups ready then opened the pantry cupboard to get milk i got cake if yer like she offered but mebbe yerd sooner ave toast an jam actually id rather like cake if you can spare it charlotte replied i havent had good cake for a while mrs waterman didnt approve of it and the disfavour came through her hands heavy as lead gracie turned round from the cupboard where she had been getting the cake plates were on the dresser charlotte noted with a smile that it was set out exactly like the one in her own kitchen which gracie had kept for so long cups hanging from the rings small plates on the top shelf then bowls dinner plates lowest she gorn then gracie said anxiously mrs waterman yes im afraid so she gave notice and left all at the same time yesterday evening or to be exact she gave notice late yesterday evening and was in the hall with her case when i came down this morning gracie was astounded she put the cake which was rich and full of fruit on the table then stared at charlotte in dismay wot she done yer dint never thrower out fer nothin i didnt throw her out at all charlotte answered she really gave notice just like that yer cant do that gracie waved her hands to dismiss the idea yer wont never get another place not a decent one a lot has happened charlotte said quietly gracie sat down sharply in the chair opposite and leaned a little across the small wooden table her face pale it int mr pitt her voice was husky with sudden fear no charlotte assured her hastily she should not have let her think it even for an instant but he is in france on business and cannot come home until it is complete and mr narraway has been thrown out of his job there was no use and no honour in concealing the truth from gracie after all it was victor narraway who had placed her as a maid in buckingham palace when pitt so desperately needed help in that case the triumph had been almost as much gracies as his narraway himself had praised her gracie was appalled thats wicked he thinks it is an old enemy perhaps hand in glove with a new one possibly someone after his job charlotte told her mr pitt doesnt know and is trusting mr narraway to support him in his pursuit now and do what he can to help from here he doesnt know he will be relying on someone else who may not believe in him as mr narraway does wot are we goin ter do gracie said instantly charlotte was so overwhelmed with gratitude and with emotion at gracies passionate and unquestioning loyalty that she felt the warmth rise up in her and the tears prickle her eyes this was absurd and certainly no time for such selfindulgence mr narraway believes that the cause of the problem lies in an old case that happened twenty years ago in ireland he is going back there to find his enemy and try to prove his own innocence but mr pitt wont be there to elp im gracie pointed out ow can e do that by isself dont this enemy know im never mind that ell expect im ter do it she looked suddenly quite pale all the happy flush gone from her face thats just daft yer gotter tell im ter thinkafore e leaps in yer really ave i must help him gracie mr narraways enemies in special branch are mr pitts as well for all our sakes we must win yer goin ter ireland yer goin ter elp im she reached out her hand almost as if to touch charlottes where it lay on the table then snatched it back selfconsciously she was no longer an employee but it was a liberty too far for all the years they had known each other she took a deep breath yer ave gotta i know i mean to charlotte assured her but since mrs waterman has walked out in disgust and outraged morality because mr narraway was alone in the parlour with me after dark i have to find someone to replace her before i can leave a succession of emotions passed across gracies face anger indignation impatience and a degree of amusement stupid ol aporth she said with disgust got minds like cesspits some o them ol vinegar virgins not that mr narraway dont ave a soft spot for yer an all the smile lit her eyes for an instant then was gone again she might not have dared say that when she worked for charlotte but she was a respectable married woman now and in her own kitchen in her own house she wouldnt have changed places with the queen and she had met the queen which was more than most could say gracie emily is away and so is my mother charlotte told her gravely i cant go and leave jemima and daniel until i find someone to look after them someone i can trust completely where do i look who can recommend someone without any doubt or hesitation at all gracie was silent for so long that charlotte realised she had asked an impossible question im sorry she said quickly that was unfair the kettle was boiling and began to whistle gracie stood up picked up the cloth to protect her hands and pulled it away from the heat she swilled a little of the steaming water around the teapot to warm it emptied it down the sink and then made the tea she carried the pot carefully over to the table and set it on a metal trivet to protect the wood then she sat down again i can she said charlotte blinked i beg your pardon i can recommend someone gracie said minnie maude mudway i knowed er since before i ever met you or come to yer ouse she lived near where i used ter in spitalfields just round the corner couple o streets along er uncle were killed i elped er find oo done it member charlotte was confused trying to find the memory and failing you were riding the donkey for christmas gracie urged minnie maude were eight then but shes growed up now yer can trust er cos she dont never ever give up ill find er for yer an ill go ter keppel street meself an check on them every day charlotte looked at gracies small earnest face the gently steaming teapot and the homemade cake with its rich sultanas the whole lovingly immaculate kitchen thank you she said softly that would be excellent if you call in every day then i shant worry gracie smiled widely yer like a piece o cake yes please charlotte accepted by three oclock in the afternoon charlotte was already packed to leave with narraway on the train the following morning should it prove possible after all she could not settle to anything one moment she wanted to prepare the vegetables for dinner then she forgot what she was intending to cook or thought of something else to pack twice she imagined she heard someone at the door but when she looked there was no one three times she went to check that daniel and jemima were doing their homework then at last the knock on the door came familiar in the rhythm as if it were a person she knew she turned and almost ran to open it on the step was gracie her smile so wide it lit her whole face with triumph next to her stood another young woman several inches taller slender and with unruly hair she had done her best to tame unsuccessfully but the thing that caught charlottes attention was the intelligence in her eyes even though now she looked definitely nervous this is minnie maude gracie announced as if she were a magician pulling a rabbit out of a top hat minnie maude dropped a tiny curtsy obviously not quite sure enough to do it properly charlotte could not hide her smile not of amusement but of relief how do you do minnie maude please come in if gracie has explained my difficulty to you then you know how delighted i am to see you she opened the door wide and turned to lead the way she took them into the kitchen because it was warmer and it would be minnie maudes domain if she accepted the position please sit down charlotte invited them would you like tea it was a rhetorical question one made tea automatically ill do it gracie said instantly you will not charlotte told her you dont work here you are my guest then as she saw the startled look on gracies face please she added gracie sat down suddenly looking awkward charlotte set about making the tea she had no cake to offer but she cut lacythin slices of bread and butter and there was finesliced cucumber and hardboiled egg of course there was also jam although it was a little early in the afternoon for anything so sweet gracie tells me that you have known each other for a very long time charlotte said as she worked yes maam since i were eight minnie maude replied she elped me when me uncle alf were killed an charlie got stole she drew in her breath as if to say something more and then changed her mind charlotte had her back to the table hiding her face and her smile she imagined that gracie had schooled minnie maude well in not saying too much not offering what was not asked for did she also explain that my husband is in special branch she asked which is a sort of police but dealing with people who are trying to cause war and trouble of one sort or another to the whole country yes maam she said as e were the best detective in all england minnie maude replied there was a warmth of admiration in her voice already charlotte brought the plate of bread and butter over and set it on the table he is very good she agreed but that might be a slight exaggeration at the moment he has had to go abroad on a case unexpectedly my previous maid left without any notice because she misunderstood something that happened and felt she could not stay i have to leave tomorrow morning very early because of another problem that has arisen it sounded peculiar even to her own ears yes maam minnie maude nodded seriously a very important gentleman as gracie speaks very ighly of too she said as someone is blaming im fer summink as e didnt do an youre going to elp im cos its the right thing ter do charlotte relaxed a little exactly im afraid we are a household of unexpected events at times but you will be in no danger at all however your job will involve considerable responsibility because although i am here most of the time i am not always yes maam i bin in service before but the lady i were with passed on an i int found a new place yet but gracie said as shell come by every day just ter make certain as everythings all right like minnie maudes face was a little tense her eyes never leaving charlottes face charlotte looked at gracie and saw the confidence in her eyes then because she was sitting at the table sideways to her the small hands knotted knuckles white in her lap she made her decision then minnie maude i would be very happy to engage you in the position of housemaid starting immediately i apologise for the urgency of the situation and you will be compensated for the inconvenience by a double salary for the first month to reflect also the fact that you will be alone at the beginning which is always the most difficult time in a new place minnie maude gulped thank you maam after tea i shall introduce you to jemima and daniel they are normally wellbehaved and the fact that you are a friend of gracies will endear you to them from the beginning jemima knows where most things are if you ask her she will be happy to help you in fact she will probably take a pride in it but do not allow her to be cheeky and that goes for daniel as well he will probably try your patience simply to test you please do not let him get away with too much the kettle was boiling and she made the tea bringing it over to the table to brew while they were waiting she explained some of the other household arrangements and where different things were kept i shall leave you a list of the tradesmen we use and what they should charge you although i dare say you are familiar with prices but they might take advantage if they think you dont know she went on to tell her of the dishes daniel and jemima liked best and the vegetables they were likely to refuse if they thought they could get away with it and rice pudding she finished that is a treat not more than twice a week wi nutmeg on the top minnie maude asked charlotte glanced at gracie then smiled the ease running through her like a warmth inside exactly i think this is going to work very well chapter four gracie and minnie maude returned early in the evening accompanied by tellman who carried minnie maudes luggage he took it up to the room that not long ago had been gracies then excused himself to take gracie home minnie maude began to unpack her belongings and settle in helped by jemima and watched from a respectful distance by daniel clothes were womens business once she had made certain that all was well charlotte telephoned greataunt vespasia immensely relieved to find her at home she asked if she might visit her you sound very serious vespasias voice came across the rather crackly wire charlotte gripped the instrument more tightly in her hand i am i have a great deal to tell you and some advice to seek but i would much prefer to tell you in person rather than this way in fact some of it is most confidential then you had better come to see mevespasia replied i shall send my carriage for you are you ready now we shall have supper i was going to have welsh rarebit on toast with a little very good hock i have and then apple flan and cream apples at this time of year are not fit for anything except cooking i would love it charlotte accepted i shall just make certain that my new maid is thoroughly settled and aware of what to cook for daniel and jemima then i shall be ready i thought you had had her since gracies wedding vespasia remarked is she still not able to decide what to prepare mrs waterman gave notice last night and left this morning charlotte explained gracie found me someone she has known for years but the poor girl has only just arrived in fact she is still unpacking charlotte now vespasia sounded worried has something happened that is serious yes oh we are all alive and well but yes it is serious and i am in some concern as to whether the course of action i plan is wise or not and you are going to ask my advice it must be serious indeed if you are willing to listen to someone else vespasia was vaguely mocking but the anxiety all but overwhelmed her im not charlotte told her i have already given my word she realised how final that sounded and felt the chill rise inside her i shall dispatch my coachman immediately vespasia responded if gracie recommends this new person then she will be goodyou had better wear a cape the evening has turned somewhat cool yes yes i will charlotte agreed then she said goodbye and replaced the receiver on its hook half an hour later vespasias coachman knocked on the door minnie maude seemed confident enough for charlotte to leave her and daniel and jemima were not in the least concerned indeed they seemed to be enjoying showing her the cupboards and drawers and telling her exactly what was kept in each charlotte answered the door told the coachman that she would be ready in a minute then went to the kitchen she stopped for a moment to stare at jemimas earnest face explaining to minnie maude which jugs were used to keep the days milk and where the milkman was to be found in the morning daniel was moving from foot to foot in his urgency to put in his advice as well and minnie maude was smiling at first one then the other i may be late back charlotte interrupted please dont wait up for me no maam minnie maude said quickly but ill be happy to if you wish thank you but please make yourself comfortable charlotte told her good night she went straight out to the carriage and for the next halfhour rode through the streets to vespasias house in gladstone park which was really not so much a park as a small square with flowering trees she sat and tried to compose in her mind exactly how she would tell vespasia what she meant to do at last charlotte sat in vespasias quiet sitting room the colours were warm muted to a familiar gentleness the curtains were drawn across the window onto the garden and the fire burned in the hearth with a soft whickering of flames she looked into vespasias face and it was not so easy to explain to her the wild decision to which charlotte had already committed herself vespasia had been considered by many to be the most beautiful woman of her generation as well as the most outrageous in her wit and her political opinions or maybe passions would be a more fitting word time had marked her features lightly and if anything liberated her temperament even more she was secure enough in her financial means and her social preeminence not to have to care what other people thought of her as long as she was certain in her own mind that a course of action was for the best criticism might hurt but it was a long time since it had deterred her now she sat stiffbacked she had never lounged in her life her silver hair coiffed to perfection a high lace collar covered her throat and the lamplight gleaming on the three rows of pearls you had better begin at the beginning she told charlotte supper will be another hour at least charlotte knew what the beginning was earlier this week mr narraway came to see me at home to tell me that thomas had been in pursuit of a man who had committed a murder almost in front of him he and his junior had been obliged to follow this person to france and had not had the opportunity to inform anyone of what they were doing mr narraway knew that they were in france they sent a telegram he told me of it so that i would not worry when thomas did not come home or call me vespasia nodded it was courteous of him to come himself she observed a trifle drily charlotte caught the tone in her voice and her eyes widened he is fond of you my dear vespasia responded her amusement was so slight it could barely be seen and was gone again the second after what has this to do with the maid charlotte looked at the drawn curtains the pale design of flowers on the carpet he came again yesterday evening she said quietly and stayed for much longer vespasias voice changed almost imperceptibly indeed charlotte raised her eyes to meet vespasias there appears to have been a conspiracy within special branch to make it look as if he embezzled a good deal of money she saw vespasias look of disbelief they have dismissed him right there on the spot oh dear vespasia said with infinite shades of meaning i see why you are distressed this is very serious indeed victor may have his faults but financial dishonesty is not one of them money does not interest him he would not even be tempted to do such a thing charlotte did not find that comforting what faults was vespasia implying that narraway did possess it seemed she knew him better than charlotte had appreciated even though vespasia had interested herself in many of pitts cases and therefore of narrawaysthen the moment after studying vespasias expression charlotte realised that vespasia was deeply concerned for him and that she believed what he had said charlotte found the tension in her body easing and she smiled i did not believe it of him either but there is something in the past that troubles him very much there will be a good deal vespasia said with the ghost of a smile he is a man of many sides but the most vulnerable one is his work because that is what he cares about then he wouldnt jeopardise it would he charlotte pointed out no someone finds it imperative that victor narraway be driven out of office and out of credit with her majestys government there are many possible reasons and i have no idea which of them it is so i have very little idea where to begin we have to help him charlotte hated asking this of vespasia but the need was greater than the reluctance not only for his sake but for thomass in special branch thomas is regarded as mr narraways man i know this because apart from my own sense thomas has told me so himself and so has mr narraway aunt vespasia if mr narraway is gone then whoever got rid of him may very well try to get rid of thomas too of course vespasia cut across her you do not need to explain it to me my dear and thomas is in france not knowing what has happened or that victor can no longer give him the support from london that he needs have you friends charlotte began i do not know who has done this or why vespasia answered even before the question was finished so i do not know whom i can trust victor mr narraway charlotte felt a faint heat in her cheeks said he believed it was an old case in ireland twenty years ago for which someone now seeks revenge he didnt tell me much about it i think it embarrassed him no doubt vespasia allowed a bleak spark of humour into her eyes for an instant twenty years ago why now the irish are good at holding a grudge or a favour but they dont wait on payment if they dont have to revenge is a dish best served cold charlotte suggested wryly cold perhaps my dear but this would be frozen there is more to it than a personal vengeance but i do not know what by the way what has this to do with your maid leaving clearly there is something you have forgotten to tell me charlotte found herself uncomfortable had vespasia been less gentle or less obviously afraid she would have been angry oh mr narraway called after dark and since the matter was of secrecy for obvious reasons he closed the parlour door im afraid mrs waterman thought i was am a woman of dubious morals she doesnt feel she can remain in a household where the mistress has goingson as she put it then she is going to find herself considerably restricted in her choice of position vespasia said waspishly especially if her disapproval extends to the master as well she didnt say charlotte bit her lip but couldnt conceal her smile but she would be utterly scandalised so much so that she might have left that night out into the street alone with her suitcase in her hand if she had known that i promised mr narraway that i would go to ireland with him to do whatever i can to find the truth and help him clear his name i have to his enemies are thomass enemies and thomas will have no defence against them without mr narraway there then what shall we do vespasia was silent for several moments be very careful charlotte she said gravely i think you are unaware of how dangerous that could become charlotte clenched her hands what would you have me do sit here in london while mr narraway is unjustly ruined and then wait for thomas to be ruined as well at best he will be dismissed because he was mr narraways man and they dont like him at worst he may be implicated in the same embezzlement and end up charged with theft her voice cracked a little and she realised how tired she was and how very frightened what would you do vespasia reached across and touched her hand very gently just fingertip to fingertip the same as you my dear thats not the same thing as saying that it is wise it is simply the only choice you can live with there was a tap on the door and the maid announced that supper was ready they ate in the small breakfast room slenderlegged georgian mahogany furniture glowed dark amid golden yellow walls as if they were dining in the sunset although the curtains were closed and the only light came from the gas brackets on the walls charlotte and vespasia did not resume the more serious conversation until they had returned to the sitting room and were assured of being uninterrupted do not forget for a moment that you are in ireland vespasia warned or imagine it is the same as england it is not they wear their past more closely wound around themselves than we do enjoy it while you are there but dont let your guard down for a second they say you need a long spoon to sup with the devil well you need a strong head to dine with the irish theyll charm the wits out of you if you let them i wont forget why im there charlotte promised or that victor knows ireland very well and the irish also know him vespasia added do not underestimate his intelligence charlotte or his vulnerability by the way you have not mentioned how you intend to carry this off without causing a scandal that might damage narraways good name further but would certainly ruin yours i assume your sense of fear and injustice did not blind you to that there was no criticism in her voice only concern charlotte felt the blood hot in her face of course i have i cant take a maid i dont have one or the money to pay her fare if i did i am going to say i am mr narraways sister halfsister that will make it decent enough a tiny smile touched the corners of vespasias lips then you had better stop calling him mr narraway and learn to use his given name or you will certainly raise eyebrows she hesitated or perhaps you already do charlotte looked into vespasias steady silvergrey eyes and chose not to elaborate narraway came early the following morning in a hansom cab when charlotte answered the door he hesitated only momentarily he did not ask her if she were certain of the decision perhaps he did not want to give her the chance to waver he called the cab driver to put her case on the luggage rack do you wish to go and say goodbye he asked her his face looked bleak with shadows under his eyes as if he had not slept in many nights there is time no thank you she answered i have already done so and i hate long goodbyes i am quite ready to go he nodded and walked behind her across the footpath then he handed her up onto the seat going round to the other side to sit next to her the cabby apparently knew the destination she had already decided not to tell him that she had visited vespasia he might prefer to think vespasia did not know of his dismissal she also chose not to let him know of mrs watermans suspicions it could prove embarrassing even as if she herself had considered the journey as something beyond business the very thought of that made the heat rise up her face perhaps you would tell me something about dublin she requested i have never been there and i realise that beyond the fact that it is the capital of ireland i know very little the idea seemed to amuse him we have a long train journey ahead of us even on the fast train and then a crossing of the irish sea i hear that the weather will be pleasant i hope so because if it is rough then it can be very violent indeed there will be time for me to tell you all i know from bc until the present day she was amazed at the age of the city but she would not allow him to see that he had impressed her so easily it might look as if she were being deliberately gentle with the grief she knew he must be feeling really is that because our journey is enormously long after all or because you know less than i had supposed actually there is something of a gap between bc and the celts arriving in bc he said with a smile and after that not a great deal until the arrival of st patrick in ad so we can leap eight thousand years without further comment she concluded after that surely there must be something a little more detailed the founding of st patricks cathedral in ad he suggested unless you want to know about the vikings in which case i would have to look it up myself anyway they werent irish so they dont count are you irish mr narraway charlotte asked suddenly perhaps it was an intrusive question and when he was pitts superior she would not have done it but now the relationship was far more equal and she might need to know with his intensely dark looks he easily could be he winced slightly how formal you are it makes you sound like your mother no i am not irish i am as english as you are except for one greatgrandmother why do you ask your precise knowledge of irish history she answered that was not the real reason she asked because she needed to know more about his loyalties even his nature and emotionally the truth about what had happened in the oneil case twenty years ago it is my job to know he said quietly as it was would you like to hear about the feud that made the king of leinster ask henry ii of england to send over an army to assist him is it interesting the army was led by richard de clare known as strongbow he married the kings daughter and became king himself in and the anglonormans took control in they began to build dublin castle silken thomas led a revolt against henry viii in and lost do you begin to see a pattern of course i do do they burn the king of leinster in effigy he laughed a brief sharp sound i havent seen it done but it sounds like a good idea we are at the station let me get a porter we will continue when we are seated on the train the hansom pulled up as he spoke and he alighted easily there was an air of command in him that attracted attention within seconds and the luggage was unloaded into a wagon the driver paid and charlotte walked across the pavement into the vast paddington railway station for the great western rail to holyhead it had great arches as if it were some halffinished cathedral and a roof so high it dwarfed the massed people all talking and clattering their way to the platform there was a sense of excitement in the air and a good deal of noise and steam and grit narraway took her arm for a moment his grasp felt strange and she was about to object then she realised how foolish that would be if they were parted in the crowd they might not find each other again until after the train had pulled out he had the tickets and he must know which platform they were seeking they passed groups of people some greeting each other some clearly stretching out a reluctant parting every so often the sound of belching steam and the clang of doors drowned out everything else then a whistle would blast shrilly and one of the great engines would come to life beginning the long pull away from the platform it was not until they had found their train and were comfortably seated that they resumed any kind of conversation charlotte found narraway courteous even considerate but she could not help being aware of the inner tensions in him the quick glances as if he memorised the faces of those around them the concern the way his hands were hardly ever completely still it would be a long journey to holyhead on the west coast it was up to her to make it as agreeable as possible and also to learn a good deal more about exactly what he wanted her to do sitting on the rather uncomfortable seat upright with her hands folded in her lap she must look very prim it was not an image she liked and yet now that they were embarked on this adventure together each for his or her own reasons she must be certain that she did not make any irretrievable mistakes first of all in the nature of her feelings she liked victor narraway he was highly intelligent individual he could be very amusing at rare times but she knew only one part of his life the professional part which pitt also knew and knew better than she ever would perhaps that was most of narraway vespasia had hinted as much but charlotte knew that there must be more the private man somewhere beneath the pragmatism there had been dreams she had seen the knowledge of their loss in his eyes thank you for the lesson on ancient irish history she began feeling clumsy but i need to know far more than i do about the specific matter that we are going to investigate otherwise i will not recognise something important if i hear it i cannot possibly remember everything to report it accurately to you of course not he was clearly trying to keep a straight face and not entirely succeeding i will tell you as much as i can you understand there are aspects of it that are still sensitive i mean politically she studied his face and knew that he also meant they were personally painful to him he was aware that she saw it in him and there was selfmockery in his smile perhaps you could tell me something of the political situation she suggested as much as is public knowledge to those who were interested she added now it was her turn to mock herself very slightly im afraid i was more concerned with dresses and gossip at the time of the oneil case she would have been about fifteen and thinking who i might marry of course of course he nodded a subject that engages most of us from time to time all you need to know of the political background is that ireland as always was agitating for home rule various british prime ministers had attempted to put it through parliament and it proved their heartbreak and for some their downfall this is the time of the spectacular rise of charles stewart parnell he was to become leader of the home rule party inseventyseven i remember that name charlotte agreed naturally but this was long before the scandal that ruined him did he have anything to do with what happened with the oneil family nothing at all at least not directly but the fire and hope of a new leader was in the air and irish independence at last and everything was different because of it he looked out of the window at the passing countryside and she knew he was seeing another time and place but we had to prevent it she assumed i suppose it came to that yes we saw it as the necessity to keep the peace things change all the time it is how they do it that must be controlled there is no point in leaving a trail of death behind you in order merely to exchange one form of tyranny for another you dont have to justify it to me she told him i am aware enough of the feeling i only wish to understand something of the oneil family and why one of them should hate you personally so much that twenty years later you believe he would stoop to manufacturing evidence that you are guilty of a crime you did not commit what sort of a man was he then why has he waited so long to do this narraway turned his head away from the sunlight coming through the carriage window he spoke reluctantly cormac he was a goodlooking man very strong quick to laugh and quick to anger but it was usually only on the surface and gone before he would dwell on it but he was intensely loyal first to ireland above all then to his family he and his brother sean were very close he smiled quarrelled like kilkenny cats as they say but let anyone else step in and theyd turn on them like furies how old was he then she asked picturing them in her imagination close to forty he replied without hesitation she wondered if he knew that from records or if he had been close enough to cormac oneil that such things were open between them she had the increasing feeling that this was far more than a special branch operation there was deep manylayered personal emotion as well but narraway would only ever tell her what he had to she must remind herself that he had lost all he valued not in material goods she agreed with vespasia that that to him was trivial it was the loss of purpose the fire and energy that drove him and defined who he was that most wounded him were they from an old family she pursued where did they live and how he looked out of the window again cormac had land to the south of dublin slane interesting place old family arent we all supposed to go back to adam it was a mild evasion and she was aware of it he doesnt seem to have bequeathed the heritage to us equally she answered im sorry am i being evasive yes cormac had enough means not to have to work more than in an occasional overseeing capacity he and sean between them owned a brewery as well i dare say you know the waters of the liffey river are famous for their softness you can make ale anywhere but nothing else has quite the flavour of that made with liffey water but you want to know what they were like he made that a statement yes charlotte replied dont you need me to seek him out because if he hates you as deeply as you think he will tell you nothing that could help the light vanished from his face if its cormac hes thought this out very carefully he must have known all about mulhare and the whole operation the money the reason for paying it as i did and probably that taking it instead of paying it as it was supposed to be paid would cost mulhare his life she was not going to keep on saying she was sorry for the pain the loss the dishonesty of it there was nothing to add and he must also have been able to persuade someone in lisson grove to help him she pointed out narraway winced yes ive thought about that a lot now his face was very sombre indeed ive been piecing together all i know mulhares connections what i did with the money to try and make certain it would never be traced back to special branch or to me personally which in the knowledge of some would be the same thing all the past friends and enemies ive made where it happened it always comes back to oneil why would anyone at lisson grove be willing to help oneil charlotte asked it was like trying to take gravel out of a wound only far deeper than a scraped knee or elbow she thought of daniels face as he sat on one of the hardbacked kitchen chairs dirt and blood on his legs while she tried to clean where he had torn the skin off and pick out the tiny stones there had been tears in his eyes and he had stared resolutely at the ceiling trying to stop them from spilling over and giving him away many reasons narraway replied you cannot do a job like mine without making enemies you hear things about people you might very much prefer not to know but that is a luxury you sacrifice when you accept the responsibility i know that his eyes wandered a little really how do you know that charlotte she saw the trap and slipped around it not from thomas he doesnt discuss his cases since he joined special branch and anyway i dont think you can explain to someone else such a complicated thing he was watching her intently now his eyes were so dark it was hard to read the expression in them the lines in his face showed all the emotions that had passed over them through the years the anxiety the laughter and the grief my eldest sister was murdered many years ago now she explained but perhaps you know that already several young women were at that time we had no idea who was responsible we were all mistaken as to the entire nature of it but in the course of the investigation we learned a great deal about each other that it would have been far more comfortable not to have known but we cannot unlearn such things she remembered it with pain now even though it was fourteen years ago she had absolutely no intention whatever of telling him what those discoveries were most especially the things she had realised about herself she looked up at him and saw his surprise and a gentleness that made her acutely selfconscious the only way to cover the discomfort was to continue talking after that when thomas and i were married i am afraid i meddled a good deal in many of his cases particularly those where society people were involved i had an advantage in being able to meet them socially and observe things he never could one listens to gossip as a matter of course it is largely what society is about but when you do it intelligently actually trying to learn things comparing what one person says with what another does asking questions obliquely weighing answers you cannot help but learn much that is private to other people painful vulnerable and absolutely none of your affair both pity and disillusionment can be much more painful than one has any idea until you taste them he moved his head very slightly in assent he knew it was not necessary to speak for a little while they rode in silence the rhythmic clatter of the wheels over the railway ties was comfortable almost somnolent it had been a difficult and tiring few days and charlotte found herself drifting into a daze and woke with a start please heaven she had not been lolling there with her mouth open she did not yet know anything like enough about what she could do to help do you know who it was at lisson grove who betrayed you she said aloud he answered immediately as if he had been waiting for her to speak had he been sitting there watching her it was an extraordinarily uncomfortable thought no i dont he admitted i have considered several possibilities in fact the only people i am certain it is not are thomas and a man called stoker it makes me realise how incompetent i have been that i suspected nothing i was always looking outward at the enemies i knew in this profession i should have looked behind me as well she did not argue it would have been a transparent and perhaps rather patronising attempt at giving comfort so we can trust no one in special branch apart from stoker she concluded then i suppose we need to concentrate on ireland why does cormac oneil hate you so much if i am to learn anything i need to know what to build upon this time narraway did not look away from her but she could hear the reluctance in his voice he told her only because he had to when he was planning an uprising i was the one who learned about it and prevented it i did it by turning his sisterinlaw seans wife and using the information she gave me to have his men arrested and imprisoned i see no you dont he said quickly his voice tight and i have no intention of telling you any further but because of it sean killed her and was hanged for her murder it is that which cormac cannot forgive if it had simply been a battle he would have considered it the fortunes of war he might have hated me at the time but it would have been forgotten as old battles are but sean and kate are still dead still tarred as a betrayer and a wife murderer i dont know why he waited so long that is the one piece of it i dont understand perhaps it doesnt matter she said sombrely it was a tragic story even ugly and she was certain he had edited it very heavily in the telling it might be to hide a special branch secret but she was sure that he was also ashamed of his part in it what do you want me to do she asked i still have friends in dublin i think he answered i cannot approach cormac myself i need someone i can trust who looks totally innocent and unconnected with me i i cant even go anywhere with you or he would suspect you immediately bring me the facts i can put them together he seemed about to add something more then changed his mind are you worried that i wont know what is important she asked or that i wont remember and tell you accurately no i know perfectly well that you can do both do you she was surprised he smiled briefly you tell me about helping pitt when he was in the police as if you imagined i didnt know you said you didnt know about my sister sarah she pointed out or was that discretion rather than truth there was a look of hurt in his face instantly covered it was the truth but perhaps i deserved the remark i learned about you mostly from vespasia she did not mention sarah perhaps out of delicacy and i had no need to know you had some need to know the rest she said with disbelief of course you are part of pitts life i had to know exactly how far i could trust you although given my present situation you cannot be blamed for doubting my ability in that that sounds like selfpity she said tartly i have not criticised you and that is not out of either good manners or sympathy neither of which we can afford just at the moment if they disguise the truth we cant live without trusting someone it is an offence to betray not to be betrayed it is a good thing you did not marry into society he retorted you would not have survived or on the other hand perhaps society would not have and that might not have been so bad a little shakeup now and then is good for the constitution now she was not sure if he were laughing at her or defending himself or possibly it was both so you accepted my assistance because you believe i can do what you require she concluded not at all i accepted it because you gave me no alternative also since stoker is the only other person i trust and he did not offer nor has he the ability i had no alternative anyway touche she said quietly they did not speak again for quite some time and when they did it was about the difference between society in london and in dublin narraway described quite a lot of the city itself and some of the surrounding countryside with such vividness she began to look forward to seeing it herself he even spoke of the festivals saints days and other occasions that people celebrated when the train drew into holyhead they went straight to the boat after a brief meal they returned to their cabins for the crossing they would arrive in dublin before morning but were not required to disembark until well after daylight dublin was utterly different from london but at least to begin with charlotte was too occupied with getting ashore at dun laoghaire and seeing that she did not lose sight of the porter with her luggage or of narraway to have time to stare about her then there was the ride into the city itself which was just waking up to the new day the rainwashed streets clean and filling with people about their business she saw plenty of horse traffic mostly trade at this hour the carriages and broughams would come later the few women were laundresses maids going shopping or factory workers wearing thick skirts and with heavy shawls wrapped around them much as they would have been at home narraway hailed a cab and they set out to look for accommodation he seemed to know exactly where he was going and gave very precise directions to the driver but he did not explain them to her they rode in silence he stared out of the window and she watched his face the harsh early morning light showing even the smallest lines around his eyes and mouth it made him seem older far less sure of himself she wondered what he was remembering as he watched streets that must be familiar to him how much of the passion or the grief of his life had been here she was glad she did not know and it seemed intrusive even to think about it she hoped that she never had to learn she thought of daniel and jemima and hoped minnie maude was settling in they had seemed to like her and surely anyone gracie vouched for would be good she could not resent gracies happiness but she missed her painfully at times like this that was absurd there had never been another time like this all the past cases and adventures had been in london or very near it here she was in a foreign country with victor narraway riding around the streets looking for lodgings little wonder mrs waterman was scandalised perhaps she was right to be charlotte had no idea where she was and not much more as to what possible use she could be to narraway or to pitt and pitt was in france pursuing someone who thought nothing of slitting a mans throat in the street and leaving him to die as if he were no more than a sack of rubbish pitt didnt even have a clean shirt socks or personal linen narraway had sent him money but he would need more he would need help information probably the assistance of the french police would narraways replacement provide all this was he loyal was he even competent and worse than any of that if he was narraways enemy then he was almost certainly pitts enemy as well only pitt would not know that he would go on communicating as if it were narraway at the other end she turned away and looked out of the window on her own side they were passing handsome georgian houses and every now and then public buildings and churches of classical elegance there were glimpses of the river which she thought did not seem to curve and wind as much as the thames she saw several horsedrawn trams not unlike those in london and in the quieter streets children playing with spinning tops or jumping ropes twice she drew in breath to ask narraway where they were going but each time she looked at the tense concentration on his face she changed her mind finally they stopped outside a house in molesworth street in the southeastern part of the city stay here narraway came suddenly to attention i shall be back in a few moments without waiting for her acknowledgement he got out strode across the footpath and rapped sharply on the door of the nearest house after less than a minute it was opened by a middleaged woman in a white apron her hair tied in a knot on top of her head narraway spoke to her and she invited him in closing the door again behind him charlotte sat and waited suddenly cold now and aware of how tired she was she had slept poorly last night aware of the rather cramped cabin and the constant movement of the boat but far more than anything physical it was the rashness of what she was doing that kept her awake now alone waiting she wished she were anywhere but here pitt would be furious what if he had returned home to find the children alone with a maid he had never seen before they would tell him charlotte had gone off to ireland with narraway and of course they would not even be able to tell him why she was shivering when narraway came out again and spoke to the driver then at last to her there are rooms here it is clean and quiet and we shall not be noticed but it is perfectly respectable as soon as we are settled i shall go to make contact with the people i can still trust he looked at her face carefully she was aware that she must look rumpled and tired and probably illtempered into the bargain she had not a very flattering picture of herself in her mind a smile would help it normally did but in the circumstances it would also be idiotic please wait for me he went on rest if you like we may be busy this evening unfortunately we have no time to waste he held out his arm to assist her down meeting her eyes earnestly questioning before letting go he was clearly concerned for her but she was glad that he did not say anything more it had all been discussed it was inevitable there would be times of terrible doubt perhaps even times when she was quite sure they would fail and the whole undertaking was completely irresponsible they must be endured with as much fortitude and as little complaint as possible she should not forget that it was his career that was ruined not hers and it was he who would in the end have to bear it alone he was the one accused of theft and betrayal no one would blame her for any of this but of course there was every likelihood that they would blame pitt thank you she said with a quick smile then turned away to look at the house it seems very pleasant he hesitated then with more confidence he went ahead of her to the front door when the landlady opened it for them he introduced charlotte as mrs pitt his halfsister who had come to ireland to meet with relatives on her mothers side how do you do maam mrs hogan said cheerfully welcome to dublin then a fine city it is thank you mrs hogan i look forward to seeing it very much charlotte replied narraway went out almost immediately charlotte began by unpacking her case and shaking the creases out of the few clothes she had brought there was only one dress suitable for any sort of formal occasion but she had some time ago decided to copy the noted actress lillie langtry and add different effects to it each time two lace shawls one white one black special gloves a necklace of haematite and rock crystals earrings anything that would draw the attention from the fact that it was the same gown at least it fitted remarkably well women might be perfectly aware that it was the same one each time but with luck men would notice only that it became her as she hung it up in the wardrobe along with a good costume with two skirts and a lighterweight dress she remembered the days when pitt had still been in the police and she and emily had tried their own hands at helping the detection of course at that time pitts cases had been rooted in human passions and occasionally social ills but never secrets of state there had been no reason why he would not discuss them with her and benefit from her greater insight into societys rules and structures and especially the subtler ways of women whose lives were so different from his own he could not guess what lay behind their manners and their words at times it had been dangerous almost always it had involved tragedy and afterwards a greater anger at injustice and compassion for confusion or grief but she had loved the adventure of both heart and mind the cause for which to fight she had never for an instant been bored or suffered that greater dullness of soul that comes when one does not have a purpose one believes in passionately what does one value if one cannot imagine losing it she laid out her toiletries both on the dressing table and in the very pleasant bathroom which she shared with another female guest then she took off her travelling skirt and blouse and the pins out of her hair and lay down on the bed in her petticoat she must have fallen asleep because she woke to hear a tap on the door she sat up for a moment completely at a loss as to where she was the furniture the lamps on the walls the windows were all unfamiliar then it came back to her and she rose so quickly she was dragging the coverlet with her who is it she asked victor he replied quietly perhaps remembering he was supposed to be her brother and mrs hogan might have excellent hearing oh she looked down at herself in her underclothes hair all over the place a moment please she requested there was no chance in the world of redoing her hair but she must make herself decent she was suddenly selfconscious of her appearance she seized her skirt and jacket and pulled them on misbuttoning the latter in her haste and having then to undo it all and start anew he must be standing in the corridor wondering what on earth was the matter with her im coming she repeated there was no time to do more than put the brush through her hair then pull the door open he looked tired but it did not stop the amusement in his eyes when he saw her or a flash of appreciation she would have preferred not to be aware of perhaps she was not beautiful certainly not in a conventional sense but she was a remarkably handsome woman with a fair warmtoned skin and rich hair and she had never since turning sixteen lacked the shape or allure of womanhood you are invited to dinner this evening he said as soon as he was inside the room and the door closed it is at the home of john and bridget tyrone whom i dare not meet yet my friend fiachra mcdaid will escort you ive known him a long time and he will treat you with courtesy will you go please of course i will she said instantly as much to commit herself before she could let her caution prevent her as to assure narraway tell me something about mr mcdaid and about mr and mrs tyrone any advantage i can have so much the better and what do they know of you will they be startled that you suddenly produce a halfsister she smiled slightly and how well do you and i know each other do i know you work with special branch we had better have grown up quite separately because we know too little of each other even one mistake would arouse suspicion he leaned against the doorjamb hands in his pockets he looked completely casual nothing like the man she knew professionally she had a momentary vision of how he must have been twenty years ago intelligent elusive emotionally unattainable but to some women that in itself was an irresistible temptation before her marriage and occasionally since she had known women for whom that was an excitement far greater than the thought of a suitable marriage even than a title or money she stood still waiting for his reply conscious of her travelling costume and extremely untidy hair my father married your mother after my mother died he began she was about to express sympathy then realised she had no idea whether his mother was dead or if he were making it up for the story they must tell perhaps better she was not confused with the truth whatever that was by the time you were born he continued i was already at university cambridge you should know that that is why we know each other so little my father is from buckinghamshire but he could perfectly well have moved to london so you may have grown up wherever you did always better to stay with the truth where you can i know london i would have visited what did he do our father she asked this all had an air of unreality about it even ridiculousness but she knew it mattered perhaps vitally he had land in buckinghamshire he replied he served in the indian armyyou dont need to have known him well i didnt she heard the sharpness of regret in his voice anger at loss then it was gone he died some time ago keep the mother you have you and i have become close only recently this trip is in part for that purpose an unreadable expression flickered through his eyes and vanished again why ireland she asked someone is bound to ask me my grandmother was irish he replied really she was surprised but perhaps she should have known it no this time he smiled fully with both sweetness and humour but shes dead too she wont mind i see she said quietly and this relative that i am looking for how is it that i remain here without finding them in fact why do i think to find them anyway perhaps it is best if you dont he answered you merely want to see dublin i have told you stories about it and we have seized the excuse to visit that will flatter our hosts and be easy enough to believe its a beautiful city and has a character that is unique she did not argue but she felt that nothing very much would happen if she did not ask questions polite interest could be very easily brushed aside and met with polite and uninformative answers charlotte collected her cape and they left molesworth street and in the pleasant spring evening walked in companionable silence the half a mile to the house of fiachra mcdaid narraway knocked on the carved mahogany door and after a few moments it was opened by an elegant man wearing a casual velvet jacket of dark green he was quite tall but even under the drape of the fabric charlotte could see that he was a little plump around the middle in the lamplight by the front door his features were melancholy but as soon as he recognised narraway his expression lit with a vitality that made him startlingly attractive it was difficult to know his age from his face but he had white wings to his black hair so charlotte judged him to be close to fifty victor he said cheerfully holding out his hand and grasping narraways fiercely wonderful invention the telephone but theres nothing like seeing someone he turned to charlotte and you must be mrs pitt come to our queen of cities for the first time welcome it will be my pleasure to show you some of it ill pick the best bits and the best people therell be time only to taste it and no more your whole life wouldnt be long enough for all of it come in and have a drink before we start out he held the door wide and after a glance at narraway charlotte accepted inside the rooms were elegant very georgian in appearance they could easily have been in any good area of london except perhaps for some of the pictures on the walls and a certain character to the silver goblets on the mantel she was interested in the subtle differences but it would be discourteous to stare he would not know she admired it rather than criticised and they had no time for such indulgence anyway youll be wanting to go to the theatre fiachra mcdaid went on looking at charlotte it was a discreet regard passing as no more than courteous interest but she noticed that he was studying her quite carefully he offered her sherry which she merely sipped she needed a very clear head and she had eaten little naturally she answered with a smile i could hardly hold my head up in society at home if i came to dublin and did not visit the theatre with a touch of satisfaction she saw an instant of puzzlement in his eyes it had been a trivial remark such as a woman might make who cares what others thought of her rather than who she was to herself not a person narraway would befriend by choice what had he told this man of her for that matter what did fiachra mcdaid know of narraway she had asked but he had not answered the look in mcdaids eyes quickly masked told her that it was quite a lot she smiled not to charm but in her own amusement he saw it and understoodyes most certainly he knew quite a lot about narraway i imagine everybody of interest is at the theatre at one time or another she said aloud indeed mcdaid nodded his head and many will be there at dinner tonight at the home of john and bridget tyrone it will be my pleasure to introduce you to them it is a short carriage ride from here but certainly too far to return you to molesworth street on foot at what may well be a very late hour it sounds an excellent arrangement she accepted she turned to narraway i shall see you at breakfast tomorrow shall we say eight oclock narraway smiled i think you might prefer we say nine he replied charlotte and fiachra mcdaid spoke of trivial things on the carriage ride which was as he had said quite short mostly he named the streets through which they were passing and mentioned a few of the famous people who had lived there at some time in their lives many she had not heard of but she did not say so although she thought he guessed sometimes he prefaced the facts with as you will know and then told her what indeed she had not known the home of john and bridget tyrone was larger than mcdaids it had a splendid entrance hall with staircases rising on both sides which curved around the walls and met in a gallery arched above the doorway into the first reception room the dining room was to the left beyond that with a table set for above twenty people charlotte was suddenly aware of being an outsider privileged to be included by some means of favour owed or returnedthere were already more than a dozen people present men in formal black and white women in exactly the same variety of colours one might have found at any fashionable london party what was different was the vitality in the air the energy of emotion in the gestures and now and then the lilt of a voice that had not been schooled out of its native music she was introduced to the hostess bridget tyrone a handsome woman with very white teeth and the most magnificent auburn hair which she had hardly bothered to dress it seemed to have escaped her attempts like autumn leaves in a gust of wind mrs pitt has come to see dublin mcdaid told her where better to begin than here is it curiosity that brings you then john tyrone asked standing at his wifes elbow a dark man with bright blue eyes sensing rebuke in the question charlotte seized the chance to begin her mission interest she corrected him with a smile she hoped was warmer than she felt it some of my grandmothers family were from this area and spoke of it with such vividness i wanted to see it for myself i regret it has taken me so long to do so i should have known it bridget said instantly look at her hair john thats an irish colour if you like now isnt it what were their names charlotte thought rapidly she had to invent but let it be as close to the truth as possible so she wouldnt forget what she had said or contradict herself and it must be useful there was no point in any of this if she learned nothing of the past bridget tyrone was waiting eyes wide charlottes mothers mother had been christine owen christina oneil she said with the same sense of abandon she might have had were she jumping into a raging river there was a moments silence she had an awful thought that there might really be such a person how on earth would she get out of it if there were oneil bridget repeated sure enough there are oneils around here plenty of themyoull find someone who knew her no doubt unless of course they left in the famine only god himself knows how many thatd be come now let me introduce you to our other guests because youll not be knowing them charlotte accompanied her obediently and was presented to one couple after another she struggled to remember unfamiliar names trying hard to say something reasonably intelligent and at the same time gain some sense of the gathering and whom she should seek to know better she must tell narraway something more useful than that she had gained an entry to dublin society at that rate it could take half a year before she acquired any information that led to finding who had betrayed him into the wilderness she introduced her fictitious grandmother again really talulla lawless said with surprise raising her thin black eyebrows as soon as charlotte mentioned the name now as determined to be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb she would gain nothing by timidity and time was short you sound fond of her talulla continued she was a slender woman almost bony but with marvellous eyes wide and bright and of a shade neither blue nor green charlotte thought of the only grandmother she knew and found impossibly cantankerous she told me wonderful stories of dublin society of the intrigue she lied confidently i dare say they were a little exaggerated but there was a truth in them of the heart even if events were a trifle inaccurate in the retelling talulla exchanged a brief glance with a fairhaired man called phelim oconor but it was so quick that charlotte barely saw it am i mistaken charlotte asked apologetically oh no talulla assured her that would be long ago no doubt charlotte swallowed yes about twenty years i think there was a cousin she wrote to often or it maybe it was her cousins wife a very beautiful woman so my grandmama said she tried rapidly to calculate the age kate oneil would be were she still alive perhaps a second cousin she amended that would allow for a considerable variation twenty years ago phelim oconnor said slowly a lot of trouble then but you wouldnt be knowing that in london might have seemed romantic to your grandmother charles stewart parnell and all that god rest his soul other peoples griefs can be like that his face was smooth almost innocent but there was a darkness in his voice im sorry charlotte said quietly i didnt mean to touch on something painful do you think perhaps i shouldnt ask she looked from phelim to talulla and back again he gave a very slight shrug no doubt youll hear anyway if your cousins wife was kate oneil shes dead now god forgive her how can you say that talulla spat the words between her teeth the muscles in her thin jaw clenched tight twenty years is nothing the blink of an eye in the history of irelands sorrows charlotte tried to look totally puzzled and guilty actually she was beginning to be a little afraid the rage in talulla was like the touch on an exposed nerve because theres been new blood and new tears since then phelim answered speaking to talulla not charlotte and new issues to address he left the sentence hanging as if there were more to say good manners might have dictated that charlotte apologise again and withdraw leaving them to deal with the memories in their own way but she thought of pitt in france alone trusting in narraway to back him up she feared there were only narraways enemies in lisson grove now people who might so easily be pitts enemies too good manners were a luxury for another time is there some tragedy my grandmother knew nothing of she asked innocently im sorry if i have woken an old bereavement or injustice i certainly did not mean to im so sorry talulla looked at her with undisguised harshness a slight flush in her sallow cheeks if your grandmothers cousin was kate oneil she trusted an englishman an agent of the queens government who courted her flattered her into telling him her own peoples secrets then betrayed her to be murdered by those whose trust she gave away oconor winced i dare say she loved him we can all be fools for love he said wryly i dare say she did talulla snarled but that son of a whore never loved her and with half a drop of loyalty in her blood shed have known that shed have won his secrets then put a knife in his belly he might have been able to charm the fish out of the sea but he was her peoples enemy and she knew that she got what she deserved she turned and moved away sharply her dark head high and stiff her back ramrod straight and she made no attempt to offer even a glance backward youll have to forgive talulla oconor said ruefully anyone would think shed loved the man herself and it was twenty years ago i must remember never to flirt with her if she fell for my charm i might wake up dead of it he shrugged not that itd be likely god help me he did not add anything more but his expression said all the rest then with a sudden smile like spring sun through the drifting rain he told her about the place where he had been born and the little town to the north where he had grown up and his first visit to dublin when he had been six i thought it was the grandest place id ever seen he said with a smile street after street of buildings each one fit to be the palace of a king and some so wide it was a journey just to cross from one side to another suddenly talullas hatred was no more than a lapse in manners and was easily forgotten as someone accidentally knocking your elbow and spilling your wine but she did not forget it oconors sudden charm had been as much a desire to hide something he was ashamed to expose in front of a stranger as his own clear love for the lyrical voice of his countrymen she was certain that he would find talulla afterwards and when they were alone berate her for allowing a foreigner and an englishwoman at that to see a part of their history that should have been kept private it was like a family airing soiled linen where any passerby could see it and read their secrets the party continued the food was excellent the wine flowed generously there was laughter sharp and poignant wit even music as the evening approached midnight but charlotte did not forget the emotion she had seen and the hatred she rode home in the carriage with fiachra mcdaid and in spite of his gentle enquiries she said nothing except how much she had enjoyed the hospitality and did anyone know your cousin he asked dublins a small town when it comes to it i dont think so she answered easily but i may find trace of her later oneil is not a rare name and anyway it doesnt matter very much now theres something i doubt our friend victor would agree with he said candidly i had the notion it mattered to him rather a lot was i wrong then do you suppose for the first time in the evening she spoke the absolute truth i think maybe you know him a great deal better than i do mr mcdaid we have met only in one set of circumstances and that does not give a very complete picture of a person do you think in the darkness inside the carriage she could not read his expression and yet i have the distinct idea that he is fond of you mrs pitt mcdaid replied am i wrong in that too do you suppose i dont do much supposing mr mcdaid at least not aloud she said the certainty was increasing inside her that it was narraway of whom talulla had been speaking when she referred to kate oneils betrayal both of her country and of her husband because she had loved a man who had used her and who then allowed her to be murdered for it then she remembered what phelim oconor had said of narraway and she wondered how much she really knew him there must be more to the story there always was but would it make the tragedy and the ugliness of it any better narraway had said cormac oneil had sought revenge the only mystery was why he had waited twenty years for it pitt had believed in narraway charlotte knew that without doubt but she also knew that pitt thought well of most people even if he accepted that they were complex capable of cowardice greed and violence but had he ever understood any of the darkness within narraway the human beneath the fighter against his countrys enemies they were so different narraway was subtle where pitt was instinctive he understood people because he could imagine himself in their place he understood weakness fear he had felt need and knew how powerful it could be but he also understood gratitude narraway had offered him dignity purpose and a means to feed his family when he had desperately needed it he would never forget that was he also just a little naive she remembered with a smile how disillusioned he had been when he had discovered the shabby behaviour of the prince of wales she had felt his shame for a man he thought should have been better he had believed more in the honour of his calling than the man did himself she loved pitt intensely for that even in the moment she understood it narraway would never have been misled he would have expected roughly what he eventually found he might have been disappointed but he would not have been hurt had he ever been hurt could he have loved kate oneil and still used her not as charlotte understood love but then perhaps narraway always put duty first maybe he was feeling a deep and insuperable pain for the first time because he was robbed of the one thing he valued his work in which his identity was so bound up why on earth was she riding through the dark streets of a strange city with a man she had never seen before tonight taking absurd risks telling lies in order to help a man of whom she knew so little why did she ache with a loss for him because she imagined how she would feel if he were like her and he was not she imagined he cared about her because she had seen it in his face in unguarded moments it was probably loneliness she saw an instant of lingering for a love he would only find an encumbrance if he actually had it i hear talulla lawless gave you a little display of her temper mcdaid interrupted her thoughts im sorry for that her wounds are deep and she sees no need to hide them but it is hardly your fault but then there are always casualties of war the innocent often as much as the guilty she turned to look at his face in the momentary light of a passing carriage lamp his eyes were bright his mouth twisted in a sad little smile then the darkness shadowed him again and she was aware of him only as a soft voice a presence beside her the smell of fabric and a faint sharpness of tobacco of course she agreed very quietly they reached molesworth street and the carriage stopped thank you mr mcdaid she said with perfect composure it was most gracious of you to have me invited and to accompany me dublins hospitality is all that has been said of it and believe me that is high praise we have just begun he replied warmly give victor my regards and tell him we shall continue i wont rest until you think this is the fairest city on earth and the irish the best people which of course we are in spite of our passion and our troubles you cant hate us you know he said it with a smile that was wide and bright in the lamplight not the way you hate us anyway she agreed gently but then we have no cause good night mr mcdaid chapter five charlotte faced narraway across the breakfast table in mrs hogans quiet house the next morning her mind still in conflict as to what she would say to him she needed far more time to weigh what she had heard although even that might not help very enjoyable she answered his enquiry as to the previous evening and she realised with surprise how much that was true it was a long time since she had been at a party of such ease and sophistication although this was dublin not london society was not very different there were no other guests in the dining room this late in the morning most of the other tables had already been set with clean laceedged linen ready for the evening she concentrated on the generous plate of food before her it contained far more than she needed for good health they were most kind to me she added nonsense he replied quietly she looked up startled by his abruptness he was smiling but the sharp morning light showed very clearly the tiredness in his face and something that might even have been fear her resolve to lie to him wavered there were many ways in which he was unreadable but not in the deepetched lines in his face or the hollows around his eyes all right she conceded they were hospitable and a certain glamour in it was fun is that more precise he was amused he gave nothing so obvious as a smile but his expression was just as plain to her whom did you meet apart from fiachra of course youve known him a long time she asked remembering mcdaids words with a slight chill why do you say that he took more toast and buttered it he had eaten very little she wondered if he had slept because he asked me nothing about you she answered but he seems very willing to help a good friend he replied looking straight at her she smiled nonsense she said with exactly the same inflexion he had used touche he acknowledged you are right but we have known each other a long time isnt ireland full of people you have known a long time he put a little marmalade on his toast she waited yes he agreed but i do not know the allegiances of most of them if fiachra mcdaid is a friend what do you need me for she asked bluntly suddenly to learn that seemed very urgent was she a diversion someone to watch while he did the real discovering then a worse thought occurred to her perhaps he did not want her in london where pitt could reach her just how complicated was this and how ugly where was the embezzled money now was it really about money and not old vengeances at all or was it both it was more urgent than ever that she learn the truth or at least all of it that still shadowed the present he had not answered because you are using me or both of us with selected lies she suggested he winced as if the blow had been physical as well as emotional i am not lying to you charlotte his voice was so quiet she had to lean forward a little to catch his words i am being highly selective about how much of the truth i tell you and the difference is she asked he sighed you are a good detective in your own way almost as good as pitt but special branch work is very different from ordinary domestic murder domestic murder isnt always ordinary she contradicted him human love and hate very seldom are people kill for all sorts of reasons but it is usually to gain or protect something they value passionately or it is outrage at some violation they cannot bear and i do not mean necessarily a physical one the emotional or spiritual wounds can be far harder to recover from i apologise he responded i should have said that the alliances and loyalties stretch in far more complicated ways brothers can be on opposite sides as can husband and wife rivals can help each other even die for each other if allied in the cause and the casualties are the innocent as well as the guilty she echoed mcdaids words my role is easy enough i would like to help you but i am bound by everything in my nature to help my husband and of course myself i had no idea you were so pragmatic he said with a slight smile i am a woman i have a finite amount of money and i have children a degree of pragmatism is necessary she spoke gently to take the edge from the sting in her words he finished spreading his marmalade so you will understand that fiachra is my friend in some things but i will not be able to count on him if the answer should turn out to be different from the one i suppose there is one you suppose i told you i think cormac oneil has found the perfect way to be revenged on me and has taken it for something that happened twenty years ago she questioned the irish have the longest memories in europe he bit into the toast and the greatest patience too she said with disbelief people take action because something somewhere has changed crimes of state have that in common with ordinary domestic murders something new has caused oneil or whoever it is to do this now perhaps it has only just become possible or it may be that for him now is the right time narraway ate the whole of his toast before replying of course you are right the trouble is that i dont know which of those reasons it is ive studied the situation in ireland and i cant see any reason at all for oneil to do this now she ignored her tea an unpleasant thought occurred to her chilling and very immediate wouldnt oneil know that this would bring you here she asked narraway stared at her you think oneil wants me here im sure if killing me were his purpose he would have come to london and done it if i thought it was simply murder i wouldnt have let you come with me charlotte even if pitts livelihood rests on my return to office please give me credit for thinking that far ahead im sorry she apologised i thought bringing someone that nobody would see as assisting you might be the best way of getting round thatyou never suggested it would be comfortable or easy and you cannot prevent me from coming to ireland if i want to he was not pitts superior any more he was simply a clever and dangerous man who had been a good friend and was now in trouble of his own i had to tell you something of the situation for pitts sake he said for your own i cannot tell you all that i know of ireland or anywhere else i dont know any reason why oneil should choose now but then i dont know any reason why anyone should it is unarguable that someone with strong connections in dublin has chosen to steal the money i sent for mulhare and so bring about the poor mans death then they made certain it was evident first to austwick and then to croxdale and so brought about my dismissal he poured more tea for himself perhaps it was not oneil who initiated it he may simply have been willingly used ive made many enemies knowledge and power both make that inevitable then think of other enemies charlotte urged whose circumstances have changed is there anyone you were about to expose my dear do you think i havent thought of that and you still believe it is oneil perhaps it is a guilty conscience he gave a smile so brief it reached barely his eyes and was gone againthe wicked flee where no man pursueth he quoted but there is knowledge in this that only people familiar with the case could have oh she poured herself more tea then we had better learn more about oneil he was mentioned yesterday evening i told them that my grandmother was christina oneil he swallowed and who was she really christine owen she replied he started to laugh and she heard the raw note in it just a little out of control too close to sadness she said nothing but finished her toast and then the rest of her tea charlotte spent the morning and most of the afternoon quietly reading as much as she could of irish history realising the vast gap in her knowledge and a little ashamed of it ireland was geographically so close to england and because the english had occupied it one way or another for so many centuries in their minds its individuality had been swallowed up in the general tide of british history the empire covered a quarter of the world englishmen tended to think of ireland as part of their own small piece of it linked by a common language disregarding the existence of the irish tongue and of course by the crown and the government in london so many of irelands greatest sons had made their names on the world stage indistinguishably from the english everyone knew oscar wilde was irish even though his plays were absolutely english in their setting they probably knew jonathan swift was irish but did they know it of bram stoker the creator of the monstrous count dracula did they know it of the great duke of wellington victor of waterloo and later prime minister the fact that these men had left ireland in their youth did not in any way alter their heritage her own family was not angloirish but in pretending to have a grandmother who was perhaps she should be a little more sensitive to peoples feelings and treat the whole subject less casually by evening she was again dressed in her one black gown this time with different jewellery and different gloves and her hair decorated with an ornament emily had given her years ago then she was worried that she was overdressed for the theatre perhaps other people would be far less formal they were a highly literate culture educated in words and ideas but also very familiar with them they may not consider an evening at the theatre a social affair but an intellectual and emotional one they might think she was trivialising it by making such an issue of her own appearance when it was the players who mattered she took the ornament out of her hair and then had to restyle it not to look as if it were incomplete all of which meant she was late and flustered when narraway knocked on the door to tell her that fiachra mcdaid was here to escort her for the evening again thank you she said putting the comb down quickly and knocking several loose hairpins onto the floor she ignored them he looked at her with anxiety are you all right yes it is simply an indecision as to what to wear she dismissed it with a slight gesture he regarded her carefully his eyes travelled from her shoes which were visible beneath the hem of her gown all the way to the crown of her head she felt the heat burn up her face at the candid appreciation in his eyes you made the right decision he pronounced diamonds would have been inappropriate here they take their drama very seriously she drew in a breath to say that she had no diamonds and realised he was laughing at her she wondered if he would have given a woman diamonds if he loved her she thought not if he were capable of that sort of love it would have been something more personal more imaginative music a cottage by the sea however small a carving of a bird im so glad she said meeting his eyes i thought diamonds were too trivial she accepted his arm laying her fingers so lightly on the fabric of his jacket that he could not have felt her touch fiachra mcdaid was as elegant and graceful as the previous evening although on this occasion dressed less formally he greeted charlotte with apparent pleasure at seeing her again even so soon he expressed his willingness to help her to understand as much of irish theatre as was possible for an englishwoman to grasp he smiled at charlotte as he said it as if it were some secret aside that she already understood it was some time since she had been to the theatre at all it was not an art form pitt was particularly fond of and she did not like going without him even though occasionally she went with emily and jack and enjoyed it enormously what was most fun was to go with aunt vespasia but vespasia was presently so very distressed over the outcry against oscar wilde and the whole case between himself and lord queensberry that she had not felt inclined to visit the theatre at all here in dublin it was quite different from london the theatre building itself was smaller indeed there was an intimacy to it that made it less an occasion to be seen and more of an adventure in which to participate mcdaid introduced her to various of his own friends who greeted him they seemed very varied in age and apparent social status as if he had chosen them from as many walks of life as possible mrs pitt he explained cheerfully she is over from london to see how we do things here mostly from an interest in our fair city but in part to see if she can find some irish ancestry and who can blame her is there anyone of wit or passion who wouldnt like to claim a bit of irish blood in their veins she responded warmly to the welcome extended her finding the exchanges easy even comfortable she had forgotten how interesting it was to meet new people with new ideas but she did wonder exactly what narraway had told mcdaid from the way he answered the enquiries of one or two more curious ladies again charlotte thought perhaps he knew quite a lot more than narraway had implied she searched his face and saw nothing in it but good humour interest amusement and a blank wall of guarded intelligence that intended to give away nothing at all they were very early for the performance but most of the audience were already present while mcdaid was talking charlotte had an opportunity to look around and study faces they were different from a london audience only in subtle ways there were fewer fair heads fewer blunt anglosaxon features a greater sense of tension and suppressed energy and of course she heard the music of a different accent and now and then people speaking in a language utterly unrecognisable to her there was in them nothing of the latin or normanfrench about the words or the german from which so much english was derived she assumed it was the native tongue she could only guess at what they said by the gestures the laughter and the expression in faces she noticed one in particular his hair was black with a loose heavy wave streaked with grey his head was narrowboned and it was not until he turned towards her that she saw how dark his eyes were his nose was noticeably crooked giving his whole aspect a lopsided look a kind of wounded intensity then he turned away as if he had not seen her and she was relieved she had been staring and that was illmannered no matter how interesting a person might seem you saw him mcdaid observed so quietly it was little more than a whisper she was taken aback saw him who cormac oneil he replied she was startled had she been so very obvious was that i mean the man with the then she did not know how to finish the sentence haunted face he said it for her i wasnt going to she saw in his eyes that she was denying it pointlessly either narraway had told him or he had pieced it together himself it made her wonder how many others knew indeed if all those involved might well know more than she and her pretence was deceiving no one did narraway know that or was he as naive in this as she do you know him she asked instead i mcdaid raised his eyebrows ive met him of course but know him hardly at all i didnt mean in any profound sense she parried merely were you acquainted in the past i thought so he was watching cormac while seeming not to but tragedy changes people or then on the other hand perhaps it only shows you what was always there simply not yet uncovered how much does one know anybody most of all oneself very metaphysical she said drily and the answer is that you can make a guess more or less educated depending on your intelligence and your experience with that person he looked at her steadily victor said you were direct she found it odd to hear narraway referred to by his given name instead of the formality she was used to the slight distance that leadership required now she was not sure if she were on the brink of offending mcdaid on the other hand if she were too timid even to approach what she really wanted she would lose the chance she smiled at him what was oneil like when you knew him mcdaids eyes widened victor didnt tell you how interesting did you expect him to have she asked why is he asking why now he sat absolutely still all around him people were moving adjusting position smiling waving finding seats nodding agreement to something or other waving to friends perhaps you know him well enough to ask him that she suggested again he countered dont you she kept her smile warm faintly amused of course but i would not repeat his answer you must know him well enough to believe he would not confide in someone he could not trust so perhaps we both know and neither will trust the other he mused how absurd how vulnerable and incredibly human indeed the convention of many comic plays to judge by cormac oneils face for him at least it was a tragedy she countered one of the casualties of war that you referred to he looked at her steadily and for a moment the buzz of conversation around them ceased to exist so he was he said softly but that was twenty years ago does one forget irishmen never do the english sometimes she replied of course you could hardly remember them all then he caught himself immediately and his expression changed do you want to meet him he asked yes please then you shall he promised there was a rustle of anticipation in the audience and everyone fell silent after a moment or two the curtain rose and the play began charlotte concentrated on it so that she could speak intelligently when she was introduced to people in the interval to know nothing would imply that she was uninterested which would be unforgivable here she found it difficult there were frequent references to events she was not familiar with even words she did not know there was an underlying air of sadness as if the main characters knew that the ending would include a loss that nothing could ever alter no matter what they said or did was that how cormac oneil felt helpless predestined to be overwhelmed everybody lost people they loved bereavement was a part of life the only escape was to love no one she stopped trying to understand the drama on the stage and as discreetly as she could she studied oneil he seemed to be alone he looked neither to right nor left of him and the people on either side seemed to be with others not once all the time she was watching did they speak to oneil or he to them not even to glance and catch the eye at some particularly poignant line on the stage or a moment when the audience seemed utterly in the grasp of the players the longer she watched him the more totally alone did he seem to be but she was equally sure that neither did he look bored his eyes never strayed from the stage yet at times his expression did not reflect the drama she wondered what was passing through his mind other times and events other tragedies related to this only in the depth of their feeling by the time the interval came charlotte was moved by the passion she could not escape which emanated from the players and audience alike but also confused by it it made her feel more sharply than the lilt of a different accent or even the sound of another language that she was in a strange place teeming with emotions she caught and lost again may i take you to get something to drink mcdaid asked her when the curtain fell and the lights were bright again and perhaps to meet one or two more of my friends im sure they are dying of curiosity to know who you are and of course how i know you i would be delighted she answered and how do you know me we had better be accurate or it will start people talking she smiled to rob the words of offence but surely the sole purpose of coming to the theatre with a beautiful woman is to start people talking he raised his eyebrows otherwise one would be better to come alone like cormac oneil and concentrate on the play without distraction thank you im flattered to imagine i could distract you she inclined her head a little enjoying the trivial play of words especially from so intense a drama the actors are superb i have no idea what they are talking about at least half the time and yet i am conquered by their emotions are you sure you are not irish he pressed not sure at all perhaps i am and i should simply look harder but please do not tell mr oneil that my grandmothers name was oneil also or i shall be obliged to admit that i know very little about her and that would make me seem very discourteous as if i did not wish to own that part of my heritage the truth is i simply did not realise how interesting it would be i shall not tell him if you dont wish me to mcdaid promised but you have not told me how we met she reminded him i saw you across a room and asked a mutual acquaintance to introduce us he said is that not always how one meets a woman one sees and admires i imagine it is but what room was it was it here in ireland i imagine not since i have been here only a couple of days but have you been to london lately she smiled at him or ever for that matter of course ive been to london do you think i am some provincial bumpkin he shrugged only once mind you i did not care for it nor it for me it was so huge so crowded with people and yet at the same time anonymousyou could live and die there and never be seen but i have been in dublin only a couple of days she repeated to fill the silence then i was bewitched at first sight he said reasonably suddenly smiling again im sorry i insulted your home it was unforgivable call it my own inadequacy in the midst of three million english oh quite a few irishmen believe me she said with a smile and none of them in the least inadequate he bowed and i accepted your invitation because i was flattered and irresponsible she challenged you are quite right he conceded we must have mutual friends some highly respectable aunt i dare say do you have any such relations my greataunt vespasia by marriage if she recommended you i would accompany you anywhere on earth she responded unhesitatingly she sounds charming she is believe me if you had met her really you would not dare to treat me other than with the utmost respect where did i meet this formidable lady lady vespasia cumminggould it doesnt matter any surroundings would be instantly forgotten once you had seen her but london will do vespasia cumminggould he turned the name over on his tongue it seems to find an echo in my mind it has set bells ringing all over europe she told him you had better be aware that she is of an indeterminate age but her hair is silver and she walks like a queen she was the most beautiful and most outrageous woman of her generation if you dont know that they will know that you never met her i am now most disappointed that i did not he offered her his arm she accepted it and together they walked down to the room where refreshments were already being served and the audience had gathered to greet friends and exchange views on the performance there were several minutes of pleasant exchange before mcdaid introduced charlotte to a woman with wildly curling hair named dolina pearse and a man of unusual height whom he addressed as ardal barralet beside them but apparently not with them was cormac oneil oneil mcdaid said with surprise havent seen you for some time how are you barralet turned as if he had not noticed oneil standing so close as to brush coattails with him evening oneil enjoying the performance excellent dont you think he said casually oneil had either to answer or offer an unmistakable rebuff very polished he said looking straight back at barralet his voice was unusually deep and soft as if he too were an actor caressing the words he did not even glance at charlotte good evening mrs pearse he acknowledged dolina good evening mr oneil she said coldly you know fiachra mcdaid barralet filled in the sudden silence but perhaps not mrs pitt she is newly arrived in dublin how do you do mrs pitt oneil said politely but without interest mcdaid he looked at with a sudden blaze of emotion in his eyes mcdaid stared back at him calmly and the moment passed charlotte wondered if she had seen it or imagined it what brings you to dublin mrs pitt dolina enquired clearly out of a desire to relieve the tension by changing the subject there was no interest either in her voice or her face good report of the city charlotte replied i have made a resolution that i will no longer keep on putting off into the future the good things that can be done today how very english dolina murmured and virtuous she added the word as if it were insufferably boring charlotte felt her temper flare she looked straight back at dolina if it is virtuous to come to dublin then i have been misled she said drily i was hoping it was going to be fun mcdaid laughed sharply his face lighting with sudden amusement it depends how you take your pleasures my dear oscar wilde poor soul is one of us of course and he made the world laugh for years we have tried to be as like the english as we can now at last we are finding ourselves and we take our theatre packed with anguish poetry and triple meanings you can dwell on whichever one suits your mood but most of them are doomladen as if our fate is in blood if we laugh it is at ourselves and as a stranger you might find it impolite to join in that explains a great deal she thanked him with a little nod of her head she was aware that oneil was watching her possibly because she was the only one in the group he did not already know but she wanted to engage in some kind of conversation with him this was the man narraway believed had contrived his betrayal what on earth could she say that did not sound forced she looked directly at him obliging him either to listen or deliberately to snub her perhaps i sounded a bit trivial when i spoke of fun she said halfapologetically i like my pleasure spiced with thought and even a puzzle or two so the flavour of it will last a drama is superficial if one can understand everything in it in one evening dont you think the hardness in his face softened then you will leave ireland a happy woman he told her you will certainly not understand us in a week or a month probably not in a year because i am english or because you are so complex she pursued because we dont understand ourselves most of the time he replied with the slightest lift of one shoulder no one does she returned now they were speaking as if there were no one else in the room the tedious people are the ones who think they do we can be tedious by perpetually trying to aloud he smiled and the light of it utterly changed his face but we do it poetically it is when we begin to repeat ourselves that we try peoples patience but doesnt history repeat itself like variations on a theme she said each generation each artist adds a different note but the underlying tune is the same englands is in a major key his mouth twisted as he spoke lots of brass and percussion irelands is minor woodwind and the dying chord perhaps a violin solo now and then he was watching her intently as if it were a game they were playing and one of them would lose did he already know who she was and that she had come with narraway and why she tried to dismiss the thought as absurd and then she remembered that someone had already outwitted narraway which was a very considerable feat it required not only passion for revenge but a high intelligence most frightening of all it needed connections in lisson grove sufficiently wellplaced and disloyal to have put the money in narraways bank account suddenly the game seemed a great deal more serious charlotte was aware that because of her hesitation dolina was watching her curiously as well and fiachra mcdaid was standing at her elbow i always think the violin sounds so much like the human voice she said with a smile dont you mr oneil surprise flickered for a moment in his eyes he had been expecting her to say something different perhaps more defensive did you not expect the heroes of ireland to sound human he asked her but there was a bleak selfconscious humour in his eyes at his own melodrama not entirely she avoided looking at mcdaid or dolina in case their perception brought her and oneil back to reality i had thought of something heroic even supernatural touche mcdaid said softly he took charlotte by the arm holding her surprisingly hard she could not have shaken him off even had she wished to we must take our seats he excused them and led her away after only the briefest farewell she nearly asked him if she had offended someone but she did not want to hear the answer nor did she intend to apologise as soon as she resumed her seat she realised that it offered her as good a view of the rest of the audience as it did of the stage she glanced at mcdaid and saw in his expression that he had arranged it so intentionally but she did not comment they were only just in time for the curtain going up and immediately the drama recaptured their attention she found it difficult to follow because although the emotion in it was intense there were so many allusions to history and to legend with which she was not familiar that half the meaning was lost to her perhaps because of that she began to look at the audience again to catch something of their reaction and follow a little more john and bridget tyrone were in a box almost opposite with the intimate size of the theatre she could see their faces quite clearly he was watching the stage leaning a little forward as if not to miss a word bridget glanced at him then seeing his absorption turned away her gaze swept around the audience charlotte put up the opera glasses mcdaid had lent her not to see the stage but to hide her own eyes and keep watching bridget tyrone bridgets searching stopped when she saw a man in the audience below her to her left from where she was she must see his profile to charlotte all that was visible was the back of his head but she was certain she had seen him before she could not remember where bridget remained staring at him as if willing him to look back at her on the stage the drama heightened charlotte was only dimly aware of it for her the emotional concentration was in the audience john tyrone was still watching the players in the audience at last the man turned and looked back up at the boxes one after the other until he found bridget it was phelim oconor as soon as she saw his profile charlotte knew him he remained with his eyes fixed on bridget his face unreadable bridget looked away just as her husband became aware of her again and switched his attention from the stage they spoke to each other briefly in the audience below oconor turned back to the stage his neck was stiff his head unmoving in spite of the scene in front of them reaching a climax where the actors all but hurled themselves at each other in the second interval mcdaid took charlotte back outside to the bar where once more refreshments were liberally served the conversation buzzed about the play was it well performed was it true to the intention of the author had the main actor misinterpreted his role charlotte listened trying to fix her expression in an attitude of intelligent observation actually she was watching to see who else she recognised among those queuing for drinks or talking excitedly to people they knew all of them were strangers to her and yet in a way they were familiar many were so like those she had known before her marriage that she halfexpected them to recognise her it was an odd feeling pleasant and nostalgic even though she would have changed nothing of her present life are you enjoying the play mcdaid asked her they drifted towards the bar counter where cormac oneil had a glass of whiskey in his hand did mcdaid know how little she had watched it he might very well she did not want either to lie to him or to tell him the truth now oneil was also waiting for her answer with curiosity i am enjoying the whole experience she replied i am most grateful that you brought me i could not have come alone nor would i have found it half so pleasant i am delighted you enjoy it mcdaid replied with a smile i was not sure that you would the play ends with a superb climax all very dark and dreadful you wont understand much of it at all is that the purpose of it she asked looking from mcdaid to oneil and back again to puzzle us all so much that we will be obliged to spend weeks or months trying to work out what it really means perhaps we will come up with half a dozen different possibilities for a moment there was surprise and admiration in mcdaids eyes then he masked it and the slightly bantering tone returned i think perhaps you overrate us at least this time i rather believe the playwright himself has no such subtle purpose in mind what meanings did you suppose oneil asked softly he had said it as if it were mere conversation to amuse during the interval but she thought he was probing to learn something deeper oh ask me in a months time mr oneil she said casually there is anger in it of course anyone can see that there seems to me also to be a sense of predestination as if we all have little choice as if birth determines our reactions i dislike that i dont wish to feel so controlled by fate you are english you like to imagine you are the masters of history in ireland we have learned that history masters us he responded and the bitterness in his tone was laced with irony and laughter but underneath the pain was plainly real it was on her tongue to contradict him then she realised her opportunity really if i understand the play rightly it is about a certain inevitability in love and betrayal that is quite universal a sort of darker and older romeo and juliet oneils face tightened and even in the lamplight of the crowded room charlotte could see his colour pale is that what you see his voice was thick almost choking on the words you romanticise mrs pitt now the bitterness in him was clearly overwhelming do i she asked him moving aside to allow a couple arm in arm to pass by them in so doing she deliberately stepped close to oneil so he could not leave without pushing her aside what harder realities should i see rivalry between opposing sides families divided a love that cannot be fulfilled betrayal and death i dont think i really find that romantic except for us as we sit in the audience watching for the people involved it must be anything but he stared at her his eyes hollow with a kind of black despair she could believe very easily that narraway was right and oneil had nursed a hatred for twenty years until fate had given him a way to avenge it but what was it that had changed and what are you mrs pitt he asked standing close to her and speaking so mcdaid almost certainly would not hear him audience or player are you here to watch the blood and tears of ireland or to meddle in them like your friend narraway she was stunned she had no idea how to answer for a moment the rest of the crowd were just a babble of noise they could as easily have been a field full of geese was there any point at all in pretence surely now to feign innocence would be ridiculous i would like to be a deus ex machina she replied but i imagine thats impossible god from a machine he said with an angry shrug you want to descend at the last act and arrange an impossible ending that solves it all how very english and how absurd and supremely arrogant you are twenty years too late tell victor that when you see him theres nothing left to mend any more he turned away before she could answer again pushing past her and spilling what was left of his whiskey as he bumped into a broad man in a blue coat the moment after he was gone charlotte was aware of mcdaid next to her and a certain air of discomfort about him im sorry she apologised there was no point in trying to explain reasons did not matter and she did not know how much mcdaid was aware of either narraways present trouble or his part in oneils past tragedies i allowed myself to express my opinions too freely he bit his lip you couldnt know it but the subject of irish freedom and traitors to the cause is painfully close to oneil it was through his family that our great plan was betrayed twenty years ago he winced we never knew for sure by whom sean oneil murdered his wife kate and was hanged for it even though it was because she was the one who told the english our plans some thought it was because sean found her with another man either way we failed again and the bitterness still lasts murder and then hanging no wonder oneil was bitter and the grief had never died and narraway still felt the guilt weigh dark and heavy on him also it was an uprising that you intended she asked quietly she heard the chatter around her of course mcdaid replied his voice carefully ironed of all expression so it sounded unnaturally flat home rule was in the very air we breathed then we could have been ourselves without the weight of england around our necks is that how you see it she turned as she spoke and looked at him searching his face his expression softened he smiled back at her rueful and a little selfdeprecating i did at the time seeing cormac brings it back but im coolerheaded now there are better places to put ones energy causes less narrow she was aware of the colour and whisper of fabric around them silk against silk they were surrounded by people in one of the most interesting capital cities in the world come out to an evening at the theatre some of them at least were also men and women who saw themselves living under a foreign oppression in their own land and some of them at least were willing to kill and to die to throw it off she looked just like them cast of feature tone of skin and hair and yet she was not she was different in heart and mind what causes she asked with interest his smile widened as if to brush it aside social injustices oldfashioned laws to reform he replied greater equality exactly the same as no doubt you fight for at home i hear there are some great women in london battling for all manner of things perhaps one day you will tell me about some of them he made it a question as if he were interested enough to require an answer of course she said lightly trying to master facts in her mind so she could answer sensibly if the necessity arose he took her arm as people milled around her returning to their seats courteous hospitable full of dry wit and a passion for life how easy and dangerous it would be for her to forget that she did not belong here she particularly because her husband was in special branch and his friend victor narraway could be the man who had used kate oneil to betray her own people and destroy her family narraway was uncertain what charlotte would learn at the theatre as he walked along arran quay on the north bank of the liffey his head down into the warm damp breeze off the water he was afraid that she would discover a few things about him that he would very much rather she did not know but he knew no way to help that he knew from fiachra mcdaid that she would meet cormac oneil and perhaps judge some depth of his hatred and the reasons for it he smiled bitterly as he pictured her pursuing it testing pushing until she found the facts behind the pain would she be disillusioned to hear his part in it all or was that his vanity his own feelings that she cared enough for him that disillusion was even possible let alone would wound her he would never forget the days after kates death worst was the morning they hanged sean the brutality and the grief of that had cast a chill over all the years since why had he exposed himself to the hurt of charlotte learning anything about it perhaps because he was afraid she would and he would rather deal the blow himself than endure the waiting for someone else to do it he should know better his years in special branch should have taught him both patience and control usually he was so good at it that people thought him a cold man charlotte thought it he knew was that the real reason why he risked her discovering so terribly that he was not he did not want her affection or her grief for him if it were based on a misconception of who he was he laughed at himself it was just a faint sound almost drowned by his quick footsteps along the stones of the quayside why at this time in his life did he care so much for the opinion of another mans wife he forced his attention to where he was going and why if he did not learn who had diverted the money meant for mulhare and placed it in his narraways own account knowing anything else about oneil was pointless someone in lisson grove had been involved he blamed none of the irish they were fighting for their own cause and at times he even sympathised with it but the man in special branch who had done this had betrayed his own people and that was different he wanted to know who it was and prove it the damage this traitor could cause would have no boundary if he hated england enough to plan and execute a way of disgracing narraway then what else might he do was his real purpose to replace him this whole business of mulhare might be no more than a means to that end but was it simply ambition or was there another darker purpose behind it as well without realising it he increased his pace moving so swiftly he almost passed the alley he was looking for he turned in and fumbled in the lightless construction of it and the uneven stones under his feet he had to feel his way along one of the walls third door he knocked sharply a quick rhythm he had brought charlotte to ireland because he wanted to but she had her own compelling reasons to be here if he was right about the traitor in lisson grove then one of the first things that person would do would be to get rid of pitt if pitt were fortunate he would simply be dismissedthere were much worse possibilities some of them passed through narraways mind as the door was opened he was let into a small extremely stuffy office piled high with ledgers account books and sheaths of loose papers a striped cat had claimed itself a space in front of the hearth and did not stir when he came in and took a seat on a chair opposite the cluttered desk ocasey sat in the chair behind it his bald head gleaming in the gaslight well narraway asked masking his eagerness as closely as he could ocasey hesitated narraway considered threatening him he still had power albeit illegal now he drew in his breath then he looked at ocaseys face again and changed his mind he had few enough friends he could not afford to alienate any of them so what is it you expect of me then ocasey asked cocking his head a little to one side ill not help you not more than i owe only for old times sake but thats little enough i know narraway agreed there were wounds and debts between them some still unpaid i need to know whats changed for cormac oneil for gods sake leave the poor man alone have you not already taken all he has ocasey exclaimed youll not be after the child will you the child for a moment narraway was at a loss then memory flooded back kates daughter by sean she had been only an infant six or seven years old when her parents died did cormac raise her he asked a little girl ocasey squinted at him contemptuously of course he didnt you fool and what would cormac oneil do with a sixyearold girl then some cousin of kates took her maureen i think her name was she and her husband raised her as their own narraway felt a stab of pity for the child kates child that should never have happened but she knows who she is he said aloud of course cormac would have told her if no one else ocasey lifted one shoulder slightly although of course it might not be the truth as you know it poor child there are things better left unsaid narraway felt chilled he had not thought of kates daughter they had been so close to the violence erupting and spreading beyond control he had thought only of preventing that he had not expected kate to die it was never planned he knew seanto deceive him in rebellion was one thing to deceive him over kate was another looking back even weeks afterwards he knew that she had crossed sides because she believed it was a doomed uprising and more irishmen would die in it than english far more but she knew sean as well he had been willing enough to use her beauty to shame narraway even lead him to his death but in his wildest imagination he had never considered that she might even give herself willingly to narraway or worse care for him and when she did it was beyond seans mind or heart to forgive he had said he killed her for ireland but narraway knew it was for himself just as in the end sean knew it too and cormac he too had loved kate did he feel an irishman bested in deviousness by an englishman in a fight where no one was fair or a man betrayed by a woman he wanted and could never have his brothers wife who had sided with the enemy for her own reasons good or bad political or personal what had he told talulla could it possibly be anything new in the last few months and if it were how could she have moved the money from mulhares account back to narraways using some traitor in lisson grove not by herself then with whom who betrayed mulhare he asked ocasey no idea ocasey answered and if i did know i wouldnt tell you a man wholl sell his own people deserves to have his thirty pieces of silver slip out of his hands deserves to have it put in a bag o lead around his neck before they throw him into dublin bay narraway had not much liked mulhare but he needed to keep his promises to whom they were made was irrelevant a broken word is as selfdefeating as a broken sword he rose to his feet the cat by the fire stretched out and then curled up on the other side thank you he said dont come back ocasey replied ill not harm you but ill not help you either i know narraway replied charlotte did not have the opportunity to speak at any length with narraway after returning from the theatre nor did she the following day they met only briefly at breakfast and there were others eating at nearby tables narraway said he had business to attend to but that he had heard from dolina pearse that charlotte would be most welcome to attend the opening of an art exhibition if she cared to and to take tea with dolina and her friends afterwards he had accepted on her behalf thank you she said a little coolly he caught the intonation and smiled did you wish to decline he asked eyebrows raised she looked at his dark face at the mercurial amusement and awareness of the absurdity of it in his eyes to have taken the slightest notice of his pride now would be idiotic he was facing disgrace and a loneliness deeper than anything she had known if he failed in this pitt too might lose his ability to support his family no of course not she replied smiling at narraway i am just a little nervous about it i met some of them at bridget tyrones party and i am not sure that the encounter was entirely amicable i can imagine he said wryly but i know you and i know something of dolina tea should be interesting and youll like the art it is impressionist i think he rose from the table victor she used his name for the first time without thinking until she saw his face the quickening the sudden vulnerability she wanted to apologise but that would only make it worse she forced herself to smile up at him where he stood half turned to leave he was naturally elegant his jacket perfectly cut his cravat tied with care she hardly knew how to begin and yet certain necessity compelled her he was waiting if i am to go to the exhibition i would like to purchase a new blouse she felt the flush of embarrassment hot in her face i did not bring of course he said quickly we will go as soon as you have finished your breakfast perhaps we should get two you cannot be seen in precisely the same costume at every function will you be ready in half an hour he glanced at the clock on the mantel good heavens i could have luncheon as well in that time i shall be ready in ten minutes she exclaimed really then i shall meet you at the front door he looked surprised and quite definitely pleased they walked perhaps three hundred yards then quite easily found a hansom to take them into the middle of the city narraway seemed to know exactly where he was going and stopped at the entrance to a very elegant couturier charlotte imagined the prices and knew that they would be beyond her budget surely narraway must know what pitt earned why was he bringing her here he opened the door for her and held it she stood where she was may we please go somewhere a little less expensive i think this is beyond what i should spend particularly on something i may not wear very often he looked surprised perhaps you have never bought a womans blouse before she said a little tartly humiliation making her tongue sharp they can be costly i wasnt proposing that you should buy it he replied it is necessary in pursuit of my business not yours it is rightly my responsibility mine also she argued may we discuss it inside he asked we are drawing attention to ourselves standing in the doorway she moved inside quickly angry with both him and herself she should have foreseen this situation and avoided it somehow an older woman came towards them dressed in a most beautifully cut black gown it had no adornment whatever the sheer elegance of it was sufficient she was the perfect advertisement for her establishment charlotte would have loved a gown that fitted so exquisitely she still had a very good figure and such a garment would have flattered her enormously she knew it and the temptation to enquire into the purchase was so sharp she could feel it like a sweet taste in her mouth may we see some elegant blouses please narraway asked suitable for attending an exhibition of art or an afternoon tea party certainly sir the woman agreed she regarded charlotte for no more than a minute assessing what might both fit and suit her then another mere instant at narraway perhaps judging what he would be prepared to pay looking at his elegant and no doubt expensive clothes charlottes heart sank the woman had probably jumped to the obvious conclusion that they were husband and wife who else would a respectable woman come shopping with for such intimate articles as a blouse she should have insisted that he take her somewhere else and wait outside except that she would have to borrow the money from him anyway victor this is impossible she said under her breath as soon as the woman was out of earshot no it isnt he contradicted her it is necessary do you want to draw attention to yourself by wearing the same clothes all the time people will notice which you know even better than i do then they will wonder what our relationship is that i do not take better care of you she tried to think of a satisfactory argument and failed or perhaps you want to give up the whole battle he suggested no of course i dont she retaliated but then be quiet and dont argue he took her arm and propelled her forward a little holding her firmly she determined to have words with him later in no uncertain fashion the woman returned with several blouses all of them beautiful if madame would care to try them there is a room available over here she offered charlotte thanked her and followed immediately every one of the garments was ravishing but the most beautiful was one in black and bronze stripes which fitted her as if it had been both designed and cut for her personally and one in white cotton and lace with ruffles and pearl buttons which was outrageously feminine even as a girl in the days when her mother was trying to marry her to someone suitable she had never felt so attractive even verging on the really beautiful temptation to have them both ached inside her like a physical hunger the woman returned to see if charlotte had made a decision or if perhaps she wished for a further selection ah she said drawing in her breath surely madame could not wish for anything lovelier charlotte hesitated glancing at the striped blouse on its hanger an excellent choice perhaps you would like to see which your husband prefers the woman suggested charlotte started to say that narraway was not her husband but she wanted to phrase it graciously and not seem to correct the woman then she saw narraway just beyond the womans shoulder and the admiration in his face for an instant it was naked vulnerable and completely without guard then he must have realised and he smiled well take them both he said decisively and turned away without contradicting him in front of the saleswoman and embarrassing them all charlotte had no alternative but to accept she stepped back closed the door and changed into her own very ordinary blouse victor you shouldnt have done that she said as soon as they were outside in the street again i have no idea how i am going to repay you he stopped and looked at her crossly for a moment suddenly his anger evaporated and she remembered the expression in his eyes only a few moments before and she was very afraid he reached up and with his fingertips touched her face it was only her cheek but it was an extraordinarily intimate gesture with a great tenderness you will repay me by helping me to clear my name he replied that is more than enough to argue would be pointlessly unkind not only to his very obvious emotion but also to the hope of success that they both needed so much then we had better set about it she agreed then moved a step away from him and started walking along the pavement again the art exhibition was beautiful but charlotte could not turn her attention to it and knew that to dolina pearse she must have appeared terribly ignorant dolina seemed to know each artist at least by repute and be able to say for what particular technique he was famous charlotte simply listened with an air of appreciation and hoped she could remember enough of it to recite back as if she had been interested while they walked around the rooms looking at one picture after another charlotte watched the other women who were fashionably dressed exactly as they would have been in london sleeves were worn large at the shoulder this season and slender from the elbow down even the most unsophisticated were puffed or flying like awkward wings skirts were wide at the bottom padded and bustled at the back it was very feminine like flowers in full bloom large ones like magnolias or peonies with the movement of walking parasols high to shade the face when outside however briefly a group of women gave the fleeting impression of a herbaceous border in the wind one of the painters should have tried such a thing or perhaps they had and she had been too inattentive to notice tea reminded her of the days before she was married accompanying her mother on suitable morning calls which were actually always made in the afternoon behaviour was very correct all the unwritten laws obeyed and beneath the polite exchanges the gossip was ruthless the cutting remarks honed to a razors edge how are you enjoying dublin mrs pitt talulla lawless asked courteously do have a cucumber sandwich always so refreshing dont you think thank you charlotte accepted it was the only possible thing to do even if she had not liked them i find dublin fascinating who would not oh many people talulla replied they think us very unsophisticated she smiled but perhaps that is what you enjoy she left it hanging in the air as to whether charlotte herself were unsophisticated or if perhaps this was a rustic escape for her from the rigours of london society charlotte smiled back utterly without warmth either they were not serious or if they were then they missed the subtlety of your words she replied i think you anything but simple she added for good measure talulla laughed it was a brittle sound you flatter us mrs pitt it is mrs isnt it i do hope i have not made the most awful mistake please dont concern yourself miss lawless charlotte replied it is very far from the most awful mistake indeed were it a mistake which it isnt it could still quite easily be put right would that all errors were so simply mended oh dear talulla affected dismay how much more exciting your life must be in london than ours is here you imply dark deeds you have me fascinated charlotte hesitated then plunged in i dare say the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence after watching the play last night i imagined life was full of passion and doomladen love here please dont tell me it is all just the fervour of a playwrights imagination you will entirely ruin the reputation of ireland abroad i didnt know you had such influence talulla said drily i had better be more careful of what i say there was mocking and anger in her face charlotte cast her eyes down towards the floor i am so sorry i seem to have spoken out of turn and struck some feeling of pain i assure you it was unintentional i can see many of your actions are unintentional mrs pitt talulla snapped and cause pain there was a rustle of silk against silk as a couple of the other women moved slightly in discomfort someone drew breath as if to speak glanced at talulla and changed her mind just as i am sure yours are not miss lawless charlotte replied i find it easy to believe that every word you say is entirely both foreseen and intended there was an even sharper gasp of breath someone giggled nervously may i offer you more tea mrs pitt dolina asked her voice was quivering but whether it was with laughter or tears it was impossible to say charlotte held out her cup thank you that is most kind dont be ridiculous talulla said tartly for heavens sake its a pot of tea the english answer to everything dolina ventured is that not so mrs pitt you would be surprised what can be done with it if it is hot enough charlotte looked straight at her scalding i shouldnt wonder dolina muttered charlotte relayed the exchange to narraway later that night after dinner they were alone in mrs hogans sitting room with the doors open on to the garden which was quite small and overhung with trees it was a mild evening and a moon almost full cast dramatic shadows in unspoken agreement they stood up and walked outside into the balmy air i didnt learn anything more she admitted finally except that we are still disliked but how could we imagine anything else at the theatre mr mcdaid told me something of oneil it is time you stopped skirting around it and told me what happened i dont want to know but i have to narraway was silent for a long time she was acutely aware of him standing perhaps a yard away from her half in the shadow of one of the trees he was slender not much taller than she but she had an impression of physical strength as if he were muscle and bone all softness worn away over the years she did not want to look at his face partly to allow him that privacy but just as much because she did not want to see what was there it would be easier for both of them and allow a certain pretence to be rebuilt after the moments in the couturier and after in the street i cant tell you all of it charlotte he said at last there was quite a large uprising planned we had to prevent it how did you do that she was blunt again he did not answer she wondered how much of the secrecy was to protect her and how much was simply that he was ashamed of his role in it necessary or not why was she standing out here shivering what was she afraid of victor narraway it had not occurred to her before that he might hurt her she was afraid that she would hurt him perhaps that was ridiculous if he had loved kate oneil and still been able to sacrifice her in his loyalty to his country then he could certainly sacrifice charlotte she could be one of the casualties of war that fiachra mcdaid had referred to just part of the price she was pitts wife and narraway had shown a loyalty to pitt in his own way she was also quite certain now that he was in love with her but how naive of her to imagine that it would change anything he had to do in the greater cause she thought of kate oneil wondering what she had looked like how old she had been if she had loved narraway had she betrayed her country and her husband to him how desperately in love she must have been charlotte should have despised her for that and yet all she felt was pity and a belief that she could have been in the same place but for a grace of circumstance if she hadnt loved pitt she could easily have believed herself in love with narraway that was a stupid equivocation she would have been in love cared totally and completely what other way was there to care you used kate oneil didnt you she said aloud yes his voice was so soft she barely heard it the faint rustling of the night wind in the leaves was almost as loud she had no doubt at all that he was ashamed but it had not stopped him thank goodness at least he had not lied but was this old case really the reason for the present manufactured charge of embezzlement against him what were they missing what was pitt doing in france should she and narraway be here in ireland or had narraway the brilliant devious schemer been outplayed by someone who knew his vulnerability too well and the real issue was somewhere else altogether she turned quietly and walked back the few steps into mrs hogans sitting room there wasnt anything more to say not here in the soft night wind and the scents of the garden chapter six pitt was troubled he stood in the sun in st malo leaning against the buttress edge of the towering wall around the town and stared out over the sea it was vivid blue the light so dazzling on it that he found himself squinting out in the bay a sail boat heeled far over as the man at the helm brought it about swung the boom and the canvas fell slack the town was ancient beautiful and at any other time pitt would have found it interesting were he here on holiday with his family he would have loved to explore the medieval streets and alleys and learn more of its history which was peculiarly dramatic as it was he had the strong feeling that he and gower were wasting time they had watched frobishers house for well over a week and seen nothing that led them any closer to whatever wrexham had killed west to prevent him from telling special branch visitors came and went not only men but women also neither pieter linsky nor jacob meister had come again but there had been dinner parties where at least a dozen people were present delivery men had come with baskets of the shellfish for which the area was famous scores of oysters had come shrimps and larger crustaceans like lobsters and bags of mussels but then the same could be said of any of the other larger houses in the area gower wandered along the same path his face sunburned his hair flopping forward he stopped just inside the wall a yard or two short of pitt he too leaned against the ledge as if he were watching the sailing boat where did he go pitt asked quietly without looking at him only to the same cafe as usual gower answered referring to wrexham whom one or the other of them had followed every day i didnt go in because i was afraid hed notice me but i saw the same thin man with the moustache go in then came back out again in about half an hour there was a slight lift in his voice a quickening i watched them through the open window for a few minutes as if i were waiting for someone they were talking about more people coming quite a lot of them they seemed to be ticking them off as if from a list theyre definitely planning something pitt would like to have felt the same stir of excitement but all the time hed been observing events seemed both too careful and too halfhearted for the passion that inspires great political change he and narraway had studied revolutionaries anarchists firebrands of all beliefs and this had a cautious feel to it the safe talking about it of those who do not actually want to take risks gower was young perhaps he attributed to them some of the enthusiasm he still felt himself and he did feel it pitt smiled as he thought of gower laughing with their landlady complimenting her on the food and letting her explain to him how it was cooked then he told her about such english favourites as steak and kidney pudding plum duff and pickled eels she had no idea whether to believe him or not theyve delivered more oysters pitt remarked its probably another party whatever frobishers political beliefs about changing conditions for the poor he certainly doesnt believe in starving himself or his guests he would hardly go around letting everyone know his plans sir gower replied quickly if everyone thinks hes a rich man entertaining his friends in harmless idealism he never intends to act on then nobody will take him seriously thats probably the best safety he could have pitt thought about it for a while what gower said was undoubtedly true and yet pitt was uneasy about it the conviction that they were wasting time settled more heavily upon him yet he could find no argument that was pure reason rather than a niggling instinct born of experience and all the others who keep coming and going he asked at last turning and facing gower who was unconsciously smiling as the light warmed his face below him in the small square a woman in a fashionable dress widesleeved and fullskirted walked from one side to the other and disappeared along the narrow alley to the west gower watched her all the way nodding very gently in approval gower turned to pitt his fair face puzzled yes about a dozen of them do you think theyre really harmless sir apart from wrexham of course are they all wild revolutionaries pretending very successfully to be ordinary citizens living satisfied and rather pedestrian lives pitt pressed it was a long time before gower answered as if he were weighing his words with intense care he turned and leaned on the wall staring at the water wrexham killed west for a reason he said slowly he was in no present danger except being exposed as an anarchist or whatever he would call himself perhaps he doesnt want chaos but a specific order that he considers fairer more equal to all people or it may be a radical reform hes after exactly what it is the socialists want is one of the things we need to learn there may be dozens of different goals there are pitt interrupted what they have in common is that they are not prepared to wait for reform by consent they want to force it on people violently if necessary and how long will they have to wait for anyone to hand it over voluntarily gower said with an edge of sarcasm whoever gave up power if they werent forced to pitt scanned his memory for the history he could recall none that i can think of he admitted thats why it usually takes a while but the abolition of slavery was passed through parliament without overt violence certainly without revolution im not sure the slaves would agree with that assessment gower said with a twist of bitterness perhaps were looking at a wouldbe wilberforce pitt looked at him obliquely slightly ashamed of his shallow remark about slavery its time we found out what we are looking at he conceded gower straightened up if we ask open questions its bound to get back to frobisher and he may take a great deal more care the one advantage we have sir is that he doesnt know were watching him can we afford to lose that he looked anxious his fair brows drawn together in a frown the sunburn flushing his cheeks ive been making a few enquiries pitt said already suddenly there was an edge of anger in gowers voice pitt was surprised it seemed gowers easy manner hid an emotional commitment he had not seen he should have they had worked together for over two months even before the hectic chase that had brought them here as to who i can ask for information without it being obvious he replied levelly who gower said quickly a man named john mciver hes another expatriate englishman whos lived here for twenty years married to a french woman are you positive hes trustworthy sir gower was still sceptical itll take only one careless word one remark made idly and frobisher will know hes being watched we could lose the big ones the people like linsky and meister i didnt choose him blindly pitt replied he did not intend to tell gower that he had encountered mciver before on a quite different case gower drew in his breath and then let it out again yes sir ill stay here and watch wrexham and whoever he meets with then he flashed a sudden bright smile i might even go down into the square and see the pretty girl with the pink dress again and drink a glass of wine pitt shook his head feeling the tension ease away i think youll do better than i will he said ruefully mciver lived some five miles outside st malo in the deep countryside he was clearly longing to speak to someone in his native tongue and hear firsthand the latest news from london pitts visit delighted him of course i miss london but dont misunderstand me sir he said leaning back in his garden chair in the sun he had offered pitt wine and little sweet biscuits and when he declined those fresh crusty bread and a soft country cream cheese which he accepted with alacrity pitt waited for him to continue i love it here mciver went on the french are possibly the most civilised nation on earth apart from the italians of course really know how to live and do it with a certain flair that gives even mundane things a degree of elegance but there are parts of english life that i miss havent had a decent marmalade in years sharp aromatic almost bitter he sighed a smile of memory on his face the mornings times a good cup of tea and a manservant who is completely unflappable i used to have a fellow who could have announced the angel of doom with the same calm rather mournful air that he announced the duchess of malmsbury pitt smiled and ate a whole slice of bread and sipped his wine before he pursued the reason he had come i need to make some very discreet enquiries government you understand of course what can i tell you mciver nodded frobisher pitt replied expatriate englishman living here in st malo would he be the right man to approach to ask a small service to his country please be candid it is of importance your understand oh quite quite mciver leaned forward a little i beg you sir consider very carefully i dont know your business of course but frobisher is not a serious man he made a slight gesture of distaste he likes to cultivate some very odd friends he pretends to be a socialist you know a man of the people but between you and me it is entirely a pose he mistakes untidiness and a certain levity of manner for being an ordinary man of limited means he shook his head he potters around and considers it to be working with his hands as if he had the discipline of an artisan who must work to live but he has very substantial means which he has no intention of sharing with others believe me although pitt had begun to wonder if there were anything more to frobisher than the comfortable way of life there seemed he still felt a sinking of bitter disappointment from mcivers words if this were not what west had been going to tell them about and for which he had been killed then why was wrexham still here why had men like linsky and meister visited are you sure he said as politely as he could however he said it he was still questioning mcivers judgement as sure as anyone can be mciver replied made a lot of noise prancing about striking poses but never done a thing in his life he had some very violent and wellknown people visiting him pitt clung to the argument unwilling to concede that they had spent over a week here for nothing still more that west had died for a farce a piece of pointless pretence see em yourself mciver asked yes one of them in particular is very distinctive pitt told him then even as he said it he realised how easy it was to ape a man as unusual as linsky he had never seen linsky except in photographs taken at a distance the hatchet features the greasy hair would not be so hard to copy and jacob meister was ordinary enough but why what was the purpose of it all that too was now hideously clear to distract pitt and gower from their real purpose it had succeeded brilliantly until this moment even now pitt was confused struggling to make sense and with no idea what to do next im sorry mciver said sadly but the mans an ass i cant say differently youd be a fool to trust him in anything that matters and i hardly imagine youd have come this far for something trivial im not as young as i used to be and i dont get into st malo very often but if theres anything i can do you have only to name it you know pitt forced himself to smile thank you but it would really need a resident of st malo but im grateful to you for saving me from making a bad mistake think nothing of it mciver brushed it away with a gesture i say do have some more cheese nobody makes a cheese like the french except perhaps the wensleydale or a good caerphilly pitt smiled i like a double gloucester myself yes yes mciver agreed i forgot that well well grant the cheese equal status but you cant beat a good french wine you cant even equal it pitt agreed mciver poured them both some wine then leaned back in his chair do tell me sir what is the latest news on the cricket here i hardly ever get the scores and even then theyre late how are somerset doing pitt walked back along the gently winding road as the sun dropped towards the horizon the air glowed with that faint patina of gold that lends unreality to old paintings and makes them seem landscapes of the imagination farmhouses looked huge comfortable surrounded by barns and stables it was too early for the trees to be in full leaf but clouds of blossom mounded like late snow taking on the delicate colours of the coming sunset there was no wind and no sound across the fields but the occasional movement of the huge patient cows in the east the darkness was no more than a fading in the sky a purpling of the colour behind the streamers of cloud he went over what they knew in his mind again carefully all he had seen or heard himself and all that gower had seen and reported it did not make sense therefore there must be something missing or something seen but misunderstood a carter passed him on the road the wheels sending up clouds of dust and he smelled the pleasant odour of horses sweat and freshturned earth the man grunted at pitt in french and pitt returned the greeting as well as he could the sun was sinking rapidly now the sky filling with hot colour the soft breeze whispered in the grass and the new leaves on the willows always the first to open a flock of birds rose from the small copse of trees a hundred yards away swirled up into the sky and circled round between them pitt and gower had seen just enough to believe it was worth watching frobishers house if they arrested wrexham now it would unquestionably show everyone that special branch was aware of their plans so they would automatically change them they should have arrested wrexham in london he would have told them nothing but they had learned nothing anyway all they had really done was waste time how had he allowed that to happen west had arranged the meeting promising extraordinary information pitt could see the letter in his mind the scrawled misspelled words the jagged edges of fear in the letters the smudged ink no one but pitt himself and gower knew of it how had wrexham learned who had betrayed west it had to be one of the men plotting whatever it was that poor west had been going to reveal but they had not followed west pitt and gower were on his heels from the minute he began to run if there had been anyone else running they would have to have seen him whoever it was must have been waiting for west how had they known he would run that way it was pure chance he could as easily have gone in any other direction pitt and gower had cornered him there pitt along the main street gower circling around to cut him off had west run into wrexham by the most hideous mischance pitt retraced in his mind the exact route they had taken he knew the streets well enough to picture every step and see the map of it in his mind he knew where they had first seen west where he had started to run and which way he had gone there had been no one else in the crowd running west had darted across the street and disappeared for an instant gower had gone after him jabbing his arm to indicate which way pitt should go the shorter way so they could cut him off then west had seen gower and swerved pitt had lost them both for a few minutes but he knew the streets well enough to know which way west would go and been there within seconds and gower had raced up from the right to come up beside pitt but the right doglegged back to the street where pitt had run the minute before not the way gower had gone unless he had passed wrexham wrexham had come from the opposite way not following west at all so why had west run so frantically as if he knew death was on his heels pitt stumbled in the road and came to a stop because it was not wrexham west was afraid of it was either pitt himself or gower he had no reason to fear pitt gower was a superb runner he could have been there before ducked back into the shelter of the alley entrance and then burst out of it again as pitt arrived it was he who had killed west not wrexham wests blood was already pooled on the stones pitt could see it in his minds eye wrexham was the harmless man he appeared to be the decoy to lure pitt to st malo and keep him here while whatever was really happening came to its climax somewhere else it had to be london otherwise it was pointless to lure pitt away from it gower in fifteen or twenty minutes pitt would be inside the walls of st malo again back to their lodgings almost certainly gower would be there waiting for him suddenly he was no longer the pleasant ambitious young man he had seemed only this morning now he was a clever and extremely dangerous stranger a man pitt knew only in the most superficial way he knew that gower slept well that his skin burned in the sun that he liked chocolate cake that he was occasionally careless when he shaved himself he was attracted to women with dark hair and he could sing rather well pitt had no idea where he came from what he believed or even where his loyalties were all the things that mattered that would govern what he would do when the mask was off now suddenly pitt must wear a mask as well his own life might depend on it he remembered with a chill how efficiently west had been killed his throat cut in one movement and his body left on the stones bleeding to death one error and pitt could end the same way who in st malo would think it more than a horrific street crime no doubt gower would be first on the scene again full of horror and dismay there was no one pitt could turn to no one in france even knew who he was and london could be in another world for all the help it could offer now even if he sent a telegram to narraway it would make no difference gower would simply disappear anywhere in europe he started to walk again the sun was on the horizon and within minutes it would be gone it would be almost dark by the time he was within the vast city walls he had perhaps fifteen minutes to make up his mind he must be totally prepared once he reached the house one mistake one slip and it would be his last he thought of the chase to the east end and finally the railway station he realised with acute selfblame how easily gower had led him always making sure they did not lose wrexham completely and yet the chase seemed natural enough to be real they lost him momentarily and it was always gower who found him it was gower who stopped pitt from arresting him pointing out the use of watching him and learning more gower had had enough money in his pocket to buy tickets on the ferry come to that it was gower who said he had seen linsky and meister and pitt had believed him what was wrexham part of the plan to take pitt away from london knowing precisely what he was doing and why then why had he not actually killed west too squeamish too afraid not paid enough of course pitt must go back to london the question was what to say to gower what reason should he give he would know there was no message from lisson grove had there been it would have been delivered to the house and simple enough to check on anyway all gower would have to do was ask at the post office the sun was already half gone a burning orange semicircle above the purple horizon shadows were deepening right across the road should pitt try to elude him simply go straight to the harbour now and wait for the next boat to southampton but that might not be till tomorrow morning and gower would realise what had happened and come after him some time during the night pitt didnt even have the rest of his clothes with him he was wearing only a light jacket in the warm afternoon the idea of fighting gower here was not to be considered even if he could subdue him and that was doubtful gower was younger and extremely fit what would pitt do with him he had no power to arrest him could he leave him tied up and then escape assuming he were successful anyway but gower would not be alone here that thought sobered him like a drench of cold water raising goose bumps on his skin how many of the people at frobishers house were part of his plan the only answer was for pitt to deceive him make him believe that he had no suspicions at all and that would not be easy the slightest change in manner and he would know even a selfconsciousness a hesitation a phrase too carefully chosen and he would be aware how could pitt tell him they were returning to london what excuse would he believe or should he suggest he himself return and gower stay here and watch frobisher and wrexham just in case there were something after all in case meister or linsky came back or anyone else they would recognise the thought was an immense relief a weight lifted off him as if it were a breathtaking escape a flight into freedom he would be alone safe gower would stay here in france a second later he despised himself for his cowardice when he had first gone on the beat in london as a young man he had expected a certain amount of violence indeed now and then he had met with it there had been a number of wild chases with a degree of brawling at the end but after promotion as a detective he had almost exclusively used his mind there had been long days even longer nights the emotional horror had been intense the pressure to solve a case before a killer struck again before the public were outraged and the police force disgraced and after arrest there was testimony at the trial worst of all was the fear which often kept him awake at night that he had not caught the right man or woman perhaps he had made a mistake believed a lie drawn a wrong conclusion missed something and it was an innocent person who was going to face the hangman but it was not physical violence the battle of wits had not threatened his own life he was chilled in the first darkness of the early evening the sunset breeze was cold on his skin and yet he was sweating he must control himself gower would see nervousness he would be watching for it the suspicion that he had been found out would be the first thing to leap to his mind not the last before he reached the house pitt must have thought of what he would say and then he must do it perfectly gower was already in when pitt arrived he was sitting in one of the comfortable chairs reading a french newspaper a glass of wine on the small table beside him he looked very english very sunburned or perhaps it was more windburn from the breeze off the sea he looked up and smiled at pitt glanced then at pitts dirty boots and rose to his feet can i get you a glass of wine he offered i expect youre hungry for a moment pitt was attacked by doubt was he being ridiculous thinking that this man had swiftly and brutally killed west and then turned with an innocent face and helped pitt pursue wrexham all the way to southampton and across the channel to france he mustnt hesitate gower was expecting an answer an easy and natural response to a very simple question yes i am he said with slight grimace as he sank into the other chair and realised how exhausted he was havent walked that far in a while nine or ten miles gower raised his eyebrows he set the wine down on the table near pitts hand did you have any luncheon he resumed his own seat looking at pitt curiously bread and cheese and a good wine pitt answered im not sure red is the thing with cheese but it was very agreeable it wasnt stilton he added in case gower should think him ignorant of gentlemens habit of taking port with stilton they were sitting with wine like friends and talking about etiquette as if no one were dead and they were on the same side he must be careful never to allow the absurdity of it to blind him to its lethal reality worth the walk gower enquired there was no edge to his voice his lean brown hand holding the glass was perfectly steady yes pitt said yes it was he confirmed what i suspected it seems frobisher is a poseur he has talked about radical social reform for years but still lives in more or less luxury himself he gives to the occasional charity but then so do most people of means talking about action seems to be his way of shocking people gaining a degree of attention for himself while remaining perfectly comfortable and wrexham gower asked there was a moments silence in the room somewhere outside a dog was barking and much further away someone sang a bawdy song and there was a bellow of laughter pitt knew it was vulgar because the intonation of the words was the same in any language obviously a different matter pitt replied we know that for ourselves unfortunately what he is doing here i have no idea i hadnt thought he knew we were after him but perhaps i was wrong in that he let the suggestion hang in the air we were careful gower said as if turning the idea over in his mind but why stay here with frobisher if all he is doing is trying to escape from us why not go on to paris or anywhere he put down his glass and faced pitt at best hes a revolutionary at worst an anarchist wanting to destroy all order and replace it with chaos there was stinging contempt in his voice if it was false then he belonged on the stage pitt rethought his plan perhaps hes waiting here for someone and he feels safe enough not to care about us he suggested or whoevers coming is so important he has to take the risk gower countered exactly pitt settled himself more comfortably in his chair but we could wait a long time for that or possibly fail to recognise it when it happens i think we need a great deal more information french police gower said doubtfully he moved his position also but to one less comfortable as if any moment he might stand up again pitt forced himself not to copy him he must appear totally relaxed their interests might not be the same as ours gower went on do you trust them sir in fact do you really want to tell them what we know about wrexham and why were here his expression was anxious bordering on critical as if it were only his junior rank that held him back from stronger comment pitt made himself smile no i dont he answered to all your questions we have no idea what they know and no way of checking anything they may tell us and of course our interests may very well not be the same but most of all as you say i dont want them to know who we are gower blinked so what are you suggesting sir now was the only chance pitt was going to have he wanted to stand up to have the advantage of balance even of weight if gower moved suddenly he had to stiffen his muscles and then deliberately relax to prevent himself from doing it carefully he slid a little further down in the seat stretching his legs as if they were tired which was not difficult after his tenmile walk thank heaven he had good boots although they looked dusty and scuffed now ill go back to london and see what they have at lisson grove he answered they may have much more detailed information they havent given us you stay here and watch frobisher and wrexham i know that will be more difficult on your own but i havent seen them do anything after dark other than entertain a little he wanted to add more to explain but it would cause suspicion he was gowers superior he did not have to justify himself to do so would be to break the pattern and if gower were clever that in itself would alarm him yes sir if you think thats best when will you be back shall i keep the room on here for you gower asked yes please i dont suppose ill be more than a couple of days maybe three i feel were working in the dark at the moment right sir fancy a spot of dinner now i found a new cafe today has the best mussel soup youve ever tasted good idea pitt rose to his feet a little stiffly ill leave first ferry in the morning the following day was misty and a lot cooler pitt had deliberately chosen the first crossing to avoid having to breakfast with gower he was afraid in the affected casualness of it he might try too hard and make some slip so small gower picked it up while pitt would have no idea anything had changed or had gower suspected something already did he know even as pitt walked down to the harbour along ancient nowfamiliar streets that the pretence was over he had a desperate instinct to swing round and see if anyone were following him would he pick out gowers fair head taller than the average and know it was he or might he already have changed his appearance and could be yards away and pitt had no idea but his allies frobishers men or wrexhams could be anyone the old man in the fishermans jersey lounging in a doorway taking his first cigarette of the day the man on the bicycle bumping over the cobbles even the young woman with the laundry why suppose that gower himself would follow him why suppose that he had noticed anything different at all the new realisation loomed gigantic to him filling his mind driving out almost everything else but how selfcentred to suppose that gower had nothing more urgent to consume his thoughts perhaps pitt and what he knew or believed he knew was an irrelevance anyway he increased his pace and passed a group of travellers heaving along shopping bags and tightly packed portmanteaux on the dockside he glanced around as if to search for someone he knew and was flooded with relief when he saw only strangers he stood in the queue to buy his ticket and then again to get on board once he felt the slight sway of the deck under his feet the faint movement even here in the harbour it was as if he had reached some haven of safety the gulls wheeled and circled overhead crying harshly here on the water the wind was sharper saltsmelling pitt stood on the deck by the railing staring at the gangway and the dockside to anyone else he hoped he looked like someone looking back at the town with pleasure perhaps at a holiday well spent possibly even at friends he might not see again for another year actually he was watching the figures on the quay searching for anyone familiar any of the men he had seen arriving or leaving frobishers house or for gower himself twice he thought he saw him and it turned out to be a stranger it was simply the fair hair an angle of shoulder or head he was angry with himself for the fear that he knew was largely in his mind perhaps it was so deep because until the walk back to the town yesterday evening it had never entered his mind that gower had killed west and wrexham was either a coconspirator or even just a tissuepaper socialist posing as a fanatic like frobisher himself it was the shock at his own blindness that dismayed pitt how stupid he had been how insensitive to possibilities he would be ashamed to tell narraway but he would have to there would be no escaping it at last they cast off and moved out into the bay pitt remained where he was at the rail watching the towers and walls of the city recede the sunlight was bright on the water glittering sharp they passed the rocky outcrops tide slapping around the feet of the minor fortress built there guarding the approaches there were few sailing boats this early just fishermen pulling up the lobster pots that had been out all night pitt tried to imprint the scene on his mind he would tell charlotte about it the beauty the tastes and sounds how it was like stepping back in time he should bring her here one day take her to dine where the shellfish was so superb she hardly ever left london let alone england it would be fun different he imagined seeing her again so vividly he could almost smell the perfume of her hair hear her voice in his mind he would tell her about the city the sea the tastes and the sounds of it all he wouldnt have to dwell on the events that had brought him to france only on the good someone bumped against him and for a moment he forgot to be startled then the chill ran through him and he realised how his attention had wandered the man apologised pitt spoke with difficulty his mouth dry its nothing the man smiled lost my balance not used to the sea pitt nodded but he moved away from the rail and went back into the main cabin he stayed there for the rest of the crossing drinking tea and having a breakfast of fresh bread cheese and a little sliced ham he tried to look as if he were at ease when they reached southampton he went ashore carrying the light case he had bought in france and looking like any other holidaymaker returning home it was midday the quayside was busy with people disembarking or waiting to take the next ferry out he went straight to the railway station eager to catch the first available train to london he would go home wash and dress in clean clothes then if he were lucky just have time to catch narraway before he left lisson grove for the evening thank heavens for the telephone at least he would be able to call and arrange to meet with him wherever was convenient maybe with his news about gower a rendezvous at narraways home would be better he felt easier now france seemed very far away and he had had no glimpse of gower on the boat he must have satisfied him with his explanation the station was unusually busy crowded with people all seemingly in an ill humour he discovered why when he bought his ticket for london sorry sir the ticket seller said wearily we got a problem at shorehambysea so theres a delay how long a delay cant say sir maybe an hour or more but the train is running pitt insisted suddenly he was anxious to leave southampton as if it were still dangerous yes sir it will be dyer want a ticket fer it or not yes i do theres no other way to london is there no sir not unless yer want ter take a different route some folk are doing that but its longer an more expensive troublell be cleared soon i dare say thank you ill have one ticket to london please return sir would you like first second or third class just one way thank you and second class will be fine he paid for it and went back towards the platform which was getting steadily more and more crowded he couldnt even pace backward and forward to release some of the tension that was mounting inside him as it seemed to be for everyone else women were trying to comfort fretful children businessmen pulled pocket watches out of their waistcoats and stared at the time again and again pitt kept glancing around him but there was no sign of gower although he was not sure if he would have noticed him in the everincreasing crowd he bought a sandwich and a pint of cider at two oclock when there was still no news at three he eventually took the train to worthing and hoped to catch another train from there perhaps to london via a different route at least leaving southampton gave him an illusion of achieving something as he made his way towards a seat in the last carriage again he had the feeling of having escaped the carriage was nearly full he was fortunate there was room for him to sit everyone else had been waiting for some time and they were all tired anxious and looking forward to getting home even if this train did not take them all the way at least they were moving one woman held a crying twoyearold trying to comfort her the little girl was rubbing her eyes and sniffing it made pitt think of jemima at that age how long ago that seemed pitt guessed she had been on holiday and was now confused as to where she was going next and why he had some sympathy for her and it made him engage the mother in conversation for the first two stops then the movement of the train and the rhythmic clatter over the connections on the rail lulled the child to sleep and the mother finally relaxed several people got off at bognor regis and more at angmering by the time they reached worthing and stopped altogether there were only half a dozen people left in pitts carriage sorry gents the guard said tipping his cap back a little and scratching his head this is as far as we go till they get the track cleared at shoreham there was a lot of grumbling but the few passengers remaining got out of the carriage they walked up and down the platform restlessly bothered the porters and the guard asking questions to which no one had answers or went into the waiting room with passengers from the other carriages pitt picked up someone elses discarded newspaper and glanced through it nothing in particular caught his eye and he kept looking up every time someone passed in the hope that there was news of the train leaving again once or twice as the long afternoon wore on he got up and walked the length of the platform with difficulty he resisted the temptation to pester the guard but he knew that the poor man was probably as frustrated as everyone else and would have been only too delighted to have news to give people finally as the sun was on the horizon they boarded a new train and slowly pulled out of the station the relief was absurdly out of proportion they had been in no hardship and no danger yet people were smiling talking to each other even laughing the next stop was shorehambysea where the trouble had been then hove by then it was dusk the light golden and casting heavy shadows for pitt this hour of the evening had a peculiar beauty almost with a touch of sadness that sharpened its emotional power he felt it even more in the autumn when the harvest fields in the country were stubbled gold the stooks like some remnant of an earlier forgotten age more barbaric without the inroads of civilisation on the land he thought of his childhood at the big house where his parents had worked of the woods and fields and a sense of belonging suddenly the carriage enclosed him he stood up and went to the end and through the door onto the small platform before the next carriage it was mostly for men to light cigars without the smoke being unpleasant to other passengers but it was a good place to stand and feel the rush of air and smell the ploughed earth and the damp of the woods as they passed not many trains had these spaces he had heard somewhere that it was an american invention he liked it very much the air was quite cold but there was a sweetness to it and he was happy to remain there even though it grew darker quickly heavy clouds rolling in from the north probably some time in the night it would rain he considered what he would tell narraway of what now seemed to be an abortive trip to france and how he would explain his conclusions about gower and his own blindness in not having understood the truth from the beginning then he thought with intense pleasure of seeing charlotte and of being at home where he had only to look up and she would be there smiling at him if she thought he had been stupid she would not say so at least not at first she would let him say it and then ruefully agree that would take away most of the sting it was nearly dark now the clouds had brought the night unnaturally soon without any warning he was aware of someone behind him with the rattle of the wheels he had not heard the carriage door open he half turned but was too late the weight was there in the middle of his back his right arm was locked in a fierce grip his left pinned against the rail by his own body he tried to step backwards onto the instep of the man shock him with the pain of it he felt the man wince but there was no easing of the hold of him he was being pushed forward twisted a little his arm was crushed on the rail and he gasped to get his breath he was pushed so his head was far out over the speeding ground the wind was cold on his face smuts from the engine striking him stinging any minute he was going to lose his balance and then it would be a second two and he would be over the edge and down onto the sleepers at this speed he would be killed the fall would probably snap his spine the man was strong and heavy the weight of him was driving the breath out of pitts chest and he had no leverage to fight back it would be over in seconds then there was a slam of carriage doors and a wild shout the pressure on pitts back was worse driving the last bit of air out of his lungs he heard a cry and realised it was from himself the weight lifted suddenly and he gasped hanging onto the rail scrambling to turn round coughing violently the man who had attacked him was struggling with someone else who was portly thickwaisted he could see only shadows and outlines in the dark the mans hat flew off and was carried away he was already getting the worst of the fight backing towards the rail at the other side in the momentary light from the door his face was contorted with anger and the beginning of terror as he knew he was losing pitt straightened up and threw himself at the attacker he had no weapon except his fists he struck the man low in the chest as hard as he could hoping to wind him he heard him grunt and he pitched forward but only a step the fat man slithered sideways and down onto one knee at least that way he would not overbalance across the rail and onto the track pitt followed his attacker striking again but the man must have expected it he went down also and pitts blow only caught the edge of his shoulder the man twisted with it but for no more than a moment then he lunged back at pitt his head down catching pitt in the stomach and sending him sprawling the carriage door was slamming open and closed the fat man scrambled to his feet and charged his face red shouting something indistinguishable over the howl of the wind and roar and clatter of the train he dived at pitts attacker who stepped out of the way and then swivelled round and raised himself he grasped the fat man and heaved him over the rail to fall screaming arms flailing helplessly out onto the track for a second pitt was frozen with horror then he turned and stared at the man who had attacked him he was only an outline in the dark but he did not need to hear him speak to recognise him how did you know gower asked curiosity keen his voice almost normal pitt was struggling to get his breath his lungs hurt his ribs ached where the rail had bruised him but all he could think of was the man who had tried to rescue him and whose broken body was now lying on the track gower took a step towards him the man you walked ten miles to see did he tell you something only that frobisher was a paper tiger pitt replied his mind racing now wrexham cant have taken so long to work that out so maybe he always knew it then i thought perhaps he was just the same i thought i saw him cut wests throat but when i went over it step by step i didnt it just looked like it actually wests blood was already pooled on the stones you were the one who had the chase all the way to the ferry i thought you were clever but then i realised how easy it had been it was always you who found him when we lost him or who stopped us actually catching him the whole pursuit was performed for my benefit to get me away from london gower gave a short burst of laughter the great pitt whom narraway sets so much store by took you over a week to work that out youre getting slow or perhaps you always were just lucky then suddenly he flung himself forward arms outstretched to grasp pitt by the throat but pitt was ready this time he ducked and charged low with his head down he caught gower in the belly just above the waist and heard him gasp he straightened his legs lifting gower off the ground his own impetus carried him on high over the rail and into the darkness pitt did not even see him land but he knew with a violent sorrow that it had to have killed him instantly no one could survive such an impact he straightened up slowly his legs weak his body shaking he had to cling onto the rail to support himself the carriage door slammed shut again then opened the guard stood there wideeyed terrified the lantern in his hand the carriage lights yellow behind him yere a lunatic he cried stuttering over his words he was trying to kill me pitt protested taking a step forward the guard jerked the lantern up as if it were some kind of shield dont you touch me his voice was shrill with terror i got alf a dozen good men ere ooll tie yer down so i ave yere a bleedin madman yer killed poor mr summers as well oo only came out there terelp the other gent i didnt pitt began but he didnt get to finish the sentence two burly men were crowding behind the guard one of them with a walking stick the other with a sharpended umbrella both held up as weapons were gonna put yer in my van the guard went on an if we ave ter knock yer senseless ter do it just gimme the excuse is all i ask i liked mr summers e were a good man an all pitt had no wish to be beaten into submission dazed aching and appalled at what he had done he went without resisting chapter seven you cant come charlotte said vehemently it was early afternoon and she was standing in the dining room of mrs hogans lodging house dressed in her best spring costume wearing the magnificent striped blouse she was rather uncomfortably aware of how well it suited her with a plain dark skirt the effect was dramatic to say the very least someone is bound to know you she added forcing her attention to the matter in hand narraway had obviously taken care to prepare himself for the occasion also his shirt was immaculate his cravat perfectly tied his thick hair exactly in place i have to he replied i must see talulla lawless i can only see her in a public place or she will accuse me of assaulting her she has already tried it once and warned me she will do it again if i attempt to see her alone i know she is going to be there this afternoon its a recital most people will be watching the musicians it will only need one person to recognise you and they will tell the others charlotte pointed out then what will i be able to do of any value theyll know the reason behind everything i say i will not go with you the charade of your being my sister is for mrs hogan he smiled bleakly you will go to the recital with fiachra mcdaid hes coming to meet you here he glanced at the clock on the mantelshelf in ten minutes or so ill go alone i have to charlotte i think talulla is crucial to this too many of my investigations keep coming back to her she is the one thread that connects everyone involved cant i do it she persisted he smiled briefly not this time my dear she did not argue any further even though she was sure he was not telling her the entire truth but it was foolish to come here at all if they were unprepared to take any risks she smiled back at him just in a very tiny gesture and gave a little nod then be careful his eyes softened he seemed to be about to say something halfmocking but there was a sharp tap on the door mrs hogan came in her hair as usual falling out of its pins her white apron crisply starched mr mcdaid is here for you mrs pitt it was impossible to tell from her expression what her thoughts were except that she was having an effort keeping them under control thank you mrs hogan charlotte said politely i shall be there immediately she met narraways eyes please be careful she said again then before he could respond she picked up her skirt perhaps half an inch and swept out of the door which mrs hogan was holding open for her fiachra mcdaid was standing in the hall next to the long clock which read five minutes ahead of the one in the dining room he was smartly dressed but he could not manage the same casual elegance as narraway good afternoon mrs pitt he said pleasantly i hope youll enjoy the music itll be another side of dublin for you to see and a fine day for it and talking of the weather have you been outside the city yet while its so agreeable how about a trip to drogheda and the ruins of mellifont the oldest abbey in ireland it was on the orders of st malachy or if that is too recent for you how about the hill of tara it was the centre of ireland under the high kings until the eleventh century when christianity came and brought an end to their power it sounds marvellous she said with as much enthusiasm as she could manage taking his arm and walking towards the front door she did not look back to see if narraway were watching her are they far from the city a little distance but its well worth it mcdaid replied theres far more to ireland than dublin you know of course i appreciate your generosity in sharing it do tell me more about these places he accepted and on the short journey to the hall where the recital was to take place she listened with an air of complete attention indeed at any other time she would have been as interested as she now pretended to be the pride in his voice was unmistakable and the love for his people and their history he had a remarkable compassion for the poor and the dispossessed that she could not help but admire when they arrived the crowds were already beginning to gather and they were obliged to take their seats if they wished to be well placed towards the front charlotte was pleased to do so in order to be as far from narraway as possible so no one might think they were with each other except mcdaid of course and she had to trust in his discretion the other ladies were dressed very fashionably but in the bronze and black striped blouse charlotte felt the equal of any of them it still gave her a twinge of guilt that narraway had paid for it and she had no idea what words she would use to explain it to pitt but for the moment she indulged the pleasure of seeing both men and women glance at her then look a second time with appreciation or envy she smiled a little not too much in case it looked like selfsatisfaction just enough to lift the corners of her mouth into a pleasant expression and return the nods of greeting from those she had met before she chose a chair then sat as straightbacked as she could and affected an interest in the arrangements of the seats where the musicians were to play she noticed dolina pearse and only just avoided meeting her eyes next to her talulla lawless was very discreetly gazing around the room apparently looking for someone charlotte tried to follow her direction and felt her breath catch in her throat as she saw narraway arrive the light was bright for a moment on the silver at his temples as he leaned forward to listen to someone talulla stiffened her face set rigid then she smiled and turned back to the man beside her it was a moment before charlotte recognised him as phelim oconor then he moved away and took his seat and talulla went to hers the master of ceremonies appeared and the babble of talk died away the performance had begun for just over an hour the audience sat absorbed in the sound and the emotion of the music it had a sweetness and a lilt that made charlotte smile and it was no effort at all to appear as if she were totally happy however the moment it ceased and the applause was finished her mind returned to the reason she was here and more urgently why narraway was she remembered the look in talullas face perhaps the greatest purpose charlotte would serve would not be anything to do with cormac oneil but to support narraway if talulla should begin to create a scene giving mcdaid no more than a quick smile she rose to her feet and headed for talulla trying to think of something reasonable to say true or not she reached her just as talulla turned to walk away and only just managed to save her balance she looked instantly amazed oh i am sorry charlotte apologised although actually it had been talulla who had all but bumped into her i am afraid my enthusiasm rather got the better of me enthusiasm talulla said coldly her face reflecting complete disbelief for the harpist charlotte said quickly i have never heard more delightful music she was fishing desperately for anything to say then dont let me stop you from speaking to her talulla retorted im sure youll find her agreeable do you know her charlotte asked eagerly only by repute and i shouldnt wish to trouble her talulla responded sharply there must be so many people eager to speak with her i would be so grateful if you would introduce me charlotte asked ignoring the rebuff im afraid i cannot help you talulla was making it impossible to conceal her impatience i am not acquainted with her now if you dont oh charlotte assumed an expression of dismay but you said she was most agreeable she made it a challenge not daring to look towards where she had seen narraway talking to ardal barralet it was the polite thing to say talulla snapped now really mrs pitt there is someone i wish to speak to and i must hurry or they may leave excuse me and she all but pushed charlotte out of the way obliging her to step aside or seem to be causing a physical unpleasantness charlotte could see narraway still talking to barralet at the far end of the room talulla was heading directly towards them charlotte went after her but several steps behind they were halfway down the aisle between the chairs when talulla stopped so abruptly that charlotte was forced to also or bump into her then she saw why talulla had halted a little knot of people had gathered around where narraway had turned from ardal barralet and was facing cormac oneil across a short open space of floor phelim oconor was looking from one to the other of them and bridget tyrone was a little to his right for seconds they stood frozen then cormac drew in his breath i never thought youd dare show your face in ireland again he said between his teeth staring at narraway whove you come back to betray this time mulhare is dead or didnt you know that the hatred trembled in his voice his whole body shook and his words were slurred a ripple of emotion ran through the gathering crowd like the passage of a storm through a field of barley yes i know mulhare is dead narraway replied not moving backwards in spite of cormacs closeness to him someone embezzled the money he should have had so he could go abroad and start a new life someone cormac sneered and i suppose you have no idea who i hadnt narraway answered still not moving although cormac was within two feet of him now im beginning to find out cormac rolled his eyes if i didnt know you id believe that you stole the money yourself you betrayed mulhare just as you betrayed all of us narraway was whitefaced eyes brilliant it was a war cormac you lost thats all all cormacs face was now contorted with hate i lost my brother and my sisterinlaw and my country and you stand here and say thats all his voice choked there was a mutter from everyone around the group closest to him charlotte winced she knew what narraway meant but he was rattled and being clumsy he knew they were against him and he could prove nothing he had no backing from london now he was alone and losing we couldnt both win narraway regained his selfcontrol with an effort that time it was meyou wouldnt have shouted betrayal if it had been you its my bloody country you arrogant ape cormac shouted how many more of us have to be robbed cheated and murdered before you get some shadow of a conscience and get the hell out of ireland ill go as soon as i prove who took mulhares money narraway answered did you sacrifice him to get your revenge on me is that how you know all about it everybody knows all about it cormac snarled his body was washed up on the steps of dublin harbour god damn you i didnt betray him narraways voice was shaking and growing louder in spite of his efforts to keep it down if id done it id have made a better job i wouldnt have left the money in my own damn account for others to find it whatever you think of me cormac you know im not a fool cormac was stunned into momentary silence it was talulla who stepped forward her face was white to the lips her eyes sunken like holes in her head yes you are a fool she said between her teeth facing narraway her back to cormac an arrogant english fool who thinks we cant ever get the better of you well one of us did this timeyou say you didnt put the money in your own bank apparently someone did and you got the blame your own people think youre a thief and no one in ireland will ever give you information again so youll be no use to london any more you have cormac oneil to thank for that she drew in her breath all but choking on it dont you have a saying in england he who laughs last laughs longest well well be laughing after you are a broken old man with nothing to do and no one who gives a damn about you remember it was an oneil who did that to you narraway she laughed with a brief jagged sound like something tearing inside her then she turned and pushed her way through the crowd until she disappeared charlotte stared at cormac and phelim oconor and then at narraway they stood pale and shaking it was ardal barralet who spoke how unfortunate he said drily i think victor it would have been better if you had not come old memories die hard it seems from what has been said as if this is one part of the war that you lost accept it with as much grace as you expected of us and take your leave while you can narraway did not even glance at charlotte not drawing her into the embarrassment he bowed very stiffly excuse me he turned and left mcdaid took charlottes arm holding her surprisingly hard she had not even known he was near her now she had no choice but to leave with him hes a fool mcdaid said bitterly as soon as they were sufficiently far from the nearest people that he could speak without being overheard did he think anyone would forget his face she knew he was right but she was angry with him for saying so she did not know the details of narraways part in the old betrayal whether he had loved kate oneil or used her or even both but he was the one betrayed this time and by a lie not by the truth she was allowing emotion and instinct to replace reason in her judgement or maybe her belief in him was a return for the loyalty narraway had shown to pitt pitt was not here to help to offer any support or advice so it was necessary that she did it for him it was not something that was even open to question then another thought came to her a moment of recollection as clear as lightning in a black storm talulla had said that mulhares money had been returned to narraways own bank in london and now no one in london would trust him how could she know about the money unless she were intimately involved in having brought that about she was in her late twenties at the time of kate and sean oneils deaths she would have been no more than a child perhaps seven or eight years old was that what narraway had come here for to provoke her unrealisingly into such selfrevelation what a desperate step to take she tried to free her arm from mcdaids grip pulling sharply but he held on youre not going after him he said firmly he did at least do one thing decently he didnt involve you as far as talulla is concerned you could be total strangers dont spoil that his words made it worse it increased her debt and to deny narraway would be pointless and desperately ungracious she snatched her arm from mcdaid and this time he let go i wasnt going to go after him she said angrily im going home to london he said incredulously to mrs hogans house in molesworth street she snapped if you would be so kind as to take me i do not wish to have to look for an omnibus ive no idea where i am or where im going that i know mcdaid agreed ruefully however as soon as mcdaid had left her at mrs hogans door she waited until he had got back into the carriage and it was round the corner out of sight then she walked briskly in the opposite direction and hailed the first carriage for hire that she saw she knew cormac oneils town address from narraway and she gave it to the driver she would wait for oneil to return for as long as was necessary as it transpired it was shortly after dusk when she saw cormac oneil climb out of a carriage a hundred yards down the street he made his way a trifle unsteadily along the footpath towards his front door charlotte moved out of the shadows mr oneil he stopped blinking momentarily mr oneil she repeated i wonder if i may speak with you please it is very important another time he said indistinctly its late he started forward to go past her to the door but she took a step in front of him no its not late its barely supper time and this is urgent please he looked at her youre a handsome enough girl he said gently but im not interested suddenly she realised that he assumed her to be a prostitute it was too absurd for her to take offence but if she laughed she might sound too close to hysteria she swallowed hard trying to control the nervous tension all but closing her throat mr oneil she had prepared the lie it was the only way she could think of that might make him tell her the truth i want to ask you about victor narraway oneil jerked to a stop and swung round to stare at her i know what he did to your family she went on a little desperately at least i think i do i was at the recital this afternoon i heard what you said and what miss lawless said too why did you come here he demanded youre as english as he is its in your voice so dont try to sympathise with me now his tone was stinging with contempt she matched his expression just as harshly and you think the irish are the only people who are ever victims she said with amazement my husband suffered too i might be able to do something about it if i know the truth something he said contemptuously what kind of something she knew she must make this passionate believable a wound deep enough he would see her as a victim like himself mentally she apologised to narraway narraways already been dismissed from special branch she said because of the money that was supposed to go to mulhare but he has everything else his home his friends his life in london my family has nothing except a few friends who know him as i do and perhaps you but i need to know the truth he hesitated a moment then wearily as if surrendering to something he fished in his pocket for a key fumbling a little he inserted it in the lock and opened the door for her they were greeted immediately by a large dog a wolfhound of some sort who gave her no more than a cursory glance before going to oneil wagging its tail and pushing against him demanding attention oneil patted its head talking gently then he led the way into the parlour and lit the gaslamps the dog on his heels the flames burned up to show a clean comfortable room with a window onto the area way and then the street he pulled the curtain across more for privacy than to keep out the cold and invited charlotte to sit down she did so soberly thanking him then waiting for him to compose himself before she began her questions she was acutely aware that if she made even one illjudged remark one clumsy reaction she could lose him completely and there would be no opportunity ever to try again it was all over twenty years ago he said looking at her gravely he sat opposite her the dog at his feet in the gaslight it was easy to see that he was labouring to keep some control of his feelings as if seeing narraway again had stirred emotions he had struggled hard to bury his eyes were redrimmed his face haggard his hair stood up on end crookedly at one side as though he had run his fingers through it repeatedly she could not fail to be aware that he had been drinking but these sorrows were not of the kind that drown easily yes i know mr oneil she spoke quietly there was no need to raise her voice here in this silent house and the tragedy of the situation demanded respect do you find time heals i would like to think so but i see no evidence of it she was inventing her own entire situation and yet she was bitterly aware that the fate she was creating in her mind for pitt could be paralleled in the future if narraway never regained his power in special branch and whoever had engineered his disgrace were to succeed pitt would fight for narraway of course he would the innate loyalty in him would never allow him to accept that narraway was guilty unless it were proved beyond any doubt at all reasonable or not and if it were it would hurt him to depths she would not be able to heal even with all the tenderness and courage she possessed disillusion is an ache that eats into the dreams of goodness of love of any value that matters even to the very belief in life she would have no trouble in lying to oneil in any way necessary she settled herself a little more comfortably in the chair and waited for his reply heals he said thoughtfully no grows a seal over maybe but its still bleeding underneath he looked at her curiously what did he do to you she leaped to the future she feared creating in her mind the worst of it my husband worked in special branch too she replied nothing to do with ireland anarchists in england people who let off bombs that killed ordinary women and children old people most of them poor oneil winced but he did not interrupt her narraway sent him on a dangerous job and then when it turned ugly and my husband was far from home narraway realised that he had made a mistake a misjudgement and he let my husband take the blame for it my husband was dismissed of course but thats not all he was accused of theft as well so he cant get any other position at all hes reduced to labouring if he can even find that hes not used to it he has no skills and its hard to learn in your forties hes not built for it she heard the thickening in her own voice as if she were fighting tears it was fear but it sounded like distress grief perhaps outrage at injustice how is my story going to help oneil asked her narraway denies it of course she replied but if he betrayed you as well that makes a lot of difference please tell me what happened narraway came here twenty years ago he began slowly he pretended to have sympathy with us and he fooled some people he looked irish and he used that he knows our culture and our dreams our history but we werent fooled youre born irish or youre not but we pretended to go along with it sean and kate and i he stopped his eyes misty as if he were seeing something far from this quiet sparse room in the past was alive for him the dead faces the unhealed wounds charlotte was uncertain whether to acknowledge that she was listening or if it would distract him she ended saying nothing we found out who he was exactly cormac went on we were planning a big rebellion then we thought we could use him give him a lot of false information turn the tables we had all sorts of dreams sean was the leader but kate was the fire she was beautiful like sunlight on autumn leaves wind and shadow the sort of loveliness you cant hold on to she was alive the way other women never are he stopped again lost in memory and the pain of it was naked in his face you loved her she said gently every man did he agreed his eyes meeting hers for an instant as if he had only just remembered that she was there you remind me of her a little her hair was about the same colour as yours but youre more natural like the earth steady charlotte was not sure if she should be insulted there was no time now but she would think of it later and wonder go on she prompted he had not told her anything yet except that he had been in love with his brothers wife was that really why he hated narraway as if he had seen her thought in her eyes he continued of course narraway saw the fire in her too he was fascinated like any man so we decided to use that god knows we had few enough weapons against him he was clever some people think the english are stupid and surely some of them are but not narraway never him so you decided to use his feelings for kate yes why not he demanded his eyes angry defending that decision so many years ago we were fighting for our land our right to govern ourselves and kate agreed she would have done anything for ireland his voice caught and for a moment he could not go on she waited there was no sound outside no wind or rain on the glass no footsteps no horses in the road even the dog at cormacs feet did not stir the house could have been anywhere out in the countryside miles from any other habitation the present had dissolved and gone away they became lovers kate and narraway cormac said bitterly she told us what he was planning he and the english at least thats what she said his voice was thick with grief wasnt it true she said when he did not continue he lied to her cormac answered he knew what she was doing what we all were somewhere she made a mistake the tears were running down his face and he made no effort to check them he fed us all lies but we believed him the uprising was betrayed stupid stupid stupid they blamed kate he gulped staring at the wall as if he could see all the players in that tragedy parading in front of him they saw she had lied to us he went on narraway did that to her used her against her own people thats why id see him in hell but i want him to suffer further here on earth where i know it for certain can you make that happen mrs pitt for kate she was appalled by the rage in him it shook his body like a disease his skin was blotchy the flesh of his face wasted he must once have been handsome what happened to her it was cruel to ask but charlotte knew it was not the end of the story yet and she needed to hear it from him not just from narraway she was murdered he replied strangled beautiful kate im sorry she meant it she tried to imagine the woman all passion and dreams as cormac had painted her but that vision was the memory of a man in love with an image kate had ceased to be breathing fallible able to laugh and be hurt wake and sleep like anyone else they said it was sean who killed her he went on but it couldnt have been he knew better than to believe she would have betrayed the cause that was narraway again he killed her because she would have told them what he had done he would never have left ireland alive he stared at charlotte his eyes brimming with tears waiting for her to respond she forced herself to speak why would he can you prove that she asked i mean can you give me anything i can take back to london that would make them listen to me she was cold now too dreading what he might say what if he could what would she do then narraway would excuse himself of course he would say he had had to kill her or she would have exposed him and the uprising might have succeeded perhaps that was even true but it was still ugly and terrible it was still murder he killed her because she wouldnt tell him what he wanted to know but if i could prove that do you think hed be alive cormac asked harshly theyd not have hanged poor sean and talulla be an orphan god help her charlotte gasped talulla shes kates daughter he said simply kate and sean did you not know that after sean and kate died she was cared for by a cousin so she could be protected as much as possible from the hatred against her mother poor child the dreadful useless tragedy of it overwhelmed charlotte she wanted to say something that would redeem any part of the loss but everything that came to her mind was banal im sorry she said im he looked up at her so are you going back to london to tell someone yes yes i am be careful he warned narraway wont go down easily hell kill you too if he thinks he has to to survive i will be careful she promised him i think i have a little more to learn yet but i promise ill be careful she stood up feeling awkward there was nothing to say to complete their conversation they moved from the desperate to the mundane as if it were completely natural but what words were there that could be adequate for what either of them felt thank you mr oneil she said gravely he took her to the door and opened it for her but he did not offer to find her any transport as if for him she ceased to be real the moment she stepped out onto the pavement where have you been narraway demanded as soon as she came into mrs hogans sitting room he had been standing by the window or perhaps pacing he looked exhausted and tense as if his imagination had plagued him with fear his eyes were hollow and the lines in his face deeper than she had ever seen them before are you all right whos with you where is he nobody is with me she answered but i am perfectly all right alone his voice shook you were out on the street alone in the dark for gods sake charlotte whats the matter with you anything could have happened i wouldnt even have known he put out his hand and gripped her arm she could feel the strength of him as if he were quite unaware how tightly he held her nothing happened to me victor i wasnt very far away and it isnt late there are plenty of people about she assured him you could have been lost then i would have asked for directions she said please there is no need to be concerned if id had to walk a little out of my way to get here it wouldnt have hurt me you could have he began then stopped perhaps realising that his fear was disproportionate he let go of her im sorry i she looked at him it was a mistake for an instant his emotion was too plain in his eyes she did not want to know that he cared so much now it would be impossible for either of them to pretend he did not love her and she could not pretend she did not know she turned away feeling the colour burning on her skin all words would be belittling the truth he stood still i went to see cormac oneil she said after a moment or two what i was perfectly safe i wanted to hear from him exactly what happened or at least what he believes and what did he say he asked quickly his voice cracking with tension she did not want to look at him to intrude into old grief which was still obviously so sharp but evasion was cowardly she met his eyes and repeated to him what cormac had said including the fact that talulla was kates daughter thats probably how he sees it narraway answered when she had finished i dare say he couldnt live with the truth kate was beautiful he smiled briefly in that moment she could imagine the man he had been twenty years earlier younger more virile perhaps less wise few men could resist her he went on i didnt try i knew they were using her to trap me she was brave passionate he smiled wryly perhaps a little short on humour but far more intelligent than they realised it sometimes happens when women are beautiful people dont see any further than that especially men its uncomfortable we see what we want to see charlotte frowned suddenly thinking of kate a pawn to others albeit one that they wanted fought over desired why do you say intelligent she asked we talked he replied about the cause what they planned to do i persuaded her it would rebound against them and it would have the deaths would have been violent and widespread attacks like that dont crush people and make them surrender they have exactly the opposite effect they would have united england against the rebels who could have lost all sympathy from everyone in europe even from some of their own kate told me what they were going to do the details so i could have it stopped charlotte tried to imagine it the grief the cost who killed her she asked she felt the loss touch her as if she had known kate more than simply as a name an imagined face sean he replied i dont know whether it was for betraying ireland as he saw it or betraying him with you narraway coloured but he did not look away from her yes do you know that beyond doubt yes his throat was so tight his voice sounded half strangled i found her body i think he meant me to she could not afford pity now why are you sure it was sean who killed her she had to be certain so she could get rid of the doubt for ever if narraway himself had killed her it might by some twisted logic of politics and terror be what he had to do to save even greater bloodshed she looked at him now with a mixture of new understanding of the weight he carried sorrow for what it had cost him whether that were a shame now or a lack of it which would be worse how did that affect pitt he would always hurt for his mistakes and for the decisions from which there was no escape thank heaven the biggest ones were not his to make why are you sure it was sean who killed her charlotte repeated he looked at her steadily what you really mean is how can i prove i didnt kill her myself she felt a heat of shame in her own face at least she would not lie to him yes he did not question her or blame her for thinking it possible she was cold when i found her he replied sean tried to blame me the police would have been happy to agree but i was with the viceroy in the residence in phoenix park at the time half a dozen staff saw me there apart from the viceroy himself and the police on guard duty they didnt know who i was but they would have recognised me in court if it had been necessary the briefest investigation showed them that i couldnt have been anywhere near where kate was killed it also proved that sean lied when he said he saw me and that by his own admission he was there he hesitated if you need to you can check it his smile was there for a moment then gone dont you think theyd have loved to hang me for it if theyd had the ghost of a chance yes she agreed feeling the weight ease from her grief was one thing but without guilt it was a passing wound something that would heal im im sorry i needed to ask perhaps i should have known you wouldnt have done it i would like you to think well of me charlotte he said quietly but i would rather you saw me as a real person capable of good and ill and of pity and shame victor dont he turned away slowly staring at the fire im sorry it wont happen again she left quietly going up to her room she needed to be alone and there was nothing either of them could say that would do anything but make matters worse they were at breakfast the following morning she with a slight headache after sleeping badly he weary but with the mark of professionalism so graciously back in place that yesterday could have been a dream something she thought of that had never happened they were eating toast and marmalade when the messenger arrived with a letter for narraway he thanked mrs hogan who brought it then tore it open charlotte watched his face but she could not read anything more than surprise when he looked up she waited for him to speak its from cormac he said gently he wants me to go and see him at midday he will tell me what happened and give me proof she was puzzled remembering cormacs hate the pain that seemed as sharp as it must have been the day it happened she leaned forward dont go you wont will you he put the letter down i came for the truth charlotte he may give it to me even if it is not what he means to do i have to go he still hates you she argued he cant afford to face the truth victor it would place him in the wrong all he has left is his illusions of what really happened that kate was loyal to ireland and the cause and that it would all have worked except for you he cant give that up i know he assured her reaching out his lean hand and touching her gently for an instant then withdrawing it again but i cant afford not to go i have nothing left to lose either if it was cormac who created the whole betrayal of mulhare i need to know how he did it and be able to prove it to croxdale his face tightened rather more than that i need to find out who is the traitor in lisson grove i cant let that go he did not offer any rationalisation taking it for granted that charlotte understood it gave her an odd feeling of being included even of belonging it was frightening for the emotional enormity of it and yet there was a warmth to it she would not willingly have sacrificed she did not argue any further but nodded and determined to follow after him and stay where she could see him he went out of the house quite casually as if merely to look at the weather then as she came to the door he turned and walked quickly towards the end of the road she followed after him barely having time to close the door behind her and needing to run a few steps to keep up she had a shawl on and her reticule with her and sufficient money for as long a fare as she would be likely to need he disappeared round the corner into the main street she had to hurry to make sure she saw which way he went as she had expected he went straight to the first carriage waiting spoke to the driver then climbed in she swung round with her back to the road and pretended to look in a shop window as soon as he had passed she darted out into the street to look for a second carriage it was long desperate moments before she found one she gave the driver the address of cormac oneils house and urged him to go as fast as possible she was already several minutes behind ill pay you an extra shilling if you catch up with the carriage that just left here she promised please hurry i dont want to lose him she sat forward peering out as the carriage careered down the street swung round the corner and then set off again at what felt like a gallop she was tossed around bruised and without any sense of where she was for what felt like ages but was probably no more than fifteen minutes at most then finally they lurched to a stop outside the house where she had been the previous evening she stepped out taking a moment to find her balance after the hectic ride she paid him more than he had asked for and then an extra shilling thank you she said then she walked up the same path she had trodden in the evening light such a short time ago somehow at midday the path looked longer the bushes more crowding in the trees overhead cut out more of the sky she had not reached the front door when she heard the dog barking it was an angry frightening sound with a note of hysteria to it as if the animal were out of control it had certainly not been like that yesterday evening it had been calm resting its head on oneils feet and barely noticing her she was surprised cormac did not come to see what the fuss was he could not possibly be unaware of the noise she touched the door with her fingers and it opened narraway was standing in the hall he swung round as the light spread across the floor for a moment he was startled then he regained his presence of mind i should have known he said grimly wait here the dog was now throwing itself at whatever barrier it was that held it in check its barking was high in its throat as if it would rip someone to shreds the moment it could reach them charlotte would not leave narraway alone she stepped inside and looked for the umbrella stand she had noticed yesterday she saw it picked out a sharpferruled black umbrella and held it as if it were a swordstick the barking was reaching a climax ahead of her narraway went to the sittingroom door to the right of where the dog was hurling itself at another door snarling in a high singing tone as if it scented prey close at last narraway opened the sittingroom door then stopped motionless charlotte could see over his shoulder that cormac oneil was lying on the floor on his back a pool of blood spreading on the polished wood around what was left of his head charlotte gulped trying to stop herself from being sick yesterday evening he had been alive angry weeping with passion and grief now there was nothing left but empty flesh lying waiting to be found by people who might or might not even care about him narraway went over and bent down touching the skin of cormacs face with his fingers hes still warm he said turning back to look at charlotte he had to raise his voice above the noise of the dog we must call the police he had barely finished speaking when there was a bang of the front door swinging open again and hitting the wall and then footsteps there was no time to wonder who it was a woman screamed with a short shrill sound and then seemed to choke charlotte swivelled round to stare at talulla lawless she was ashenfaced her hand to her mouth black eyes staring wildly past charlotte and narraway to the figure of cormac on the floor behind her a policeman tried to catch his breath as a wave of horror overtook him talulla glared at narraway i warned him she gasped i knew youd kill him after yesterday but he wouldnt listen i told him i told him her voice was getting higher and higher and her body was shaking the policeman regained control of himself and stepped forward looking at charlotte then at narraway what happened here he asked he murdered my uncle cant you see that talulla shouted at him listen to the dog dammit for gods sake dont let him out hell tear that murderer apart thats what brought me here i heard him poor creature he was dead when we got here charlotte shouted back at her we dont know what happened any more than you do narraway stepped forward to the policeman i came in first he said to the policeman mrs pitt waited outside she has nothing to do with this she never met mr oneil until very recently ive known him for twenty years please allow her to leave talulla thrust out her hand finger pointing theres the gun look its lying right there on the floor he hasnt even had time to take it away of course he hasnt charlotte retorted we only just got here if you ask the charlotte be quiet narraway said with such force that she stopped speaking he faced the policeman i came into the house first please allow mrs pitt to leave as i said before she had no acquaintance with mr oneil beyond a casual introduction i have known him for years we have an old enmity which has finally caught up with us is that not true miss lawless yes she said vehemently the dog just started to bark i can hear it from my house i live only a few yards away over there if thered been anybody else hed have raised this row before ask anyone the policeman looked at cormac on the floor at narraway and the blood on his shoes then at charlotte whitefaced by the door the dog was still barking and trying to break down the barrier that held it in check sir im sorry but youll have to come with me itll be best for you if you dont give me any trouble i have no intention of giving you trouble narraway told him none of this is your fault will you permit me to make certain that mrs pitt has sufficient funds to pay a cab driver she has had a very ugly shock the policeman looked confused she was with you sir he pointed out no narraway corrected him she came after me she was not here when i arrived i went in and oneil and i quarrelled he attacked me and i had no choice but to defend myself you came deliberately to kill him talulla accused him he showed you for the liar and the cheat you are he got you dismissed from your position and you wanted your revenge you came here and shot him she looked at charlotte can you deny that yes i can charlotte responded heatedly i did arrive after mr narraway was already here but only seconds behind him he had not gone further than the hallway the sittingroom door was closed we discovered mr oneils body at the same moment liar talulla shouted youre his mistress youd say anything charlotte gasped a look at once of humour and pain flickered in narraways eyes he turned to the policeman that is not true please allow her to go if you can find the cabby who brought her he will affirm that mrs pitt arrived after i did and he must have seen her come into the house oneil was shot as you observe ask the driver if he heard the shot the policeman nodded youre right sir dont take the lady down with you he turned to talulla and if youd go back home maam ill take care o this an you maam he looked at charlotte youd better go an find a cab back to your lodgings but dont leave dublin if you please well be wishing to talk to you where are you staying number seven molesworth street thank you maam thatll be all now dont stop me doing my duty or itll be the worse for you charlotte could do nothing but watch helplessly as another policeman arrived narraway was manacled and led away to talullas intense delight charlotte walked back down the pathway and along the road dazed and alone chapter eight pitt ceased to struggle at first in the heat of the moment there was no point he was in the grasp of two burly constables both convinced they had apprehended a violent lunatic who had just hurled two men possibly strangers to him off a fastmoving train the irate and terrified passengers who had witnessed half the events had seen pitt on the platform with the first man who had gone over and then alone with gower just before he had been pitched over as well i know what i saw one of them stated he stood as far away from pitt as he could his face a mask of horror in the railway platform gaslight he threw them both over you want to watch yourselves or hell have you too hes insane he has to be threw them over one after the other we were fighting pitt protested he attacked me but i won which one of them would that be sir one of the constables asked him the first one or the second one the second one pitt answered but he heard the note of desperation in his own voice it sounded ridiculous even to him maybe he didnt like it that youd thrown the first man off the train the constable said reasonably e was tryin to arrest you good citizen doin is duty he attacked me the first time pitt tried to explain the other man was trying to rescue me and he lost the fight but when this second man attacked you you won right the constable said with open disbelief obviously since im here pitt snapped if you undo the manacles ill show you my warrant card im a member of special branch yes sir the constable said sarcastically they always go around throwin people off trains very special they are pitt barely controlled his temper look in my pocket inside my coat up at the top he said between his teeth youll find my card the constables looked at each other yeah an why would you be pitchin people off trains sir because the man attacked me pitt said again he is a dangerous man planning violence here he knew as he said it how absurd that sounded considering that gower was dead on the track and pitt was standing here alive and unhurt apart from a few bruises which were on his body and invisible under his clothes look he tried again gower attacked me the stranger came to my rescue but gower was stronger than he and he lost the fight i couldnt save him then gower attacked me again but this time i was ready i won look for my warrant card thatll prove who i am the constables exchanged glances again then one of them very gingerly approached pitt and held his coat open with one hand while the other felt inside his inner pocket there int nothin there sir he said removing his hand quickly theres my warrant card and my passport pitt said with a sense of rising panic it had to be he had had them both when he got onto the train at shoreham he remembered putting them back as always no sir the constable repeated your pockets empty sir there int nothin in it at all now why dont you come quietly no use in causing a lot o fuss just gets people urt and i can promise you sir itll be you as comes off worst he turned to the other passenger thank you for yer trouble sir we got yer name and address well be in touch with yer when we needs more pitt drew in his breath to try reasoning further and realised the futility of it he knew what must have happened either his warrant card and passport had fallen out of his pocket in the fight which didnt seem likely not from a deep pocket so well concealed or else gower had taken the precaution of picking it during the struggle they had stood very close struggling together pitt had been thinking of saving his own life not being robbed he turned to the constable closest to him ive just come in from france through southampton he said with sudden hope i had to have my passport then or they wouldnt have let me in my warrant card was with it cant you see that ive been robbed the constable stared at him shaking his head i only know as youre on the train sir i dont know where you got on or where you was before that you just come quietly and well get you sorted at the police station dont give us any more trouble sir believe me yer got enough already pitt made no protest as they led him away it would be pointless he would probably get hurt and it would be grotesquely undignified as it was a crowd was gathering watching him at this moment it was impossible for him to feel sorry gower was dead the other passenger he grieved for with a dull angry pain do you have a telephone at the police station he demanded yes sir o course we do if yer got family well call them for yer an let em know where you are the policeman promised thank you but when they arrived at the police station and pitt was led in a constable closely at either side of him he was put straight into a cell and the door locked my phone call he persisted well make it for yer sir oo shall we call then pitt had considered it if he called charlotte she would be frightened and very distressed and there was nothing she could do far better he call narraway who would straighten out the whole hideous mess and could tell charlotte about it afterwards victor narraway he answered e related to yer the constable asked suspiciously brotherinlaw pitt lied quickly he gave them the lisson grove number thats his work its where hell be or theyll know where to find him at this time o night sir theres always someone there please just call if thats what you want well call thank you pitt sat down on the hard wooden bench in the cell and waited he must stay calm it would all be explained in a matter of minutes this part of the nightmare would be over there was still gowers treachery and his death now in the silence of the cell he had time to think of it more deeply he should not have been surprised that gower came after him the pleasant friendly face gower had shown in france indeed all the time they had worked together over the last few months might have been part of his real character but it was superficial merely a skin over a very different man beneath pitt thought of his quick humour how he had watched the girl in the pink dress admiring her taking pleasure in her easy walk the swing of her skirt imagining what she would be like to know he remembered how gower liked the fresh bread he drank his coffee black even though he pulled his mouth at its bitterness and still went back for more he pictured how he stood smiling with his face to the sun watched the sailing boats on the bay and knew the french names for all the different kinds of seafood people fought for their own causes for all kinds of reasons maybe gower believed in his goal as much as pitt did they were just utterly different pitt had liked him even enjoyed his company how had he not seen the ruthlessness that could kill west and then turn on pitt so easily except perhaps it had not been easy gower might have lain awake all night wretched seeking another way and not finding it pitt would never know it was painful to realise that so much was not as you had trusted and your own judgement was nowhere near the truth he could imagine what narraway would have to say about that the constable came back stopping just outside the bars he did not have the keys in his hand pitts heart sank suddenly he felt confused and a little sick sorry sir the constable said unhappily i called the number you gave it was a branch o the police all right but they said as theyd got no one there called narraway an they couldnt elp yer of course narraways there pitt said desperately hes head of special branch call again you must have had the wrong number this is impossible it were the right number sir the constable repeated stolidly it was special branch like you said an they told me they got no one there called victor narraway i asked em careful sir an they were polite but very definite there int no victor narraway there now you settle down sir get a bit o rest well see what we can do in the morning ill get you a cup o tea an mebbe a sandwich if yer like pitt was numb the nightmare was getting worse his imagination created all kinds of horror what had happened to narraway how wide was this conspiracy perhaps he should have realised that if they removed pitt himself to france on a pointless errand then of course they would have got rid of narraway as well there was no purpose in removing pitt otherwise he was only a kind of backup a righthand man possibly but not more than that narraway was the real threat to them yer want a cup o tea sir the constable repeated yer look a bit rough sir an a sandwich yes pitt said slowly the mans humanity made it all the more grotesque yet he was grateful for it i would thank you constable yer just rest sir dont give yerself so much trouble ill get yer a sandwich would am be all right very good thank you pitt sat down on the cot to show that he had no intention of causing any problems for them he was numb anyway he did not even know who to fight certainly not this man who was doing his best to exercise both care and a degree of decency in handling a prisoner he believed had just committed a double murder it was a long and wretched night he slept little and when he did his dreams were full of fear shifting darkness and sudden explosions of sound and violence when he woke in the morning his head throbbed and his whole body was bruised and aching from the fight it was painful to stand up when the constable came back again with another cup of tea well take yer ter the magistrate later on he said watching pitt carefully yer look awful pitt tried to smile i feel awful i need to wash and shave and i look as if ive slept in my clothes because i have comes with being in gaol sir ave a cup o tea itllelp yes i expect it will even if not much pitt accepted he stood well back from the door so the constable could place it inside without risking an attack it was the usual way of doing things the constable screwed up his face yer bin in the cells before int yer he observed no pitt replied but ive been on your side of them often enough as i told you im a policeman myself i have another number i would like you to call seeing that mr narraway doesnt seem to be there please i need to let someone know where i am my wife and family at least oo would that be sir the constable put down the tea and backed out of the cell again closing and locking the door you give me the number and ill do it everyone deserves that much lady vespasia cumminggould pitt replied ill write the number down for you if you give me a pencil you jus tell me sir ill write it down pitt obeyed there was no point in arguing the man returned ten minutes later his face wideeyed and a trifle pale she says as she knows yer sir described yer to a t she did says as yere one o the best policemen in london an mr narraways oo yer said e were but summinks appened to im shes sending a member o parliament down ter get yer out ofere an as wed better treat yer proper or shell be avin a word wi the chief constable i dunno if shes real sir i ope yer understand i gotter keep yer in ere till this gentleman comes wi proof es wot e says e is an all e could be anyone but i know i got two dead bodies on the tracks of course pitt said wearily he would not tell him that gower was special branch and pitt had not known that he was a traitor until the day before yesterday of course ill wait here he added id be obliged if you didnt take me before the magistrate until the man arrives that lady vespasia sends yes sir i think as we can arrange that he sighed i think as wed better next time yer come from southampton sir id be obliged if yerd take some other line pitt managed a lopsided smile actually id prefer this one given the circumstances youve been very fair the constable was lost for words he struggled but clearly nothing he could think of seemed adequate it was nearly two hours later that mr somerset carlisle mp came sauntering into the police station elegantly dressed his curious face filled with a rueful amusement many years ago he had committed a series of outrages in london to draw attention to an injustice against which he had no other weapon pitt had been the policeman who led the investigation the murder had been solved and he had seen no need to pursue the man who had so bizarrely brought it to public attention carlisle had remained grateful and become an ally in several cases since then on this occasion he had with him all his identification of the considerable office he held within ten minutes pitt was a free man brushing aside the apologies of the local police and assuring them that they had performed their duties excellently and found no fault with them what the devils going on carlisle asked as they walked outside into the sun and headed in the direction of the railway station vespasia called me in great agitation this morning saying you had been charged with a double murder you look like hell do you need a doctor there was laughter in his voice but his eyes reflected a very real anxiety a fight pitt explained briefly he found walking with any grace very difficult he had not realised at the time how bruised he was on the platform at the back of a railway carriage travelling at considerable speed he told carlisle very briefly what had happened carlisle nodded its a very dark situation i dont know the whole story but id be very careful what you do pitt vespasia told me to get you to her house not lisson grove in fact she advised very strongly against going there at all pitt was cold the sunlit street the clatter of traffic all seemed unreal whats happened to narraway i dont know ive heard whispers but i dont know the truth if anyone does itll be vespasia but ill take you to my flat first clean you up a bit you look as if youve spent the night in gaol pitt did not grace the observation with a reply two hours later he was washed shaved and dressed in a clean shirt provided by carlisle as well as clean socks and underwear pitt alighted from the hansom cab outside vespasias house and walked up to the front door she was expecting him and he was taken straight to her usual favourite sitting room which looked onto the garden there was a bowl of fresh narcissi on the table their scent filling the air outside the breeze very gently stirred the new leaves on the trees vespasia was dressed in silver grey with the long ropes of pearls he was so accustomed to seeing her wear she looked calm as she always did and her beauty still moved him with a certain awe however he knew her well enough to see the profound anxiety in her eyes it alarmed him and he was too tired to hide it she looked him up and down i see somerset lent you a shirt and cravat she observed with a faint smile is it so obvious he asked standing in front of her of course you would never choose a shirt of that shade or a cravat with a touch of wine in it but it becomes you very well please sit down it is uncomfortable craning my neck to look up at you he would never have seated himself before she gave her permission but he was glad to do so in the chair opposite her the formalities were over and they would address the issues that burdened them both where have you been she asked she gave no thought even to the possibility that he might consider it confidential from her she knew more about the power and danger of secrets than most ministers of government in st malo he replied he was embarrassed by his own failure to see through the subterfuge more rapidly however he did not avoid her eyes as he told her about himself and gower chasing through the streets their brief parting then their meeting and almost instantly finding wrexham crouched over the corpse of west his neck slashed open and blood covering the stones vespasia winced but did not interrupt him he described their pursuit of wrexham to the east end and then in the train to southampton and on the ferry across to france he found himself explaining too fully why they had not arrested wrexham until it sounded miserably like excuses thomas she interrupted gently common sense justifies your actions as seen at the time you do not need to dot the is and cross the ts for me you were aware of a socialist conspiracy and you believed it to be more important than one grisly murder in london what did you learn in st malo very little he replied we saw one or two known socialist agitators in the first couple of days at least i think we did you think he explained to her that it was gower who had made the identification and he had accepted it i see who did he say they were he was about to say that she would not know their names then he remembered her own radical part in the revolutions of which had swept across every country in western europe except britain she had been in italy manning the barricades for that brief moment of hope in a new freedom it was possible she had not lost all interest jacob meister and pieter linsky he replied but they didnt come back again she frowned the tension increased in the rigidity of her shoulders the way her hands in her lap gripped each other you know of them he concluded of course she said drily and many others they are dangerous thomas there is a new radicalism awakening in europe the next insurrections will not be like fortyeight it is a different breed there will be more violence i think perhaps it will be much more the russian monarchy cannot last a lot longer unless it learns to change the oppression is fearful i have a few friends left who are able to write occasionally old friends who tell me the truth there is desperate poverty the tsar has lost all sense of reality and is totally out of touch with his people as are all his ministers and advisers the gulf between the obscenely rich and the literally starving is so great it will eventually swallow them all the only thing we do not know is when the thought was chilling but he did not even question it and i am afraid the news is not good here but you already know something of it only that narraway is out of lisson grove pitt replied i have no idea why or what happened i know why she sighed and he saw the sadness in her eyes she looked pale and tired he has been charged with the embezzlement of a considerable amount of money which what it was absurd ordinarily he would not have dreamed of interrupting her it was a break of courtesy unimaginable to him but the disbelief was too urgent to remain concealed a flicker of amusement sparkled in her eyes and vanished as quickly i am aware of the absurdity thomas victor has several faults but petty theft is not among them you said a large amount large to steal it cost a mans life because he did not have it but if victor were to steal it would be the crown jewels or something really worth the price of his position in special branch i doubt anything short of the queens crown would be sufficient for him someone engineered this very astutely i have my ideas as to who it may have been but they are no more than ideas insubstantial and possibly quite mistaken where is narraway in ireland she told him in prison he asked and why ireland he must find out he had expected him to be in london not in prison so far as i know but i have not heard he went of his own will because he believes that whoever was the author of his misfortune is irish and the answer to that persons identity is to be found there she bit her lip very slightly for her it was a gesture of anxiety so deep he could not recall having seen her do it before aunt vespasia he leaned forward a little he believed it personal she continued an act of revenge for an old injury at the time i thought he might have been correct although it was a long time to wait for such perceived justice and the irish have never been noted for their patience especially for revenge i assumed some new circumstance must have made it possible you say assumedwere you wrong he asked after what you have told me of your experience in france and of this man gower who was your assistant and of whom neither you nor anyone else in special branch appeared to have any suspicions i think victor was mistaken she said gravely i fear this trumpedup allegation may have had nothing to do with personal revenge but have been a means of removing him from command of the situation in london and replacing him with either someone of far less competence or very much worse of sympathy with the socialist cause it looks as if you were removed to france for the same reason pitt smiled with a bitter humour i am not of narraways experience or power he told her honestly i am not worth their trouble to remove you are too modest my dear she regarded him with amused affection surely you would have fought for victor i think you are fond of him but even if i am wrong in that you owe him a great loyalty he took you into special branch when the metropolitan police dismissed you and you had too many enemies to return there he took some risk doing so and made more enemies of his own it is not appreciated in certain circles most of those men are gone now but at the time it was a dangerous act you have more than repaid him with your ability but you can now repay the courage i do not imagine you think differently her eyes were steady on his added to which you have enemies in special branch yourself because of the favour he showed you and your somewhat rapid rise with victor gone you will be very fortunate indeed if you survive him for long even if you do you will be forever watching over your shoulder and waiting for the unseen blow if you do not know that you are far more naive than i think you the loyalty would have been enough he told her but yes of course i am aware that without narraways protection i wont last long her voice was very gentle my dear it is imperative for many reasons that we do what we can to clear victors name i am glad you see it so clearly he felt a sudden chill a warning she inclined her head in assent then you will understand why charlotte has gone to ireland with victor to help him in any way she can he will find it hard enough on his own she may be his eyes and ears in places he is unable to go himself for a moment pitt did not even understand as if her words were half in a foreign language the key words were plain enough charlotte narraway and ireland but the whole of it made no sense charlottes gone to ireland he repeated she cant have what on earth could she do she doesnt know ireland and she certainly doesnt know anything about narraways past his old cases or anyone else in special branch he hesitated to tell her she had misunderstood it sounded so rude but it was the only explanation thomas vespasia said gravely the situation is very serious victor is helpless he is closed out of his office and all access to any assistance from special branch we know that at least one person there highly placed is a thief and a traitor we do not know who it is charles austwick is in charge austwick yes you see how serious it is do you imagine that without your help austwick will find the traitor apparently none of you including victor were aware of gowers treason who else would betray you charlotte is at least in part aware of the danger including the danger to you personally she went with victor partly out of loyalty to him but mostly to save his career because she is very sharply aware that yours depends upon it also and another element which you may not yet have had time to consider if victor can be made to appear guilty of theft how difficult would it be for the same people to make you appear guilty with him it was a nightmare again frightening irrational pitt was exhausted aching with the pain of disillusion and the horror of his own violence his body was bruised and so tired he could sleep sitting in this comfortable chair if only he could relax long enough and yet fear knotted the muscles in his back his shoulders and his neck and his head throbbed this last piece of news made his whole situation worse he struggled to make sense of it where is she is she safe safe was a stupid word to use if she was in ireland with narraway thomas victor is out there with her he wont let any harm come to her if he can prevent it vespasia said softly pitt knew narraway was in love with charlotte but he did not want to hear it if he cared he wouldnt have he began allowed her to go she finished for him thomas she has gone in order to honour her friendship and loyalty and above all to protect her husbands career and therefore the familys means of survival what do you imagine he could have said or done that would have stopped her not told her he was going in the first place he snapped really vespasia raised her silver eyebrows and left her wondering why you did not come home after chasing your informant through the streets not that night or for days afterwards she might have gone to lisson grove and asked by which time she would be frantic with fear and she would have been met with the news that narraway was gone and you were nowhere to be found and there was no one in lisson grove to help or support you do you feel that would have been preferable no he felt foolish panicky what should he do he wanted to go immediately to ireland and make sure charlotte was safe but even an instants reflection told him that might do at least as much harm as good and anyway the heart of the problem was not there but in london he had no idea what narraways old case was there were so many and it now looked as if that were a red herring anyway if however it was what had lured narraway to ireland and pitt to france by reacting thoughtlessly he would be playing directly into the conspirators hands it was an irresponsible hotheaded thing even to think of ill go home and see daniel and jemima he said more calmly if they have had a week of mrs waterman they may be feeling pretty desperate she is not an easy woman i must speak to charlotte about that when she gets home you dont need to concern yourself vespasia began you dont know the woman he started she is irrelevant vespasia told him she left what then vespasia raised her hand that is the other thing i was going to tell you she has been replaced by a new maid on the recommendation of gracie she seems a very competent girl and gracie looks in on them every day i have been in touch with gracie all is well in fact i must say that i rather like the sound of young minnie maude she has character pitt was dizzy everything seemed to be shifting the moment he looked at it it changed as if someone had struck the kaleidoscope and all the pieces had shattered and reformed in a different pattern minnie maude he said stumblingly for gods sake how old is she to him gracie herself was little more than a child his own intelligence told him that was because he had known her since she was thirteen and she had not grown much taller than she was then he knew her ability and her courage through experience who was this minnie maude left alone in charge of his children she could be anyone about twenty vespasia replied gracie has known her since she was eight she has courage and sense there is nothing to concern yourself about thomas as i said i kept a discreet eye on the girl via gracie and everything was satisfactory perhaps just as importantly both daniel and jemima like her do you imagine i would allow the situation to remain if that were not so now he felt clumsy and deeply ungracious no he knew an apology was appropriate his fear had made him foolish and rude of course not im sorry i he hunted for words she smiled it was a sudden beautiful gesture that lit her face and restored everything of the beauty that had made her famous i would think less of you were you to take it for granted she said now before you leave would you like tea and are you hungry if you are i shall have whatever you care for prepared in the meantime we need to discuss what is to be done next it is now up to you to address the real issue behind all this ploy and counterploy by whoever is the traitor at lisson grove her words were suddenly and hideously sobering how like vespasia to discuss the fate of revolution murder and treason in high places over tea and a plate of sandwiches in the withdrawing room it restored a certain sanity to the world at least something was as it should be pitt drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly steadying himself thank you i should very much like a good cup of tea the prison in shoreham had only the most moderate amenities and a sandwich would be excellent pitt arrived home at keppel street in the early afternoon both daniel and jemima were still at school he knocked on the door rather than use his key and startle this minnie maude in whom vespasia seemed to have so much confidence he stood on the step shifting his weight from one foot to the other his mind racing over what changes he might find what small things uncared for changed so it was no longer the home he was used to and which he realised he loved fiercely exactly as it was except of course charlotte should be there without her nothing was more than a shell the door opened and a young woman stood just inside her expression guarded yes sir she said it politely but stood squarely blocking the way in can i elp yer she was not pretty but she had beautiful hair thick and curling and of a rich bright colour and she had the freckles on her face that so often went with such vividness she was far taller than gracie but slender however she had the same direct almost defiant gaze are you minnie maude he asked beggin yer pardon sir but that int yer business she replied if yer want the master yer gimme a card an ill ask im to call on yer he could not help smiling ill give you a card by all means he fished for one in his pocket and passed it to her then wondered if she could read he had become used to gracie reading since charlotte had taught her minnie maude looked at the card then up at him then at the card again he smiled at her the blush spread up her cheeks in a hot tide im sorry sir she stumbled over the words i dint know yer dont be sorry he said quickly you shouldnt allow anyone in unless you know who they are and not just because they say so she stood back allowing him to pass he went into the familiar hallway and immediately smelled the lavender floor polish the hall mirror was clean the surfaces free of dust jemimas shoes were placed neatly side by side under the coat stand he walked down to the kitchen and looked around everything was as it should be blueandwhite ringed plates on the welsh dresser copper pans on the wall kitchen table scrubbed the stove burning warm but not overhot he could smell newly baked bread and the clean comfortable aroma of fresh laundry hanging from the airing rail up near the ceiling he was home again there was nothing wrong except that his family was not there but he knew where charlotte was and the children were at school would you like a cup o tea sir minnie maude asked in an uncertain voice he did not really need one so soon after leaving vespasias but he felt she would like to do something familiar and useful thank you he accepted he had been obliged to buy several necessities for the days he had been in france including the case in which he now carried them i have a little laundry in my bag but i dont know whether i shall be home for dinner or not im sorry if i am something cold to eat will do very well yes sir would you like some cold mutton an ot bubble and squeak thats wot daniel an jemimall beavin as its wot they like ceptin they like eggs wif it eggs will be excellent thank you he meant it it sounded familiar comfortable and very good vespasia had warned pitt not to go to lisson grove but he had no choice and at least now he was far more aware of the situation he could not learn what was really planned rather than the bluff that had taken him to france and kept him there so long he was still both angry and embarrassed by the ease with which he had been duped also he could do nothing to help narraway and now obviously charlotte as well without information he could learn only there and of course there was the question of explaining what had happened to gower he had no idea how badly he had been disfigured by the fall from the train but every effort would be made to identify him and the police were bound to succeed sooner or later indeed when he reached lisson grove he might find that it had already happened what should his story be how much of the truth could he tell without losing every advantage of surprise that he had he did not know who his enemies were but they certainly knew him his instinct was to affect as much ignorance as possible the less they considered him a worthwhile opponent the less likely they were to eliminate him it would be a manner of camouflage at least for a while he should be open and honest about the attack on the train it was a matter of record with the police but it would be easy enough highly believable in fact to claim that he had no idea who the man was remove every thought that it was personal he had last seen gower in st malo when they agreed that pitt should come home to see what lisson grove knew of any conspiracy and that gower should remain in france and watch frobisher and wrexham and anyone else of interest naturally pitt would know nothing of narraways disgrace and be thoroughly shocked he arrived just before four oclock he went in through the door past the man on duty just inside and asked to see narraway he was told to wait as he had expected but it was a surprisingly short time before charles austwick himself came down and conducted pitt up to what used to be narraways office pitt noticed immediately that all signs of narraway were gone his pictures the photograph of his mother which used to sit on top of the bookcase the few personal books of poetry and memoirs the engraved brass bowl from his time in north africa he stared at austwick allowing his sense of loss to show in his face hoping austwick would see it as confusion sit down pitt austwick waved him to the chair opposite the desk of course youre wondering what the devils going on im afraid i have some shocking news for you pitt forced himself to look alarmed as if his imagination were racing something has happened to mr narraway is he hurt ill im afraid in some ways it is worse than that austwick said sombrely narraway appears to have stolen a rather large amount of money and when faced with it he disappeared we believe he has gone to ireland obviously he has been dismissed from the service and at least for the time being i have replaced him i am sure that is temporary but until further notice you will report to me im sorry it must be a great blow to you indeed it is to all of us i dont think anyone imagined narraway of all people would give in to that kind of temptation pitts mind raced how should he respond he had thought it was all worked out in his mind but sitting here in narraways office subtly but so completely changed he was uncertain again was austwick the traitor if so then he was a far cleverer man than pitt had thought but pitt had had no idea that there was a traitor at all and he had trusted gower what was his judgement worth i can see that youre stunned austwick said patiently weve had a little while to get used to the idea we knew almost as soon as you had gone by the way where is gower pitt inhaled deeply and plunged in i left him in france in st malo he replied he watched austwicks face as closely as he dared trying to read in his eyes his gestures if he knew that that was only half true austwick spoke slowly as if he also were measuring what he said and he seemed to be watching pitt just as closely had he noticed somerset carlisles beautifully cut shirt or his winecoloured cravat pitt repeated exactly what he believed had happened at the time he had first notified narraway that he had to remain in france he had never submitted more than a superficial report not trusting detail to the post and certainly not to anything as public as a telegram even one in carefully coded language he said nothing about the facts involving gower that he now knew austwick listened attentively his expression did not betray whether he knew anything further or not i see he said at last drumming his fingers silently on the desk top so you left gower there in the hope that there might yet be something worthwhile to observe yes sir he added the sir with difficulty there was a slowly mounting rage inside him that this man was sitting here in narraways chair behind his desk was he also a pawn in this game or was he the one playing it with the opposing pieces do you think that is likely austwick asked you say you saw nothing after that first sighting of who did you say meister and linsky was it yes pitt agreed there were plenty of people coming and going all the time but neither of us recognised anyone else its possible that was coincidence on the other hand west was murdered and the man who killed him very brutally and openly fled to that house there has to be a reason for that austwick appeared to consider it for several moments finally he looked up his lips pursed youre right there is certainly something happening and there is a good chance that it concerns violence that may affect us here in england even if it begins in france we have our allies to consider and what our failure to warn them may do to our relationship i would certainly feel a distinct sense of betrayal if they were to have wind of such a threat against us and keep silent about it yes sir pitt agreed although the words all but stuck in his throat he rose to his feet if youll excuse me i have several matters to attend to yes of course austwick agreed he seemed calm even assured pitt found himself shaking with anger as he left the room making an effort to close the door softly that evening he went to see the minister sir gerald croxdale croxdale himself had suggested that pitt come to his house if the matter were as private and as urgent as pitt had said then it would be better if their meeting were not observed by others croxdales home in hampstead was old and very handsome overlooking the heath the garden trees were coming into leaf and the air seemed to be full of birdsong pitt was shown in by the butler he found croxdale standing in his library which had long windows onto the lawn at the back of the house at present the curtains were open and the evening sky beyond was pale with the last light croxdale turned from gazing at it as pitt came in he offered his hand miserable time he said sympathetically pretty bad shock to all of us ive known narraway for years difficult man not really a team player but brilliant and id always thought he was sound but it seems as if a man can never entirely leave his past behind he gestured to one of the armchairs beside the fire do sit down tell me what happened in st malo by the way have you had any dinner pitt realised with surprise that he had not he had not even thought of eating and his body was clenched with anxiety as different possibilities poured through his mind now he was fumbling for a gracious answer sandwich croxdale offered roast beef acceptable experience told pitt it was better to eat than try to think rationally on an empty stomach thank you sir croxdale rang the bell and when the butler appeared again he requested roast beef sandwiches and whisky now he sat back as soon as the door was closed tell me about st malo pitt offered him the same edited version he had given austwick he was not yet ready to tell anyone the whole truth croxdale had known victor narraway far longer than he had known pitt if he would believe that narraway had stolen money why should he think any better of pitt who was his protege and closest ally the butler brought the sandwiches which were excellent pitt took an unaccustomed glass of whisky with it but declined a second to have the fire inside him was good his heart beating a little faster however to be fuzzyheaded could be disastrous croxdale considered in silence for some time before he replied pitt waited him out i am certain you have done the right thing croxdale said at length the situation requires very careful watching but at this point we cannot afford your absence from lisson grove this fearful business with narraway has changed all our priorities pitt was aware that croxdale was watching him far more closely than at a glance it might seem he tried to keep his expression respectful concerned but not as if he were already aware of the details croxdale sighed i imagine it comes as a shock to you as it does to me perhaps we should all have seen some warning but i admit i did not of course we are aware of peoples financial interests we would be remiss not to be narraway has no urgent need of money as far as we know this whole business with oneil is longstanding some twenty years or more he looked closely at pitt his brows drawn together did he tell you anything about it no sir old case all very ugly but i thought it was over at the time we all did very briefly narraway was in charge of the irish situation and we knew there was serious trouble brewing as indeed there was he foiled it so successfully that there was never any major news about it only afterwards did we learn what the price had been pitt did not need to pretend his ignorance nor the growing fear inside him chilling his body croxdale shook his head minutely his face clouded with unhappiness narraway used one of their own against them a woman named kate oneil the details i dont know and i prefer to be able to claim ignorance the end of it was that the womans husband killed her rather messily and was tried and hanged for it pitt was stunned he tried to imagine the grief and the guilt of it whoever was involved whatever had happened was narraway really as ruthless as that implied he pictured narraways face in all the circumstances they had known each other through success and failure exhaustion fear disappointment the final conclusion of dozens of battles won or lost reading him defied reason it was instinct the trust that had grown up over time in all sorts of ways it took pitt a painful and uncertain effort to conceal his feelings he tried to look confused if all this happened twenty years ago what is it that has changed now he asked croxdale was only momentarily taken aback we dont know he replied presumably something in oneils own situation i thought you said he was hanged oh yes the husband was that was sean oneil but his brother cormac is still very much alive they were unusually close even for an irish family croxdale explained then why did cormac wait twenty years for his revenge i assume you are saying that narraway took the money in some way because of oneil croxdale hesitated then looked at pitt guardedly you know i have no idea clearly we need to know a good deal more than we do at present i assume it is to do with oneil because narraway went almost immediately to ireland he either has many enemies there and is in grave danger or he has made new allies and by exposing mulhare as a traitor has turned to them and intends to work against us there pitt felt as if he had been sandbagged he struggled to keep any sense of proportion even of reality he stared at croxdale seeing his face waver and the room seem to swim in and out of his focus im sorry croxdale said gravely it has already come as a terrible shock to you you could have had no idea of this side of narraway and i admit neither had i i feel remiss to have had such a man in charge of our most sensitive service during my period of office his extraordinary skill completely masked this darker and clearly very duplicitous side of his nature pitt refused to believe it partly because he could not bear it charlotte was in ireland with narraway what had happened to her how could he ask croxdale without admitting that he knew this he would not draw vespasia into it she was one element he had in his favour perhaps the only one croxdale spoke very quietly now as if he feared some waiting servant might hear him pitt this is very grave indeed im glad you see the depth of it so immediately we have to regroup our forces to meet this appalling situation there seem to be plots on all sides im sure what you and gower were witness to is part of some larger and possibly very dangerous plan the socialist tide has been rising for some time in europe as we are all aware i can no longer have narraway in charge obviously i need the very best i can find a man i can trust morally and intellectually whose loyalty is beyond question and who has no ghosts from the past to sabotage our present attempts to safeguard our country and all it stands for pitt blinked of course did that mean that croxdale knew austwick was the traitor pitt had been avoiding the issue waiting judging pointlessly it was a relief croxdale was clever more reliable than he had thought then how could he think such things of narraway but what was pitts judgement to rely on he had trusted gower croxdale was still looking at him intently pitt could think of nothing to say we need a man who knows what narraway was doing and can pick up the reins he dropped croxdale said you are the only man who fits that description pitt its a great deal to ask of you but there is no one else and your skills and integrity are things about which i believe narraway was both right and honest but austwick pitt stammered he is a good stopgap croxdale said coolly he is not the man for the job in such dangerous times as these frankly he has not the ability to lead or to make the difficult decisions of such magnitude he was a good enough lieutenant pitts head swam he had not the experience of decisionmaking the mastery of the political stakes or the nerve and selfbelief to stake his own judgement above that of others and act swiftly secretly and with devastating power as narraway had had only in this moment looking at croxdale did he grasp some of the magnitude of narraways job neither have i the skills he said aloud and i havent been in the service long enough for the other men to have confidence in me i will support austwick to the best of my ability but i havent the abilities to take on the leadership croxdale smiled i thought you would be modest it is a good quality arrogance leads to mistakes im sure you will seek advice and take it at least most of the time but you have never lacked judgement before or the courage to go with your own beliefs i know your record pitt do you imagine you have gone unnoticed in the past he asked it gently as if with a certain degree of amusement i imagine not pitt conceded you will know a good deal about anyone before taking them into the service at all but not in your case croxdale contradicted him you were narraways recruit but i have made it my business to learn far more about you since then your country needs you now pitt narraway has effectively betrayed our trustyou were narraways secondincommandthis is your duty as well as your privilege to serve he held out his hand pitt was overwhelmed not with pleasure or any sense of honour but with mourning for narraway fear for charlotte and the knowledge that this weight of command of power for good and ill he did not want it was not in his nature to act with certainty when the balance of judgement was so unclear and the stakes were the lives of other men we look to you pitt croxdale said again dont fail your country man no sir pitt said unhappily i will do everything i can sir good croxdale smiled i knew you would that is one thing narraway was right about i will inform the necessary people including the prime minister of course thank you pitt we are grateful to you pitt accepted he had little choice croxdale began to outline to him exactly what his task would be his powers and the rewards it was midnight when pitt walked outside into the lamplit night and found croxdales own carriage waiting to take him home chapter nine charlotte walked away from cormac oneils home with as much composure as she could muster but she had the sinking fear inside her that she looked as afraid and bewildered as she felt and as helplessly angry whatever else narraway might have been guilty of and it could have been a great deal she was certain that he had not killed cormac oneil she had arrived at the house almost on his heels she had heard the dog begin to bark as narraway went into the house and continue more and more hysterically knowing there was an intruder and perhaps already aware of oneils death had cormac cried out had he even seen his killer or had he been shot in the back she had not heard a gun fire that was it of course she had heard the dog bark but no gunshot the dog had barked at narraway but not at whoever had fired the shot she stopped in the street standing rooted to the spot as the realisation shook her with its meaning narraway could not possibly have shot cormac her certainty was not built on her belief in him but on evidence facts that were not capable of any other reasonable interpretation she turned on her heel and stepped out urgently striding across the street back towards oneils house then stopped again just as suddenly why should they believe her she knew that what she said was true but would anyone else substantiate it of course not talulla would contradict it because she hated narraway with hindsight that had been perfectly clear and predictable she would be only too delighted if he were hanged for cormacs murder to her it would be justice the sweeter now after the long delay she must know he was not guilty because she had been close enough to have heard the dog start to bark herself but she would be the last person to say so narraway would know that she remembered his face as he allowed the police to handcuff him he had looked at charlotte only once concentrating everything he had to say in that one glance he needed her to understand he also needed her to keep a very calm mind and to think to work it out detail by detail and not act before she was certain not only of the truth but that she could prove it so it could not be ignored it is very difficult indeed to make people believe what is against all their emotions the conviction of friend and enemy years deep paid for in blood and loss she was still standing on the pavement just over a hundred yards away a small crowd had gathered because of the violence and the presence of the police they were staring wondering what was the matter with her she swallowed straightened her skirt then turned yet again and walked back towards where she judged to be the best place to find a carriage to take her to molesworth street there were many practical considerations to weigh very carefully she was completely alone now there was no one at all she could trust she must consider whether to remain at mrs hogans or if it would be safer to move to somewhere else where she would be less exposed everyone knew her as narraways halfsister but where else could she go how long would it take anyone to find her again in a town the size of dublin she was a stranger an englishwoman on her own she knew no one except those narraway had introduced her to a couple of hours enquiring would find her again and she would merely look ridiculous and evasive as if she had something of which to be ashamed she was walking briskly along the pavement trying to appear to know precisely where she was going and to what purpose although only the former was true there was a carriage ahead of her setting down a fare and she could hire him if she were quick enough she reached him just as he moved his horse forward and began to turn sir she called out will you be good enough to take me back to molesworth street sure an ill be happy to he responded completing his turn and pulling the horse up she thanked him and climbed up into the carriage sitting down with considerable relief and feeling intensely grateful as the wheels rumbled over the cobbles and they picked up speed she did not turn to look behind her she could picture the scene just as clearly as if she could see it narraway should still be in the house manacled like some dangerous criminal he must feel desperately alone was he frightened certainly he would never show it charlotte told herself abruptly to stop being so useless and selfindulgent pitt was somewhere in france with nobody else to rely on believing narraway was still at lisson grove not ever in his nightmares would he suppose narraway could be in ireland under arrest for murder and lisson grove or at least part of it in the hands of traitors whatever she felt was irrelevant the only task ahead of her was to rescue narraway and to do that she must find the truth and prove it talulla lawless knew who had killed cormac because it had to be someone the dog would not bark at therefore someone who had a right to be in cormacs home the clearest answer was talulla herself cormac lived alone he had said so the previous evening when charlotte had asked him no doubt a local woman would come in every so often and clean for him and do the laundry even assuming she had been here today however why on earth would she kill him where would she even get a gun why would talulla kill him he was her uncle but then how often was murder a family matter she knew from pitts cases in the past very much too often the next most likely answer would be a robbery but any thief breaking in would have set the dog into a frenzy but then why would talulla kill cormac and why now not purely to blame narraway surely how could she even know that he would be there to be blamed the answer to that was obvious it must have been she who had sent the letter luring narraway to cormacs house she of all people would be able to imitate his hand narraway might recall it from twenty years ago but not in such tiny detail that he would recognise a good forgery but that still left the question as to why she had chosen to do it now cormac was her uncle they were the only two still alive from the tragedy of twenty years ago cormac had no children and her parents were dead surely both of them believed narraway responsible for that why would she kill cormac was narraway on the brink of finding out something that she could not afford him to know that made incomplete sense if it were true then surely the obvious thing would be to have killed narraway she recalled the look on talullas face as she had seen narraway standing near cormacs body she had been almost hysterical she might have a great ability to act but surely not great enough to effect the sweat on her lip and brow the wildness in her eyes the catch in her voice as it soared out of control and yet never once had she looked at cormacs body as if she could not bear to or she already knew exactly what she would see she had not gone to him even to assure herself that he was beyond help that must be because she already knew it there had been nothing in her face but hate no grief no denial charlotte was riding through the handsome streets of dublin as if it could have been any city on earth she was oblivious of the sights and sounds except for a moment of sudden surprise as cold rain spattered through the open window wetting her face and shoulder how much of this whole thing was talulla responsible for what about the issue of mulhare and the embezzled money she could not possibly have arranged that or was someone in lisson grove using irish passion and loyalties old wounds opened up again to further their own need to remove narraway if that were possible not just a part of her fevered imagination then who else was involved who could she ask were there any of narraways supposed friends actually willing to help him or had he wounded or betrayed them all at one time or another so that when it came to it they would take their revenge he was totally vulnerable now could it be that at last they had stopped quarrelling with each other long enough to conspire to ruin him did they hate him more than they loved any kind of honesty people justified hate in all sorts of ways it could suspend normal morality she knew that perhaps that was a superficial judgement and one she had no right to make what would she have felt or done were it all the other way around if ireland were the foreigner the occupier in england if someone had used and betrayed her family would she be so loyal to her beliefs in honesty or impartial justice perhaps but perhaps not it was a question she could not answer except with hope that was meaningless without reality but narraway was still innocent of killing cormac and charlotte realised as she said that to herself she thought he was no more than partially guilty of the downfall of kate oneil the oneils had tried to use him turn him to betray his country they might well be furious that they had failed but had they the right to exact vengeance for losing she needed to ask help from someone because alone she might as well simply give up and go back to london leaving narraway to his fate and eventually pitt to his before she reached molesworth street and even attempted to explain the situation to mrs hogan which she must do she had decided to ask fiachra mcdaid for help what mcdaid said incredulously when charlotte found him at his home and told him what had happened im sorry she gulped and tried to regain her composure she had thought herself in perfect control and realised she was much further from it than she imagined we went to see cormac oneil at least victor said he was going alone but i followed him just behind you mean you found a carriage able to keep up with him in dublin traffic mcdaid frowned no no i knew where he was going i had been there the evening before myself to see oneil he looked incredulous yes please listen her voice was rising again and she made an effort to calm it i arrived moments after he did i heard the dog begin to bark as he went in but no shot it would bark the frown deepened on his brow it barks for anyone except cormac or perhaps talulla she lives close by and looks after it if cormac is away which he is from time to time not the cleaning woman she said quickly no shes afraid of it he looked at her more closely his face earnest why what does it matter she hesitated still uncertain how far to trust him it was the only evidence she had that protected narraway perhaps she should keep it to herself i suppose it doesnt she said deliberately looking confused then as coherently as she could but missing out any further reference to the dog she told him what had happened as she did she watched his face trying to read the emotions in it the belief or disbelief the confusion or understanding the loss or the triumph he listened without interrupting her they think narraway shot cormac why for gods sake in revenge for cormac having ruined him in london she answered thats what talulla said it makes a kind of sense do you think thats what happened he asked she nearly said that she knew it was not then realised her mistake just in time no she spoke guardedly now i was just behind him and i didnt hear a shot but i dont think he would do that anyway it doesnt make sense he shook his head yes it does victor loved that job of his in a way it was all he had he looked in conflict emotions twisting his features im sorry i dont mean to imply that you are not important to him but i think from what he said that you do not see each other so often now she was angry she felt the anger well up inside her knotting her stomach making her hands shake her voice thick as if she were a little drunk no we dont but youve known victor for years was he ever a fool no never many things good and bad but never a fool he admitted did he ever act against his own interest hotheadedly all feelings and no thought she could not imagine it not the man she knew had he once had that kind of runaway passion was this supreme control a mask she found the thought oddly alien destroying some part of him she would not have wished different mcdaid laughed abruptly without joy no he never forgot his cause hell or heaven could dance naked past him and he would not be diverted why because if he really thought cormac oneil was responsible for ruining him in london for setting up what looked like embezzlement and seeing that he was blamed the last thing he would want was cormac dead she answered then he couldnt tell who helped him how it was done or where to find the proof of it it would be i see he interrupted i seeyoure right victor would never put revenge ahead of getting his job back vindicating himself would be the best revenge anyway so someone else killed cormac and made it look like victor charlotte concluded that would be their revenge wouldnt it it was a statement not a question yes he agreed his eyes bright his hands loosely beside him will you help me find out who she asked he gestured to one of the big leather chairs in his gracious but very masculine sitting room she imagined wealthy gentlemens clubs must be like this inside worn and comfortable upholstery lots of wood panelling brass ornaments except these were silver and uniquely celtic she sat down obediently he sat opposite her leaning forward a little have you any idea who already her mind raced how should she answer how much of the truth reveal could he help at all if she lied to him i have lots of ideas but they dont make any sense she replied prevaricating i know who hated victor but i dont know who hated cormac a moment of humour touched his face and then vanished it looked like selfmockery i dont expect you to know she said quietly or you would have warned him but perhaps with hindsight you might understand something now talulla is sean and kates daughter brought up away from dublin after her parents deaths she saw instantly in his eyes that he had known that she is poor child he agreed you didnt tell victor that did you it sounded more like an accusation than she had intended it to he looked down for a moment then back up at her no i thought she had suffered enough over that another one of your innocent casualties she observed remembering what he had said during their carriage ride in the dark something in that had disturbed her a resignation she could not share all casualties still upset her but then her country was not at war not occupied by another people half friend half enemy i dont make judgements as to who is innocent and who guilty mrs pitt just what is necessary and only that when i have no choice talulla was a child children grow up did he know or guess whether talulla had killed cormac she looked at him steadily and found herself a little afraid the intelligence in him was overwhelming rich with understanding of terrible irony and it was not himself he was mocking it was her and her naivety she was quite certain of that now he was a thought a word ahead of her all the time she had already said too much and he knew perfectly well that she was sure talulla had shot cormac into what she said aloud into a woman who would shoot her uncles head to pieces in order to be revenged on the man she thinks betrayed her mother that surprised him just for an instantthen he covered it of course she thinks that he replied she can hardly face thinking that kate went with him willingly in fact if hed asked her maybe she would have gone to england with him who knows do you charlotte said immediately i his eyebrows rose i have no idea is that why sean killed her really again i have no idea she did not know whether to believe him or not he had been charming to her generous with his time and excellent company but behind the smiling facade he was a complete stranger she had no idea what was going on in his thoughts no certainty at all that it was not something alien and unbearable more incidental damage she said aloud kate sean talulla now cormac incidental to what mr mcdaid irelands freedom could we have a better cause mrs pitt he said gently surely talulla can be understood for wanting that hasnt she paid enough but it didnt make sense not completely who had moved the money meant for mulhare back into narraways account was that done simply in order to lure him to ireland for this revenge why so elaborate wouldnt the kind of rage talulla had be satisfied by killing narraway herself why on earth make poor cormac the sacrifice wasnt that complicated and in the end pretty pointless if she wanted narraway to suffer she could have shot him so he would be disabled mutilated die slowly there were plenty of possibilities this might well be part of the picture but it certainly was not all of it and why now there had to be a reason mcdaid was still watching her waiting yes i imagine she has paid enough charlotte answered his question and cormac hasnt he too ah yes poor cormac mcdaid said softly he loved kate you know thats why he could never forgive narraway she cared for cormac but she would never have loved him mostly i suppose because he was seans brother cormac was the better man i think maybe in the end kate thought so too that doesnt answer why talulla shot him charlotte pointed out oh youre right of course it doesnt another casualty of war she said with a touch of bitterness whose freedom do you fight for at such a cost is that not a weight of grief to carry for ever his eyes flashed for a moment then the anger was gone again but it had been real cormac was guilty too he said grimly of what surviving she asked yes but more than that he didnt do much to save sean he barely tried if hed told the truth sean might have been a hero not a man who murdered his wife in a jealous rage perhaps to cormac he was a man who murdered his wife in a jealous rage charlotte pointed out people react slowly sometimes when they are shattered with grief it takes time for the numbness to wear off cormac might have been too shocked to do anything useful what could it have been anyway didnt sean himself tell the truth as to why he killed kate he barely said anything mcdaid admitted this time looking down at the floor not at her stunned too she said but someone told talulla that cormac should have saved her father and she believed them easier to think of your father as a hero betrayed rather than a jealous man who killed his wife in a rage because she cuckolded him with his enemy and an englishman at that mcdaid looked at her with a momentary flare of anger then he masked it so completely she might almost have thought it was her imagination it would seem so he agreed but how do we prove any of that she felt the coldness sweep over her i dont know im trying to think be careful mrs pitt he said gently i would not like you to be a casualty of war as well she managed to smile just as if she did not even imagine that his words could be as much a threat as a warning she felt as if it were a mask on his face transparent ghostly thank you i shall be careful i promise but it is kind of you to care she rose to her feet very careful not to sway now i think i had better go back to my lodgings it has been a a terrible day when she reached molesworth street again mrs hogan came out to see her immediately she looked awkward her hands winding around each other twisting her apron charlotte addressed the subject before mrs hogan could search for the words you have heard about mr oneil she said gravely a very terrible thing to have happened i hope mr narraway will be able to help them he has some experience in such tragedies but i quite understand if you would prefer that i move out of your house in the meantime i will have to find something of course until i get my passage back home i dare say it will take me a day or two in the meantime i will pack my brothers belongings and put them in my own room so you may let his rooms to whomsoever you wish i believe we are paid for another couple of nights at least please heaven within a couple of days she would be a great deal further on in her decisions and at least one other person in dublin would know for certain that narraway was innocent mrs hogan was embarrassed the issue had been taken out of her hands and she did not know how to rescue it as charlotte had hoped she settled for the compromise thank you that would be most considerate maam if you will be kind enough to lend me the keys ill do it straight away charlotte held out her hand reluctantly mrs hogan passed them over charlotte unlocked the door and went inside closing it behind her instantly she felt intrusive she would pack his clothes of course and have someone take the case to her room unless she could drag it there herself but far more important than shirts socks personal linen were whatever papers he might have she wondered if he had committed anything to writing and whether it would even be in a form she could understand if only she could at least ask pitt she had never missed him more but then of course if he were here she would be at home in london not trying desperately to carry out a task for which she was so illfitted this was not some domestic crime that could be pieced together at leisure she was in a foreign country where she did not really know anyone and the dreams and beliefs were alien above all she was the enemy and justly so the weight of centuries of history was against her she opened the case then went to the wardrobe and took out narraways suits and shirts folded them neatly and packed them then feeling as if she were prying she opened the drawers in the chest she took out his underwear and packed it also making sure she had his pyjamas from under the pillow in the bed she included his extra pair of shoes wrapped in a cloth to keep them from marking anything and put them in as well she collected the toiletries picking some long black and grey hairs from his hairbrush what a personal thing a hairbrush was and a toothbrush razor and small clothes brush he was an immaculate man how he would hate being locked up in a cell with no privacy and probably little means to wash what few papers there were were in the top drawer of the dresser thank heaven they were not locked in a briefcase but that probably indicated that they would mean nothing to anyone else back in her own room with narraways case propped in the corner charlotte looked at few notes he had made they were a curious reflection on his character a side of him she had not even guessed at before they were mostly little drawings very small indeed but very clever they were little stick men but with such movement in them and with perhaps only one characteristic that told her who they were there was one little man with striped trousers and a banknote in his hat and beside him a woman with chaotic hair behind him was another woman even thinner her limbs poking jaggedly even with arms and legs merely suggested charlotte knew they were john and bridget tyrone and that tyrone being a banker was important the other woman had such a savagery about her it immediately suggested talulla beside her was a question mark there was no more than that except a man of whom she could see only the top half as if he were up to his arms in something she stared at it until it came to her with a shiver of revulsion it was mulhare drowning because the money had not been paid the little drawing suggested a connection between john tyrone and talulla he was a banker charlotte knew that already but this indicated that that was what mattered about him was he the connection to london had he the power through his profession to move money around from dublin to london and with the help of someone in lisson grove to place it back in narraways account then who in lisson grove and why no one could tell her that but tyrone himself was it dangerous absurd to go to him she had no one else she could turn to because she did not know who else was involved certainly she could not go back to mcdaid she was growing more and more certain within herself that his remarks about innocent casualties of war were statements of his philosophy and also a warning to her he had a purpose like a juggernaut which would crush those who got in its way was talulla the prime mover in cormacs death or only the instrument used by someone else someone like john tyrone so harmlessseeming but with power in dublin and in london power to serve or even to create a traitor in lisson grove there seemed to be two choices open to her go to tyrone himself or give up and go home leaving narraway here to answer whatever charge they brought against him presuming he lived long enough to face a trial would it be a fair trial even possibly not the old wounds were raw and special branch would not be on his side so she really had no choice at all the maid who answered the door let her in somewhat reluctantly i need to speak with mr tyrone charlotte said as soon as she was let into the large highceilinged hall it is to do with the murder of mr mulhare and now poor mr oneil it is most urgent ill ask him maam the maid replied who shall i say is calling charlotte pitt she hesitated only an instant victor narraways sister yes maam she went across the hall and knocked on a door at the far side it opened and she spoke for a moment then returned to charlotte if youll come with me maam charlotte followed her and the maid knocked on the same door again come in tyrones voice was abrupt the maid opened it for charlotte to go past hertyrone had obviously been working there were papers spread across the surface of the large desk he stood impatiently making no attempt to hide the fact that she had interrupted him im sorry she apologised i know it is late and i have come without invitation but the matter is urgent tomorrow may be impossible for me to rescue what is left of the situation he moved his weight from one foot to the other i am very sorry for you mrs pitt but i have no idea how i can help perhaps i should send the maid to see where my wife is it was offered more as an excuse than a suggestion she is calling on a neighbour she cannot be far it is you i need to see she told him and it might be more suitable for your reputation if the maid were to remain although my enquiries are confidential then you should call at my place of business within the usual hours he pointed out she gave him a brief formal smile confidential to you mr tyrone that is why i came here i dont know what you are talking about it was still only a deduction from narraways drawings but it was all she had left she plunged in the money for mulhare that you transferred back into my brothers account in london which was responsible for mulhares death and my brothers professional ruin mr tyrone he might have intended to deny it but his face gave him away the shock drained the blood from his skin leaving him almost grey he drew in his breath sharply then changed his mind and said nothing his eyes flickered and for an instant charlotte wondered if he were going to call for some kind of assistance and have her thrown out probably no servant would attack her but if any other of the people involved in the plan were here it would only increase her danger mcdaid had warned her or did tyrone even imagine she had had some hand in murdering cormac oneil now her own voice was shaking mr tyrone too many people have been hurt already and im sure you know poor cormac was killed this morning it is time for this to end i would find it easy to believe that you had no idea what tragedies would follow the transfer of that money nor do i find it hard to sympathise with your hatred of those who occupy a country that is rightfully yours but by using personal murder and betrayal you win nothing you only bring more tragedy on those you involve if you doubt me look at the evidence all the oneils are dead now even the loyalty that used to bind them is destroyed kate and cormac have both been murdered and by the very ones they loved your brother killed cormac he spoke at last no he didnt cormac was already dead by the time we got there he was startled we you went with him just after him but only moments after then he could have killed him before you got there no i was on his heels i would have heard the shot i heard the dog begin to bark as victor entered he let out a long slow sigh as if at last the pieces had settled into a dark picture that for all its ugliness still made sense to him his face looked bruised as if some familiar pain had returned inside him you had better come into the study he said wearily i dont know what you can do about any of it now the police believe narraway shot oneil because they want to believe it hes earned a long deep hatred here they caught him all but in the act they wont look any further you would be wise to go back to london while you can he led the way across the floor into the study and closed the door he offered her one of the leatherseated chairs and took the other himself i dont know what you think i can do to change anything there was no lift in his voice no hope tell me about transferring the money she answered and how will that help special branch in london will know that victor did not steal it she must remember always to refer to him by his given name one slip calling him mr narraway and she would betray both of them he gave a sharp bark of laughter and when hes hanged in dublin for murdering oneil what will that matter to them theres a poetic justice to it but if its logic youre after the fact that he didnt steal the money wont help oneil had nothing to do with it but narraway didnt know that of course he did charlotte retorted instantly how do you think i know that caught him off guard she saw it instantly in his eyes then what is it you want me to tell you he asked who helped you someone in lisson grove gave you the account information so you could have it done and it was nothing to do with helping you it was to get victor out of special branch you just served their purpose she had not thought what she was going to say until the words were on her lips did she really mean that it was charles austwick it didnt have to be there were a dozen others who could have done it for a dozen other reasons even one as simple as being paid to but again that came back to ireland and who would pay and for what reason just revenge or an enemy who wanted their own man in narraways place or was it simply an ambitious man or one narraway suspected of treason or theft and they struck before he could expose them she watched tyrone waiting for him to respond he was trying to judge how much she knew but there was also something else in his eyes a hurt that so far made no sense as part of this old vengeance austwick she guessed before the silence allowed the moment to slip yes he said quietly did he pay you she could not keep the contempt from her voice his head came up sharply no he did not i did it because i hate narraway and mulhare and all other traitors to ireland victor is not a traitor to ireland she pointed out hes as english as i am youre lying she picked a weapon out of her imagination did he have an affair with your wife as well as with kate oneil tyrones face flamed and he half rose from his chair if you dont want me to throw you out of my house woman youll apologise for that slur on my wife your minds in the gutter but then i dare say you know your brother a great deal better than i do if he is your brother that is now charlotte felt her own face burn i think perhaps it is your mind that is in the gutter mr tyrone she said with a tremor in her voice and perhaps guilt because she knew what narraway felt for her she could think of no defence so she attacked why do you do this for charles austwick what is he to you an englishman who wants to gain power and office and in the very secret service that was formed to defeat irish hopes of home rule that was an exaggeration she knew it was formed to combat the bombings and murders intended to terrorise britain into granting home rule to ireland but the difference seemed pedantic and hardly mattered now tyrones voice was low and bitterly angry i dont give a tinkers curse who runs your wretched services secret or open it was my chance to get rid of narraway whatever else austwick is hes a fool by comparison you know him she seized the only part of what he was saying that seemed vulnerable even momentarily there was a tiny sound behind her just the brushing of a silk skirt against the doorjamb she turned round and saw bridget tyrone standing a yard from her suddenly charlotte was horribly physically afraid she could scream her lungs out here and no one would hear her no one would know or care it took all the strength she had to stand still and command her voice to be level or at least something like it it would be absurd to pretend bridget had not overheard the conversation charlotte was trapped and she knew it the fury in bridgets face was unmistakable just as bridget moved forward charlotte did also she had never before struck another woman however when she turned as if to say something to tyrone and saw him also moving towards her she swung back her arm wide she put all her weight behind it catching bridget on the side of the head just as she lunged forward bridget toppled sideways catching at the small table with books on it and sending it crashing herself on top of it she screamed as much in rage as pain tyrone was distracted diving to help her charlotte ran past out of the door and across the hall she flung the front door open hurtling out into the street without once looking behind her she kept on running both hands holding her skirts up so she did not trip she reached the main crossroads before she was so out of breath she could go no further she dropped her skirts out of shaking hands and started to walk along the dimly lit street with as much dignity as she could muster keeping an eye to the roadway for cab lights in the hope of getting one to take her home as soon as she could she would prefer to be right away from the area when she saw an unoccupied cab she gave the driver the molesworth street address before climbing in and settling back to try to arrange her thoughts the story was still incomplete bits and pieces that only partially fitted together talulla was sean and kates daughter when had she known the truth of what had happened or at least something like it perhaps more importantly who had told her had it been with the intention that she should react violently did whoever it was know her well enough and deliberately work on her loneliness her sense of injustice and displacement so that she could be provoked into murdering cormac and blaming narraway to her it could be made to seem a just revenge for the destruction of her family sometimes rage is the easiest answer to unbearable pain charlotte had seen that too many times before had even been brushed by it herself long ago at the time of sarahs death it is instinctive to feel there must be someone to blame for random injustice and that someone must be made to pay who could have used talulla that way and why was cormac the intended victim or was he a victim of incidental damage as fiachra mcdaid had said one of the casualties in a war for a greater purpose and narraway was the real victim it would be poetic justice if he were hanged for a murder he did not commit since talulla believed sean innocent of killing kate and narraway guilty for her that would be elegant perfect but who prompted her to it gave her the information and stoked her passions all but guided her hand and why obviously not cormac not john tyrone because he seemed to know nothing about it and charlotte believed that bridget perhaps certainly she was involved her reaction to charlotte that evening had been too immediate and too violent to spring from ignorance in fact looking back at it now perhaps she had known more than tyrone himself perhaps tyrone himself was at least in part another victim of incidental damage someone to use because he was vulnerable more in love with his wife than she was with him and because he was a banker and had the means charlotte could no longer evade the answer fiachra mcdaid perhaps he had not anything to do with the past at all or any of the old tragedy except to use it and for him winning was all the means and the casualties nothing but how did getting narraway out of special branch help the cause of ireland he would only be replaced but perhaps that was it replaced with a traitor bought and paid for charlotte was still working on this train of thought when she arrived at mrs hogans door she had promised mrs hogan she would be gone in a day or two it would be very difficult to manage her own luggage and narraways as well and there were other practical considerations to be taken in mind such as the shortage of money to remain much longer away from home she had still her tickets to purchase for the boat and for the train when everything was weighed she had little choice but to go to the police station in the morning and tell them carefully all that she believed however there was no proof she could show them the one thing she could possibly verify was that she had arrived at cormacs house just after narraway and she had heard the dog begin to bark but no gunshot they would ask her why she had not said so at the time should she admit that she did not think they would believe her is that what an innocent person would do she went to sleep uneasily waking often with the problem still unsolved narraway sat in his cell in the police station less than a mile from where cormac oneil had been murdered he maintained a motionless pose but his mind was racing he must think plan once they moved him to the main prison he would have no chance he might be lucky to survive long enough to come to trial and by that time memories would be clouded people persuaded to forget or to see things differently but far worse even than that whatever was being planned and for which he had been lured to ireland and pitt to france would have happened and be irrevocable he sat there and remained unmoving for over two hours no one came to speak to him or give him food or drink slowly a desperate plan took shape in his mind he would like to wait for nightfall but he could not take the risk that they would take him into the main prison before that daylight would be much more dangerous but perhaps that too was necessary he might have only one chance he listened intently for the slightest sound beyond the cell door any movement at all he had decided exactly what to do when at last it came it would have to eventually when they put the heavy key in the lock and swung the door open narraway was lying on the floor sprawled in a position that looked as if he had broken his neck his beautiful white shirt was torn and hanging from the bars on the window above him hey flaherty the guard called come quick the stupid bastards hanged himself he came over to narraway and bent to check his pulse sweet mother of god i think hes dead he breathed flaherty where the devil are you before flaherty could come and there would be two of them to fight narraway snapped his body up and caught the guard under the chin so hard his head shot back narraway hit him again sideways so as to knock him unconscious but very definitely not kill him in fact he intended him to be senseless for no more than fifteen or twenty minutes he needed him alive and able to walk he moved the inert body to the exact spot where he himself had been lying all but tore the mans jacket off him and left him in his shirt he took his keys and barely managed to get behind the door when flaherty arrived narraway held his breath in case flaherty had the presence of mind to come in and lock the door or even worse stay out and lock it but he was too horrified by the sight of the other guard on the floor to think so rationally he covered the few paces to the fallen man calling his name and narraway took his one chance he slipped around the door slammed it shut and locked it he heard flaherty yelling almost immediately good someone would let him out within minutes he needed them in hot pursuit he was very careful indeed going out of the police station twice standing motionless on corners while people moved past him following the shouting and the hurried footsteps outside in the street quite deliberately he ran he wanted to be remembered someone had to tell them which way he had gone if they didnt work it out for themselves and they could only do that if they knew enough of the facts on the chance that they did know he could afford no delay no hesitation it was wet the rain came down in a steady drizzle the gutters were awash and very quickly he was soaked his hair sticking to his brow his bare neck cold without his shirt people looked at him but no one stood in his way perhaps they thought he was drunk he had to go around cormacs house in case there were still police there he could not be stopped now he slowed to a walk and crossed the road away from it then back again without seeing anyone and in at the gate of talullas house and up to the front door if she did not answer he would have to break a window and force his way in his whole plan rested on confronting her when the police caught up with him he knocked loudly there was no answer what if she were not here but with friends could she be so soon after killing cormac surely she would need to be alone and she had to take care of the dog wouldnt she be waiting until the police left so she could take whatever she wanted or needed to protect of the records of her parents that he had kept he banged again again silence was she there already he had seen no police outside she might be upstairs here in her own house lying down emotionally exhausted from murder and the ultimate revenge he took off his jacket and standing in the rain barechested he wrapped the jacket around his fist and with as little noise as possible he broke a side window and unlocked it and climbed inside he put his jacket on again and walked softly across the floor to look for her he searched from top to bottom there was no one here he had not expected a maid talulla would have given her the day off so she could not witness anything to do with cormacs murder not hear any shots any barking dog he let himself out of the back door and ran swiftly to cormacs house time was getting short the police could not be far behind him hurry hurry he wasted no time knocking on the door she would almost certainly not answer and he had no time to wait he took off his jacket again shivering with cold now and perhaps also with fear he smashed another window and within seconds was inside at once the dog started barking furiously he looked around him he was in some kind of pantry he must get as far as the kitchen before she found him if she let the dog attack him he had to be ready and why would she not he had broken into the house he was already accused of cormacs murder she would have every possible justification he opened the door quickly and found himself in the scullery the kitchen beyond he darted forward and grabbed at a small hardbacked wooden chair just as talulla opened the door from the further side and the dog leaped forward still barking hysterically she stopped stunned to see him he lifted the chair its thin sharp legs pointed towards the dog i dont want to hurt the animal he said having to raise his voice to be heard above it call her off so you can kill me too she shouted back at him dont be so damn stupid he heard the rage trembling in his own voice abrasive almost out of control you killed him yourself to get your revenge at last she smiled a hard glittering expression vibrant with hate well i have done havent i theyll hang you victor narraway and the ghost of my father will laugh ill be there to watch you that i swear she turned to the dog quiet girl she ordered dont attack him i want him alive to suffer trial and disgrace ripping his throat out would be too quick too easy she looked back at narraway but the dog was distracted by something else now it swung its head round and stared towards the front door hackles raised a low growl in its throat too easy narraway heard his voice rising the desperation in it palpable she must hear it too she did and her smile widened i want to see you hang see your terror when they put the noose around your neck see you struggle for breath gasping your tongue purple filling your mouth and poking out you wont charm the women then will you do you soil yourself when you hang do you lose all control all dignity she was screeching now her face twisted with the pain of her own imagination actually the function of the noose and the drop of the trapdoor is to break your neck he replied you are supposed to die instantly does that take the pleasure away for you she stared at him breathing heavily the dog now was fully concentrated on the front door the growl low in its throat lips curled back off the teeth if she realised there was someone at the front please god in heaven the police then she would stop perhaps even claim he had attacked her but this was the moment of her private triumph when she could tell him exactly how she had brought about his ruin he made a sudden movement towards her the dog swung round barking again narraway raised the chair legs towards it just in case it leaped frightened victor she said with relish why now he asked trying to keep his voice level he nearly succeeded but she must have seen the sheen of sweat on his face it was mcdaid wasnt it he told you something what why does he want all this he used to be my friend youre pathetic she said all but choking over her words he hates you as much as we all do what did he tell you he persisted how you seduced my whore of a mother and then betrayed her you killed her and let my father hang for it she was sobbing now then why kill poor cormac he asked was he expendable simply to create a murder for which you could blame me it had to be you who killed him youre the only one the dog wouldnt bark at because you feed her when cormacs away shes used to you in the house shed have raised the roof if it had been me very clever she agreed but by the time you come to trial no one else will know that and no one will believe your sister if thats who she is because theyll all know she would speak for you did you kill cormac just to get me he asked again no i killed him because he didnt raise a hand to try to save my father he did nothing absolutely nothing you were only five or six years old he pointed out mcdaid told me she sobbed ah yes mcdaid the irish hero who wants to turn all europe upside down in a revolution to change the social order sweep away the old and bring in the new and do you imagine that will bring ireland freedom to him you are expendable talulla just as i am or your parents or anyone else it was at that point that she let go of the dogs collar and shrieked at it to attack just as the police threw open the door to the hall and narraway raised the chair as the dog leaped and sent him flying to land hard on his back all but winding him one of the policemen grabbed the animal by its collar half choking it the other seized hold of talulla narraway climbed to his feet coughing and gasping to get his breath thank you he said hoarsely i hope you have been there rather longer than it would appear long enough the elder of the two responded but therell still be one or two charges for you to answer like assaulting a policeman while in custody and escaping custody if i were you id run like hell and never come back to ireland mr narraway very good advice narraway stood to attention gave the man a smart salute then turned and ran exactly as he had been told in the morning there was no alternative for charlotte but to have a hasty breakfast then with mrs hogans assistance send for a carriage to take herself and all the baggage as far as the police station where narraway was held it was a miserable ride she had come up with no better solution than simply to tell the police that she had further information on the death of cormac oneil and hope that she could persuade someone with judgement and influence to listen to her as she drew closer and closer the idea seemed to grow even more hopeless the carriage was about a hundred yards away from the police station she was dreading being put out on the footpath with more luggage than she could possibly carry and a story she was already convinced no one would believe then abruptly the carriage pulled up short and the driver leaned down to speak to someone charlotte could only partially see we are not there yet she said desperately please go further i cannot possibly carry these cases so far in fact i cant carry them at all sorry miss the driver said sadly as if he felt a real pity for her that was the police seems theres been an escape of a very dangerous prisoner in the night they just discovered it an the whole streets blocked off a prisoner yes miss a terrible dangerous man they say murdered a man yesterday near shot his head off an now hes gone like magic just disappeared went to see him this morning and his cell is empty theyre not allowing any carriages through charlotte stared at him as if she could barely understand his words but her mind was racing escape murdered a man yesterday it had to be narraway didnt it he must have known even more certainly than she did just how much people hated him how easy it would be for them to see all the evidence the way they wished to who would believe him an englishman with his past rather than talulla lawless who was sean oneils daughter perhaps even more importantly kates daughter who would want to believe she had shot cormac the driver was still staring at charlotte waiting for her decision thank you she fumbled for words she did not want to leave narraway alone and hunted in ireland but there was no way in which she could help him she had no idea in which direction he would go north or south inland or even across the country to the west she did not know if he had friends old allies anyone to turn to then another thought came to her with a new coldness when they arrested him they would have taken his belongings his money he would be penniless how would he survive let alone travel she must help him except that she had very little money herself please heaven he did not trust any of the people he knew in dublin every one of them would betray him they couldnt afford not to they were tied to each other by blood and memory old grief too deep to forget miss the driver interrupted her thoughts charlotte was marked as narraways sister she would be a liability to him there was nothing she could do to help here her only hope was to go back to london and somehow find pitt or at the very least ask for aunt vespasias help please take me to the dock she said as steadily as she could i think it would be better if i were to catch the next steamer back to england whatever dock that is if you please yes missthe driver climbed back onto the box again and urged his horse forwards and round they made a wide turn in the street and headed away from the police station the journey was not very long but to charlotte it seemed to take ages they passed down the wide handsome streets some of the roads would have taken seven or eight carriages abreast but they seemed half deserted compared with the noisy crushing jams of traffic in london she was desperate to leave and yet also torn with regrets one day she wanted to come back anonymous and free of burdens simply to enjoy it now she could only lean forward peering out and counting the minutes until she reached the dock the whole business of alighting with the luggage and the crowds waiting to board the steamer was awkward and very close to desperate she tried to move the cases without leaving anything where it could be taken and at the same time keep hold of her reticule and pay for a ticket in the jostling of people she was bumped and knocked twice she nearly lost her own case while trying to move narraways and find money ready to pay the fare can i help you a voice said close to her she was about to refuse when she felt his hand over hers and he took narraways case from her she was furious and ready to cry with frustration she lifted her foot with its nicely heeled boot and brought it down sharply on his instep he gasped with pain but he did not let go of narraways case she lifted her foot to do it again harder charlotte let the damn thing go narraway hissed between his teeth she let not only his case go but her own also she was so angry she could have struck him with an open hand and so relieved she felt the tears prickle in her eyes and slide down her cheeks i suppose youve no money she said tartly choking on the words not much he agreed i borrowed enough from an old aquaintance of mine ocasey to get as far as holyhead but since you have my luggage well manage the rest keep moving we need to buy tickets and i would very much like to catch this steamer i might not have the opportunity to wait for the next i imagine the police will think of this its the obvious way to go but i need to be back in london i have a fear that something very nasty indeed is going to happen several very nasty things already have she told him i know but we must prevent what we can i know what happened with mulhares money im pretty sure who was behind it all are you there was an eagerness in his voice that he could not hide even now in this pushing noisy crowd ill tell you when we are on board did you hear the dog what dog cormacs dog of course i did the poor beast hurled itself at the door almost as soon as i was in the house did you hear the shot no did you he was startled no she said with a smile ah he was level with her now and they were at the ticket counter i see he smiled also but at the salesman two for the holyhead boat please chapter ten pitt was overwhelmed with the size and scope of his new responsibilities there was so much more to consider than the relatively minor issues of whether the socialist plot in europe was something that could be serious or only another manifestation of the sporadic violence that had occurred in one place or another for the last several years even if some specific act were planned very possibly it did not concern england the alliance with france required that he pass on any important information to the french authorities but what did he know that was anything more than speculation west had been killed before he could tell him whatever it was he knew with hindsight now it had presumably been gower who was a traitor but had there been more to it than that had west also known who else in lisson grove was what a socialist conspirator to be bought for money or power or was it not what they wished to gain so much as what they were afraid to lose was it blackmail over some real or perceived offence was it someone who had been made to appear guilty as narraway had but this person had yielded to pressure in order to save himself had narraway been threatened and defied them or had they known better than to try and he had simply been professionally destroyed without warning pitt sat in narraways office which was now his own a cold and extraordinarily isolating thought would he be next it was hard to imagine that he posed the threat to them that narraway had whoever they were he looked around the room it was so familiar to him from the other side of the desk that even with his back to the wall he could see in his minds eye the pictures that narraway used to have there they were mostly pencil drawings of bare trees the branches delicate and complex the sky behind them only suggested there was one exception an old stone tower by the sea but again the foreground was in exquisite detail of light and shadow the sea only a feeling of distance without end he would ask austwick where they were and put them back where they belonged if narraway ever returned here then pitt would give them back to him they were his and he must care about them they were part of the furniture of his mind of his life they would give pitt a sense of his presence and it was both sad and comforting at the same time narraway would have known what to do about these varied and sometimes conflicting remnants of work that scattered the desk now some were reports from local police some from special branch men in various parts of the country many were from other towns and cities in europe pitt was familiar with some of them but he had only a vague knowledge of others they were cases narraway had dealt with himself austwick had left him notes but how could he trust anything austwick had said he would be a fool to without corroboration from someone else and that would take time he could not afford now and who could he trust there was nothing but to go on he would have to proceed with the most urgent cases first comparing one piece of information with another cancelling out the impossible and then weighing what was left as the morning wore on and assistants of one sort or another came with new papers more opinions he became painfully aware of how isolated narraway must have been some people he could rely on for honesty but perhaps not for judgement at least not in all things others he dared not even believe as to matters of fact none dare he confide in he was commander now they did not expect him to consult to defer to be vulnerable or confused in anything he looked in their faces and saw courtesy respect for his new position in a few he also saw envy once he recognised an anger that he such a relative newcomer should have been promoted before his time in none did he see the kind of respect he needed in order to command their personal loyalty beyond their commitment to the task that could only exist when it had been earned he would have given most of what he possessed to have narraway back right now he would even have given away his excellent expensive boots which afforded him comfortable feet no bodily discomfort could threaten as much as the anxiety that he would make a bad judgement fail to understand the importance of some piece of information or simply not have the courage the wisdom and the astuteness of intelligence to make all the right choices one big mistake could be sufficient to cost someone his life now narraway was somewhere in ireland why had charlotte gone with him to help fight against injustice out of loyalty to a friend in desperate need how like her but narraway was pitts friend not really hers and yet now remembering a dozen small things he knew that narraway was in love with her and had been for some time he knew exactly when he had first subconciously noticed it he had seen narraway turn to look at her they had been standing in the kitchen in the house in keppel street it had been during a bad case a difficult one narraway had come to see him late in the evening over something or other a new turn in events they had had tea charlotte had been standing waiting for the kettle to boil again she had been wearing an old dress not expecting anyone except pitt the lamplight had shone on her hair bringing up the warm deep colour of it and on the angle of her cheek he could see her in his minds eye picking up the mitt so as not to burn her hands on the kettle narraway had said something and she had looked at him and laughed in an instant his face had given him away did she know it had taken her what seemed like ages to realise that pitt was in love with her years ago in the beginning but since then they had all changed she had been awkward the middle sister of three the one her mother found so difficult to match with an acceptable husband but now she knew she was loved and it was impossible she could be unaware of how deeply pitt cared she would be furiously angry at the injustice against narraway and she would still feel a gratitude to narraway for having taken pitt into special branch when he so badly needed it life could have become very bleak indeed and if she knew that narraway loved her that could be an added sense of responsibility even of debt to think of it as a debt was ridiculous she had not asked for his regard but pitt knew the fierce protectiveness she felt towards the vulnerable it was instinct defensive like an animal with cubs she would act first and think afterwards he loved her for it he would lose something of infinite value if she were different more guarded more sensible but it was still a liability there were papers piled on the desk in front of him reports waiting to be made sense of but still his mind was on charlotte where was she how could he find out without placing her in further danger who was he absolutely certain he could trust a week ago he would have sent gower unwittingly he would have been giving them the perfect hostage should he contact the dublin police that would hardly be helpful if narraway were under suspicion of embezzlement perhaps anonymity was charlottes best defence but his own helplessness was almost like a physical pain he knew nothing he had all the forces of special branch at his fingertips and no idea whom he could trust there was a knock on his door the moment he answered it austwick came in looking grave and slightly smug he had more papers in his hand pitt was glad to be forced back into the present what have you he asked austwick sat down without being asked pitt knew he would not have done that with narraway more reports from manchester austwick replied it does begin to look as if latimer is right about this factory in hyde they are making guns in spite of their denials and then theres the messup in glasgow we need to pay more attention to that before it gets any bigger last report said it was just young people protesting pitt reminded him narraway had it marked as better left alone austwick pulled his face into a grimace of distaste well i think narraways mind was hardly on the countrys interests over the last while unfortunately we dont know how long his inattention had been going on read it yourself and see what you think ive been handling it since narraway went and i think he may have made a serious misjudgement and we cant afford to ignore scotland either pitt swallowed his response he did not trust austwick but he must not allow him see that all this felt like wasting time of which he had far too little what about the other reports from europe on the socialists he asked anything from germany and what about the russian emigres in paris nothing significant austwick replied and nothing at all from gower he looked at pitt steadily concern in his eyes pitt kept his expression perfectly composed he wont risk communication unless he has something of value to report it all has to go through the local post office austwick shook his head i think its of secondary importance honestly west may have been killed simply because they discovered he was an informant it would have been revenge rather than anything important he was going to tell you he shifted his position a little and looked straight at pitt there have been rumblings about great reform for years you know people strike postures and make speeches but nothing serious happens at least not here in britain i think our biggest danger was three or four years ago there was plenty of unrest in the east end of london which i know you are aware of though a lot of it was just before you joined the branch that was a reminder of how recent pitt was to this job he saw the flicker of resentment in austwicks eyes as he said it he wondered for a moment if the unease he was aware of was personal ambition thwarted rather than anything to do with political unrest then he remembered gower bending over wests body on the ground and the blood either austwick had nothing to do with it or he was better at masking his emotions than pitt had judged he must be careful perhaps well escape it he said aloud austwick shifted in his chair again as if finding it difficult to be comfortable these are the reports in from liverpool and youll see some of the references to ireland nothing dangerous as yet but we need to make note of some of these names and watch them he pushed across more papers and pitt bent to read them the afternoon followed the same pattern more reports both written and verbal a case of violence in a town in yorkshire looked as if it were political and turned out not to be a government minister had been robbed in piccadilly and investigating it took up the rest of the day the minister had been carrying sensitive papers fortunately it was not pitts decision as to how seriously he should be reprimanded for carelessness it was however up to him to decide with what crime the thief should be charged he weighed it with some consideration he questioned the man trying to judge whether he had known his victim was in the government and if so that his attache case might contain government papers he was uncertain even after several hours but narraway would not have asked advice if he could not deal with such an event without help then he was far from equal to the position pitt decided that the disadvantages of letting the public know how easy it was to rob an inattentive minister outweighed the possible error of letting a man be charged with a lesser crime than the one he had intended to commit he went home in the evening tired and with little sense of achievement it changed the moment he opened the front door and daniel came racing down the hall to greet him papa papa i made a boat come and look he grasped pitts hand and tugged at him pitt smiled and followed him willingly down to the kitchen where the rich smell of dinner cooking filled the air something was bubbling in a big pan on the stove and the table was littered with pieces of newspapers and a bowl of white paste minnie maude was standing with a pair of scissors in her hands as usual her hair was all over the place pinned up over and over again as she had lost patience with it in pride of place in the centre of the mess was a rather large papiermache boat with two sticks for masts and several different lengths of tapers for bowsprit yardarms and a boom minnie maude looked abashed to see him clearly earlier than she had expected see daniel said triumphantly pointing to the ship minnie maude showed me how to do it he gave a little shrug and jemima helped a bit well a lot pitt felt a sudden and overwhelming warmth rush up inside him he looked at daniels face shining with pride and then at the boat its magnificent he said emotion all but choking his voice ive never seen anything better he turned to minnie maude who was standing wideeyed she was clearly waiting to be criticised for playing when she should have been working towards having dinner on the table for him thank you he said to her sincerely please dont move it until it is safe to do so without risk of damage what what about dinner sir she asked beginning to breathe again well clear the newspapers and the paste and eat around it he answered wheres jemima shes reading daniel answered instantly she took my boys own why doesnt she read a girls book cos theyre boring jemima answered from the doorway she had slipped in without anyone hearing her come along the corridor she looked past pitt at the table and the ship at the centre youve got the masts on thats beautiful she gave pitt a radiant smile hello papa look what we made i see it he replied putting his arm around her shoulder its magnificent how is mama she asked an edge of worry in her voice well he answered lying smoothly and holding her a little closer shes helping a friend in bad trouble but shell be home soon now lets help clear the table and have dinner afterwards he sat alone in the parlour as the silence settled over the house daniel and jemima had gone up to bed minnie maude had finished in the kitchen and went up as well he heard every creak of her tread on the stairs far from being comforting the absence of all voices or movement made the heaviness swirl back in again like a fog the islands of light from the lamps on the wall created deeper shadows he knew every surface in the room he also knew they were all immaculately clean as if charlotte had been there to supervise this new girl whose only fault was that she was not gracie but she was good it was only the familiarity she lacked the papiermache ship made him smile it wasnt a trivial thing it was very important indeed minnie maude mudway was a success he sat in the armchair thinking of jemima and her pride daniels happiness for as long as he could finally he turned his mind to tomorrow and the fact that he must go and tell croxdale the truth about gower and the betrayal that might run throughout the service the following day at lisson grove was filled with the same necessary trivia there was news from paris which was only vaguely disturbing there was a definite increase in activity among the people special branch was watching but if it had any meaning pitt was unable to determine what it was it was much the same sort of thing he might have done had narraway been here and he in his own job the difference was the weight of responsibility the decisions that he could no longer refer upwards now they all came to him other men who had previously been his equals were now obliged to report to him they came not always for advice more often simply so that he was aware of all the different pieces that formed the picture they had of subversion possible treason violence before it happened he must know everything that might threaten the safety of her majestys realm and her government the peace and prosperity of britain it was the morning of the day after when he finally obtained an interview with sir gerald croxdale pitt was no further forward in understanding the extent of the treachery but he must tell croxdale of gowers death and how it had happened no report had come in yet but it could not be long now he arrived at whitehall late in the afternoon the sun was still warm and the air was soft as he walked across from the park and along the street to the appropriate entrance several carriages passed him the women in them wearing wide hats to protect their faces from the light their muslin sleeves drifting in the breeze horse brasses winked with bright reflections and some carriage doors carried painted family crests pitt was admitted without question apparently the footman knew who he was he was taken straight to croxdales rooms and kept waiting only a matter of moments how are you pitt croxdale said warmly rising from his seat to shake pitts hand sit down how is it at lisson grove his voice was pleasant almost casual but he was watching pitt intently there was a gravity in him as if he already knew that pitt had ugly news to tell him it was the opening pitt needed without having to create it himself i had hoped to tell you more sir he began but the whole episode of seeing west murdered and following frobisher to france was far more serious than i thought at first croxdale frowned sitting a little more upright in his chair in what way have you learned what he was going to tell you no sir i havent at least i am not certain but i have a strong idea and everything i have discovered since returning supports it but does not provide a conclusion stop beating around the bush man croxdale said impatiently what is it pitt took a deep breath the risk must be taken we have at least one traitor at lisson grove croxdale froze his eyes hard his right hand on top of the desk suddenly became rigid as if he were deliberately forcing himself not to clench it i presume you mean other than victor narraway he said quietly pitt made another decision i dont and never have believed that narraway was a traitor sir whether he is guilty of a misjudgement or a carelessness i dont yet know but regrettably we all misjudge at times explain yourself croxdale said between his teeth if not narraway and i reserve judgement on thatthen who gower sir gower croxdales eyes opened wide did you say gower yes sir pitt could feel his own temper rising how could croxdale accept so easily that narraway was a traitor and yet be so incredulous that gower could be what had austwick told him how deep and how clever was this web of treason was pitt rushing in where a wiser more experienced man would have been careful laid his ground first but there was no time to do that narraway was outcast in ireland and heaven only knew if charlotte was safe or where she was and in what circumstances pitt could not afford to seek their enemies cautiously croxdale was frowning at him should he tell him the whole story or simply about the murder of west any of it made pitt look like a fool but he had been a fool he had trusted gower even liked him the memory of it was still painful he could smell the sea air of st malo feel the heat of the sun on his face hear gowers voice his laughter something happened in france that made me realise that it only appeared that gower and i arrived together as wrexham killed west he said actually gower had been there moments before and killed him himself for gods sake man thats absurd croxdale exploded almost rising from his seat you cant expect me to believe that how did you fail he sat back again composing himself with an effort im sorry this comes as an appalling shock to me i i know his family are you certain it all seems very flimsy yes sir im afraid i am certain pitt felt a stab of pity for the minister i made an excuse to leave him in france and return by myself you left him again croxdale was stunned i couldnt arrest him pitt pointed out i had no weapon and he was a young and very powerful man the last thing i wanted to do was inform the local police of who we were and that we were there without their knowledge or permission watching french citizens yes of course i see i see go on croxdale was flushed and obviously badly shaken pitt could have sympathised at another time i told him to remain watching wrexham and frobisher whos frobisher croxdale demanded pitt told him what they knew of frobisher and the other men they had seen coming and going from his house croxdale nodded so there was some truth to this business of socialists meeting and possibly planning something possibly nothing conclusive yet and you left gower there i thought so but when i reached southampton i took the train to london on that train i was attacked twice and very nearly lost my life good god by whom croxdale was horrified gower sir the first time he was interrupted and the man who did so paid for his courage with his life then gower renewed his attack on me but this time i was ready for him and it was he who lost croxdale wiped his hand across his brow what happened to gower it was he who went over onto the track pitt replied his stomach knotting at that memory and the sweat breaking out on his skin again he decided not to mention his own arrest because then he would have to explain how vespasia had rescued him and he preferred to keep her name out of it altogether he was killed croxdale said at that speed sir there can be no doubt croxdale leaned back how absolutely fearful he let out his breath slowly you are right of course we had a traitor at lisson grove i am profoundly grateful that it was he and not you who went over onto the tracks why on earth did you not tell me this as soon as you returned because i hoped to learn who was the man behind gower before i told you pitt answered croxdales face went white behind gower he said awkwardly i dont yet know pitt admitted not for certain i never found evidence one way or the other whether frobisher was the power behind a new socialist uprising perhaps violent or only a dilettante playing on the edge of the real plot we dont assume it is trivial croxdale said quickly if gower i still find it hard to credit but if gower murdered two people and attempted to murder you also then it is very real indeed he bit his lip i assume from what you say that you did not tell austwick this no i believe someone made it appear that narraway was guilty of embezzlement in order to get him out of the way discredit him so deeply that anything he said against them would be disbelieved who someone to do with frobisher or gower again neither frobisher nor gower had the ability pitt pointed out that has to be someone in lisson grove someone with a considerable amount of power in order to have access to the details of narraways banking arrangements croxdale was staring at him his face drawn cheeks flushed i see yes of course you are right then this socialist plot seems very deep perhaps this frobisher is as dangerous as you first thought and poor west was killed to prevent you from learning the full extent of it no doubt gower kept you along with him when he went to france so you could be duped into believing frobisher harmless and sending that misinformation back to london he smiled bleakly just for an instant thank god you were clever enough to see through it and agile enough to survive his attack on you you are the right man for this job pitt whatever else he may be guilty of narraway did well when he brought you into the service pitt felt he should thank him for the compliment and for his trust but he wanted to argue and say how little he was really suited to it he ended by inclining his head thanking croxdale briefly and moving on to the more pressing problem of the present we need to know very urgently sir what information gower himself may have passed back to london and more specifically to whom i dont know who i can trust no croxdale said thoughtfully no neither do i we need to look at this a great deal more closely pitt austwick has reported to me at least three times since narraway left i have the papers here we need to go through all this information and you must tell me what you know to be accurate or inaccurate and what we still need to test some picture should emerge im sorry but this may very well require all night ill have someone fetch us supper he shook his head god what a miserable business there was no question of argument croxdale had other notes not only of what austwick had reported to him but going back further what narraway also had written it was curious looking at the different papers austwicks writing was neat his notes carefully thought out and finely presented narraways pitt viewed with a jolt of familiarity and a new sense of how alone he was in narraways place the writing was smaller more flowing as if it were casual and yet there were fewer words there was no hesitation he had thought before he began and there was no attempt to conceal the fact that he was giving croxdale only the minimum was that an agreement between them and croxdale could read between the lines or had narraway simply not bothered to conceal the fact that he was telling only part of what he knew pitt studied croxdales face and did not know the answer they read them carefully a servant brought in a tray of light toast and pate then cheese and finally a heavy fruit cake along with brandy which pitt declined it was now totally dark outside the wind was rising a little spattering rain against the windows croxdale put down the last paper narraway obviously thought there was something to this business in paris but not major austwick seems to disagree and thinks there is nothing but noise and posturing unlike narraway he believes it will not affect us here in britain what do you think pitt it was the question pitt had dreaded but it was inevitable that it would come there was no room for excuses no matter how easy to justify he would be judged on the accuracy of his answer he had lain awake weighing everything he knew hoping croxdales information would top the balance one way or the other again he answered with barely a hesitation i think that narraway was on the brink of finding out something crucial and he was got rid of before he could do so croxdale waited a long time before he answered do you realise that if that is true then you are also saying that austwick is either incompetent to a most serious degree or else far worse than that he is complicit in what is going on yes sir im afraid that has to be the case pitt agreed but gower was reporting to someone so we know that at least one person within the service is a traitor ive known charles austwick for years croxdale said softly but perhaps we dont know anyone as well as we imagine he sighed ive sent for stoker apparently hes newly back from ireland he may be able to throw some light on things do you trust him yes but i trusted gower so im not sure my opinion is worth a great deal pitt said ruefully do you croxdale gave him a bleak smile touche lets at least see what he has to say and the answer is no i trust no one i am painfully aware that we cannot afford to not after narraway and not it would seem gower also are you sure you wont have a brandy im quite sure thank you sir there was a knock on the door and at croxdales word stoker came in he looked tired there were shadows around his eyes and his face was pinched with fatigue however he stood to attention until croxdale gave him permission to sit stoker acknowledged pitt but only so much as courtesy demanded when did you get back from ireland croxdale asked him about two hours ago sir stoker replied weathers a bit poor mr pitt doesnt believe the charge of embezzlement against narraway croxdale went on he thinks it is possibly false manufactured to get rid of him because he was on the verge of gaining information about a serious socialist plot of violence that would affect britain he was completely ignoring pitt his eyes fixed on stoker so intently they might have been alone in the room sir stoker said with amazement but he did not look at pitt either you worked with narraway croxdale continued does that seem likely to you what is the news from ireland now stokers jaw tightened as if he were labouring under some profound emotion his face was pale as he leaned forward a little into the light he seemed leached of colour by exhaustion im sorry sir but i cant see any reason to question the evidence its amazing what lack of money can do and how it can change your view of things pitt felt as if he had been struck the sting of stokers words was hard enough to have been physical he would rather it had been i see croxdale sighed and what is the state of affairs in dublin at present mr narraway is in prison accused of murdering cormac oneil stoker answered murder croxdale looked aghast pitts thoughts were in disarray the narraway he knew was not a murderer and what of charlotte was she now alone and frightened yet pitt could not ask stoker it seems he quarrelled with him rather publicly making no secret of the fact he believed oneil to be responsible for creating the evidence that made it seem he was guilty of embezzling the money intended for mulhare and to be honest that could well be true could it croxdale asked a lift of hope in his voice from what i can make out yes sir it could stoker replied only problem is how he got the information hed need to get it into mr narraways account ive been trying to find the answer to that and i think ill get there someone at lisson grove croxdale said no sir stoker answered without a flicker in his face not as far as i can see croxdales eyes narrowed then who who else would be able to do that stoker did not hesitate looks like it could be someone at mr narraways bank sir i dare say one time and another hes made some enemies or it could just be someone willing to be paid nice to think that wouldnt happen but maybe a bit innocent thered be those with enough money to buy most things i suppose so croxdale replied perhaps narraway found out already that would explain a great deal what other news have you from ireland stoker told him about narraways connections who he had spoken to and their reactions the confrontation with oneil at the concert never once did he mention charlotte at least some of what he described was so unlike narraway panicky and protective that it seemed as if his whole character had fallen apart pitt listened with disbelief and mounting anger at what he felt had to be a betrayal thank you stoker croxdale said sadly a tragic end to what was a fine career give your report on ireland to mr pitt yes sir stoker left and croxdale turned to pitt i think that makes the picture clearer gower was the traitor which i admit i still find hard to credit but what you say makes it impossible to denywe may have the disaster contained but we cant take it for granted investigate as fully as you can pitt and report to me keep an eye to whats going on in europe and if there is anything we should inform the french about then well do so in the meantime theres plenty of other political trouble to keep us busy but im sure you know that he rose to his feet extending his hand take care of yourself pitt you have a difficult and dangerous job and your country needs you more than it will ever appreciate pitt shook his hand and thanked him going out into the night without any awareness of the sudden chill the coldness was already inside him narraway arrested for murder it seemed unbelievable what stoker had said of narraways bank betraying him could be true although he did not believe it the rest seemed a curious set of exaggerations and lies pitt could not accept that narraway had fallen apart so completely either to steal anything in the first place or to so lose the fundamental values of his past as to behave in the way stoker had described and surely stoker must at the very least have noticed charlotte or was stoker the traitor at lisson grove he was floundering like a man in quicksand none of his judgements was sound he had trusted stoker he had even liked gower narraway he would have sworn his own life on he admitted he still would do croxdales carriage was waiting to take him home he half saw the shadow of a man on the pavement who moved towards him but he ignored it the coachman opened the door for him and he climbed in sitting miserable and shivering all the way back to keppel street he was glad it was late he did not want to make the intense effort it would cost to hide his disillusion from daniel and jemima if he were fortunate even minnie maude would be asleep in the morning he was halfway to lisson grove when he changed his mind and went instead to see vespasia it was too early for any kind of social call but if he had to wait until she rose then he was willing to his need to speak with her was so urgent he was prepared to break all the rules of etiquette even of consideration trusting she would see his purpose beyond his discourtesy in fact she was already up and taking breakfast he accepted tea but he had no need to eat is your new maid feeding you properlyvespasia asked with a touch of concern yes he answered his own surprise coming through his voice actually shes perfectly competent and seems very pleasant it wasnt he saw her wry smile and stopped it wasnt to seek recommendation for a new maid that you came at this hour of the morning she finished for him what is it thomas you look very troubled indeed i assume something new has occurred he told her everything that had happened since they last spoke including narraways arrest for murder and pitts own dismay and disappointment over stokers sudden change of loyalties and the brutal details with which he had described narraways falling apart i seem to be completely incompetent at judging anyones character he said miserably he would like to have been able to say it with some dry wit but he felt so inadequate that he was afraid he sounded selfpitying vespasia listened without interrupting she poured him more tea then grimaced that the pot was cold it doesnt matter he said quickly i dont need more let us sum up the situation she said gravely it would seem unarguable that you were wrong about gower as was everyone else at lisson grove including victor narraway it does not make you unusually fallible my dear and considering that he was your fellow in the service you had a right to assume his loyalty at that point it was not your job to make such decisions now it is i thought stoker was narraways man too he pointed out possibly but let us not leap to conclusions you know only that he brought news of victors arrest and that what he reported to gerald croxdale about the embezzlement charge seemed to blame victor and also was untrue in other respects he made no mention of charlotte as you observed and yet he must have seen her surely his omission is one you are grateful for yes yes of course although i would give a great deal to know she is safe that was an understatement perhaps only vespasia could measure did you say anything to croxdale about your suspicions of austwick she asked no he explained how reluctant he had been to give any unnecessary trust he had guarded everything fearing that because croxdale had known austwick a long time perhaps he would be more inclined to trust him than to trust pitt very wise she agreed is croxdale of the opinion that there is something very serious being planned in france i saw nothing except a couple of faces he answered and when i look back it was gower who told me they were meister and linsky there was talk but no more than usual there was a rumour that jean jaures was coming from paris but he didnt vespasia frowned jacob meister and pieter linsky are you sure yes thats what gower said i know the names of course but only for just one day maybe thirtysix hours then they left again they certainly didnt return to frobishers vespasia looked puzzled and who said jean jaures was coming one of the innkeepers i think the men in the cafe were talking about it you think a name like jaures is mentioned and you dont remember by whom she said incredulously again he was struck by his own foolishness how easily he was duped he had not heard it himself gower had told him he admitted this to vespasia did he mention rosa luxemburg she asked with a slight frown yes but not that she was to coming to st malo but he mentioned her name yes why jean jaures is a passionate socialist but a gentle man she explained he was a campaigner for reform he sought office and on occasion gained it but he fights for change not for overthrow as far as i know he is content to keep his efforts within france rosa luxemburg is different she is polish now naturalised german and of a much more international cast of mind i have russian emigre friends who fear that one day she will cause real violence in some places im afraid real violence is almost bound to happen the oppression in russia will end in tragedy stretching as far as britain he said dubiously no only in so far as the world is sometimes a far smaller place than we think there will be refugees however indeed london is already full of them what did gower want he asked why did he kill west was west going to tell me gower was a traitor perhaps but i admit none of it makes sufficient sense to me so far unless there is something a great deal larger than a few changes in the laws for french workers or a rising unease in germany and russia none of this is new and none of it worries special branch unduly i wish narraway were here pitt said with intense feeling i dont know enough for this job he should have regarded austwick as his protege unless he knows austwick is a traitor too i imagine that is possible she was still lost in thought and if victor is innocent which i do not doubt then there was a very clever and carefully thoughtout plan to get both you and he out of london why can we not deduce what it is and why pitt went to his office in lisson grove aware as he walked along the corridors of the eyes of the other men on him watching waiting austwicks particularly good morning austwick said apparently forgetting the sir he would have added for narraway good morning austwick pitt replied a little tartly not looking at him but going on until he reached narraways office door he realised he still thought of it as narraways just as he still thought of the position as his he opened the door and went inside there was nothing of pitts here yet no pictures no books but narraways things had been returned so that to pitt it felt as if he were still expecting the man himself to come back when that happened he would not have to pretend to be pleased and it would not be entirely for unselfish reasons either he cared for narraway and he had at least some idea of how much the job meant to him it was his vocation his life pitt would be immensely relieved to give it back to him it was not within pitts skill or his nature to perform this job he regretted that it was now his duty he dealt with the most immediate issues of the day first passing on all he could to juniors when that was done he told them not to interrupt him then he went through all narraways records of every crime gower had been involved with over the past year and a half he read all the documents getting a larger picture concerning european revolutionary attempts to improve the lot of the working men he also read the latest report from paris as he did so the violence proposed settled over him like a darkness senseless and destructive but the anger at injustice he could not help sharing it grieved him that people had been oppressed and denied a reasonable life for so long that the change when it came and it must would be fuelled by so much hatred the more he read the greater the tragedy seemed to him that the high idealism of the revolution of had been crushed with so little legacy of change left behind gowers own reports were spare as if he had edited out any emotive language at first pitt thought that was just a very clear style of writing then he began to wonder if it were more than that a guarding of gowers own feelings in case he gave something away unintentionally or narraway himself picked up a connection an omission even a false note then he took out narraways own papers he had read most of them before because it was part of his duty in taking over the position many of the cases he was familiar with anyway from general knowledge within the branch he selected three specifically to do with europe and socialist unrest those associated with britain memberships of socialist political groups such as the fabian society he compared them with the cases on which gower had worked and looked for any notes that narraway might have made what were the facts he knew personally that gower had killed west and made it appear it was wrexham who had done so all doubt left him that it had been extremely quick thinking on gowers part it had been his intention all the time and with wrexhams collaboration pitt recalled the chase across london and then on to southampton he was bitterly conscious that it had been too easy the conclusion was inevitable gower and wrexham were working together to what end again looked at from the result it could only have been to keep pitt in st malo or more specifically to keep him from being in london and aware of what was happening to narraway but to what greater purpose was it to do with socialist uprisings or was that also a blind a piece of deception who was wrexham he was mentioned briefly twice in gowers reports he was a young man of respectable background who had been to university and dropped out of a modern history course to travel in europe gower suggested he had been to germany and russia but seemed uncertain it was all very vague and with little substantiation certainly there was nothing to cause narraway to have him watched or enquired into any further presumably it was just sufficient information to allow gower to say afterwards that he was a legitimate suspect the more he studied what was there the more pitt was certain that there had to be a far deeper plan behind the random acts he had connected in bits and pieces the picture was too sketchy the rewards too slight to make sense of murder it was all disparate and too small the most urgent question was whether narraway had been very carefully made to look guilty of theft in order to gain some kind of revenge for old defeats and failures or whether the real intent was to get him dismissed from lisson grove and out of england the more pitt looked at it the more he believed it was the latter if narraway had been here what would he have made of the information surely he would have seen the pattern why could pitt not see it what was he missing he was still comparing one event with another and searching for the links the commonality when there was a sharp knock on the door he had asked not to be interrupted this had better be something of importance or he would tear a strip off the man whoever he was come in he said sharply the door opened and stoker came in closing it behind him pitt stared at him coldly stoker ignored his expression i tried to speak to you last night he said quietly i saw mrs pitt in dublin she was well and in good spirits shes a lady of great courage mr narraway is fortunate to have her fighting his cause although i dare say its not for his sake shes doing it pitt stared at him he looked subtly quite different from the way he had when standing in front of croxdale the previous evening was that a difference in respect in loyalty personal feeling or because one was the truth and the other lies did you see mr narraway pitt asked him yes but not to speak to it was the day oneil was shot stoker answered by whom i dont know i think probably talulla lawless but whether anyone will ever prove that i dont know mr narraways in trouble mr pitt he has powerful enemies i know that pitt interrupted him apparently dating back twenty years not that stoker said impatiently now here in lisson grove someone wanted him discredited and out of england and wanted you in france gone in the other direction where you wouldnt know what was going on here and couldnt help tell me all you know of what happened in ireland pitt demanded and for heavens sake sit down it was not that he wanted the information in detail so much as he needed the chance to weigh everything stoker said and make some judgement as to the truth of it and exactly where stokers loyalties were stoker obeyed without comment i was there only two days he began who sent you pitt interrupted no one i made it look like it was mr narraway before he went why because i dont believe hes guilty any more than you do stoker said bitterly hes a hard man clever cold at times in his own way but hed never betray his country they got rid of him because they knew hed see what was going on here and stop it they thought you might too in loyalty to mr narraway even if you didnt spot what theyre doing no offence sir but you dont know enough yet to see what it is pitt winced but he had no argument it was painfully true mr narraway seemed to be trying to find out who set him up to look like he took the money meant for mulhare probably because that would lead back to whoever it is here in london stoker went on i dont know whether he found out or not because they got him by killing oneil they set that up perfectly fixed a quarrel between them in front of a couple o score of people then somehow got him to go alone to oneils house and had oneil shot just before he got there by all accounts mrs pitt was right on his heels but he swore to the police that she wasnt there at the time so they didnt bother her she went back to where she was staying and thats the last i know of it mr narraway was arrested and no doubt if we dont do anything theyll try him and hang him but well have a week or two before that he stopped meeting pitt with steady demanding eyes he must trust stoker the advantage outweighed the risk then we have about ten days in which to rescue narraway he replied perhaps whoever is behind this will be as aware of that as we are it is safe to assume that by that time they will have achieved whatever it is they plan and for which they needed him gone stoker sat up a little straighter yes sir and we have no idea who it is that is planning it pitt continued except that they have great power and authority within the branch so we dare not trust anyone even sir gerald himself may choose to trust this person rather than trust you or me stoker allowed himself a slight smile youre right sir and that could be the end of everything probably of you an me and certainly of mr narraway then we are alone in working out what it is pitt had already made up his mind that if he were to trust stoker at all then it might as well be entirely this was not the time to let stoker believe he was only half relied on pitt pulled out the papers he had been studying and placed them sideways on the desk so they could both see them this is the pattern i found so far he pointed to communications gun smuggling the movements of known radicals both in britain and in the continent of europe not much of a pattern stoker said grimly it looks pretty much like always to me he pointed theres rosa luxemburg in germany and poland in that part but shes been getting noisier for yearstheres jean jaures in france but hes harmless enough your basic socialist reformer bit hard now and then but what hes saying is fair enough if you look at it nothing to do with us though hes as french as frogs legs and here pitt pointed to some fabian society activity in london and birmingham theyll get changes through parliament eventually stoker said that keir hardiell do a thing or two but thats not our bother either personally i wish him good luck we need a few changes no sir there is something big planned and pretty bad an we havent worked out what it is yet pitt did not reply he stared at the reports yet again rereading the text studying the geographic patterns of where they originated who was involved then he saw something curious is that willy portman he asked stoker pointing to a report of known agitators observed in birmingham yes sir seems like it whats he doing here nasty piece of work willy portman violent nothing good if hes involved i know pitt agreed but thats not it this report says he was seen at a meeting with joe gallagher those two have been enemies for years what could bring them together stoker stared at him theres more he said very quietly mcleish was seen in sheffield with mick haddon pitt knew the names they were both extremely violent men and again known to hate each other and fenner he added putting his finger on the page where fenners name was noted and guzman and scarlattithats the patternwhatever it is its big enough to bring these enemies together in a common cause and here in britain there was a shadow of fear in stokers eyes id like reform sir for lots of reasons but i dont want everything good thrown out at the same time and violence isnt the way to do anything because no matter what you need to do in the first place it never ends there seems to me that if you execute the monarch either you end up with a religious dictator like cromwell who rules over the people more tightly than any king ever did and then you only have to get rid of him anyway or else you end up with a monster like robespierre in paris and the reign of terror then napoleon after that then you get a king back in the end anyway at least for a while i prefer us as we are with our faults rather than all that so do i pitt agreed but we cant stop it if we dont know what it is and when and how it will strike i dont think we have very long no sir and if youll excuse me spelling it out we havent any allies either least of all not here in lisson grove whoever blackened mr narraways name did a very good job of it and nobody trusts you because youre his man pitt smiled grimly its a lot more than that stoker im new to this job and none of the men will trust me above austwick for which you can hardly blame them is austwick a traitor sir i think so but he may not be the only one i know that stoker said very quietly chapter eleven narraway was intensely relieved to see the familiar coast of ireland slip away over the horizon with no coastguard or police boat in pursuit of them at least for a few hours he could turn his attention to what he should do once he arrived at holyhead the obvious thing would be to catch the next train to london would it be so obvious a move that he might be apprehended on the other hand would delay only give anyone still bent on catching him a better chance to cross the irish sea in a lighter perhaps faster boat and arrest him before he could get any help he was standing on the deck looking westwards charlotte was beside him she looked weary and the marks of fear were still drawn deep into her face even so he found her beautiful he had long ago grown tired of unspoiled perfection if that was what one hungered for the colour the proportion the smooth skin the perfect balance of feature there were works of art all over the world to stare at even the poorest man could find a copy for himself a real woman had warmth vulnerability fears and blemishes of her own or else how could she have any gentleness towards yours without experience one was a cup waiting to be filled wellcrafted perhaps but empty and to a soul of any courage or passion experience also meant a degree of pain false starts occasional bad judgements a knowledge of loss young women were charming for a short while but very soon they bored him he was used to loneliness but there were times when its burden ached so deeply he could never be unaware of it after all that had happened in ireland now standing on the deck with charlotte watching the wind unravel her hair and blow it across her face was another such time she had already told him what she had learned of talulla john tyrone and the money and of fiachra mcdaid it was complicated some of the situation he had guessed from what ocasey had told him but he had not understood talullas place in it without her and fiachra having convinced her that her parents were innocent she would not have blamed cormac she would still have blamed narraway of course but that was fair kates death was as much his fault as anyones in so far as it was foreseeable he had known how sean felt about her what did talulla imagine cormac could have done to save sean sean was a rebel whose wife gave him up to the english was that betrayal treason to the spirit of ireland or just a practical decision to avoid more pointless heartbreaking bloodshed how many people were still alive who would not have been if the uprising had happened perhaps half the people she knew but of course she wouldnt see it that way she couldnt afford to she needed her anger and it was justified only if her parents were the victims and fiachra narraway winced at his own blindness how desperately he had misread him he had concealed the passion of his irish nationalism inside what had seemed to be a concern for the disenfranchised of all nations the more narraway thought about it the more it made sense odd how often a sweeping love for all could be willing to sacrifice the one or the ten or the score almost with indifference fiachra would see the glory of greater social justice freedom for ireland and the price would slip through his fingers uncounted he was a dreamer who stepped over the corpses without even seeing them under the charm there was ice and by god he was clever in law he had committed no crime if justice ever reached him it would be for some other reason at another time narraway looked at charlotte again she became aware of it and turned to him theres no one anywhere on the whole sea she said with a slightly rueful smile i think were safe the inclusion of herself in his escape gave him a sort of warmth that he was aware was ridiculous he was behaving like a man of twenty so far he agreed but when we get on the train at holyhead you would be safer to be in a different carriage i doubt there will be anyone looking for me but its not impossible who she said as if dismissing the idea no one could have got here ahead of us before he could answer she went on and dont tell me they anticipated your escape if they had theyd have prevented it dont be naive victor they wanted you hanged it would be the perfect revenge for sean he winced youre very blunt i suppose you just noticed that she gave a tiny twisted smile no of course not but that was unusual even for you this is an unusual situation she said at least for me should i be trite if i asked you if you do it often ah charlotte he brushed his hand through his heavy hair and turned away needing to hide the emotion in his face from her he needed it to be private but far more than that he knew that it would embarrass her to realise how intense were his feelings for her im sorry she said quickly hell he swore to himself he had not been quick enough i know its serious she went on apparently meaning something quite different a wave of relief swept over him and perversely of disappointment did some part of him want her to know if so it must be suppressed it would create a difficulty between them that could never be forgotten yes he agreed will you go to lisson grove now she sounded anxious no id rather they didnt even know i was back in england and certainly not where he saw the relief in her face theres only one person i dare trust totally and that is vespasia cumminggould i shall get off the train one or two stations before london and find a telephone if im lucky ill be able to get hold of her straight away itll be long after dark by then if not ill find rooms and wait there until i can his voice dropped to a more urgent note you should go home you wont be in any danger or else you could go to vespasias house if you prefer perhaps you should wait and see what she says he realised as he spoke that he had no idea what had happened to pitt even if he were safe to send charlotte back to a house with no one there but a strange maid was possibly a cruel thing to do she had said before that her sister emily was away somewhere similarly her mother god what a mess but if anything had happened to pitt no one would be able to comfort her he could not bear to think of that please heaven whoever was behind this they did not think pitt a sufficient danger to have done anything drastic to him well get off a couple of stations before london he repeated and call vespasia good idea she agreed turning back to watch the gulls circling over the white wake of the ship the two of them stood side by side in silence oddly comforted by the endless rhythmic moving of the water and the pale wings of the birds echoing the curved line of it narraway was connected with vespasia immediately only when he heard the sound of her voice which was thin and a little crackly over the line did he realise how overwhelmingly glad he was to speak with her victor where on earth are you she demanded then the instant later no do not tell me are you safe is charlotte safe yes we are both safe he answered her she was the only woman since his childhood who had ever made him feel as if he were accountable to her we are not far away but i thought it better to speak to you before coming the rest of the journey dont she said simply it would be far better if you were to find some suitable place which we shall not name and we shall meet there a very great deal has happened since you left but there is far more that is about to happen i do not know what that is except that it is of profound importance and it may be tragically violent but i dare say you have deduced that for yourself i rather fear that your whole trip to ireland was designed to take you away from london everything else was incidental whos in charge now he asked a chill seeped into him even though he was standing in a very comfortable hotel hallway looking from left to right every few moments to make sure he was still alone and not overheard charles austwick no she answered and there was a heaviness in her voice even over the wires that was only temporary thomas is back from france that trip was entirely abortive he has replaced austwick and is now in your office and hating it narraway was so stunned for a moment he could think of no words that were adequate to his emotions certainly none that he could repeat in front of vespasia or charlotte were she close enough to hear victor vespasia said sharply yes im here what what is going on i dont know she admitted but i have a great fear that he has been placed there precisely because he cannot possibly cope with whatever atrocity is being planned he has no experience in this kind of leadership he has not the deviousness nor the subtlety of judgement to make the necessary unpleasant decisions and there is no one there whom he can trust which at least he knows i am afraid he is quite appallingly alone exactly as someone has designed he should be his remarkable record of success as a policeman and as a solver of crimes within special branch jurisdiction will justify his being placed in your position no one will be held to blame for choosing him you mean hes there to take the blame when this storm breaks narraway said bitterly precisely vespasias voice cracked a little victor we must beat this and i have very little idea how i dont even know what it is they plan but it is something very very wrong indeed she was brave no one he knew had ever had more courage she was clever and still beautiful but she was also growing old and at times very much alone suddenly he was aware of her vulnerability of the friends and even the lovers she had cared for passionately and lost she was perhaps fifteen years older than he suddenly he thought of her not as a force of society or of nature but as a woman as capable of loneliness as he was himself do you remember the hostelry where we met somerset carlisle about eight years ago we had the most excellent lobster for luncheon he asked yes she said unhesitatingly we should meet there as soon as possible he told her bring pitt please i shall be there by midnight she replied he was startled midnight for heavens sake victor she said tartly what do you want to do wait until breakfast dont be absurd you had better reserve us three rooms in case there is any of the night left for sleeping then she hesitated he wondered why lady vespasia she gave a little sigh i dislike being offensive but since i assume you escaped from where you were that you have little money and i dare say are in less that your usually elegant state you had better give my name as if you were booking it for me and tell them that i shall settle when i arrive better if you do not give anyone elses name your own or thomass actually charlotte had the foresight to pack my case for me so i have all the respectable attire i shall need he replied with the first flash of amusement he had felt for some time she did what vespasia said coolly she was obliged to leave the lodgings he exclaimed still with a smile she did not wish to abandon my luggage so she took it with her if you dont know me better than that you should at least know her quite so she said more gently i apologise indeed i also know you i shall see you as close to midnight as i am able to make it i am very glad you are safe victor that meant more to him than he had expected so much more that he found himself suddenly unable to answer he replaced the receiver on its hook in silence pitt was at home sitting at the kitchen table beginning his supper when minnie maude came into the room her face was pink her eyes frightened her usually untamed hair pulled even looser and badly pinned up at one side whats the matter pitt said instantly worried as well minnie maude took a deep breath and let it out shakily theres a lady ere ter see yer sir i mean a real lady like a duchess or summink wot shall i do wif er sir oh pitt felt a wave of relief wash over him like warmth from a fire on cold flesh show her in here and then put the kettle on again minnie maude held her guard no sir i mean a real lady not jus some nice person like tall and slender and very beautiful in spite of the fact that she isnt young any more pitt agreed and eyes that could freeze you at twenty paces if you step out of line lady vespasia cumminggould please ask her to come into the kitchen she has been in here before then make her a cup of tea we have some earl grey we keep it for her minnie maude stared at him as if he had lost his wits please he added yerll pardon me sir minnie maude said shakily but yer look like yer bin dragged through an edge backwards pitt pushed his hand through his hair she wouldnt recognise me if i didnt dont leave her standing in the hall bring her here she int in the all sir shes in the parlour minnie maude told him with disgust at his imagining she would do anything less i apologise of course she is bring her here anyway defeated she went to obey pitt ate the last mouthful of his supper and cleared the table as vespasia arrived in the doorway i always liked this room she observed thank you minnie maude good evening thomas i am sorry to have interrupted your dinner but it is unavoidable behind him minnie maude skirted around her and put the kettle onto the hob then she began to wash out the teapot in which pitts tea had been made and prepare it to make a different brew for vespasia her back was very straight and her hands shook just a little pitt did not interrupt vespasia he held one of the hardbacked kitchen chairs for her to be seated she declined to take off her cape i have just heard from victor she told him on the telephone from a railway station not far from the city charlotte was with him and perfectly well you have no need to concern yourself about her health or anything else however there are other matters of very great concern indeed matters that require your immediate and total attention narraway his mind raced she was being discreet no doubt aware that minnie maude could hear all they said it would be cruel pointless and possibly even dangerous to frighten her unnecessarily certainly she did not deserve it apart from the very practical matter that he needed her common sense to care for his household and most importantly his children at least until charlotte returned and he admitted he rather liked her she was goodnatured and not without spirit there was something about her not totally unlike gracie indeed vespasia turned to minnie maude when you have made the tea will you please go and pack a small case for your master with what he will need for one night away from home clean personal linen and a clean shirt and his customary toiletries when you have it bring it downstairs and leave it in the hall by the bottom step minnie maudes eyes widened she blinked as if wondering whether she dare confirm the orders with pitt or if she should simply obey them who was in charge they were giving the poor girl a great deal to become accustomed to in a very short while pitt smiled at her please do that minnie maude it appears i shall have to leave you but also i shall return before too long you may be extremely busy for some time vespasia corrected him it is a very good thing that minnie maude is a responsible girl you will need her now let us have tea and prepare to leave as soon as the tea was poured and minnie maude was out of the room pitt turned to vespasia the look on his face demanded she explain it is a conclusion no longer avoidable that both you and victor were drawn away from london for a very specific purpose she said sipping delicately at her tea victor was put out of office with an attempt to have him at least imprisoned in ireland possibly hanged you were lured away from london before that so you as the only person at lisson grove with an unquestionable personal loyalty to him and the courage to fight for him would not be there he would be friendless as indeed he was pitt would have interrupted narraway to ask why but he did not dare interrupt vespasia it appears that charles austwick is involved she continued to what degree and for what purpose we do not yet know but the plot is widespread dangerous and probably violent i know he said quietly i think after all i can rely on stoker but so far as i can see at the moment he is the only one there will be more but i dont know who they are and i cant afford any mistakes even one could be fatal what i dont understand is why austwick made so little fuss at being removed from the leadership it makes me fear that there is someone else who knows every move i make and who is reporting to him she set her cup down the answer is uglier than that my dear she said very quietly i think that what is planned is so wide and so final in its result that they wish you to be there to take the blame for special branchs failure to prevent it then the branch can be recreated from the beginning with none of the experienced men who are there now and be completely in the control of those who are behind this or alternatively it might be disbanded altogether as a force that has served its purpose in the past but is now manifestly no longer needed the thought was so devastating that it took pitt several moments to grasp the full import of it he was not promoted for merit but as someone completely dispensable a judas goat to be sacrificed when special branch took the blame for failing to prevent some disaster he should have been furiously angry and he would be in time when he absorbed the enormity of it and had time to think of himself now all he could deal with was the nature of the plot and who was involved how could they ever begin to fight against it he looked at vespasia he was startled to see the gentleness in her face a deep and hurting compassion he forced himself to smile at her in the same circumstances she would never have spent time pitying herself he would not let her down by doing so im trying to think what i would have been working on had i not gone to st malo he said i dont know if poor west was actually going to tell me anything that mattered such as that gower was a traitor or if he was killed only to get me chasing wrexham to france i thought it was the former but perhaps it wasnt certainly that was the end of my involvement over here if you had been here you might have prevented victor from having been removed from office she concluded on the other hand you might have been implicated in the same thing and removed also she stopped he shrugged or killed he said what he knew she was thinking sending me to france was better much less obvious also it seems they want me here now to take the blame for this failure that is about to descend on us ive been trying to think what cases we were most concerned with what we may have learned had we had time we will consider it in my carriage on the way to our appointment vespasia said finishing her tea minnie maude will have your case packed any moment and we should be on our way he rose and went to say good night and for the very immediate future goodbye to his children he gave minnie maude last instructions and a little more money to ascertain that she had sufficient then he collected his case and went outside to vespasias carriage where it was waiting in the street within seconds they were moving briskly ive already looked over everything that happened shortly before i left and in austwicks notes since he began and in the reports from other people i did it with stoker we saw something that i dont yet understand but it is very alarming what is it she asked quickly he told her about the violent men who had been seen in several different parts of england and watched her face grow pale and very grave as he told her how old enemies had been seen together as if they had a common cause this is very serious she agreed there is something i also have heard whispers of while you were away i dismissed it at first as being the usual idealistic talk that has always been around among dreamers always totally impractical for example certain social reformers seem to be creating plans as if they could get them through the house of commons without difficulty some of the reforms were radical and yet i admit there is a certain justice to them i assumed they were simply naive but perhaps there is some major element that i have missed they rode in silence for the length of woburn place towards euston road then turned right with the stream of traffic and continued north until it became the pentonville road i fear i know what element you have missed pitt said at last violence she asked i cannot think of any one man or even group of men who would pass some of the legislation they are proposing it would be pointless anyway it would be sent back by the house of lords and then they would have to begin again by that time the opposition would have collected its wits and its arguments they must know that of course they do he agreed but if there were no house of lords the streetlamps outside seemed harsh the rattle of the carriage wheels unnaturally loud another gunpowder plot she asked the country would be outraged we hanged drew and quartered guy fawkes and his conspirators we might not be quite so barbaric this time but i wouldnt risk all i valued on it her face was momentarily in the shadows as a higher longer carriage passed between them and the nearest streetlamps they arrived at the hostelry narraway had chosen nearly an hour later tired chilly and uncomfortable they greeted each other briefly with intense emotion then allowed the landlord to show them to the rooms they would occupy for the night then they were offered a private lounge where they might have whatever refreshments they wished and be otherwise uninterrupted pitt was filled with emotion to see charlotte joy just at the sight of her face anxiety that she looked so tired he was relieved that she was safe when she so easily might not have been frustrated that he had no opportunity to be alone with her even for a moment and angry that she had been in such danger she had acted recklessly and with no reference to his opinion or feelings he felt painfully excluded narraway had been there and he had not his reaction was childish he was ashamed of it but that did nothing to lessen its sharpness then he looked at narraway and in spite of himself his anger melted the man was exhausted the lines in his face seemed more deeply cut as if made with some instrument that dragged the skin down as it scored them into his cheeks his dark eyes were bruised around the sockets and he brushed his hair back impatiently with his thin strong hands as if it were in his way they glanced at each other no one knowing who was in command narraway had led special branch for years but it was pitts job now and yet neither of them would disregard vespasias seniority vespasia smiled for heavens sake thomas dont sit there like a schoolboy waiting for permission to speak you are the commander of special branch what is your judgement of the situation we will add to it should we have something to offer pitt cleared his throat he felt as if he were usurping narraways place yet he was also aware that narraway was weary and beaten betrayed on either hand in ways that he had not foreseen and accused of crimes where he could not prove his innocence the situation was harsh a little gentleness was needed in the few places where it was possible carefully he repeated for narraway what had happened from the time he and gower had seen west murdered until he and stoker had put together as many of the pieces as they could he was aware that he was speaking of professional secrets in front of both vespasia and charlotte it was something he had not done before but the gravity of the situation did not allow him to exclude them if they failed the nature of the plot would all become desperately public in a very short time anyway how short a time he could only guess when he had finished he looked at narraway the house of lords would be the obvious and most relevant target narraway said slowly it would be the beginning of a revolution in our lives a very dramatic one god only knows what might follow the french throne is already gone the austrohungarian empire is shaking especially after that wretched business at mayerling he glanced at charlotte and saw the puzzlement in her face six years ago in eightynine he explained crown prince rudolf and his mistress shot themselves in a hunting lodge all very messy and never really understood he leaned forward a little his face resuming its gravity the other thrones of europe are less secure than they used to be and russia is careering towards chaos if they dont institute some sweeping reforms very soon which is almost as likely as daffodils in november theyre all hanging on with their fingers not us pitt argued the queen went through a shaky spell a few years ago but her popularitys returning which is why if they struck here at our hereditary privilege the rest of europe would have nothing with which to fight back narraway responded think about it pitt if you were a passionate socialist and you wanted to sweep away the rights of a privileged class to rule over the rest of us where would you strike france has no ruling nobility spain isnt going to affect the rest of us any more they used to be related to half europe in habsburg times but not now austria theyre crumbling anyway germany bismarck is the real power all the great royal houses of europe are related to victoria one way or another if victoria gets rid of her house of lords then it will be the beginning of the end for privilege by birth one cannot inherit honour or morality victor vespasia said softly but one can learn from the cradle a sense of the past and gratitude for its gifts one can learn a responsibility towards the future to guard and perhaps improve on what one has been given and leave it whole for those who follow his face was pinched as he looked at her i am speaking their words not my own lady vespasia he bit his lip if we are to defeat them we must know what they believe and what they intend to do if they can gain the power they will sweep away the good with the bad because they dont understand what it is to answer only to your conscience rather than to the voice of the people which comes regardless whether or not they have the faintest idea what they are talking about im sorry she said very quietly i think perhaps i am frightened hysteria appals me it should he assured her the day there is no one left to fear it we are all lost he turned to pitt have you any idea as to what specific plans anyone has very little pitt admitted but i know who the enemy is he relayed to narraway what he had told vespasia about the different violent men who loathed each other and yet appeared to have found a common cause where is her majesty now narraway asked osborne pitt replied he felt his heart beating faster harder other notes he had seen from various people came to mind mens movements that were small and discreet but of people whose names should have given warning to whoever was reading the reports narraway would have seen it i believe thats where theyll strike its the most vulnerable and most immediate place narraway looked even paler the queen he gave no exclamation no word of anger or surprise his emotion was too consuming the thought of attacking victoria herself was so shocking that all words were inadequate pitts mind raced to the army the police on the isle of wight all the men he himself could call from other duties then another thought came to him was this what they were supposed to think what if he responded by concentrating all his resources on osborne house and the actual attack come somewhere else be careful narraway said quietly if we cause public alarm it could do all the damage they need i know pitt was aware of charlotte and vespasia watching him as well i know that i also know that they have probably a large space of time in which to strike they could wait us out then move as soon as we have relaxed i doubt it narraway shook his head i think its urgent even immediate the men you named here in england together wont wait you should go back to lisson grove and im going to osborne pitt cut across him i dont have anyone else i can send and if youre right we could already be too late youre going to lisson grove narraway repeated you are head of special branch not a foot soldier to be going into battle what happens to the operation if you are shot captured or simply where no one can reach you stop thinking like an adventurer and think like a leader you need to find out exactly who you can trust and you need to do it by the end of tomorrow he glanced at the ormolu clock on the mantel today he corrected ill go to osborne i can at least warn the queens household perhaps find a way of holding off whatever attack there is until you can send men to relieve us you may not be let in vespasia pointed out to him you have no standing now narraway winced clearly he had forgotten that aspect of his loss of office ill come with you vespasia said not as an offer but as a statement i am known there unless i am very unfortunate they will admit me at least to the house if i explain what has happened and the danger the butler will give me audience with the queen i still have to decide what to tell her once i am in her company pitt did not argue the logic of it was only too clear he rose to his feet then we had better return and begin charlotte you will come with me as far as keppel street narraway and aunt vespasia had better take the carriage and set out for the isle of wight vespasia looked at pitt then at narraway i think a couple of hours sleep would be wise she said firmly and then breakfast before we begin we are going to make some very serious judgements and perhaps fight some hard battles we will not do it well if we are mentally or physically so much less than our best pitt wanted to argue with her but he was exhausted if it was in any way morally acceptable he would like to lie down for an hour or two and allow his mind to let go of everything he couldnt remember when he had last relaxed totally let alone had the inner peace of knowing that charlotte was beside him that she was safe he looked at narraway narraway gave a bleak smile its good advice well get up at four and leave at five he glanced towards vespasia to see that it met with her agreement she nodded im coming with you charlotte said there was no question in her voice just a simple statement she turned to pitt im sorry it is not a question of not wanting to be left out or of any idea that i am indispensable but i cant let aunt vespasia travel alone it would be remarked on for a start surely the servants at osborne would consider it very odd of course she was right pitt should have thought of it himself it was a large omission on his part that he had not of course he agreed now lets retire while we still have a couple of hours left when they were upstairs and the door closed charlotte looked at him with gentleness and intense apology im sorry she began be quiet he answered lets just be together while we can she walked into his arms and held him close he was so tired that he was almost asleep on his feet moments later when they lay down he was dimly aware that she was still holding him in the morning pitt left to return to lisson grove charlotte vespasia and narraway took the coach south along the main road to the nearest railway station to catch the next train to southampton and from there the ferry to the isle of wight if nothing is happening yet we may have a little trouble in gaining an audience with the queen narraway said when they were sitting in a private compartment in the train the soothing rattle of the wheels over the rails rhythmically clattered at every joint but if the enemy are there already we will have to think of a better way of getting inside can we purchase a black gladstone bag in southampton charlotte suggested with a few bottles and powders from an apothecary victor could pose as a doctor i shall be his nurse she glanced at vespasia or your ladys maid i have no skills in either but am sufficiently plainly dressed to pass at least briefly vespasia considered for only a moment an excellent idea she agreed but we should get you a plainer gown and an apron a good white one without ornament should serve for either calling i think victors nurse would be better the staff will be very familiar with ladys maids nurses they might know less do you agree victor there was a flash of amusement in his eyes of course we will arrange it all as soon as we arrive at the station you think we are late already dont you charlotte said to him he made no pretence yes if i were they i would have acted by now an hour and a half later they approached the spacious comfortable house in which queen victoria had chosen to spend so many years of her life particularly since the death of prince albert osborne seemed to offer her a comfort she found nowhere else in the more magnificent castles and palaces that were also hers the house looked totally at peace in the fitful spring sun most of the trees were in leaf in a clean almost gleaming translucency the grass was vivid green there was blossom on the blackthorn and the may was in heavy bud osborne was set in the gently rolling parkland that one would expect of any family mansion of the extremely wealthy much of the land was wooded but also there were wide wellkept sweeps of grass which gave it a feeling of great space and light the house had been designed by prince albert himself who had clearly much admired the opulent elegance of the italian villas it had two magnificent square towers which were flattopped and tall windows on all sides the main building copied the same squared lines and the sunlight seemed to reflect on glass in every aspect one could only imagine the beauty of the inside their carriage pulled up and they alighted thanking the driver and paying him youll be wanting me to wait the cabby said with a nod you can look but thats all her majestys in residence you dont get no closer than this vespasia paid him generously no thank youyou may leave us he shrugged and obeyed turning his vehicle round and muttering to the horse about tourists with no sense there is nothing for us to wait for either narraway said ruefully i cant tell anything from the outside can you it all looks just as i imagine it should do theres even a gardener at work over there he did not point but inclined his head charlotte glanced in the direction he indicated and saw a man bent over a hoe his attention apparently on the ground the scene looked rural and pleasantly domestic some of the anxiety inside her eased perhaps they had been more frightened than necessary they were in time now they must avoid looking foolish not only for the sake of pride but so that when they gave the warning the royal household staff would take them seriously anyway it would not be long before pitt would send reinforcements who were trained for just this sort of duty and the danger would be past unless of course they were mistaken and the blow would strike somewhere elsewas this yet another brilliant diversion narraway forced himself to smile in the sunlight i feel a trifle ridiculous carrying this case now please hold on to it as if it were highly valuable to you vespasia said very quietly you will need it that man is no more a gardener than you are he doesnt know a weed from a flower dont look at him or he will become alarmed doctors called out to the queen are not concerned with men hoeing the heads off petunias charlotte felt the sun burn in her eyes the huge house in front of them seemed to blur and go fuzzy in her vision ahead of her vespasias back was rulerstraight her head with its fashionable hat was as high and level as if she were sailing into a garden party as an honoured guest they were met at the door by a butler whose white hair was scraped back from the high dome of his forehead as if he had run his hands through it almost hard enough to pull it out he recognised vespasia immediately good afternoon lady vespasia he said his voice shaking i am afraid her majesty is a little unwell today and is not receiving any callers whatever im so sorry we didnt know in time to advise you i would invite you in but one of our housemaids has a fever which we would not wish anyone else to catch im so sorry most unpleasant for the poor girl vespasia sympathised and for all the rest of you also you are quite correct to take it seriously of course fortunately i have brought dr narraway with me and im sure he would be happy to see the girl and do whatever can be done for her sometimes a little tincture of quinine helps greatly it might be wise for her majestys sake as well it would be dreadful if she were to catch such a thing the butler was lost for words he drew in his breath started to speak and stopped again the sweat stood out on his brow and his eyes blinked rapidly i can see that you are distressed for her vespasia spoke as assuringly as she could although her voice wavered a trifle also perhaps in humanity as well as wisdom we should have dr narraway look at her if all your staff became infected you will be in a serious and most unpleasant situation lady vespasia i cannot before he could finish another younger man appeared also dressed as a servant he was darkhaired perhaps in his midthirties and heavier set sir he said to the butler i think perhaps the lady is right i just had word poor mollie is getting worse youd better accept their offer and have them in the butler looked at the man with loathing but after one desperate glance at vespasia he surrendered thank you vespasia stepped across the threshold charlotte and narraway followed her the moment they were inside and the front door closed it was apparent that they were prisoners there were other men at the foot of the sweeping staircase and at the entrance to the kitchens and servants quarters you didnt have to do that the butler accused the other man oh decidedly we did the other contradicted him theyd ave gone away knowing there was something wrong best we keep all this quiet dont want the old lady upset no you dont vespasia agreed tartly if she has an attack and dies you will be guilty not only of murder but of regicide do you imagine there is anywhere in the world that you could hide from that not that you would escape we may have many ideas about the liberty or equality that we aspire to even fight for but no one will countenance the murder of the queen who has been on our throne longer than the lifetime of most of her subjects around the face of the earth you would be torn apart although i dare say that matters less to you than the complete discrediting of all your ideas lady keep a still tongue in yer head or ill still it for yer whatever people feel about the queen no one cares a jot if yer survive this or not the man said sharply yer pushed yer way in here yerve no one but yerself to blame if it turns bad for yer this is the butler began then realising he was only offering another hostage to fate he bit off his words is anyone sick vespasia enquired of no one in particular no the butler admitted its what they told us to say good then will you please conduct us to her majesty if she is being held with the same courtesy that you are offering us it might still be as well for dr narraway to be close to heryou dont want her to suffer any unnecessary ill effects if she is not alive and well i imagine she will be of little use to you as a hostage how do i know yere a doctor the man said suspiciously looking at narraway you dont narraway replied but what have you to lose do you think i mean her any harm what do you think i mean her any harm narraway repeated impatiently of course not what kind of a stupid question is that the only kind that needs an answer if i mean her no harm then it would be of less trouble to you to keep us all in the same room rather than use several this is not so very large a house for all its importance i will at least keep her calm is that not in your interest whats in that bag yer could have knives even gas for all i know i am a physician not a surgeon narraway said tartly whos she the man glanced at charlotte my nurse do you imagine i attend female patients without a chaperone the man took the gladstone bag from narraway and opened it up he saw only the few powders and potions they had bought from the apothecary in southampton all labelled they had been careful for precisely this reason not to purchase anything that was an obvious weapon not even small scissors for the cutting of bandages everything was exactly what it purported to be the man shut the bag again and turned towards his ally at the foot of the stairs yer might as well take em up we dont want the old lady passing out on us not yet anyway the other man agreed he jerked his hand towards the flight of stairs come on then yer wanted to meet her majesty this is yer lucky day it was the butler who conducted them up and then across the landing and knocked on the upstairs sittingroom door at the order from inside he opened it and went in a moment later he came out again her majesty will receive you lady vespasia you may go in thank you vespasia accepted leading the way while narraway and charlotte followed a couple of steps behind her victoria was seated in one of the comfortable homely chairs in the wellused very domestic living room only the height and ornate decoration of the ceiling reminded one that this was the home of the queen she herself was a small rather fat elderly woman with a beaky nose and a very round face her hair was screwed back in an unflatteringly severe style her large eyes were pale and she was dressed entirely in black which drained every shred of colour from her skin when she saw vespasia for a second she blinked and then she smiled vespasia how very agreeable to see you come here vespasia went forward and dropped a graceful curtsy her head slightly bowed her back perfectly straight your majesty who are these victoria enquired looking beyond vespasia to narraway and charlotte she lowered her voice only slightly your maid presumably the man looks like a doctor i didnt send for a doctor theres nothing the matter with me every fool in this household is treating me as if im ill i want to go for a walk in the garden and i am being prevented i am empress of a quarter of the world and my own household wont let me go for a walk in the garden her voice was petulant vespasia come for a walk with me she made to rise to her feet but she was too far back in the chair to do so without assistance and rather too fat to do it with any grace maam it would be better if you were to remain seated vespasia said gently i am afraid i have some very harsh news to tell you lady vespasia narraway warned be quiet victor vespasia told him without turning her eyes away from the queen her majesty deserves to know the truth i demand to know itvictoria snapped what is going on narraway stepped back surrendering with as much dignity as possible i regret to say maam vespasia said frankly that osborne house has been surrounded by armed men of what number i do not know but several of them are inside and have taken your household prisoner victoria stared at her then glanced past her at narraway and who are you one of those traitors no maam until very recently i was head of your special branch he replied gravely why are you not still so why did you leave your post i was dismissed maam by traitors within but i have come now to be of whatever service i may until help arrives as it will do we have seen to it when i hope by nightfall or shortly after narraway replied first the new head of the branch must be absolutely certain whom he can trust the queen sat very still for several moments the ticking of the longcase clock seemed to fill the room then we had best wait with some composurevictoria said at last we will fight if necessary before that we may have some chance to attempt escape narraway began victoria glared at him again i am queen of england and the british empire young man in my reign we have stood our ground and won wars in every corner of the earth am i to run away from a group of hooligans in my own house in osborne narraway stood a little more uprightly vespasia held her head high charlotte found her own back ramrod straight i should think so victoria said regarding them with a very slight approval to quote one of my greatest soldiers sir colin campbell who said at the battle of balaclava here we stand and here we die she smiled very slightly but since it may be some time you may sit if you wish chapter twelve pitt returned to lisson grove knowing that he had no allies there except probably stoker and that the safety of the queen perhaps of the whole royal house depended upon him he was surprised as he walked up the steps and in through the doorway how intensely he felt about it there was a fierce loyalty in him but not towards an old woman sitting in lonely widowhood in a house on the isle of wight nursing the memories of the husband she had adored millions of people were lonely many had always been so most of them were also poor often sick and bore with it with both grace and fortitude it was the leadership he cared about the embodiment of what britain had been all his life it was the whole idea of unity greater than all the differences in race creed and circumstance that bound together a quarter of the earth the worst of society was greedy arrogant and selfserving but the best of it was supremely brave generous and above all loyal what was anybody worth if they had no concept of a purpose greater than themselves this was very little to do with victoria herself and most certainly nothing to do with the prince of wales the murder at buckingham palace was very recent in pitts mind the selfishness of the prince his unthinking arrogance and the look of hatred he had directed at pitt could not be forgotten they should not soon the prince would be king edward vii and pitts career as a servant of the crown would rest at least to some degree in his hands pitt would have wished him a better man but his own loyalty to the throne was something apart from any personal disillusionment all his concentration now was bent on controlling austwick whom dare he trust he could not do this alone and he must force himself not to think of charlotte or vespasia or even of narraway except insofar as they were allies their danger he must force from all his conscious thoughts one of the burdens at the core of leadership was that you must set aside personal loyalties and act in the good of all he made himself think of how he would feel if others in command were to save their own families at the cost of his if charlotte were sacrificed because another leader put his wifes safety ahead of his duty only then could he dismiss all questions from his mind as he passed along the familiar corridors he had to remind himself again not to go to his old office which was now occupied by someone else but back to the one that used to be narraways and would be again as soon as this crisis was past as he closed the door and sat at the desk he was profoundly glad that he had retrieved narraways belongings and never for a moment behaved as if he believed this was permanent the drawings of trees were back on the walls and the tower by the sea even the photograph of narraways mother dark and slender as he was but more delicate the intelligence blazing out of her eyes pitt smiled for a moment then turned his attention to the new reports on his desk there were very few of them just pedestrian comments on things that for the most part he already knew there was no information that changed the circumstances he stood up and went to find stoker rather than sending for him because that would draw everyones attention to the fact that he was singling him out it was necessary he trust someone or failure was certain even with stokers help success would be desperately difficult yes sir stoker said as soon pitt had closed the door and was in front of him he stared at pitts face as if trying to read in it what he was thinking pitt hoped that he was a little less transparent than that he remembered how he had tried to read narraway and failed at least most of the time we know what it is he said quietly there was no point in concealing anything and yet even now he felt as if he were standing on a cliff edge about to plunge into the unknown yes sir stoker froze his face pale on the desk still holding the paper he had been reading his hands were stiff pitt took a breath mr narraway is back from ireland he saw the relief in stokers eyes too sharp to hide and went on more easily a darkness sliding away from him also it seems we are right in thinking that there is a very large and very violent plan already begun there is reason to believe that the people we have seen together such as willie portman fenner guzman and so on intend to attack her majesty at osborne house god almighty stoker gasped regicide pitt grimaced not intentionally we think they mean to hold her to ransom in return for a bill to abolish the hereditary power of the house of lords a bill that of course she will sign before i imagine her own abdication stoker was ashen he looked at pitt as if he had turned into some nightmare in front of his eyes he swallowed then swallowed again and then what kill her pitt had not taken it that far in his mind but perhaps it was the logical end the only one they could realistically live with in the eyes of britain and most of the world as long as victoria was alive she would be queen regardless of what anyone else said or did he had thought things could not get worse but in one leap they had yes i imagine so he agreed narraway and lady vespasia cumminggould have gone to osborne to do what they can until we can send reinforcements to deal with whatever we find stoker half rose in his seat but not until we know whom we can trust pitt added the group must be small enough to be discreet if we go in with half an army it will be far more likely to provoke the plotters into violence immediately if they know they are cornered and cannot escape theyll hold her to ransom their freedom for her life he felt his throat tighten as he said it he was fighting an enemy of unknown size and shape moreover elements of it were secret from him and lay within his own men for a moment he was overwhelmed he had no idea even where to begin every possibility seemed to carry its own failure built into it a few men wellarmed and taking them by surprise stoker said quietly thats our only hope i think pitt agreed but before we do that we need to know who is the traitor here in lisson grove and who else is with him otherwise they may sabotage any effort we make stokers hand on the desk clenched into a fist you mean you think theres more than one dont you i dont know stoker pushed his hand through his hair scraping it back off his forehead god help me i dont know and theres no time to find out it could take us weeks its going to have to take us a lot less than that pitt replied pulling out the hardbacked chair opposite the desk and sitting on it in fact we must make a decision by the end of today stokers jaw dropped and if were wrong we mustnt be pitt told him unless you want a new republic born in murder and living in fear well start with who set up the fraud that got rid of narraway and made it all connect up with ireland so he would be in an irish prison when all this happened stoker took a deep breath yes sir then wed better get started and im sorry to say this but well have to consider whoever gower worked with as well because getting you out of the way has to be part of it of course it has pitt agreed but gower worked with me and i reported to narraway thats the way it looked to all of us stoker agreed but it cant be what it was ill get his records from the officer who keeps all the personal stuff well have to know who he worked with before you you dont happen to know do you i know what he said pitt replied with a twisted smile id like to know rather more than that i think wed better take as close a look as we can at everyone they spent the rest of the day reading through all the records they could find going back a year or more having to be discreet as to why what are you looking for sir one man asked helpfully perhaps i can find it i know the records pretty well pitt had his answer prepared its a pretty serious thing that we were caught out by narraway he replied grimly i want to be sure beyond any doubt at all that theres nothing else of that kind in fact nothing at all that can catch us out again the man swallowed his eyes wide there wont be sir thats what we thought before pitt told him i dont want to leave it to trust i want to know yes sir of course sir can i help or he bit his lip i see sir of course you cant trust any of us pitt gave him a bleak smile i dont mind your help wilson i need to trust all of you and equally you need to trust me it was narraway who embezzled the money after all not one of the juniors here but i have to know who helped him if anyone and who else might have had similar ideas wilson straightened up yes sir is anyone else allowed to know not at the moment pitt was taking a chance but time was growing short and if he caught wilson in a lie it would at least tell him something in fact perhaps fear would be a better ally than discretion as long as that too was used secretly he loathed this at least in the police he had always known that his colleagues were on the same side he had not realized then how infinitely valuable that was he had taken it for granted by the middle of the afternoon they had found the connection between gower and austwick they discovered it more by luck than deduction here stoker held out a piece of paper with a note scrawled across the bottom pitt read it it was a memorandum of one man written to himself saying that he must see austwick at a gentlemens club and report a fact to him does this matter he asked puzzled its nothing to do with socialists or any kind of violence or change its just an observation of someone which turned out to be irrelevant yes sir stoker agreed but its this he handed pitt another note with something written on the bottom in the same hand gave the message on hibbert to gower to pass on to austwick at the hyde club matter settled the place was a small very select gentlemens club in the west end of london he looked up at stoker how the devil did gower get to be a member of the hyde club i looked at that sir austwick recommended him and that means that he must know him pretty well then well look a lot more closely at all the cases gowers worked on and austwick as well pitt replied but we already know theyre connected stoker pointed out and who else pitt asked there are more than two of them but with this weve got a better place to start keep working we cant afford even one oversight silently stoker obeyed he concentrated on gower while pitt looked at every record he could find of austwick by nine oclock in the evening they were both exhausted pitts head thumped and his eyes felt hot and gritty he knew stoker must feel the same there was little time left pitt put down the piece of paper he had been reading until the writing on it blurred in front of his vision any conclusions he asked some of these letters sir make me think sir gerald croxdale was just about onto him he was pretty close to putting it together stoker replied i think that might be what made austwick hurry it all up and act when he did by getting rid of narraway he shook everybody pretty badly took the attention away from himself and also put him in charge pitt added it wasnt for long but maybe it was long enough the last paper he had read was a memorandum from austwick to croxdale but it was a different thought that was in his mind stoker was waiting do you think austwick is the leader he asked is he actually a great deal cleverer than we thought or at any rate than i thought stoker looked unhappy i dont think so sir it seems to me like hes not making the decisions ive read a lot of mr narraways letters and theyre not like this he doesnt suggest he just tells you and it isnt that hes any less of a gentleman just that he knows hes in charge and he expects you to know it too maybe that wasnt how he spoke to you but its how he did to the rest of us no hesitation you ask you get your answer i reckon that austwicks asking someone else first that was exactly the impression pitt had had a hesitation as if checking with the man in control of master plan but if croxdale was almost onto him why was narraway not who can we trust he asked aloud we have to take a small force no more than a couple of dozen men at the very most any more than that and well alert them theyll have people watching for exactly that stoker wrote a list on a piece of paper and passed it across these im sure of he said quietly pitt read it crossed out three and put in two more now we must tell croxdale and have austwick arrested he stood up and felt his muscles momentarily lock he had forgotten how long he had been sitting shoulders bent reading paper after paper yes sir i suppose we have to we need an armed force stoker we cant go and storm the queens residence whatever the reason without the ministers approval dont worry weve got a good enough case here he picked up a small leather satchel and put into it the pages vital to the conclusions they had reached come on at osborne charlotte vespasia and narraway were kept in the same comfortable sitting room as the queen one terrified ladys maid was permitted to come and go in order to attend to queens wishes they were given food by one of the men who kept them prisoner and watched as they availed themselves of the necessary facilities for personal relief the conversation was stilted in front of the queen no one felt able to speak naturally charlotte looked at the old lady this close to her with no distance of formality possible she was not unlike charlottes own grandmother someone she had loved and hated feared and pitied over the years as a child charlotte had never dared to say anything that might be construed as impertinent later exasperation had overcome both fear and respect and she had spoken her own mind with forthrightness more recently she had learned terrible secrets about that woman and loathing had melted into compassion now she looked at the short dumpy old lady whose skin showed the weariness of age whose hair was thin and almost invisible under her lace cap victoria was in her late seventies and had been on the throne for nearly half a century however it was not the responsibility of that that wore her down it was the bitter loneliness of widowhood to the world she was queen empress defender of the faith and her numerous children had married into half the royal houses of europe here at osborne standing looking out of the upstairs window across the fields and trees in the waning afternoon light she was a tired old woman who had servants and subjects but no equals she would probably never know if any of them would have cared a jot for her if she were a commoner the loneliness of it was unimaginable would they kill her those men in the hallway with guns and violent dreams of justice for people who would never want it purchased this way if they did would victoria mind so very much a clean shot through the heart and she would join her beloved albert at last would they kill the rest of them too narraway and vespasia and charlotte herself what about all the servants or did the hostagetakers consider the servants to be ordinary people like themselves charlotte was sure the servants didnt think anything of the sort charlotte had been sitting quietly on a chair at the far side of the room on a sudden impulse she stood up and walked over towards the window she stopped several feet short of the queen it would be disrespectful to stand beside her perhaps it was disrespectful to stand here at all but she did so anyway the view was magnificent she could even see a bright glint of sunlight on the sea in the distance the hard light picked out every line on victorias face the marks of tiredness sorrow ill temper and perhaps also the inner pain of emotional isolation was she afraid it is very beautiful maam charlotte said quietly where do you live victoria asked in london in keppel street maam do you like it i have always lived in london but i think i might like it less if i had the choice of living where i could see something like this and just hear the wind in the trees instead of the traffic can you not be a nurse in the country victoria asked still staring straight ahead of her charlotte hesitated surely this was a time for the truth it was only conversation the queen did not care in the slightest where she lived any answer would do if they were all to be shot what sort of an answer mattered an honest one no a kind one she turned and looked quickly at vespasia vespasia nodded charlotte moved half a step closer to the queen no maam im afraid im not a nurse at all i told the man at the door that i was in order for them to allow me in victoria twisted her head to stare at charlotte with cold eyes and why was that charlotte found her mouth dry she had to lick her lips before she could speak my husband is in special branch maam yesterday he became aware what these men planned to do he returned to london to get help from among those we can trust lady vespasia mr narraway and i came here to warn you hoping we were in time clearly we were not but now that we are here we will do all we can to be of help victoria blinked you knew that those creatures were here she said incredulously yes maam lady vespasia realised that the man pretending to be a gardener was actually taking the heads off the petunias no real gardener would do that victoria looked beyond charlotte to vespasia still at the far side of the room yes maam vespasia answered the unspoken question narraway moved at last he came forward bowed very slightly just an inclination of his head maam these men are violent and we believe they are seeking reform of all hereditary privilege in europe all hereditary privilege she interrupted you mean her voice faltered like the french from the pallor of her face she had to be thinking of the guillotine and the execution of the king not as violently as that maam narraway told her we believe that when they are ready they will ask you to sign a bill abolishing the house of lords never she said vehemently then she gulped i do not mind dying so much for myself if that is what they have in mind but i do not wish it for my household they have been loyal and do not deserve this repayment some of them are young can you negotiate something that will spare them with your permission maam i will attempt to prevaricate long enough for help to arrive he replied why does special branch not call in the army or at the very least the police she asked because if they come in with force these people may react violently he explained they are tense now in their own way they are frightened they know the cost of losing they will certainly be hanged we cannot afford to panic them whatever we do it must be so stealthy that they are unaware of it everything must appear normal until it is too late i see she said quietly i thought i was being brave when i said here we die it looks as if i was more accurate than i intended i will remain here in this room where i have been so happy in the past she gazed out of the window do you suppose heaven is like that mr what is your name narraway maam yes i think it may well be i hope so dont humour me she snapped if god is an englishman maam then it certainly will be he said drily she turned and gave him a slow careful look then she smiled he bowed again then turned away and walked to the door outside in the landing he saw one of the armed men halfway down the stairs the man must have caught the movement in the corner of his vision he spun around raising the gun narraway stopped he recognised gallagher from special branch photographs but he did not say so if any of them realised who he was they might shoot him on principle get back there gallagher ordered narraway stood where he was what do you want he asked what are you waiting for is it money gallagher gave a snort of contempt what do you think we are bloody thieves is that as far as your imagination goes thats all your sort thinks of isnt it money all the worlds money property you think thats all there is property and power and whats yours narraway asked keeping his voice level and as emotionless as he could get back in there gallagher jerked the gun towards the upstairs sitting room again again narraway remained where he was youre holding her majesty hostage you must want something what is it well tell you that when were ready now unless you want to get shot get back in there reluctantly narraway obeyed there was an edge of fear in gallaghers voice a jerkiness in his movements that said he was as tight as a coiled spring inside he was playing for the highest stakes he could imagine and this was the only chance they would have this was win or lose it all back in the sitting room vespasia looked at narraway the moment the door was closed theyre waiting for something he said quickly whoever it is here hes not in charge someone will come with a proclamation for her majesty to sign or something of the sort he gritted his teeth we may be here for some time this has been put to the prime minister if they are arguing this thing in the cabinet well have to keep our heads try to keep them calm and possibly even convince them they have a hope of success if they lose that they may just kill us all theyll have nothing to lose he looked at her white face im sorry i would prefer not to have had to tell you that but i cant do this alone we must all stay steady the household staff as well i wish i could get to them to persuade them of the need for calm one person in hysterics might be enough to panic them all vespasia rose to her feet a trifle unsteadily then i will ask this lunatic on the stairs for permission to go and speak with the household staff perhaps you will be good enough to help me persuade him of the necessity charlotte will manage here very well narraway took her arm holding it firmly he turned to victoria maam lady vespasia is going to speak with your staff it is imperative that no one loses control or behaves with rashness i shall try to persuade the men who hold us hostage to permit her to do this for all our sakes i am afraid we may be here for some little time thank you victoria spoke more to vespasia than to narraway but the comment included them both perhaps they could serve everyone food charlotte suggested it is easier to be busy an excellent idea vespasia agreed come victor if they have any sense at all they will see the wisdom of it they went to the door and he held it open for her charlotte watched them go with her heart pounding and her stomach clenched tight she turned to victoria who was staring at her with the same fear bright in her eyes out on the landing there was still silence no sound of gunfire a little before midnight pitt and stoker sat in a hansom cab on its way to the home of sir gerald croxdale with them in the satchel was the main evidence to prove austwicks complicity in the movement of the money which had made narraway appear guilty of theft and resulted in the murder of mulhare also included were the reports of the leading revolutionary socialists prepared to use violence to overthrow governments they believed to be oppressive and who were now gathered together in england and had been seen moving south towards osborne house and the queen also of course there were the names of the traitors within special branch it took nearly five minutes of ringing and knocking before they heard the bolts drawn back in the front door it was opened by a sleepy footman wearing a coat over his nightshirt yes sir he said cautiously pitt identified himself and stoker it is an extreme emergency he said gravely the government is in danger will you please waken the minister immediately he made it a request but his tone left no doubt that it was an order they were shown to the withdrawing room just over ten minutes later croxdale himself appeared hastily dressed his face drawn in lines of anxiety as soon as he had closed the door he spoke looking from pitt to stoker and back again what is it gentlemen there was no time for any more explanation than necessary to convince him we have traced the money that was placed in narraways account pitt said briefly it was charles austwick behind it and the consequent murder of mulhare and also behind gowers murder of west far more importantly we know the reason for both it was to place austwick in charge of special branch so no one else would notice the violent radical socialists coming into britain men who have been ideological enemies until now suddenly cooperating with each other and all moving down towards the isle of wight croxdale looked startled the isle of wight for gods sake why osborne house pitt said simply god almighty the queen croxdales voice was all but strangled in his throat are you sure no one would why it makes no sense it would unite the world against them he waved one hand and shook his head as if to push away the whole idea not to kill her pitt told him at least not to start with perhaps not at all then what croxdale peered at him as if he had never really seen him before pitt are you sure you know what you are talking about yes sir pitt said firmly he was not surprised croxdale doubted him if he had not seen the proof himself he would not have believed it we traced the money that was supposed to go to mulhare the information he gave was very valuable he gave up nathaniel byrne one of the key men responsible for several bombings in ireland and in london very few people knew that even in special branch but austwick was one of them narraway arranged the payment so mulhare could escape that was a condition of his giving the information i knew nothing about it croxdale said sharply but why would austwick do such a thing did he take some of it himself no he wanted narraway out of special branch and me too in case i knew enough of what narraway had been working on to piece it together piece what croxdale said sharply you havent explained anything yet and what has this to do with socialist violence against the queen passionate idealism gone mad pitt answered hold the queen to ransom for abolition of the house of lords and then probably for her own abdication the end of rule by hereditary privilege then probably a republic with only elected representation of the people good god croxdale sank into the nearest armchair his face ashen his hands shaking are you certain man i cant act on this without absolute proof if i have to mount a force of armed men to take osborne house id better be bloody sure im doing the right thing in fact the only thing if youre wrong ill end up in the tower and itll be my head on the block mr narraway is already at osborne sir pitt told him what croxdale sat up with a jerk narraways in he stopped rubbing his hand over his face do you have proof of all this pitt yes or no i have to explain this to the prime minister before i act immediately tonight i can have austwick arrested before he gets any idea that you know what hes done ill do that now but you must give me more than your word to take to the prime minister yes sir pitt indicated the case he had with him its in here reports instructions letters it takes a bit of piecing together but its all there are you certain my god man if youre wrong ill see you go down with me croxdale rose to his feet ill get it started theres obviously no time to waste he walked slowly from the room closing the door behind him stoker was standing where he had been throughout the conversation there was a very slight frown on his face what is it pitt asked stoker shook his head i dont know sir pitt had the case in his hand with the papers why had croxdale not asked to see them at least check over them especially with the possibility of treachery inside special branch and his belief earlier that narraway himself was a thief pitt was known to be narraways man in his place pitt would have been sceptical at the very least do you think he suspected austwick all along stoker asked of what if he was part of setting up the forgeries to blame narraway then he was part of the plot to attack the queen if croxdale knew that then hes part of it too as he spoke the pieces fell together in his mind austwick was reporting to someone else they were certain of that croxdale himself then he remembered something else croxdale had said he did not know about austwick sending the money for mulhare but croxdale had had to countersign it it was too large an amount for one signature alone he turned to stoker hes going to get rid of austwick and blame him for all of it he said then the queen stoker was holloweyed in the lamplight pitt knew he must look the same could they possibly be right the price would be total ruin if they were wrong and ruin for the country if they were right and did nothing pitt nodded stoker went to the door and opened it very quietly not allowing the latch to click back pitt came behind him across the hallway the study door was ajar and there was a crack of light across the dark floor wait till he comes out stoker said under his breath ill get over the far side in the other doorway you hold his attention ill be behind him be prepared hell fight pitt could feel his heart pounding so hard his whole body must be shaking with it had his promotion gone to his head and he was doing the wildest thing of his life throwing away everything he had in a gesture that in the light of day would look like the act of a madman or a traitor he should wait act with moderation ask someone elses opinion what if stoker were the traitor and deliberately provoking pitt to this what if he were austwicks man about to arrest the one person who stood in their way what if it were all a plan to ruin special branch discredit it into oblivion he froze ahead of him stoker tiptoed across the hall to stand little more than a shadow in the doorway next to the study where croxdale would have his back to him when he came out to go back to pitt the seconds ticked by was croxdale speaking to the prime minister what could he tell him over a telephone would he have to go and see him in person in order to raise a force of men to relieve osborne house no this was an emergency no time to argue or plead a case was he arranging to have austwick arrested the study door opened and croxdale came out now was the time for decision as croxdale walked across the unlit hall before he reached the sittingroom door pitt stepped forward sir gerald austwick is not the leader in the attempted coup croxdale stopped what the devil are you talking about if theres somebody else why in gods name didnt you tell me before because i didnt know who it was pitt said honestly croxdale was in the shadow his face all but invisible and now you do his voice was soft was it in disbelief or understanding at last yes pitt said stoker moved silently forward until he was a yard behind croxdale he had deliberately chosen an angle to come where he cast no shadow indeed and who is it croxdale asked you pitt answered there was total silence croxdale was a big man heavy pitt wondered if he and stoker would be able to take him if he fought back if he called for the footman who must be waiting somewhere please god he was in the kitchen where he would only hear a bell but he would not go back to bed while his master was up and there were visitors in the house you made a mistake pitt pointed out as much to hold croxdales attention from any slight sound stoker might make as for any reasoning really what was that croxdale did not sound alarmed in seconds he had regained his composure the amount of money you paid mulhare he was worth it he gave us byrne croxdale replied the contempt undisguised in his voice if you were up to your job you would know that oh i do know it pitt answered keeping his eyes on croxdale so he did not waver even once and glance at stoker behind him the point is not whether mulhare was worth it it is that that amount had to be authorised by more than one man it has your signature on it what of it croxdale asked it was a legitimate payment it was used to get rid of narraway and you said you didnt know anything about it pitt reminded him croxdale brought his hands out of his pockets in the left one there was a small gun the light from the sitting room behind pitt gleamed on the metal of the barrel as croxdale raised it pitt swung round as if stoker were behind him just as stoker slammed into croxdale kicking high and hard at his left elbow the gun flew in the air pitt lunged for it just catching it as it arced over to his left croxdale swung round and grabbed at stoker twisting his arm and turning him so he halffell and croxdale had him in a stranglehold give me back the gun or ill break his neck croxdale said in a grating voice just a little highpitched pitt had no doubt whatever that he would do it the mask was off croxdale had nothing to lose pitt looked at stokers face which was already turning red as his neck was crushed by croxdales hold there was no choice stoker was still only half in front of croxdale but slipping forward and sideways a minute more and he would be unconscious and form a perfect shield pitt shot croxdale in the head making a single wound he was surprised how accurate he was not because of the distance which was short enough but because he had never shot a man to death before croxdale fell backwards stoker sprayed with blood staggered and collapsed onto the floor pitt dropped the gun and held out his hand hauling stoker to his feet again stoker looked at the gun leave it pitt said startled to find his voice almost level the minister shot himself when he realised we had proof of his treason we didnt know he had a gun so we werent able to prevent him from doing it now he was shaking and it took all his control to keep even reasonably steady what the hell did you think you were doing he snarled at stoker suddenly he would have killed you you fool stoker coughed and rubbed his hand over his throat i know that he said huskily just as well you shot him or id have been the one on the floor thank you sir pitt was about to tell stoker that he was incompetent to have allowed croxdale to grasp hold of him like that however with a shock like a physical blow he realised that stoker had done it on purpose risking his own life to force pitt to shoot croxdale he stared at him as if seeing him for the first time what could we have done with him sir stoker said pragmatically tie him up here for his servants to find and let go take him with us in a hansom cab or one of us stay and sit all right pitt cut him off now we have to get to the isle of wight and rescue the queen and narraway and lady vespasia and my wife his mind raced picturing the men he knew were going to be there violent fanatical men like portman gallagher haddon fenner and others with the same distorted idealism willing to kill and to die for the changes they believed would bring a new era of social justice then another idea came to him if he had austwick arrested where would he be taken to quickly austwick stoker did not understand yes where would he be now where does he live do you know how can we find out kensington sir not far from here stoker replied itd be the kensington police if croxdale really called anyone if he didnt we will pitt said now knowing exactly what he was going to do come on weve got to hurry we dont know who croxdale actually spoke to it wont have been the prime minister he started towards croxdales study sir stoker said bewildered pitt turned if one of the servants comes down tell him sir gerald shot himself do what you can to make it look right im going to call the kensington police in croxdales study there was no time to search he picked up the receiver and asked the operator to connect him as an emergency perhaps croxdale had done the same as soon as they answered he identified himself and said that there had been a practical joke suggested concerning mr austwick and arresting him it should be disregarded are you sure sir the man at the other end said doubtfully weve ad nothing ere mr austwick lives in your area pitt had a sudden sinking in the pit of his stomach oh yes sir then wed better make certain hes safe what is his address the man hesitated a moment then told him but well send men there ourselves sir if youll pardon me seein as ow i dont really know oo you are good do that pitt agreed well be there as soon as i can get a cab he replaced the receiver and went to find stoker the other man was waiting by the front door anxiously moving his weight from one foot to the other right find a hansom pitt told him well have to walk as far as the main road stoker warned opening the door and slipping out with immense relief they started striding along at as rapid a pace as possible without actually running it was still several minutes before they found a cab and gave austwicks address with orders to make the best speed possible what are we going to do with austwick sir stoker asked he had to raise his voice above the clatter of the hoofs and the rattle and hiss of wheels over the cobbles get him to help us pitt replied theyre his men down there hes the one person who might be able to call them off without an allout shooting battle we wont have achieved much in capturing them if they kill the queen in the process he did not mention narraway or vespasia or above all charlotte do you think hell do that stoker asked its up to us to persuade him pitt said grimly croxdales dead narraways alive i doubt the queen will sign anything that reduces the power or dignity of the crown even in fear of her life stoker did not reply but in the light of the next streetlamp they passed pitt saw that he was smiling when they reached austwicks house there were police outside it discreetly well in the shadows pitt identified himself showing them his new warrant card and stoker did the same yes sir the police sergeant said smartly how can we help sir pitt made an instant decision we are going to collect mr austwick and we are all going to travel to portsmouth as rapidly as possible the sergeant looked bemused use austwicks telephone hold the night train pitt told him its imperative we get to the isle of wight by morning the sergeant came to attention yes sir ill ill call immediately pitt smiled at him thank you then he nodded to stoker they went to the front door of austwicks house and knocked hard and continuously until a footman in his nightshirt opened it blinking and drawing in breath to demand an explanation pitt told him sharply to step back the man saw the police beyond pitt and stoker at his elbow and did as he was told ten minutes later austwick was in the hall hastily dressed unshaven and very angry what the hell is going on he said furiously do you know what time it is man pitt looked at the longcase clock at the far side of the hall coming up to quarter to two he answered and we must make portsmouth by dawn austwick paled visibly even in the dim light of the hall with its main chandelier unlit if anything could tell pitt that he knew of croxdales plan it was the fear in his face now croxdale is dead pitt said simply he shot himself when we faced him with his plans its all over narraways back hes at osborne now with the queen youve got two choices austwick we can arrest you now and youll be tried as a traitor youll hang and your family will never live it down your grandchildren if you have any will still carry the stigma of your name he saw austwicks horror but could not afford to pity him or you can come with us and call off your men from osborne he went on you have two minutes to choose do you wish to hang as a traitor or come with us to live or die as a hero austwick was too paralysed with fear to speak good pitt said decisively youre coming with us i thought youd do that were going for the night train to portsmouth hurry stoker grasped austwick by the arm holding him hard and they stumbled out into the night they halfheaved him into the waiting hansom then sat with one on either side of them two uniformed police followed in another cab ready to clear traffic if there should be any and confirm that the night train was held they raced through the streets in silence towards the railway station where they could catch the mail train to the coast pitt found his fists clenched and his whole body aching with the tension of not knowing whether the sergeant he had instructed had been able to hold the train there it can have taken only a telephone call from austwicks house to his own police station and then a call from there to the railway what if the stationmaster on night duty did not believe them or not realise the urgency of it what if he was simply incompetent for such a crisis they swayed and lurched along the allbutdeserted streets one moment he was desperate that they were going too slowly the next as they slewed around a corner that they were going too fast and would tip over at the station they leaped out pitt wildly overpaying the driver because he could not wait for change they ran into the station dragging austwick with them the sergeant showed his warrant card and shouted at the stationmaster to direct them to the train the man obeyed with haste but was clearly unhappy about it all he looked at austwicks ashen face and dragging feet with pity for a moment pitt feared he was going to intervene the train was waiting the engine belching steam a very impatient guard stood at the door of his van his whistle in one hand ready to raise to his lips pitt thanked the sergeant and his men happy to be able to give them some idea of how intensely grateful he was he made a mental note to commend the sergeant if they survived the night and if his own reputation was such that his appreciation was a blessing not a curse as soon as they were in the guards van the whistle blew the train lurched forward like a horse that had been straining at the bit the guard was a small neat man with bright blue eyes i hope all this is worth it he said looking at pitt dubiously youve a lot of explaining to do young man do you realise you have kept this train waiting ten minutes he glanced at his pocket watch and then replaced it eleven minutes he corrected himself this train carries the royal mail nobody holds us up not rain nor floods nor lightning storms and now we are standing around the platform for the likes of you thank you pitt said a little breathlessly the guard stared at him well nice manners are all very good but you cant hold up the royal mail you know while its in my care it belongs to the queen pitt drew in his breath to reply and then the irony of the situation struck him smiling he said nothing they went to the rear carriage and found seats stoker remained next to austwick as if he feared the man might make a run for it although there were nowhere for him to go pitt sat silently trying to make the best plans possible for when they arrived they would have to commandeer a boat any sort would do to get them across the narrow strip of water to the isle of wight he was still thinking of it when about fifteen minutes into the journey the train slowed then with a great panting of steam it stopped altogether pitt shot to his feet and went back to the guards van whats the matter he demanded why have we stopped where are we we stopped to put off the mail ocourse the guard said with elaborate patience thats what we came for now you just go an sit down in your seat and be quiet sir well be on our way when were ready how many places do you stop pitt asked his voice was louder and harsher that he meant it to be but it was sliding out of his control the guard stood very straight his face grim every place where weve got to pick up mail or set it down sir like i said thats what we do jus you go an sit back down sir pitt pulled out his warrant card and held it for the guard to see this is an emergency im on the queens business and i need to get to the isle of wight by sunrise drop off the mail on the way back or let the next train through pick it up the guard stared at pitt with both pride and disgust im on the queens business too sir i carry the royal mail youll get to portsmouth when weve done our job now like i said go an sit down an well get on with the mail yere just holding us up sir an i wont have that youve caused enough trouble already pitt felt exasperation well up inside him so he could almost have hit the man it was unfair the guard was doing his duty he had no idea who pitt was other than some kind of policeman could pitt tell him any part of the truth no he would find himself held in charge as a lunatic he could prove nothing and it would only delay them even more with a chill he remembered his helplessness on his last train ride the horror and absurdity of it and gowers mangled body on the tracks thank god at least he had not seen it he returned to the carriage and sat down in his seat sir stoker said we have to stop at all the stations pitt answered keeping his voice level this time without telling him the truth i cant persuade him not to he smiled lopsidedly its the royal mail nothing stands in its way stoker started to say something then changed his mind everything he meant to express was in the lines of his face pitt read it with ease the journey seemed achingly slow none of them spoke again until finally they pulled into portsmouth station as the dawn was lightening the eastern sky austwick caused no trouble as they went through the barely wakening streets and found a large rowing boat to take them across the water there was a brisk wind and the sea was choppy the wave caps translucent almost mirroring the high rippling clouds shot through by the rising wind it was hard work and they were obliged to bend their backs to make headway they landed shivering at the wharf and set off towards osborne house which was just in sight above the trees they walked as fast as they could since there was no one around from whom to beg or hire any kind of transport the sun was above the horizon and glittering sharp in a clear morning when they approached the boundaries the rolling parkland and the splendid stone mansion were spread before them broad and magnificent as if still sleeping in the hushed land which was silent but for the birdsong pitt had a moment of terrible doubt was this whole thing no more than a vast nightmare without reality at all had they misunderstood everything was he about to burst in on the queen and make the ultimate fool of himself stoker strode forward still gripping austwick by the arm nothing at osborne stirred surely there had to be a guard of some sort whatever the circumstances even if the entire conspiracy was a delusion of pitts mind as they reached the gate a man stepped forward he was in livery but it fitted him poorly he stood straight but not like a soldier there was an arrogance in his eyes you cant come in here he said curtly this is the queens house you can look of course but no further understand pitt knew his face he tried to remember his name but it eluded him he was so tired his vision swam a little he must stay alert keep his mind sharp his judgement steady he was a little behind austwick so pushed him hard in the small of the back its all right mcleish austwick said his voice shaky and a little rough these gentlemen are with me we need to come in mcleish hesitated quickly pitt added there are others behind us itll all be over in an hour or two right mcleish responded turning on his heel and leading the way ask about the queen pitt hissed at austwick dont slip up now hanging is not a nice way to die austwick stumbled stoker yanked him up austwick cleared his throat is her majesty still all right i mean i mean will she be able to sign papers of course mcleish answered cheerfully three people turned up unexpectedly we had no choice but to let them in or theyd have gone away and raised the alarm a man and two women but theyre no trouble its all going well they were nearly at the front doors austwick hesitated the sun was dazzling through a break in the trees there was no sign of life inside no sound but then the weight of the doors would have muffled anything someone must have been watching the door opened and a heavyset man stood barring the way a shotgun hanging on his arm austwick stepped forward his head high his voice cracked at first then gained strength good morning portman my name is charles austwick i represent gerald croxdale and the socialist people of britain about damn time you turned up portman said sharply have you got the documents were taking them to the queen pitt said quickly get everybody in its nearly over he tried to put some excitement in his voice portman smiled right yes he raised his arm with the gun in it giving a salute of victory stoker stepped forward and hit him as hard as he could with all the force of his weight he caught him in the vulnerable point of the solar plexus driving him backwards and inside portman doubled up in agony and the gun flew from his hand stoker spun round and picked it up austwick stood as if paralysed pitt started up the stairs as another man came out of the servants quarters with a gun at the ready narraway emerged onto the landing and struck the man at the top of the stairs sending him pitching forward and down his gun flying out of his grasp he landed at the bottom his neck broken the man in the hall raised his gun and aimed at pitt austwick stepped in front of him there was the roar of an explosion and austwick collapsed slowly crumpling to the ground in a sea of blood stoker shot the man with the gun narraway came down the stairs and picked up the gun from the man at the bottom there are five more he said calmly lets see if we can get them without any further bloodshed pitt looked at him narraway sounded totally in control but his face was haggard holloweyed there was a rough edge to his voice as if he held it level with an effort that cost him all he had pitt glanced at stoker who was now armed with the gun that had killed austwick yes sir stoker said obediently and set off towards the servants quarters narraway looked at pitt he smiled very slightly but there was a warmth in his eyes pitt had never seen before even in the best of their past triumphs would you like to go up and tell her majesty that order is restored he said there will be no papers to sign are you all right pitt asked suddenly he found he cared very much yes thank you narraway replied but this business is not quite finished yet is that charles austwick on the floor yes pitt answered i think it might be better all round if we say he died giving his life for his country he was the head of this goddamned conspiracy narraway said between his teeth actually he wasnt pitt told him croxdale was narraway looked startled are you sure absolutely he more or less admitted it where is he dead well say he took his own life pitt found he was shivering he tried to control it and couldnt but he didnt i shot him he had stoker by the neck he was going to break it pitt passed him on the stairs i see narraway said slowly he smiled with great sweetness croxdale underestimated you didnt he pitt found himself blushing embarrassed he turned and went on up the stairs at the top he crossed the landing and knocked on the door come a quiet voice commanded he turned the handle and went inside victoria was standing in the middle of the room charlotte to one side of her vespasia to the other as pitt looked at them the emotion welled up inside him until he felt the tears of relief prickle in his eyes his throat was so tight the words were difficult to say your majesty he cleared his throat i am pleased to inform you that osborne house is now back in the hands of those to whom it belongs there will be no further trouble but i would advise you to remain here until a little clearingup has been done vespasias face was radiant with relief all the past weariness slipping from her charlotte smiled at him too happy too proud even to speak thank you mr pitt victoria said a trifle hoarsely we are most obliged to you we shall not forget
