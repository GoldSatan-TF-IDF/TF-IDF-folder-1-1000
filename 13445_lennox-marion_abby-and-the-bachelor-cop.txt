and to all the maytoners whose friendships bring my stories to life to radar who was trouble i look back on every moment with laughter and with love chapter one if you couldnt be useful at the scene of an accident you should leave onlookers only caused trouble banksia bays animal welfare van had been hit from behind dogs were everywhere people were yelling at each other esther ford was having hysterics abigail callahan however had been travelling at a safe enough distance to avoid the crash shed managed to stop before her little red sports car hit anything and shed done all she could shed checked no one was hurt shed hugged esther shed tried to calm her down and shed phoned esthers son who she hoped might be better at coping with hysterics than she was shed carried someones crumpled fender to the side of the road shed even tried to catch a dog luckily shed failed she wasnt good with dogs now blessedly emergency services had arrived banksia bay emergency services took the shape of rafferty finn local cop so it was definitely time for abby to leave stay away from raff finn it wasnt past history making her go she was doing the right thing she tried to back her car so she could turn but the crowd of onlookers was blocking her way she touched her horn and raff glared at her how else could she make people move she did not need to be here she looked down at her briefcase and thought about the notes inside that she knew had to be in courtnow then she glanced back at raff and she thought she thought she thought rafferty finn looked toecurlingly sexy which was ridiculous abby had fallen for raff when she was eight it was more than time she was over it she was over it she was so over it she was engaged to be married to philip when raff had been ten years old which was when abby had developed her first crush on him hed been skinny freckled and his red hair had spiked straight up twenty years on skinny had given way to tall tanned and ripped his thick curls had darkened to burned copper and his freckles had merged to an allover tan his gorgeous green eyes with dangerous mischief lurking within had the capacity to make her catch her breath but right now it was his uniform that was causing problems his uniform was enough to make a girl go right back to feeling as she had at eight years old raff was directing drivers he was calm authoritative and far more sexy than any man had a right to be henrietta hold that dalmatian before it knocks mrs ford over roger quit yelling at mrs ford you drove into the dog van not mrs ford and it doesnt make a bit of difference that she was going too slow back your volvo up and get it off the road do not look at raff finn she told herself do not the man is trouble she turned and tried again to reverse her car why wouldnt people move someone was thumping on her window the door of her car swung open she swivelled and her heart did a back flip raff was standing over hersix foot two of lethal cop with dog i need your help abby he growled and before she could react there was a dog in her car on her knees i need you to take him to the vet raff said now the vet the local veterinary clinic was half a mile away on the outskirts of town but she wasnt given a chance to argue raff slammed her car door closed and started helping mrs ford steer to the kerb there was a dog on her knee abbys grandmother had once owned a shortbread tin adorned with a picture of a dog called greyfriars bobby according to legendor granbobby was famous for guarding his masters grave for almost fourteen years through the bleakest of edinburghs winters this dog looked his twin he was smallish but not a toy his coat was wiry and a bit scruffy sort of sandcoloured one of his ears was a bit floppy his eyebrows were too long did dogs have eyebrows he looked up at her as if he was just as stunned as she was what was wrong with him why did he need to go to the vet he wasnt bleeding she was due in court in ten minutes help what to do with a dog she put a hand on his head and gave him a tentative pat very tentative if she moved him maybe shed hurt him maybe hed hurt her he wiggled his head to the side and she tried scratching behind his ear that seemed to be appreciated his eyes were huge brown and limpid he had a raggedy tail and he gave it a tentative wag his eyes didnt leave hers his eyes werewere lets cut out the emotion here she told herself hastily this dog is nothing to do with you she fumbled under the dog for the door catch and climbed out of the car the dogs backside sort of slumped as she lifted him actually both ends slumped she carried him back to raff the little dog looked up at her and his tail still wagged it seemed a halfhearted wag as if he wasnt at all sure where he was but he sort of hoped things might be okay she felt exactly the same raff was back in the middle of the crashed cars raff i cant she called raff had given up trying to get mrs ford to steer he had hold of her steering wheel and was steering himself pushing at the same time moving the car to the kerb all by himself cant what he demanded i cant take this dog anywhere henrietta says its okay raff snapped its the only one shes caught shes trying to round up the others come on abby the roads clearhow hard is this just take him to the vet im due in court in ten minutes so am i raff shoved mrs fords car another few feet and then paused for breath if you think ive spent years getting wallace baxter behind bars just to see you and your prissy boyfriend get him off because i cant make it cut it out raff cut what out hes not prissy she snapped and hes not my boyfriend you know hes my fiancé your fiancé i stand corrected but hes definitely prissy ill bet hes sitting in court right now in his smart suit and silk tienot like me out here getting my hands dirty case for the prosecutionme and the time i can spare after work case for the defenceyou and philip and weeks of paid preparation two lawyers against one cop theres the crown prosecutor whos eighty who sleeps instead of listening thisll be a nobrainer even if you dont show he shoved the car a bit further but ill be there whether you like it or not meanwhile take the dog to the vets youre saying you want me to take the dog to the vetsto keep me out of court im saying take the dog to the vets because theres no one else he snapped your cars the only one still roadworthy ill radio justice weatherby to ask for a half hour delay thatll get us both there on time get to the vets and get back but i dont do dogs she wailed raff you dont want to get your suit dirty thats not fair this isnt about my suit or not very its just whats wrong with him i mean i cant look after him what if he bites raff sighed he wont bite he said speaking to her as if she were eight years old again hes a pussycat his names kleppy hes isaac abrahams cairn terrier and hes on his way to be put down put him on your passenger seat and fredll take him out at the other end all im asking you to do is deliver him it was twelve minutes to ten on a beautiful morning in banksia bay the sun was warm on her face the sea was glittering beyond the harbour and the mountain behind the town was blue with the haze of a still autumn morning the sounds of the traffic chaos were lessening as raffs attempts at restoring order took effect abby stood motionless her arms full of dog and raffs words replayed in her head hes isaac abrahams cairn terrier and hes on his way to be put down she knew isaac or rather shed known him the old man had lived a mile or so out of town up on black mountain wherewell where she didnt go any more isaac had died six weeks ago and she was handling probate isaacs daughter in sydney had been into the office a couple of times busy and efficient in her disposing of isaacs belongings thered been no talk of a dog can you get your car off the road raff said youre blocking traffic she was blocking traffic but she gazed around and realised she was somehow magically raff had every other car to the side of the road raff was like that he ordered and people obeyed there were a couple of tow trucks arriving but already cars could get through there was no problem all she had to do was get in the carwith dogand drive to the vets butto take a dog to be put down henrietta should do this she said looking round for the lady she knew ran the animal shelter but raff put his hands on his cop hips and she thought any minute now hed get ugly henrietta has a van full of dogs to find he snapped but she runs the animal shelter so so thats where he needs to go surely not to be put down raffs face hardened she knew that look life hadnt been easy for raffshe knew that too when he was up against itwell he did what he had to do abby i know this dogive known him for years he told her and his voice was suddenly bleak i took him to the animal shelter the night isaac died his daughter doesnt want him and neither does anyone else the only guy who loves him is isaacs gardener and lionel lives in a rooming house theres no way he can keep him the shelters full to bursting kleppys had six weeks and the shelter cant keep him any longer freds waiting the injection will be quick dont drag it out abby deliver the dog and ill see you in court but just do it and he turned his back on her and started directing tow trucks hed just given abigail callahan a dog and she looked totally flummoxed she looked adorable yeah well it was high time he stopped thinking abby was adorable as a teenager abby had seemed a piece of hima part of his wholebut shed watched him with condemnation for ten years now shed changed from the laughing kid she used to befrom his adoring shadowto someone he no longer liked very much hed killed her brother raff had finally come to terms with that longago tragedyor hed accepted it as much as he ever couldbut hed killed a part of her how did a man get past that it was time he accepted that he never could what sort of name was kleppy for a dog he shouldnt have told her its name only she would have figured it the dog had a blue plastic collar obviously standard animal welfare issue but whoever had attached it had reattached his tag as if they were leaving him a bit of personality to the end kleppy the name had been scratched by hand on the back of what looked like a medal abby set the dog on her passenger seathe wagged his tail again and turned round twice and settledand she couldnt help turning over his tag it was a medal she recognised it and stared old man abrahams had done something pretty impressive in the war shed heard rumours but shed never had confirmation this was more than confirmation a medal of honour an amazing medal of honourhanging on the collar of a scruffy homeless mutt called kleppy uhoh he was looking up at her again now his brown eyes were huge six weeks in the animal shelter shed gone there once on some sort of school excursion concrete cells with a tiny exercise yard too many dogs gazing up at her with hope she couldnt possibly match the people who run this do a wonderful job she remembered her teacher saying but they cant save every dog if you ask your parents for a pet for christmas you need to understand a dog can live for twenty years every dog deserves a loving home boys and girls shed been what thirteen she remembered looking at the dogs and starting to cry and she also remembered raffof course it was raffpatting her awkwardly on the shoulder hey its okay abby therell be a fairy godmother somewhere i reckon all these dogsll be claimed by tea time yeah probably by your grandmother someone had said not unkindly how many dogs do you have finn seven hed said and the welfare lady had pursed her lips see thats the problem she said no family should have more than two so you ought to bring five in someone else told raff and raff had gone quiet you ought to bring five in to be put down maybe that was what philip would think abby decided though she couldnt remember philip being there but even then philip had been a stickler for rules as were her parents we dont want an abandoned dog theyd said in horror that night all those years ago why would you want someone elses castoff she needed to remember her parents advice right now for isaac abrahams castoff was in her car wearing a medal of valour move the car abby raffs voice was inexorable she glanced up and he was filling her windscreen i dont want you dont always get what you want he growled i thought you were old enough to figure that out while youre figuring shift the car but or ill get you towed for obstructing traffic he snapped no choice lady move so all she had to do was take one dog to the vets and get herself to court how hard was that she drove and kleppy stayed motionless on the passenger seat and looked at her looking as if he trusted her with his life she felt sick this wasnt her responsibility kleppy belonged to an old guy whod died six weeks ago his daughter didnt want him no one else had claimed him so the sensible humane thing to do was have him put down but what if what if oh help what she thinking she was getting married on saturday week to philip nine days her tiny house was full of wedding presents her wedding gown was hanging in the hall a vision of beaded ivory satin shed made it herself every stitch she loved that dress this dog would walk past it and shed have dog hair on ivory silk well that was a dumb thing to think for this dog to walk past it hed have to be in her house and this dog was headed to the vets to be put down he looked up at her and whimpered his paw came out and touched her knee her heart turned over nooooo it took five minutes to drive to the vets kleppys paw rested against her knee the whole time she pulled up kleppy wasnt shaking she was fred came out to meet her the elderly vet looked grim he went straight to the passenger door tugged it open raff rang to say you were coming he said lifting kleppy out thanks for bringing him do you know when the rest are coming i henrietta was trying to catch them how many more than i want to think about fred said grimly three months from christmas puppies stop being cute not your call though ill deal with him from here kleppy lay limp in freds arms he looked back at her the paw on her knee help help help help itll be quick fred glanced at her brows snapping abby had gone to school with freds daughter he knew her well dont he said dont what think about it get on with your life nine days till the wedding iyes then youve enough on your plate without worrying about stray dogs not that you and philip would ever want a dog youre not dog people whatwhat do you mean dogs are mess he said not your style you guys might qualify for a goldfish see you later love happy wedding if i dont see you before he turned away she could no longer see kleppy she could feel him his eyes help help help help she was a goldfish person shed never even had a goldfish a paw on her knee he reached the door before she broke fred the vet turned kleppy was still slumped yes i cant bear this she said can youcan you take him in check him out for damage and then give him back to me give him back yes you want him hes my wedding present to me she knew she sounded defiant but she didnt care ive decided how hard can one dog be i can do this kleppy is mine fred did his best to dissuade her a dog is for life abigail small dogs like kleppy live for sixteen years or longer thats ten years at least of keeping this dog yes but ten years that was a fact to give her pause but the paw hes a mutt fred said mostly cairn but a bit of something else thats okay her voice was better she decided firmer if she was adopting a stray what use was a pedigree what will philip say philip will say im crazy but itll be fine she said stoutly though in truth she did have qualms is he okay fred was checking him even as he tried to dissuade her he seems shocked and hes much thinner than when isaac brought him in for his last vaccinations my guess is that hes barely eaten since the old man died isaac found him six years back as a pup dumped out in the bush there were a few problems but in the end they were pretty much inseparable inseparable the word suddenly pushed her back to the scene shed just left to raff once upon a time she and raff had been inseparable she thought and inexplicably there was a crazy twist of her heart inseparable this dog the paw he looks okay fred said feeding him a liver treat kleppy took it with dignified politeness just deflated from what lifes done to him so now what i take him home youll need food bedding a decent chain ill stop at the pet store tell me what to get but fred was glancing at his watch looking anxious im urgently needed at a calving tell you what youll be seeing raff again in court raffll tell you what you need how did you know everyone knows everything in banksia bay fred said i know where youre supposed to be right now i know raffs had the case set back half an hour and i hear judge weatherbys not happy hes fed up with raff though not you so chances are youll get baxter off which no one in banksia bay will be happy about but hey if your fees go toward buying dog food then who am i to argue get baxter off then talk to raff about dog food he gets a discount at the stock and station store why because raff has one pony two dogs three cats two rabbits and at last count eighteen guinea pigs fred said handing her kleppy and starting to clear up his place is a menagerie its a wonder he didnt take this one but i guess even raff has limits he has a lot on his plate see you later love happy wedding and happy new dog chapter two she couldnt go to the stock and station store now thatd have to wait until shed talked to raff still kleppy obviously needed something what best guess she stopped at the supermarket and bought a water bowl a nice red lead with pictures of balls on it and a marrowbone she drove to the courthouse and kleppy lay on the passenger seat and looked anxious his tail had stopped wagging hey i saved you she told him look happy he obviously didnt get the word saved he sort ofhunched what was she going to do with him while she was in court she drove her car into her personal parking space how neat was this she remembered the day her name had gone up her parents had cracked champagne it was a fine car park butit was in full sun she might not be a dog person but she wasnt dumb she couldnt leave kleppy here nor could she take him homeor not yetnot until shed done something about dogproofing her parents ha theyd take him right back to fred so she drove two blocks to the local park there were shade trees here and she could tie him by her car anyone passing would know he hadnt been abandoned she hoped kleppy would know it too she gave him water and his bone and he slumped on the ground and looked miserable maybe he didnt know it she looked at him and sighed she took off her jackether lovely tailored jacket that matched her skirt exactlyand she laid it beside kleppy he sniffed it the paw came out againand he inched forward on his belly until it was under him her very expensive jacket was on dirt and grass and under dog her professional jacket she didnt actually like that jacket anyway she preferred less serious clothes she was five foot four and a bitmousy but maybe lawyers should be mousy her shiny brown hair curled happily when she let it hang to her shoulders but philip liked it in a chignon she had freckles but philip liked her to wear foundation that disguised them she had a neat figure that looked good in a suit professional lawyers should be professional shed given up on professional this morning she was so late oh but kleppy looked sad ill be back at midday she told him two hours tops promise then well work out where we go from here where shed think of something she must maybe raff there was a thought fred had said raff had a menagerie what difference would one dog make once upon a time hed had seven instead of advice maybe she could persuade him to take him youd like rafferty finn she told kleppy hes basically a good man good but flawedtroublebut she didnt need to go into that with kleppy but how to talk him into it or philip into the alternative it was too hard to think of that right now she grabbed her briefcase and headed to the courthouse without looking back or without looking back more than half a dozen times kleppy watched her until she was out of sight heart twist she didnt want to leave him it couldnt matter her work was in front of her and what was more important than work what was facing her was the case of the crown versus wallace baxter wallace was one of three banksia bay accountants the other two made modest incomes wallace however had the biggest house in banksia bay the baxter kids went to the best private school in sydney sylvia baxter drove a mercedes coupé and they skied in aspen twice a year they owned a lodge there lucky investments wallace always said but after years of juggling his web of dealings had turned into one appalling tangle wallace himself wasnt sufferinghis house cars even the ski lodge in aspen were all in his wifes namebut there were scores of banksia bays retirees who were suffering a lot its just the financial crisis wallace had said as philip and abby had gone over his case notes i cant be responsible for the failure of overseas banks just because im global because he was global his financial dealings were hard to track this was a small case by national standards the crown prosecutor who covered banksia bay should have retired years ago the case against wallace had been left pretty much to raff who had few resources and less time so raff was right philip and abby had every chance of getting their client off philip rose to meet her looking relieved the documents they needed were in her briefcase he kept the bulk of the confidential files but it was her job to bring day to day stuff to court what the did raff tell you what happened philip cast raff a look of irritation across the court there was no love lost between these two menthere never had been he said you had to take a dog to the vet to get it put down isnt that his job he had cars to move he got here before you what kept you and wheres your jacket it got dog hair on it that at least was true can we get on itd be appreciated the judge said dryly from the bench so she sat and watched as philip decimated the crowns case maybe his irritation gave him an edge this morning she thought he was smooth intelligent insightfulthe best lawyer she knew hed do magnificently in the city that hed returned home to banksia bayto herseemed incredible her parents thought so they loved him to bits what was more philips father had been her brother bens godfather they were almost family already he almost makes up for our ben her mother said over and over and their engagement had been a foregone conclusion that made everyone happy except except dont go there she generally didnt it was only in the small hours when she woke and thought of philips dry kisses and thought why dont i feelwhy dont i feel like she did when she looked at rafferty finn no this was prewedding nerves she had no business thinking like that if she so much as looked at raff in that way itd break her parents hearts so no and no and no raff was on the stand now steady and sure giving his evidence with solid backup his investigation stretched over years with so many pointers but all of those pointers were circumstantial she suspected there were things in philips briefcase that might not be circumstantial umdont go there there was such a thing as lawyerclient confidentiality even if baxter admitted dishonesty to them outrightwhich he hadntthey couldnt use it against him so raff didnt have the answers to philips questions the crown prosecutor didnt ask the right questions of baxter itd take a few days maybe more but even by lunch time no one doubted the outcome at twelve the court rose the courtroom emptied you might like to go home and get another jacket philip said im taking wallace to lunch she wasnt up to explaining about kleppy right now where to start but she surely didnt want to have lunch with wallace acting for the guy made her feel dirty go ahead she said philip left escorting a smug wallace she felt an almost irresistible urge to talk to the crown prosecutor tell him to push harder it was only suspicion she had no proof thanks for taking kleppy raff was right behind her and made her jump her heart did the same stupid skittering thing it had done for years whenever she heard his voice she turned to face him and he was smiling at her looking rueful sorry abby that was a hard thing to ask you to do this morning but i had no choice putting kleppy down a hard thing it was too hard she whispered the crown prosecutor was leaving for lunch if she wanted to talk to him she was lawyer for the defence what was she thinking hey but youre tough raff motioned to the back of the courtroom where bert and gwen mackervale were shuffling out to find somewhere to eat their packed sandwiches not like the mackervales theyre as soft a touch as any ive seen they lost their house yet youll get wallace off raff this is inappropriate im a defence lawyer you know its what i do you dont have to youre better than this abby no im not yeah well he shrugged im going to find me a hamburger see you later uhoh maybe she shouldnt have snapped definitely she shouldnt have snapped not when there was such a big favour to ask how to ask just ask you couldnt cope with another dog could you she managed and he stilled another i couldnt she whispered i cant hes still alive raff hehe looked at me he looked at you raff was looking at her as if shed just landed from mars i couldnt get him put down raff was carrying papers he placed them on the nearest bench without breaking his gaze he stared at her for a full minute she didnt stare back she stared at her shoes instead they were nice black shoes maybe a bit high pert she thought pert was good there was a smudge on one toe she considered bending to wipe it and decided against it still silence youre keeping kleppy he said at last she shook her head imi dont think its possible im asking if you could take him fred says you have a menagerie one more wouldntwouldnt be much more trouble i could pay you for his keep fred suggested he sounded flabbergasted he didnt she admitted i thought of it myself that id take kleppy yes she whispered and she thought that she sounded about eight years old again she sounded pathetic no he said she looked up at him then raff finn was a good six inches taller than she was more he was a bit too big he was a bit too male he was a bit tooraff he was also a bit too angry nno no his expression was a mixture of incredulity and fury i dont believe this you strung out a dogs life in the hope id take him no i do you know how miserable he is thats why i decided to give him to me thanks abby but no but im not a soft option you have all those animals because sarah loves them do you know how much they cost to feed i cant go away i cant do anything because sarah breaks her heart over each and every one of them dont you dare do this to me abby im not your soft option if you saved kleppy then hes yours i cant and neither can i you brought this on yourself you deal with it yourself his voice was rough as gravel his anger palpable i need to go i didnt get breakfast and i dont intend to miss lunch ill see you back in court at one he turned away he strode to the court door and she chewed her lip and thought but then she decided there wasnt time for thinking she panicked instead raff he stopped not looking back what sometimes only an apology would do she was smart enough to know that this was one of those times maybe a little backtracking wouldnt hurt either raff im very sorry she said it was just a thoughtor maybe it was just a wild hopebut the decision to save kleppy was mine asking you was an easy option and i wont ask again but moving on if im to keep him i know nothing about dogs fred didnt suggest you take him but he did suggest i ask you for help he said youll tell me all the things i need to care for him so please please what just tell me what i need to buy at the stock and station store i have a meeting with the wedding caterers after work so i need to do my shopping now youre seriously thinking youll keep him i dont have a choice he was facing her now his face a mixture of incredulity andlaughter where had laughter come from youre keeping kleppy he said it as if shed chosen kleppy above all others theres no other dogs out there she said alarmed and he grinned his grin lit his facelit the whole court oh she knew that grin trouble tragedy theres thousands of dogs he said so many needing homes but you have to fall for kleppy whats wrong with kleppy nothing he was still grinning i take it you havent told philip i no so wheres kleppy now his grin faded you havent left him in the car the sun i know that much she said indignant i took the car to the park and i tied him to a nice shady tree he has water and feed he even has my jacket he has your jacket he sounded bemused as if there was some private joke she wasnt privy to yes and youve tied him uphow i bought a lead please tell me its a chain the chains looked cruel its webbing pretty red with pictures of balls on it i dont believe this whats wrong but she didnt have a chance to answer instead he grabbed her hand towed her out of the courthousepractically at a runand he headed for the park dragging her behind him kleppy was gone her pretty red lead was chewed into two piecesor at least she assumed it was chewed into two pieces one piece was still tied to the tree her jacket lay on the ground rumpled the water bowl was half empty apparently chewing leads was thirsty work the marrowbone wasnt touched no dog he doesnt like being confined our kleppy raff said taking in the scene with professional care you know this how hed chewed through a lead its always been a problem im guessing hell make tracks up to the abrahams place but who knows where hell end up in the meantime hell be up at isaacs isaac lived halfway up the mountain at the back of the town raff was looking concerned it is a bit far he admitted and from here itll be off his chosen beat he raked his hair of all the stupid i dont have time to go look for a dog ill look for him you know where to look do you backyards he said never takes the fastest route our kleppy he raked his hair again looking tired i need lunch if im not back in court at one then baxterll definitely get off you need to do this abby i cant look for a dog all afternoon philipll kill me then i guess the weddingll be off is that a good thing raff spoke absently as if it didnt bother him if her wedding was at risk as indeed it didnt what business was it of his to care about the wedding what business was it of his to even comment on it she opened her mouth to say so but suddenly his gaze focused sharpened is that she turned to see it wasand the change was extraordinary when shed left him two hours ago kleppy had looked defeated and depressed when hed crawled onto her jacket he hadnt had the energy to even rise off his stomach now he was prancing across the park towards them looking practically jaunty his rough coat was never going to be pretty one of his ears flopped down almost covering his eye his tail was a bit ragged but they could see his tail wagging when he was still a hundred yards away and as he got closer he had something in his mouth something pink and lacy what the its a bra abby breathed as the little dog reached them she bent down and the dog circled her twice then came to her outstretched hand he rubbed himself against her leg and his whole body shivered with delight he was carrying the bra like a trophy she touched it and he dropped it into her hand then stood back as if hed just presented her with a cheque for a million dollars his body language was unmistakable look what ive found for you arent i the cleverest dog in the world she dropped the bra and picked him up hugging him close he wriggled frantically and she put him back down he picked up the bra again placed it back in her hand and then allowed her to pick him upas long as she kept the bra his meaning couldnt be plainer ive brought you a gift you appreciate it youve brought me a bra she managed and she felt like crying oh kleppy it could just as easily have been mens jocks raff said he lifted the end of the bra that was hanging loose there was a price tag attached i thought so hes a bit small to rob clothes lines our kleppy this has come from main street morrisy drapers are having a sale this will have come from the discount bin at the front of the store had it she checked it out cop and lawyer for the defence standing in the sun examining evidence pink bra nylon white and silver frills about an e plus cup room for about three of abby veryvery useful abby managed youll need to pay for it sorry its theft raff said touching the bras middle with a certain degree of caution it was looking a bit soggy he never hurts anything he hunts treasures he never destroys them but they do get a bitwet taking it back and apologisings not going to cut it will they know hes stolen it hes not a cat burglar raff said gravely though the sides of his mouth were twitching dog burglars dont have the same finesse hes a snatch and grab man our kleppy therell be a dozen people on main street wholl be able to identify him in a line up oh my and then she paused kleppy kleppy was a strange name but shed hardly had time to think about it now kleppy oh raff looked like a man starting to enjoy himself got it he said grinning and theres another reason youre not offloading this mutt onto me this is a dog who lives to present his master with surprises no dead rats or old bones for his guy it has to be interesting expensive is good one of a sets his favourite isaac gave up on him long sincehe just paid for the damage and got on with it so now heres kleppy deciding youre his new owner welcome to dog ownership abigail callahan youre the proud owner of banksia bays biggest kleptomaniacand also the littlest a kleptomaniac kleppy she stared at raff as if he was out of his mind he gazed back lips twitching that dangerous smile lurking deep within she was about to present her fiancé with a kleptomaniac dog i dont believe it she managed at last theres no such thing you want to know how i know this dog he wasnt even trying to disguise his grin id like to say im personally acquainted with every dog in banksia bay but even with sarahs help i cant manage that nope im acquainted with kleppy because ive arrested him arrested ive caught him redhandedor redpawedon any number of occasions the problem is that he doesnt know how to hide it like now he steals and then he shows off i dont believe it youve already said that but thats why no one wants him he said humour fading hes always been a problem henriettas had to be honest with everyone who came to the shelter looking for the ideal pet he isnt ideal isaac paid out on kleppys behalf more times than i can say hes hidden stuff and hes been accused of stealing himself isaac never cared what people thought of him which was just as well as theres been more womens underwear end up at his house than you can imagine he burned most of itwhat choice did he have can you imagine wandering the town saying who owns this gstring but he loved kleppy you see the smile returned like you will i this is appalling i told you to get him put down you know im a soft option anger hit then fury pure and simple you know me raff finn you put this dog in my car because you knew i wouldnt be able to have him put down you know im a soft touch now how would i know that he said softly i havent known you for a very long time abby youve grown up youve got yourself engaged to philip the abby i knew could no sooner have married philip than fly youre a lawyer engaged in getting wallace baxter off a lawyer doing cases like thatof course you can get a dog put down his gaze met hers direct challenging knowing he was calling a bluff she couldnt possibly meet you still can he told her put kleppy in the car and take him back to fred youve made his last hours happy by giving him the freedom for one last hoist hell die a happy dog you still can say something she couldnt think of a thing to say she was hugging kleppy who had a pink bra somehow looped around his ears she still hugged kleppy what raff was saying was sensible very sensible there were too many dogs in the world shed done her best by this one shed let him have a happy morningif indeed raff was right and kleppy did enjoy stealing but he was certainly a happier dog now than hed been when shed first met him he was warm and nuzzly he was poking his damp nose against her neck giving her a tentative lick his backside was wriggling take him back to fred no way shed always wanted a dog philip would hate a dog her marriage suddenly loomed before her loomed wrong word but she couldnt think of another one philip was wonderful he was her rock hed looked after her and her family for ever when ben had died hed held her up when her world seemed to be disintegrating philip was right for her her parents loved him everyone thought philip was wonderful if she hadnt married him she hadnt married him she reminded herself not yet that was the point in nine days shed be married shed move into the fabulous house philip had bought for them and shed be philips wife philips wife would never bring home a kleptomaniac dog shed never bring home any sort of dog so if she wanted one she took a deep breath and she knew exactly what shed do her last stand like it or leave it she thought and she sounded desperate even to herself but she had made up her mind im keeping him good for you raff said and the twinkle was back with a vengeance can i be there when you tell philip get lost thats not kind not when you need help to buy what kleppy needs im starting to get a very good idea of what kleppy needs she said darkly an eightfoot fence and a sixfoot chain hell mope then hell have to learn not to mope its that or dead youll explain that to him how youre not being helpful no he said and glanced at his watch im not i need a hamburger and times running out before court resumes you want a list no i mean the afternoon suddenly stretched before her long and lonely or not long and lonely for her long and lonely for the little dog squirming in her arms her thief i do need a list i also need a chain she hesitated but i cant leave him here this morning was only two hours this afternoons four at least before i can collect him so take him home i cant it was practically a wail she caught herself fought for a little dignity i meanits not dogproof i need an hour or so there to get things organised thats fair enough he paused surveyed her face and then decided to be helpful you want me to ask sarah to help sarah her eyes widened of course sarah loved dogs and maybe her first suggestion was still possible maybe no raff said before she opened her mouth sarahs not taking ownership of another dog and if you ask her ill personally run you out of town i mean that abby i wouldnt ask her no she managed a twisted smile abandoning her last forlorn hope no good then he said briskly moving on but shell enjoy taking care of him this afternoon kleppyll be tired after his excursion we have a safe yard the other dogs are quietthey wont overwhelm himand you can come by this evening and pick him up go back to raffs she couldnt imagine doing that but raff was moving on its a good offer raff said take it or leave it but do it now if you accept then ill lock this convicted thief in my patrol car and take him out to sarah i may even do it with lights and sirens if it means getting back to court on time you can take my list and go buy what you need and get back to court on time as well or i leave you to it whats it to be abby i she was starting to panic go out to raffs tonight to raffs she hadnt been there since unless you have another friend you can call on he suggested and maybe her emotions were on her face definitely her emotions were on her face all my friends work she wailed then its sarah tonight and you will collect him that irrepressible grin emerged again hey you have a dog what a wedding gift to you and to philip one kleptomaniac dog happy wedding he drove out to sarah with kleppy beside him and he found the smile inside him growing somewhere inside the abby hed once known and loved was still there once upon a time shed loved him that had been years ago a teenage romance yes theyd felt as if they were truly madly deeply but they were only kids at nineteen hed headed off to sydney to police training college abby had been stuck in banksia bay until she finished school and shed needed a partner for her debutante ball he still remembered the arguments youre my boyfriend how can i have anyone else as my partner why cant you come home more often so we can practice and more you and ben are totally obsessed with that car every time you come home thats all you ever think about they were kids he hadnt seen her need and she hadnt seen his philip had been home from university hed agreed to partner her for her ball and raff was given the cold shoulder theyd been kids moving on changing they had changed he conceded only just now hed seen a glimpse that the old abby was still in there feisty and funny and gorgeous but stillunforgiving and who could blame her hed forgiven himself he didnt need abigail callahans forgiveness he couldnt need it if only she wasnt adorable chapter three the afternoon was interminable the case was boringfinancial evidence that was as dry as dust the courtroom was as dry as dust she couldnt think of a way to tell philip all afternoon she was aware of raff on the opposite side of the courtroom he was here this afternoon to present the police case thankfully he wouldnt be here for the rest of the week he was called away twice for which she was also thankful but he wasnt called away for long enough he was watching her he was waiting for her to tell philip he was laughing at her she knew he was the man spelled trouble and hed just got her into more trouble one small dog easily contained in a secure backyard how hard could this be so tell philip there was lots of time the police case went on for most of the afternoontedious financial details she and philip both knew it back to front there were gaps while documents were given to the jury she had time to tell him philip would be civilised about it hed never raise his voice to her especially not in a courtroom but still she couldnt across the court raff still watched her finally the court rose raff crossed the courtroom and abby panicked dont say anything you guys okay he asked and anyone who didnt know him would think it was simply a courtesy question they wouldnt see that lurking laughter trouble why wouldnt we be philip demanded irritated he disliked raffof course he did he showed no outright aggressionsimply cool professional interaction and nothing more its getting close to your wedding raff said no last minute nerves no last minute hitches we need to go abby said feeling close to hysterics i have a meeting with the caterers in half an hour i bet theres lots of stuff you need to do raffs voice was sympathy itself messy things weddings not ours philip snapped everythings under control isnt that right sweetheart iyes just go away raff get out of our lives are you coming to the caterers with me philip i cant philip turned a shoulder on raff excluding him completely my dad and my uncles are taking me out to dinner and bowling a boys only night i thought i told you he had that sounds exciting raff said mildly interested bowling huh i guess i wont be untying you naked from in front of the country womens association clubrooms at dawn then my friends dont do wild bucks nights raff said approvingly i guessed that youll probably be home in bed by eight so youre alone tonight abby organising caterers on your lonesome and anything else you need to do could you please she started and then stopped the impossibility of asking another favourasking him to bring kleppy homeoverwhelming her nope raff said not if youre about to ask me anything that involves the wedding me and weddings keep far away from each other were not asking you to be involved philip snapped abby can cope with the caterers herself ready to go sweetheart yes she managed and allowed philip to usher her out of the court she should have told philip then she had ten minutes while philip went over the results of the day what they needed to do to strengthen their case the next morning a few wedding details hed forgotten to cover philip was a man at ease with himself it was only when raff was around that he got prickly and maybewell that did have to do with their past raff had messed with philips life as well as hers philip was a good man he was looking forward to his wedding his father and his uncles were taking him out for a prewedding night with the boys and hed enjoy it she didnt want to mess with that until she must even if it did mean delaying telling him about kleppy even if it meant going to raffs alone maybe itd be better going alone going with philip it could make things worse come round tonight after bowling she told him kissing him lightly on the lips her fiancé her husband in nine days she loved him and if he was a bit dull hed had his days of being wild they all had before life had taught them that caution was good we should get a good nights sleep he said yes but there are things we need to discuss hed like kleppy when he saw him she decided kleppy of the limpid eyes wide and brown and innocent she should change his name to rover rover was a philipish name for a dog but kleppy suited him what do we need to discuss he was asking say it no introduce him to kleppy as a done deal justcaterers and things i dont want to make too many decisions on my own he smiled and kissed her and she had to stop herself from thinking dry and dusty you need to have more selfconfidence make your own decisions youre a big girl now iyes anything you decide is fine by me but you will drop by ill drop by night sweetheart and off he went for his night with the boys his dad and his uncles bowling yeeha and that was the type of thinking that was getting her into trouble she decided so cut it out philip was a lovely man he was handsome he was beautifully groomed theyd had a very nice holiday last yeartheyd gone to italy and philip had had four suits made there they were lovely suits hed also had two briefcases madematching ones magnificent leather discreetly initialled and fitted out to philips specifications shed only been mildly irritated when hed decreedfor the sake of the briefcasesher surname would be his what was the issue after all she was to be his wife but buying suits and briefcases had taken almost half of their holiday cut it out it was just raff had unsettled her this whole day had unsettled her so go home and organise your house for one small dog then go organise caterers she told herself oh and pay for kleppys stolen goods just do what has to be done one step at a time and then go out to raffs aargh she could do this she could visit rafferty finn she could do it one step at a time the rest of the afternoon was full but abby and her dog were front and centre of his thoughts he shouldnt have offered to bring kleppy home not this afternoon not ever he didnt want her coming here after dinner raff washed and sarah wiped while sarah told him about her day the highlight of which had been minding kleppy hes a sweetheart his sister told him her face softening at the thought of the little dog hes so cuddly why does he love his bra hes a thief he likes stealing things hes a bad dog he found himself smiling at the thought of straitlaced abigail callahan having to front up and pay for stolen goods maybe it wasnt a good idea to keep thinking of abby not like this she was philips fiancée anything between them was a distant memory it had to be but sarah was looking doubtful she looked down at kleppy snoozing by the fire his bra tucked underneath him he doesnt look bad hes really cute and abbys very busy are you sure abby wants him raff hardened his heart im sure and abbys coming tonight yes abbys my friend she was the tension of the day lessened a little at that no matter what lay between raff and abby no matter how much she hated seeing him abby had always been sarahs friend theyd all been best friends at the time of the accident ben and raff abby and sarah two big brothers two little sisters philip had been in there too a gang of five but one car crash and friendship had been blown to bits in the months that followed no matter that abby had loathed raff so much that seeing him made her cry shed stuck by sarah shed visited her in sydney despite her parents disapproval taking the train week after week to sydney central hospital and then later to the rehabilitation unit on north shore back home sarahs friends had fallen away acquired brain injury was a hard thing for friends to handle sarah was still sarah and yet not shed struggled with everythingrelearning speaking walking the simplest of survival skills theyd come so far she could now almost live independentlyalmost but not quite she had her animals and their little farm raff kept for her she worked in the local sheltered workshop three days a week and twice a week abby met her after work for drinks drinks being milkshakes two friends catching up on their news raff would pick sarah up and shed be happy bubbly about going out with her friendbut abby would always have slipped away from the café just before raff was due since the accident abby had never come back to their farm shed never talked to raff unless she absolutely must but shed never taken that anger out on sarah im glad abbys coming tonight sarah said simply and im glad shes getting a dog abbys lonely lonely sarah rarely had insights this one was startling no shes not shes getting married to philip i dont like philip sarah said that was unusual too sarah liked everyone when philip met heras of course he did because this wasnt a big townhe was unfailingly friendly but still in the times when raff had been with her and theyd met philip sarahs hand had crept to his and shed clung was that from memories of the accident the accident dont go there theres nothing wrong with philip he told sarah i want abby to come sarah said wiping her last pot with a fierceness unusual for her but i dont want philip he makes me scared scared the mans boring raff said theres nothing to be scared about i just dont like him sarah said and logical or not raff felt exactly the same she didnt want to go she must she gazed round her little house with a carefully appraising eye shed hung her wedding dress in the spare room and shed packed away everything else she thought a dog might hurt shed bought a dog kennel for outside and a basket for inside shed bought a chain for emergencies but she didnt intend using it her back garden was enclosed with a fourfoot brick fence and shed checked and rechecked for gaps she had dog food dog shampoo flea powder worm pills a dog brush padding for his kennel and a book on training your dog shed had a quick browse through the book there was nothing about kleptomania but confinement would fix that shed take him for a long walk every day kleppy might sometimes be lonely she conceded but surely loneliness was better than the fate that had been waiting for him and if he was lonely she might sneak him into the office occasionally that though was for the future for now she was ready to fetch him from raff so fetch him theres not a lot of use staring at preparations she told herself its time to go claim your dog it was eight oclock philips night out would be over by ten and she had to be back here by then of course shed be back ten minutes drive out two minutes to collect kleppy and say hi to sarah ten minutes back just go she hadnt been out there since just go when will she be here any time soon he shouldnt care he shouldnt even be here there was bound to be something coplike that needed his attention at the stationonly that might look like he was running and rafferty finn wasnt a man who ran she never comes here she likes going to cafés with you too much sarah giggled hugging kleppy close this place was pretty relaxed for a dog the screen door stayed permanently open and the dogs wandered in and out at will the gate to the back garden was closed but kleppy seemed content to be hugged by sarah to watch television and to occasionally eat popcorn raff watched television too or sort of it was hard to watch when every sense was tuned to a car arriving the finn place hadnt changed the moon was full but she hardly needed to see shed come here so often to the base of black mountain that she knew every bend as kids she and ben had ridden their bikes here almost every day this had been their magic place her parents had disapproved the finns her mother had told them over and over are not our sort of people by that she meant they didnt fit into her social mould abby and ben didnt care old mrs finneverybody called her granhad been the familys stability grans husband had died long before abby had known her and it was rumoured that his death had been a relief for the town as well as for gran after his death gran had quietly got on with life she ran a few sheep a few pigs a lot of poultry her garden was amazing she seemed to spend her life in the kitchen and her baking was wonderful abby barely remembered raff and sarahs mother but there had been disapproving whispers about her as well shed run away from home at fifteen then come home unwed with two small children shed worked in the local supermarket for a time abby had vague memories of a silent woman with haunted eyes with none of the life and laughter of her mother or her children shed died when abby was about seven abby remembered little fuss just a family whod got on with it gran had taken over her grandchildrens care life had gone on and the finns were still disapproved of abby and ben had loved it here they had always been welcome and now she turned into the drive but her foot eased from the accelerator youre always welcome she could remember gran saying it to her over and over she remembered gran saying it to her after bens death as if she could come back here she had come back tonight this is only about a dog she told herself breathing deeply nothing else the past is gone theres no use regrettingno use even thinking about it go get your dog from raff finn and then get off his land raff never meant i know he didnt she told herself of course he didnt accidents happened and it was only stupidity could she forgive stupidity ben was dead why would she want to he saw her stop at the gate it was after eightwould philip have finished his wild night out would she have him with her maybe that was why theyd stopped philip would be doing his utmost to stop her keeping kleppy would she defy him shed need strength if she was going to stay married to philip shed need strength not to be philips doormat but the thought of abby as a doormat made him smile shed never been a doormat abby callahan was smart sexy sassyand so much more orshe had been shed followed him round like a shadow for years he and ben had scoffed at abby and sarah the little sisters theyd teased them and had given them such a hard time theyd loved them both until until one stupid night one stupid moment he closed his eyes as hed done so many times searching for a memory summer nineteen years old home from police training college ben home from university theyd spent weekend after weekend tinkering with a car they were trying to restore finally theyd got it started towards dusk on the day they were both due to go back to the city they were pumped with excitement aching to see it go they couldnt take it on the roadit wasnt registeredbut up on black mountain just behind isaac abrahams place there was a cleared firebreak smoothed for access for fire trucks if they could get it out there they could put it through its paces he remembered loading the car on the trailer behind grans ancient truck bens dad watching them in disapproval you should be home tonight ben your mothers expecting you we need to see this working ben had told him and mr callahan had left in a huff sarah was watching them wistful can i come theres not enough room in the truck what if philip brings me sure bring abby you know abbys mad at youand shes not talking to philip either but neither ben nor raff were interested they were only interested in getting their car going and it worked up on the mountain he remembered ben driving yahooing both of them high as kites months of work paying off he remembered getting out swapping drivers thinking it was too dark to be on this track and it was starting to rain plus ben had to get back to have dinner with his parents but ben saying we have lights if i can cope with mum being fed up you can cope with a bit of rain just do one turn to see for yourself how well she handles thennothing hed woken in hospital concussion multiple lacerations broken wrist and broken ankle all he knew of the accident was what was written in the official reports philip had driven sarah onto the track to find them hed turned off the main road onto the firebreak and ventured just far enough down the break to reach the crest philip had been the only one uninjured his recall was perfect stark and bleak raff had burst over the crest on the wrong side of the road driving so fast he was almost airborne philip had nowhere to go both drivers swerved but not fast enough both cars had ended up in the trees the rain and the mess from the emergency vehicles had washed the tracks away before the authorities could corroborate philips story raff couldnt be prosecutedbut he had punishment enough hed killed his best mate and hed destroyed his sister he missed ben like hed miss a twinan aching gutdestroying loss hed lost a part of sarah that could never be restored his grandmother had died six months later and abby facing abby had been the hardest thing hed had to do in his life the first time hed seen hershed looked at him and it was as if he was some sort of black hole where her heart used to be im sorry hed said and shed simply turned away shed stayed away for ten years her brother was dead and sometimes raff wished it could have been him which was dumb whod take care of sarah then let it go go greet abby and philip abby and philip banksia bays perfect couple chapter four raff was waiting on the veranda and abby felt her breath catch in her throat she came close to heading straight back down the mountain what was it with this man she was well over her childhood crush shed decided today that it was the uniform making him sexy but he wasnt wearing a uniform now he was in faded jeans and an old tshirt stretched a bit tight he looked good enough to to get away from fast he was leaning idly against the veranda post big looselimbed absurdly goodlooking he was standing with crossed arms watching her walk towards him simply watching his eyes said caution she didnt need the message caution she had it in spades wheres kleppy she asked and she knew she sounded snappy but there wasnt a thing she could do about it phils still on his wild night out cut it out raff sorry he said then he hesitated and his eyes narrowed nope come to think of it im not sorry why are you marrying that stuffed shirt dont be insulting hes wealthy raff conceded parents own half banksia bay hes making a nice little income himself or a big income hes already bought the dream home hes starting to look almost as wealthy as baxter you guys will be set for life stop it she snapped just because hes a responsible citizen im responsible now maybe even more responsible than you what have you got on baxter that i dont know about you think philip and i would ever do anything illegal maybe not you philip though i dont believe this of all the i could sue give me my dog sarah has your dog he said and stood aside giving her no choice but to enter a house shed vowed never to set foot in again he was standing on the top step of the veranda he didnt move she would not let him make her feel like this like shed felt as a kid but her arm brushed his as she passed him so slightly that with anyone else she wouldnt have noticed she noticed her arm jerked as if shed been burned she glowered and stomped past and still he didnt move she pushed the screen door wide and let it bang behind her she always had it banged like it always banged and she got the same effect from the depths of the house came the sound of hysterical barking she braced when shed been a kid and shed come here the finns dog pack would knock her over shed loved it shed be lying in the hall being licked all over squirming and wriggling a tadpole in a dog pond giggling and giggling until raff hauled the dogs off when she didnt end up knocked over shed felt almost disappointed she was bigger now she conceded not so likely to be knocked over by a pack of dogs but there werent as many dogs anyway there was an ancient black labrador almost grey with age there was a pug and there was kleppy bringing up the rear wagging his tail greeting her she knelt and hugged kleppy he licked her face so did the old labrador the pug was young but this oneshe even remembered the feel of his tongue boris abby sarah burst out of the kitchen her beam wide enough to split her face she dived down onto the floor and hugged her friend with total lack of selfconsciousness abby youre here ive made you honey jumbles igreat maybe she should get up lawyer on floor hugging dog boris was licking her chin boris she said tentatively and she included him in the hug she was giving kleppy he is boris raff said and she twisted and found raff was watching them all from the doorway how old was he when you were last here abby i three hes fourteen now old for a labrador youve missed out on his whole life thats not all ive missed out on she whispered how could i ever come back she shook her head and hauled herself to her feet raff made an instinctive move to help but then pulled away shook his head closed down but you will stay for a bit sarah said grabbing abbys hand to pull herself up movement was still awkward for sarah it always would be ive told the dogs they can have a honey jumble each she told abby but they need to wait until theyve cooled down you cant take kleppy home before hes had his i could take it with me abby sarah said in a term of such reproach that abby knew she was stuck how long did honey jumbles take to cool apparently a while because ive just put them in the oven sarah said happily i made a lot after tea but raff forgot to tell me to take them out they went black even the dogs didnt want them raff never forgets she said heading back to the kitchen but hes funny tonight do you think its because youre here i expect thats it abby said trying desperately to find something to say babbling because of it maybe its because im a lawyer sometimes police dont like lawyers cos they ask too many questions and sometimes they dont ask enough raff growled meaning baxter oh for heavens sake leave it raff she said just butt out of my life i did that years ago well dont stop now she took a deep breath sarah love im in a rush i know you are sarah said and pushed her into a kitchen chair you sit down raff will make you a nice cup of tea and well talk until the honey jumbles are ready but dont yell at raff she said disapprovingly raffs nice raff was nice okay maybe a part of him was nice she might want to hate raff finnand a part of her couldnt help but hate himbut she had to concede he was caring for sarah beautifully the twelve months after the crash had been appalling even her grief for ben hadnt stopped abby seeing the tragedy that was sarah shed lain unconscious for three weeks and everyone had mourned her as dead at one time rumour had it that raff and gran were asked to stop life support at three weeks shed woken but it was a different sarah shed had to relearn everything her memory of childhood was patchy her recent memory was lost completely shed learned to walk again to talk she coped now but her speech was slow as was her movement gran and raff had brought her home and worked with her loved her massaged exercised pleaded cajoled bullied when gran died raff had taken it on himself to keep on going for over a year he hadnt been able to work theyd lived on the smell of an oily rag because shes not going into care with anyone else the community would have rallied but not with the finns not when raff was seen as being the cause of so much tragedy how hed managed if the accident happened now the community would help she thought somehow in the last years raff had redeemed himself he was a fine cop hed cared for sarah with such love and compassion that the worst of the naysayers had been silenced shed even thoughtit was time she moved on time she learned to forgive but over and over hed killed ben how could she ever be friends with him again she didnt need to be she simply chose to be distant so she sat in raffs kitchen while sarah chatted happily showing her the guinea pigs explaining theyd had too many babies and that raff had told her they had to sell some but how could she choose smelling honey jumbles in a kitchen she loved knowing raff was watching her she found her fingers were clenched on her knees they were hidden by the table she could clench them as much as she wanted it didnt help this place was almost claustrophobic the memories it evoked but raff was watching her and how raff was making her feel wasnt a memory this was no childhood crush it was like a wave of testosterone blasting across the table assaulting her from every angle sarah was laughing raff wasnt laughing he was simply watchful judgemental because she was marrying philip why shouldnt she marry philip he was kind thoughtful clever her fallback umno he was her careful choice shed gone out with philip before ben had died just for a bit when the boys had left home raff to the police training college ben to university philip had left for university too but hed caught glandular fever and come home for a term shed needed a date for her debutante ball and was fed up with raff being away with the boys being obsessed with their junkpile car when they did come home philip had the most wonderful set of wheels he had money even then but he wasnt raff shed made her debut and shed found an excuse to break up the decision wasnt met with regret philip had immediately asked sarah out maybe if the accident hadnt happened maybe sarah and philip where was she going dont even think it she decided they were different people now philip especially was different after the crashhe was so caring whenever she needed him he was there hed encouraged her to take up law as well you can do it hed said youre bright organised meticulous do law and well set up the best law firm banksia bays ever seen we can care for our parents that way abby your parents miss ben so much we can be there for them and so they were it was all working out all she needed to do was avoid the judgement on raffs face and avoid the way raff made herfeel how could he bear her here one night one car crash and it stood between him and this woman for ever how could she marry philip but he knew it was even reasonable he conceded philip was okay once hed even been a friend yes the man made money and raff did wonder how but that was just his nasty cop mind yes he took on cases raff wouldnt touch with a bargepole if he got baxter off he would get him off but raff also knew a portion of philips fee would end up as a cheque to the pensioners baxter had ripped off not all of itphilip was careful not stupid with his charitybut the town might end up being grateful baxter would think he was great as well it was only raff whod feel ill and maybe that was part of ancient history as well if philip hadnt been there that night how unfair was that tell us about your wedding dress he said and abby shot him a look that was both suspicious and angry you want to knowwhy sarah would like to know im going to the wedding sarah said and pointed to the invitation stuck to the fridge you should come too did you get an invitation where did you put it raffs coming too isnt he abby im on duty that day raff told her before abby was forced to answer we talked about it remember mrs hendersons taking you itd be more fun if you were there no it wouldnt raff thought but he didnt say so he glanced at his watch i reckon theyll be cooked sares ooh sarah said happily distracted my honey jumbles i could make you some more for your wedding present abby does philip like honey jumbles sure he does abby said who wouldnt honey jumbles a big cosy kitchen like this dogs would philip like honey jumbles maybe not abby ate four honey jumbles and sarah beamed the whole time and how could a girl worry about how tight her wedding dress was going to be in the face of that beam sarah wasnt the only one happy this morning kleppy had been due for the needle tonight he was lying under her chair licking the last of sarahs honey jumbles from his chops and sarahs beam and kleppys satisfaction and raffs thoughtful watchful gaze made her feelmade her feel like she needed to leave before things got out of hand she needed to go home to philip to tell him she had a dog whats wrong raff asked and he sounded as if he cared that scared her all by itself she pushed her chair back so fast she scared kleppy which meant she had her dog in her arms and she was at the door before she meant to be she hadnt meant to look like she was rushing she was rushing will you take some jumbles in a bag sarah asked and she managed to calm down a little and smile and agree so sarah bagged her some jumbles but she was holding kleppy she didnt have a hand free which meant raff carried her jumbles down to the car while she carried her dog kleppy was warm and fuzzy his heart was beating against hers he was a comfort she thought and even as she thought it he stretched up and licked her throat to chin she giggled and raff whod gone before and was stowing her jumbles onto the back seat turned and smiled in the moonlight dogs are great they are she said and felt happy philip will be okay with him why must he always butt into what wasnt his business why must he always spoil the moment he will so youll tell him tonight of course i wish you luck i wont need it no butt out finn youre always saying that he said but its not in my power to butt out its my job to intervene in domestic crises stopping them before they start is a life skill you seriously think philip and i would fight over a dog im thinking you might fight for a dog he said softly the old abbys still there somewhere shell fight for this dog to the death and how melodramatic is that melodramatic he agreed call the police emergency number if you need me why would i possibly need you just offering he was holding the passenger door wide so she could pop kleppy in you know philip wouldnt yeah i know philip wouldnt he took kleppy from her and laid him on the passenger seat youre giving him honey jumbles and kleppy why wouldnt the man be delighted i dont know when i hate it mostwhen youre being offensive or youre being sarcastic maybe theyre the same thing maybe they are i wish you wouldnt no you dont he said softly it helps you keep as far away from me as you want isnt that right abby raff its okay i understand he said how could i fail to understand what youre doing is entirely reasonable i only wish your second choice wasnt philip hes not my second choice hes my first thats right he said sounding suddenly thoughtful i forgot you went out with philip when you were seventeen for two whole months and then you dumped him dont those reasons hold true now i cant believe youre asking me im a cop i ask the hard questions i dont have to answer meaning you cant meaning i dont need to why are you asking this now ive hardly had a chance until now you back off every time you see me and you know why i do he said harshly and she winced and thought she shouldnt have said it it was too long ago the whole thing it was a nightmare to be put behind them yes philip and i broke up when i was seventeen she managed but people change i guess we do he paused and then said almost conversationally you know once upon a time we had fun we even decided we loved each other they had girlfriend and boyfriend inseparable raff had shared her first kiss it had felt it had felt no we were kids she managed we were dumb in all sorts of ways he was too close she decided it was too dark she should be back in her nice safe house waiting for philip to come home she shouldnt be remembering being kissed by her first boyfriend i loved kissing you he said and it wasnt just her remembering it didnt mean maybe it did theres this thing he said what thing but she shouldnt have asked because the moment she had she knew what he was talking about or maybe shed known all along this thing this frisson an electric current an indefinable thing that was tugging her closer no she had to go home raff you really want to be mrs philip dexter what a waste leave it choose someone else abby marrying him youre burying yourself i am not does he make you sizzle i dont does he you know i cant imagine it good old philip knocking your socks off are you racing home now to have hot sex i dont believe im hearing this you see its such a waste he said and suddenly he was even closer big and bad and dangerous big bad and dangerous certainly dangerous his hand came up and cupped her chin forcing her to look up at him and her sense of danger deepened but she couldnt pull away i wouldnt mind if it wasnt philip he told her and she wondered if he knew the effect he was having on her she wondered if he could sense how her body was reacting ive known since ben died that nothing could bring back what was between you and me but there are men out there who could bring you alive again men whod like kleppy philip will like kleppy liar he was gazing down into her eyes holding her to truth she should break away she could break away she thought wildly he was only holding her chinnothing more she could step back get into the car and drive home to philip she could but he was gazing down into her eyes and he was still asking questions so tell me he makes you sizzle i he doesnt does he raff said in grim satisfaction but there are guys out there who couldwho could find out what youre capable ofwhats beneath your prissy lawyer uniform because youre still there somewhere the abby i he paused there was a moments loaded silence when the whole world stilled the abby i she should push away she should she couldnt she tilted her face just a little the moment stretched on the darkness stretched on and then he kissed her as inevitably as time itself he kissed her she couldnt move she didnt move she froze and then heat fire the contact lips against lips was a tiny point but that point sizzled caught burned and her whole body started heating her face was tilted to his but he had no need to hold her it was as if she was melting against himinto him raff he broke away just a little and his eyes blazed in the moonlight abby he said and it was a rough angry whisper abby i does he do this he demanded he snagged her arms and held them behind her but this was no forceful hold it was as if her arms might get in the way could interfere and nothing must nothing could she was paralysed she was burning but she couldnt escape she didnt want to escape what was between them it sizzled tugged as if searching for oxygen he was watching her in the moonlight his eyes questioning she wouldnt answer she couldnt she was being held by raff a man shed once loved she found herself lifting herself tiptoe so her mouth could meet his again this morning shed fantasised about raff finn sex on legs but this if shed expected anything it was a kiss of anger a kiss of sexual tension passion nothing more and maybe it had started like that but it was changing his kiss was tender aching even loving it was as unexpected as ice within a fire heating cooling sizzling all at once shed never felt anything like thisshed never known sensations like this could exist raff hed released her hands and they were free to do as she willed her will was that her hands were behind his back drawing him closer for how could she not want him close sense had flown thoughts had flown there was only this man there was only this need there was only now raff did she say his name maybe she did or maybe it was just a sigh deep in her throat a sound of pure sensual pleasure of taking something shed never dreamed she could have of sinking into the forbidden of the longed for of a memory shed have to put away quite soon but not yet please not yet oh but his mouth clever and warm and beguiling it was coaxing her to places she had no business going but she wanted oh she wanted to be there she was helpless melting into him degree by achingly wonderful degree he was irresistible she wasappalled somehow she had to break this her head was screaming at her neon danger signs flashing through her sensual need no no it came out a muffled whisper if he didnt hearif he ignored it how could she say it again did she want him to hear it but he did he had and the wrench as he put her away from him was indescribable he let her go he stepped back from her and his eyes in the moonlight were almost as dazed as hers but then his face hardened tightened and she knew he was moving on as she must her mothers voice keep away from the finn boy hes trouble he surely was she was kissing him nine days before her wedding she was risking allfor the finn boy i just go abby he said and she didnt recognise his voice it was harsh and raw and she could even imagine there was pain get out of here you know you dont want this of course i dont then take your dog and go ill see you in court of course she would shed see him and hed be back to being the local cop and shed be a lawyer sitting beside her fiancé trying to pretend tonight had never happened but it had happened the feel of his mouth on hers was with her still she caught herself gasped and thumped down into the drivers seat before she could change her mind that was ridiculous she managed howhow dare you you wanted it as much as i did then were both stupid we are he said gravely we were but heaven help us abby if were stupid still chapter five abby drove home in a daze she felt ill the feel of raffs mouth on hers wouldnt goit felt as if her lips were surely bruised and yet she knew they couldnt be there had been tenderness in his kiss it hadnt been onesided he hadnt been brutal it had been a kiss of no dont even think about it kleppy put out his paw in a gesture she was starting to know giving comfort as well as taking it the feel of him beside her was absurdly comforting almost as if he was a little part of raff and there was a dopey thing to think the whole night had been dopey she thought stupid stupid stupid imagine if she ever thought there could be anything between herself and raff imagine the heartbreak her heart clenched down no just because the man was a load of semicontrolled testosterone just because he had the ability to push her buttons she turned into her street and philips car was out the front her heart sank philip she told herself not a load of semicontrolled testosterone a good kind man whod keep her happywhod keep her safe i might get tired of safe she whispered to herself and then she let herself open her mind to the rush of memory that was ben and she felt the concept of safe the need for safe close around her again safe was the only way hi she said climbing from the car the bucks night finished early then hardly a bucks night he took her hands and kissed her and she had to stop herself from thinking dry as dust just my dad and uncles and cousins why arent you having a bucks night tonight was enough philip said contentedly im busy right up to the honeymoon where have you but then he paused inside the car kleppy had stirred and yawned and whimpered a little whats that deep breath its kleppy kleppy hes my dog she said and she had a really good shot at not sounding defensive maybe she even succeeded you know raff gave me a dog this morning and asked me to take him to be put down i couldnt hes isaac abrahams dog he needs a new home and ive decided to keep him sarahs been looking after him for me there was no need to mention raff again so we have a dog she said and she surprised herself by sounding cheerful philip meet kleppy kleppy meet philip i just know you two are going to be best of friends he didnt like it but she wouldnt budge she didnt budge and finally he conceded itll have to sleep outside he not it hell have to sleep outside he concededno mean concession okay she said with her fingers crossed behind her back he could sleep outside for a little she thought until philip got used to the idea and then she could sort of sneak him in and for the next nine nights he could sleep inside at her place and what about our honeymoon ill get mrs sanderson to feed and walk him shell charge we can afford it i dont want eileen sanderson snooping in our backyard ill figure something else out then but youll love him if you want a dog then why dont we get a purebred he asked checking kleppy out with suspicion i like kleppy and finn dumped him on you it was my decision to keep him youre too softhearted i cant do a thing about that she admitted knowing the hurdle had been leaped and she was over the other side you want to come in for coffee and get acquainted with our new pet i have work to do im not confident about tomorrow he would be confident abby knew but hed still go over his notes until he knew them backwards and once again she wonderedwhy had he come back to banksia bay he was smart he was ambitious he could have made serious money in the city i came back for you hed told her over and over but she knew it was more than that he spent time with her parents he worked at the yacht club where ben had once sailed every time a challenge occurred that might draw him to the city he looked at it with regret but he still turned back to banksia bay she kissed him goodnight and carried kleppy inside thinking every time she laid down an ultimatum philip caved in this dog or no wedding this dog he loves me she told kleppy sitting down on the hearth rug and allowing her scruffy dog to settle contentedly on her knee hell take you because he loves me but shed seen philips ruthless behaviour in court he could be ruthless hed never liked dogs why didnt he just say no im so lucky he didnt she whispered and she hugged kleppy a bit tighter and then gazed towards the spare room door her wedding dress lay behind she was lucky of course she was she was gone and raff stayed outside staring sightlessly into the moonlit night abby callahan right now there was nothing in the world he wanted but abby callahan oh but there was inside sarah would be snuggling into bed surrounded by dogs and cats dreaming of the day shed just hadher animals her honey jumbles her big brother he loved sarah he also loved this place he loved this town but love or not hed leave if he could to stay in this place with so many memories to stay in this place and watch abby married but leaving wasnt an option hed stay and he wouldnt touch her again tonight had been an aberration as stupid as it was potentially harmful he didnt want to upset abby it wasnt her fault she was the way she was it was his he was thirty years old and he felt a hundred he hardly needed to see her again before the wedding his participation in the baxter trial was almost over hed given the prosecutor all the help he could manage even if it wasnt enough to convict the guy there might be another couple of times he was called to the stand but otherwise he could steer well clear so hed drop sarah off at the church next saturday pick her up afterwards and itd be done abby callahan would be married to philip dexter abby spent until midnight making kleppy hers she bathed him and blowed him dry with her hairdryer he was never going to be a beautiful dog but he was incredibly cutein a shambolic kind of way he was a very individual dog she decided he tolerated the hairdryer he ate a decent dinner despite his predinner snack of honey jumbles he investigated her bedroom as she got ready for bed and curiously he fell in love with her jewellery box it was a beautiful cedar box with inlaid huon pine philips grandfather had made it for her when she and philip had announced their engagement she loved its craftsmanship and she also loved the woods faint and beautiful perfume stronger whenever she opened it she also loved philips grandpa she thought as she removed kleppys paw from where it had been resting proprietorially on the box his woodwork was his passion hed made these beautiful boxes for half the town itll last for hundreds of years after im gone girl hed told her and she suspected it would philips grandpa was part of this town philips family her future more peoples happiness than hers was tied up in next weeks wedding that should make her feel happy but right now it was making her feel claustrophobic which was dumb do you like the box or the jewels she asked kleppy deliberately shifting her thoughts she opened the lid so he could see he couldnt make millions with a jewel heist kleppy nosed the trinkets with disinterest but looked longingly at the box he sniffed it again and she thought it was its faint scent he liked no she said and put it further back on the chest kleppy sighed and went back to his bra the bra shed paid for and given to him yes he shouldnt benefit from crime but today was an exception he made a great little thief he slept on her bed snuggled against her and she loved it he snored she loved his snore she didnt even mind that he slept with his bra tucked firmly under his left front paw whatever makes you happy klep she told him but thats the last of your loot you belong to a lawabiding citizen now one who needs to stay right away from the law from raff dont think of raff think of the wedding some hope she slept thinking of raff she woke feeling light and happy for the past few weeks shed woken with the mammoth feeling that her wedding was bursting in on her from all sides her mother was determined to make it perfect it was starting to overwhelm her but not this morning she loved that kleppy woke at dawn and stuck his nose in her face and she woke to dog breath and a tail wagging it was lucky philip wasnt here hed have forty fits he wouldnt mind being here or ratherhed be happy if she was there as far as philip was concerned she was wasting money having her own little house when he already had a wonderful house overlooking the sea her parents had said that too when shed moved back to banksia bay after university theyd welcomed her home and even had her bedroom repainted pink she had a choice philips house or her old bedroom but her grandparents had left her a lovely legacy and this little house was her statement of independence as she let kleppy outside to inspect her tiny garden she thought how much she was going to miss it philips house was fabulous shed been blown away that he could afford to build it and it had everything a woman could possibly want so get over it she left kleppy to his own devices and went and checked on her wedding dressjust to reassure herself she really was getting married she should be excited she was excited it was a gorgeous dress it was exquisite it had taken her two years to make the pleasure was in making it not in wearing it this was dumb she felt a cold spot on her leg and there was kleppy wagging his tail brighteyed and bushytailed looking hopefully at the front door looking for adventure ill take you round the block before i go to work she told him and ill come home at lunch time im sorry klep but you might be bored this morning i cant help it though its the price youve paid for me bailing you out of death row and im going to be in court this morning too she told him as he looked doleful youre a lawyers dog and im a lawyer im a lawyer with a gorgeous handbeaded wedding dress and youre a lawyers dog with a new home we need to be grateful for what we have im sure we are she was grateful it was just as she left for work and kleppy looked disconsolately after her she knew how kleppy felt raff wasnt in court of course he wasnt he didnt need to be he was a cop not a prosecutor and he had work to do elsewhere hed given his evidence yesterday philip wouldnt call him back but shed sort of hoped the crown prosecutor would there were things the crown prosecutor could ask it wasnt for her to know that or even think thatshe was lawyer for the defenceand it also wasnt for her to have her heart twist because raff wasnt here she slid into the chair beside philip and he smiled and kissed her and then said second thoughts about the dog he really is unsuitable this was what would happen she thought hed agree and then slowly work on her to come round to his way of thinking he wasnt all noble no and i wont be having any she said where is he now safely in my garden fourfoot fence safe as houses hell make a mess i walked him before i left walkings good im going to do it every morning from now on maybe you can join us gyms far better aerobic exercise he said you need a fully planned programme to get full cardiac advantage walkings she was no longer listening her morning had begun it was very very boring the hands on the clock moved at a snails pace how bored would kleppy be how bored was she malcolm the crown prosecutor should do something about his voice she thought it was a voice designed to put a girl to sleep ooh wallace looked smug ooh she was bored lunch time all rise hooray and then the door of the court swung open all eyes turned as they would every person in the room with the possible exception of wallace and philip was probably as bored as she was and suddenly she wasnt bored at all for standing in the doorway wasraff full cop uniform grim expression gun at his side cop ready for action at his sideonly lowerwas a white fluff ball attached to a pink diamanté lead and in his arms he was carrying kleppy im sorry your honour he said addressing the judge but im engaged in a criminal investigation is abigail callahan in court of course she was abby rose her colour starting to rise as well kkleppy she stammered could you come with me please miss callahan raff said shes not going anywhere philip snapped rising and putting his hand on abbys shoulder what the if she wont come willingly im afraid i need to arrest her raff said accessory after the fact he looked down at his feet to where the white fluff ball pranced on the end of her pink diamanté lead a lead that led up to kleppys jaw kleppy had a very tight hold abigail callahan your dog has stolen mrs fryers peke you need to come now and sort this out or ill have to arrest you for theft the courtroom was quiet so quiet you could have heard a pin drop justice weatherbys face was impassive almost impassive there was a tiny tic at the side of his mouth raffs face was impassive too he stood with kleppy in his arms waiting for abby to respond kleppy looked disgusting he was coated in thick black dust his tail was wagging nineteen to the dozen in his mouth he held the end of the pink lead and his jaw was clamped as if he wasnt going to let go any time soon on the other end of the lead the white fluff ball was wagging her tail as well he was locked in my backyard abby said eyeing the two with dismay my sharp investigative skills inform me that the dog can dig raff said shaking kleppy a little so a rain of dirt fell onto the polished wood of the courtroom door will you come with me please maam just give the dog back to whoever owns it philip snapped his hand gripping abbys shoulder tightly now tie the other one up outside abigails busy raff please abby said mrs fryers hopping mad raff said unbending a little ive waited until court broke for lunch but im waiting no longer you want to avoid charges you come and placate her she glanced at philip uhoh she glanced at justice weatherby the tic at the corner of his mouth had turned into a grin someone was giggling at the back of the court philips face looked like thunder sort the dog abigail he snapped gathering his notes just get it out of here and stop it interfering with our lives right this way maam raff said amiably the solicitor for the defence will be right back just as soon as she sorts her stolen property abby walked out behind raff trying to look professional but she didnt feel professional and when she reached the outside steps and the autumn sun hit her face she felt suddenly a wee bit hysterical and alsoa wee bit free as if raff had sprung her from jail which was a dumb thing to think raff had attempted to make her a laughing stock i suppose you think youre funny she said and raff turned and looked at her and once again she was hit by that wave of pure testosterone he was in his cop uniform and my it was sexy the sun was glinting on his tanned face and his coppery hair he was wearing short sleeves and his arms they were twice as thick as philips she thought and then she thought that was a very inappropriate thing to think as was the fact that his eyes held the most fabulous twinkle her knees felt wobbly what was she doing she was standing in the sun and lusting after raff finn the man whod destroyed her life she needed to get a grip and fast youre saying kleppy dug all the way out of my garden she snapped trying to sound disbelieving she was disbelieving youre implying i might have helped raff said still with that twinkle you think i might have hiked round there and loaned him a spade no i of course not but the fence sits hard on the ground hed have had to go deep hes a very determined dog i did warn you abigail why dont you just call me maam and be done with it she snapped what am i supposed to do now apologise to you he grinned at that and his whole face lit up shed hardly seen that grin not since not since no avoid that grin at all costs i cant imagine you apologising to me he said but you might try mrs fryer i imagine shes apoplectic by now she rang an hour ago to say her dog had been stolen from outside the drapers i did think we were looking at dognappingshed definitely pay a ransombut we have witnesses saying the napper was seen making a getaway it seems kleppy decided to go find another bra and found something better she closed her eyes this was not good on so many levels you caught him i didnt have to catch him he said and his smile deepened a slow smouldering smile that had the power to heat as much as the sun i found the two of them on your front step on my he seems to think of your place as home already home of abby home of kleppy or maybe he was just bringing this magnificent gift to you oh kleppy she stared at her scruffy kleptomaniac mudcovered dog in raffs arms he stared back gazing straight at her quivering with hope with happiness a dog fulfilled why did her eyes suddenly fill whywhy didnt you just take fluffy back to mrs fryer she managed trying not to sniff she had a dog watch this he set kleppy down and tugged the diamanté lead trying to dislodge it from kleppys teeth kleppy held on as if his life depended on it raff tugged again kleppy growled and gripped and glanced across at abbyand his appeal was unmistakable come and help this guys trying to steal your property her property raff released him the little dog turned towards her his whole body quivering in delight she stooped and held out her hand and he dropped the lead into it oh my she was having trouble making herself speak she was having trouble making herself think this disreputable mutt had laid claim to her she should be horrified she loved it you could have just taken fluffy off the other end of the lead she managed hey your dog growled at me raff said you heard him he could have taken my hand off he was wagging his tail at the same time im not one to take chances raff said i might be armed but im not a fast draw too big a risk she looked up at him big and brawny and absurdly incongruous cop with gun hed shoot to kill you dont have capsicum spray she managed lady you think this vicious mutt could be subdued by capsicum spray she ran her fingers down the vicious mutts spine he arched and preened and waggled his tail in pleasure the fluff ball moved in for a back scratch as well she giggled abigail it was philip striding down the steps looking furious philip dignity she scrambled to her feet and the dogs looked devastated at losing her im just settling the dogs down she managed before raff takes them away before we take them away raff said he motioned to his patrol car you can cope with this yourself finn philip snapped no raff said humour fading he lifted kleppy in one arm and fluff ball in the other you cope with getting wallace off he told philip abigail copes with the dogs i need youre getting as little help as i can manage to get that low life off the hook raff snapped abigail come with me she went raff was not giving her a choice and she knew mrs fryer would be furious behind her philip was furious but right now that seemed the lesser of two evils she sat in the front of raffs patrol car with two dogs on her knee and she tried to stare straight ahead to think serious thoughts she still wanted to giggle kleppy should be in the back raff said gravely a known criminal youve accused me of being an accessory why dont you toss me in the back as well i like you up front he said you do my image good i need dark glasses she said glowering carted round town in a police car you will keep a kleptomaniac dog it might well push you over to the dark side spoil that goodgirl reputation send you into the shadowy side like me her bubble of laughter faded at that hed spoken lightly but there was truth behind his words the shadowy side raffs grandfather and then his mother had given the family a bad name a drunk and then a woman whod broken societys rules if raffs mother had had the strength to defend herself to ride out community criticism then maybe it would have been different but shed been an easy target the family had been an easy target raff though he had defended himself hed come back here after the accident hed made a home for sarah hed looked on community disdain with indifference did it hurt it wasnt anything to do with her she thought but as they pulled up outside louise fryers she watched the middleaged matron greet raff with only the barest degree of civility it must still hurt after the accident thered been no trial she remembered the investigators talking to her parents thered been insufficient evidence to charge him is raff denying it that had been abby whispering from the background she barely remembered those appalling days after the crash but she did remember that she did remember asking what does raff say he cant remember a thing the investigator told her his blood alcohols come back zero and frankly thats a surprise he was just a stupid kid doing stupid things our ben wasnt stupid her mother said hotly led astray more like the investigator said and the fair part of abby the reasonable part thought no ben hadnt been wearing his seat belt it wasnt all raffs fault hed been stupid he had been on the wrong side of the dirt road and hed been speeding hed killed ben and injured his sister maybe that was enough punishment for anyone the authorities seemed to think so even though her parents wanted him thrown in jail it had simply been left as an accident raff had come back as the town cop hed cared for his sister and hed worked hard to rid himself of that bad boy reputation for the most part he now had community respect but there were thoseher parents friendspeople with long memories he was still condemned louise fryer coming out now with her mouth pursed into a look of dislike was one of the more vocal of the condemners havent you found her yet her voice was an accusation ive had five phone calls people have seen her dont you know how valuable she is abby was trying to untangle leads to get out of the car you dont care mrs fryer said we need a decent police presence in this oh for finally abby was out she set fluff ball on the ground fluff ball headed over to mrs fryer but uhoh kleppy was out of the car and after his prize he grabbed the lead and fluff ball stopped in her tracks fluff ball looked at mrs fryer then looked at kleppy she wagged her pompom and proceeded to check out kleppys rear shell catch something get it away louise was practically screeching abby sighed she picked up both dogs and tucked them firmly under her arms thank you kleppy but no she said severely she took the lead from kleppy and handed over fluff ball and finally mrs fryer realised who she was abigail hi mrs fryer what are you doing here my dog stole your dog your dog louises eyes were almost popping out of her head thats never your dog he is his names kleppy hes lovely but ive only had him for a day so hes not exactly well trained but he will be just as soon as she installed fences down to bedrock has this man foisted him onto you her glare at raff was poisonous no not exactly or actuallyyes but that was what the woman was expecting her to say she thought raff finntowns bad boy one of those finns capable of anything which was what she thought too she reminded herself so why was she standing here figuring out how to defend him he didnt foist she started yes i did raff said before she could get any further have you forgotten already i definitely foisted and thats exactly what youd expect of someone like me isnt it mrs fryer and here i am messing up your front garden but its okay your dogs been restored justice has been done so i can step out of your life again if youll excuse me abby when mrs fryers given you a nice cup of tea so you can both recover from your very nasty experience could you walk back to court yourself do you think i she stared at him speechless he gave her his very blandest smile i bet louise wants to hear all about the wedding preparations shell be invited though wont she yes louise said a bit confused but mostly belligerent her dislike for raff was unmistakable of course i am im a friend of dear philips mother there you are youre practically family raffs gaze met hers and there was laughter behind his eyespure trouble all it takes for you to be friends for life is for your two dogs to bond which theyre doing already me i have other stuff to do murderers and rapists to chase or the police station lawn to mow abby snapped and then wished she hadnt i was just saying that to philips mother the other night louise said old sergeant troy used to keep the station really nice yeah but he wasnt a finn raff said the place has gone to hell in a handbasket since i arrived did you think of the lawn yourself abigail or did philip mention it a tidy man our philip but enough murderers rapistsand lawn he sighed a policemans lot is indeed a tough one see you ladies later have a nice cup of tea he turned and walked away louise put her hand on abbys arm holding her back the toad raff finn knew she wouldnt be able to get away from here for an hour make sure you plant some petunias when youre finished abby called after him itd be a pity if we saw our police force bored petunias it is he said and gave her an airy wave consider them planted in between thefts how long till the next snatch and grab he shook his head keep off the streets abigail and keep a tight hold on that felon of yours next time i might have to put you up for a community corrections order the pair of you might find yourself planting my petunias for me chapter six abby didnt go back to court philip phoned to find out where she was and she decided she had a headache she did have a headache her headache was wagging his tail and watching as she dogproofed her fence according to the internet to stop foxes digging into a poultry pen you had to run wire netting underground from the fence but flattening outward and forward surfacing about eighteen inches from the fence the fox would then find itself digging into a ushaped wire cavity that meant a lot of digging would it work when kleppy the fox was sitting there watching dont even think about it she told him philips being very good we cant expect his patience to last for ever philip she was expecting him to explode he didnt he arrived to see how she was just after shed finished cleaning up after fence digging they were supposed to be going out to dinner two of philips most affluent clients had invited them out to banksia bays most prestigious restaurant as a prewedding celebration when abby thought of it her headache was suddenly realand surprisingly she didnt need to explain it to philip you look dreadful he said hugging her with real sympathy white as a sheet you should be in bed iyes bed sounded a good idea wheres the mutt outside actually on her bed hoping shed join him you cant keep him philip said seriously hes trouble this morning wasnt his fault you dont need to tell me that philip said darkly the dog might be trouble but finns worse its my belief he set the whole thing up look abby the best thing would just be for you to take the dog back to the animal shelter no he sighed but he held his temper well talk about it when youre feeling better im sorry you cant make tonight will you cancel no he said surprised theyll understand of course they would theyd hardly notice her absence she thought bitterly theyd talk about their property portfolios all night make some more money what will you eat he asked solicitous and she thought she wouldnt have to eat five courses and five different wines headaches had their uses ill make eggs on toast if i get hungry well keep up your strength you have a big week ahead of you he kissed her and he was off happily going to a wedding celebration without her the moment the door shut behind him her headache disappeared just like that why was she marrying him uhoh the question had been hovering for months niggling shoved away with disbelief that she could think it but the closer the wedding grew the bigger the question grew now it was the elephant in the room or the tyrannosaurus rex what was the worlds biggest dinosaur whatever the question was getting very large indeed and very insistent philip was heading to a dinner shed been dreading he was anticipating it with pleasure worse philips kiss meant absolutely nothing last night raffs kiss had shown her how little philips kisses did mean and worse still shed almost been wanting him to yell at her about kleppy how had she got into this mess it had justhappened the car crash philip always here supporting her parents supporting her interested in everything she was doing throwing himself heart and soul into this town throwing himself heart and soul into her life she couldnt even remember when shed first realised he intended to marry her it was just sort of assumed she did remember the night hed formally asked hed proposed at the banksia bay private golf club overlooking the bay the setting had been perfect a full moon moonbeams glinting on the sea the terrace a balmy night stars a dessert to die forchocolate ganache in the shape of a heart surrounded by strawberries and tiny meringues a beautifully drawn line of strawberry coulis spelling out the words marry me but thered been more philip had left nothing to chance the small town orchestra had appeared from nowhere playing pachelbels canon the staff not just from the restaurant but from the golf club as well crowding into the doorways applauding before she even got to answer ive already asked your parents philip said as he lifted the lid of the crimson velvet box they couldnt be more pleased were going to be so happy he lifted the ring she now worea diamond so big it made her gaspand slid it onto her finger before she realised what was happening then just in case she thought he hadnt got it completely right hed tugged her to her feet then dropped to his knees abigail callahan would you do me the honour of becoming my wife she remembered thinkinghysterically and only for the briefest of momentswhat happens if i say no but how could she say no how could she say no now why would she want to because rafferty finn had kissed her because raff made her feel as hed always made her feel as if she was on the edge of a precipice and any minute shed topple the night ben died shed toppled philip had held her up to tell him now that she couldnt marry him what was she thinking he was a good kind man and next saturday shed marry him and right now she was going to sit in front of the television and stitch a last row of lace onto the hem of her wedding gown the gown should be finished but her mother and philips mother had looked at it and decreed one more row to make everything perfect fine lace perfect she could do this she let kleppy out of the bedroom he seemed a bit subdued she gave him a doggy chew and he snuggled onto the couch beside her shed washed him again he was clean or clean enough so what if the occasional dog hair got on her dress it didnt have to be that perfect life didnt have to be that perfect marriage to philip would be okay the doorbell rang kleppy was off the couch turning wild circles barking his head off at the door he hadnt stirred from his spot on her bed when philip had rung the bell different bell technique she should tuck kleppy back in her bedroom thisd be her mother or philips mother philip would have reported the headache gathered the troops it was a wonder the chicken soup hadnt arrived before this her mother would be horrified at the sight of kleppy shed just have to get used to him she decided theyd all have to get used to him the chicken soup brigade but it wasnt the chicken soup brigade she opened the door sarah was standing on her doorstep holding a gift and raff was right behind her see that was just the problem she had no idea why her heart did this weird leap at the sight of him it didnt make sense she should feel anger when she saw him betrayal and distress shed felt it for ten years but now somehow distress was harder to maintain and there was also this extra layer of hope she really didnt want to spend the rest of her life running into this man maybe she and philip could move maybe raff should move why had he come back to banksia bay in the first place but sarah was beaming a greetingraffs sisterabbys friendand abby thought there were so many complexities in this equation she couldnt get her head around them raff was caught as well as she was held by ties of family and love and commitment his teenage folly had killed his best mate he was trapped in this judgemental town looking after the sister he loved for ten years shed felt betrayed by this man but she looked at him now and thought hed been to hell and back there were different forms of life sentence and hed losther hed never had her she thought fiercely shed broken up with him before the crash if she even started thinking of him that way again the problem was she was thinking but the nightmare if she kept thinking her parentsphilip the way she felt herself the aching void where ben had been she was dealing with it she had been dealing with it if only he hadnt kissed her youre home sarah said she was holding a silver box tied with an enormous red ribbon you took ages to answer raff said you probably werent home he said youd be out gall gall gallivanting its what i said but i guess thats the wrong word raff said you wouldnt gallivant with philip she ignored him she ignored that heartstopping dareyou twinkle hi sarah its lovely to see you what do you have there were delivering your present sarah said but raff said youd be out with philip we were going to leave it on the doorstep and go but i heard kleppy why arent you out with philip i had a headache very wise raff said the gleam of mischief intensifying in those dark dangerous eyes dinner with the flanagans id have a headache too how did you know we were going out with the flanagans she sighed no dont tell me this town sorry raffs mischief turned to a chuckle deep and toecurlingly sexy and sorry about the intrusion but sarah wrapped your gift and decided she needed to deliver it immediately so can we come in while you open it sarah was halfway in scooping up a joyful kleppy on the way but then she faltered do you still have a headache sarah knew all about headachesabby could see her cringe at the thought abby said she had a headache raff said thats past tense sares i reckon it was cured the minute philip went to dinner without her will you cut it out do you still have a headache he asked not perturbed at all by her snap no but there you go sares what if i leave you here for half an hour so you can watch the presentopening and play with kleppy ill pick you up at eight is that okay with you abby it wasnt okay with sarah no she ordered you have to watch her open it it was your idea youll really like it abby ooh and i want to help you use it so they both came in abby was absurdly aware that she had a police car parked in her driveway thatd be reported to philip in about two minutes she thought and to her parents and to everyone else in this claustrophobic little town what was wrong with her she loved this town and she was old enough to ignore gossip raff was here helping sarah deliver a wedding gift what was wrong with that ten minutes tops and shed have him out of here but the gift took ten minutes to open sarah had wrapped it herself shed used about twenty layers of paper and about four rolls of tape i should use you to design my police cells raff said grinning as abby ploughed her way through layer after layer after layer this suckers not getting out any time soon its exciting sarah said wideeyed with anticipation i wonder what it is uhoh abby glanced up at raff at that and saw a shaft of pain shortterm memory sarah would have spent an hour happily wrapping this gift but an hour was a long time for her to remember what shed actually wrapped there was no way raff could leave this town she conceded sarah operated on longterm memory the things shed had instilled as a child a new environmenta new home new city new friends sarah would be lost raff was as trapped here as she was but she wasnt trapped she told herself sharply scaring herself with the direction her thoughts were headed she loved it here she loved philip she was almost at the end one last snip and ooooh she couldnt stop the sigh of pure pleasure this was no small gift it was a thing shed loved for ever it was gran finns pasta maker colleen finn had been as irish as her name suggested she was one of thirteen children and shed married a hard drinking bull of a man whod come to australia to make a new start with no intention of changing his ways as a young bride gran had simply got on with it and shed cooked every recipe she could get her hands on irish or otherwise abby was about ten when the pasta maker had come into the house bright and shiny and a complete puzzle to them all greta riccardos having a yard sale getting rid of all her mothers stuff gran was puffed up like a peahen in her indignation all marias recipesbooks and booksand heres greta saying she never liked italian food thats like me saying i dont like potatoes how could i let the pasta maker go to someone who doesnt love it in honour of my friend maria well learn to be italian it was in the middle of the school holidays and the kids en masse were enchanted theyd watched and helped and within weeks theyd been making decent pasta abby remembered holding sheets of dough stretching it out competing to see who could make the longest spaghetti pasta thus became a staple in the finn house and it was only as she grew older she realised how cheap it must have been with her own eggs and her home grown tomatoes gran had a new basic food but now dont you use this any more she ventured stunned they could give away this part of themselves and raff smiled though his smile was a little wary and with the wariness abby got it she remembered sarah as a teenager stretching dough kneading it easing it through the machine with care so it wouldnt rip making angels hair every kind of the most delicate pasta varieties she thought of sarah now with fumbling fingers knowing what shed been able to do knowing what shed lost we dont use it any more sarah said but we dont want to throw it away so raff said why dont we give it to you and i can come round and remind you how to do it will you and i make some now she asked sarah before she could stop herself can you remember how to make it i think so sarah said and looked doubtfully at her big brother can i raff maybe we could both give abby a reminder lesson raff said as part of our wedding present if your headaches indeed better abigail both whoa no uhuh this was really dumb the police car would be parked outside for a couple of hours you want me to drive the car round the back he asked she stared at him and he gazed straight back impassive reading her mind this was up to her all she had to do was say her headache had come back they were all looking at her sarah kleppy raff go away youre complicating my life my wedding dress is right behind that door my fiancé is just over the far side of town sarahs eyes were wide with hope i guess itll still get around that my car was round the back for a couple of hours raff said watching the warring emotions on her face will dexter call me out at dawn philip she said automatically philip he agreed neutral he wont mind she said id mind if i was philip just lucky youre not philip she said and shed meant to sound snarky but she didnt quite manage it why dont you go do what you need to do and come back in a couple of hours but raff likes making pasta too sarah said and abby looked at his face and sawand saw that he did there was a lot of this man to back away from there was a lot about this man to distrust but watching him now it was as if he was hungry she thought he was disguising it with his smart tongue and his teasing and his blatant provocation but still hed just given away his grandmothers pasta maker hed given it to her shed love it shed use it for ever the memories she and sarah raff and ben messing round in grans kitchen if it wasnt for this man ben would still be here how long did hate last for the last ten years every time shed looked at raff finn shed felt ill now she looked at sarah and at the pasta maker she thought of mrs fryers vitriol she thought that ben had been raffs best friend ben had loved him shed loved him she couldnt keep hating she justcouldnt she felt sick and weary and desperately sad she feltwasted hey abby really isnt well raff said and maybe hed read the emotionsmaybe it was easy because she was having no luck disguising them from herself much less from him maybe we should go sares and let her recover do you really have a headache sarah put her hand on her arm all concern does it bang behind your eyes its really bad when it does that did sarah still have headaches did raff cope with them take care of her ache for his little sister and all shed lost maybe she should have invited raff to her wedding now there was a stupid thing to think she might be coming out the other side of a decade of bitterness but her parentsthey never would they knew that raff had killed their son pure and simple philip would never countenance him at their wedding her parents would always hate him any bridges must be her own personal bridges built of an understanding that she couldnt keep stoking this flame of bitterness for the rest of her life they were watching her sarahs hand was still on her arm concerned for her headache sarah whose headaches had taken away so much not a headache she whispered and then more strongly its not a headache its just im overwhelmed i loved making pasta with you guys when i was a kid i cant believe youre giving this to me its the most wonderful gifta truly generous gift of the heart its made me feel all choked up and then as sarah was still looking unsure she took her hands and tugged her close and kissed her thank you she whispered raff too sarah said raff too he was watching with eyes that were impassive giving nothing away hed given her his grandmothers pasta maker hed killed her brother no an accident had killed ben a moment of stupidity that hed have to pay for forever she took a deep breath released sarah took raffs hands in hers and kissed him too lightly as shed kissed sarah on the cheek and nothing more she went to release him but he didnt release her his hands held for just a fraction of a second too long a fraction of a second that said he was as confused as she was a fraction of a second that said there could never be idle friendship between them no longer enemies but what not friends not when he looked at her like like he was seeing all the regret in the world she had to do something they were all looking at her raff sarah and kleppy wondering why her eyes were brimmingwhy she was standing like a dummy wishing the last ten years could disappear and she could be seventeen again and raff could be gorgeous and young and free and and she neednt think anything of the kind in eight days she was marrying philip her direction was set eight days was all very well but what about now now she closed her eyes for a fraction of a second gave herself that tiny respite to haul herself togetherand then she put on her very brightest smile lets make pasta she said and they did chapter seven he shouldnt have given the pasta maker away if it made him feel like this this was a bad idea and it was getting worse he was sitting at abbys kitchen table watching sarah hold one end of the pasta dough as abby fed it through the machine watching it stretch watching sarah hold her breath gasp with pleasure smile watching abby smile back he could helpsarah kept offering him a turnbut he excused himself on the grounds that all abbys aprons were frilly and there was no way banksia bays cop could be caught in a rosecovered pinny but in reality he simply wanted to watch hed forgotten how good it was to watch abby callahan had she forgotten how to be abby callahan for years now hed never seen her with a hair out of place now though she was wearing faded jeans an old sweatshirt smudged with flour bare feet he remembered her in bare feet abby seventeen years old shed laugh and everyone laughed with her she could tease a smile out of anyone she was a laughing loving girl shed been his girlfriend and hed loved it they just seemed tofit but then theyd grown up sort of one heated weekend angry words the car the debutante ball incredibly important to teenagers abby had started dating philip she and philip had broken up and then sarah had started going out with him he hadnt liked that either maybe hed acted like a jerk making abby pay hed assumed theyd make it up but then the tragedy that turned abby from a girl whod dreamed of being a dress designer who lived for colour and life into a lawyer who represented the likes of wallace baxter a lawyer who was about to marry philip dexter no he came close to shouting it to thumping his fist down on the flourcovered table he did no such thing there was no reason why she shouldnt marry philip there was nothing raff could put his finger on against the guy philip was a model citizen he didnt like him jealous yeah but something else a feeling a feeling hed had at nineteen that had never gone away why did you and dexter stop going out he asked as the pasta went through a third and final time she didnt lift her head but he saw the tiny furrow of concentration the setting of her lips abby just ease it in a little more sarah ten years ago after your debut why did you break up thats none of your business now we put this attachment on to cut it into ribbons i know sarah said crowing in triumph as she found the right attachment this one its just ive always wondered raff said as sarah tried to get the attachment in they both let her be itd be easier to step in and do it for herher fingers were fumbling badlybut she was a picture of intense concentration and to step in now they both knew not to you know i only went out with debbie macallroy to get back at you he said so you did childhood romances raff we were dumb really dumb where had they all ended up we did have fun before the crash he said gently we were such good friends but then philip first you and then sarah but you didnt fall in love with him then you ditched him ive changed we both have people dont change of course they do of course people changed she had and so had philip she didnt look up at raff she focused on the sheets of pasta making sure they were dusted so they wouldnt stick in the final cutting process she thought back to philip at nineteen hed been rich or rich compared to every other kid in banksia bay he had his own car and it was a far cry from the bomb ben and raff were doing up a purple monaro v cool every girl in abbys year group had wanted to go out with him abby didnt so muchshe was trying hard not to think she was still in love with raffbut shed needed a partner for her debut all raff thought about was his stupid car and sarah had bet her she wouldnt be game to ask him for a few weeks shed preened her friends were jealous philip danced really well and her debut was lovely but what followedthe drivein movies sitting in the dark with philip not so cool nothing she could put her finger on though it was just he wasnt raff and that was no reason to break up with him but finally theyd gone for a drive one afternoon heading up black mountain to the lookout she hadnt wanted to go she remembered and when theyd had a tyre blowout shed been relieved she hadnt been so relieved when they realised philips spare tyre was flat or when he thought she should walk back into town to fetch his fatherbecause he had to look after the car no way am i trudging back to town while you sit here in comfort she retorted youre the dummy who didnt check his spare not so tactful even for a seventeenyearold but she was reaching the point where she wanted to end it philip left her bored she tried out the sound system his tapes were boring top ten stuff nothing she enjoyed she flicked through his tape boxa box just like the one that graced her bedside table beautiful cedar with slots for every cassette his grandpa really was great boring cassettes boring boring but at the back some unmarked ones she slid one in and heard the voice of christabelle thomas a girl in the same class as her at school philip we shouldnt my mumd kill me philip enough she met philip and his father as she stomped down the mountain fuming you were supposed to stay with the car philip told her i didnt like the music she snapped and held up the tape and threw it at him through his fathers car window put the ripped up tape in my letterbox tomorrow or im telling christabelle why think of that now because of raff she glanced up and he was watching her sarah was watching her whats wrong sarah asked and she came back to the present and realised sarah had successfully put the cutting tool in place hey fantastic lets cut she said and the moment had passed the time had passed the tapes had been an aberration philip had brought the tape round the next morning cut to shreds hey abby i need to tell you im sorry christabelle and i only went out a couple of times well before you and me its not what you think i only asked to kiss her and i hadnt realised the tape was on record i record stuff in the car all the time on the trip between here and sydneyi try and recall study notes and then see how accurate ive been i must have forgotten this was still on im so sorry you found it it was okay she conceded it was a mistake kids did stupid things like driving on the wrong side of the road whats wrong sarah asked again and raffs eyes were asking the same question sorry she said i just started thinking about all the things i had to do before the wedding you want us to go home sarah asked and abby winced and got a grip no way im hungry pasta here we come what setting shall we have it on do we want angels hair or tagliatelle angels hair sarah said my favourite raff said it always has been she glanced up and he was looking straight at her he wasnt smiling raff dont she told herself but she wasnt quite sure what she was saying dont to all she knew was that this man meant trouble he was surely causing trouble now they left at nine which gave her an hour to clean the kitchen and to get her thoughts in order before philip arrived he arrived promptly at ten kleppy met him at the door and growled he hadnt growled at raff and sarah but then he knew they were friends he didnt yet know philip was a friend if he bites philip said he wont bite hes being a watchdog i thought you had a headache philip said wary and irritated i hear finn and his sister have been here she sighed she lived in banksia bay she should be used to this sarah brought our wedding present she wanted to demonstrate demonstrate what her grans pasta maker you need to see it philip its cool a secondhand pasta maker its an heirloom pasta makers arent heirlooms this one is she gestured to the battered silver pasta maker taking pride of place on her bench well make pasta once a week for the rest of our lives when were finally in our nursing home well discuss the virtues of each of our children and decide who most deserves our fantastic antique pasta maker if our children are unworthy well donate it to the state gallery as a national treasure he didnt even smile you said you had a headache i did have a headache but you let them in it was sarah she said losing patience her grans pasta maker means a lot to her she was desperate to see me using it you werent well enough to come out to dinner if it was necessary i would have come she snapped it wasnt it was however absolutely necessary for me to show sarah that her grandmothers pasta maker will be appreciated and finn you mean raff of course i mean raff finn he brought sarah here he watched i dont see how you can bear that man to be in the house i can bear a lot for sarah even having a dog foisted onto you kleppy growled again and abby felt like growling herself philip and just like that he caved he put his hands up in mock surrender tossed his jacket over the back of a kitchen chair and hugged her kissed her on the forehead sorry sorry sorry i know you had no choice i know you wouldnt let finn in unless you had no choice of course she wouldnt tell me about tonight she said and he sat and she made him coffee and he told her all about the fantastic business opportunities theyd discussedprojects of mutual benefit that needed careful legal input if they were to get past council and all the while things were changing some time in the last twentyfour hours the buried question had surfaced in her head and it was getting louder and louder until it was almost a drumbeat why am i marrying this man the question was making her feel dizzy a week on saturday shed be married to philip uhoh this was raffs fault she thought feeling desperate raff asking her why did you and dexter stop going out shed shoved that memory away ten years ago not to be thought of again remembering it now how shed felt underneath the logic did she still feel like that this was like waking from a coma a million emotions were crowding in memories stupid childhood snatches laughter trouble tears adventure fun always with raff philip i you need to go to bed he said immediately contrite he rose im sorry i forgot the headache you should have said just because finn barges his way in welcome or not i have a bit more finesse you sleep well and ill see you in the morning breakfast at the yacht club you want to come sailing afterwards mums organised the girls lunch at midday of course so much to plan so much to plan this wedding had been organised for years sleep well sweetheart he told her and stooped and kissed her dry dusty he reached for his jacket and paused frowned felt the pockets my wallet your wallet it was in my side pocket could you have dropped it it was there when i got out of the car he opened the front door and stared out at the path the front light showed the path smooth and bare i always check i have my phone and my wallet when i get in and out of the car of course caution was philips middle name im sure i didnt drop it he said which left she swivelled and looked for kleppy kleppy was at her bedroom door he had something on the floor in front of him a wallet too big she walked over to see and he wagged his tail and beamed up at her she was sure it was a beam it might be the stupidest beam on the planet but it was strangely adorable what have you got it wasnt the wallet it was her jewellery box the cedar box philips grandfather had given her her heart sank if hed chewed it he hadnt how had he got it down from the bedside table there wasnt a mark on it he had his paw resting proprietorially on its lid but when she bent down and took it he quivered all over with that stupid canine beam arent i fantastic look what i found for you that dog philip said in a voice full of foreboding he doesnt have it she said but she looked more closely at kleppy then she looked at her bed kleppy had retrieved the box via the bed she had a pale green quilt on her bed the coverlet was now patterned with footprints she bent down and looked at kleppys paws dirt uhoh uhoh uhoh she looked out through the glass doors to the garden to the fence to where shed dug in netting all the way along lots of lovely loose soil a great place to bury something loose dirt was scattered over the grass in half a dozen places kleppy it seemed had been a little indecisive in his burial location youre kidding me philip said guessing exactly what had happened uhoh what else was a girl to say you expect me to dig no shed had enough she was waking from a bad dream and this was part of it ill find it she told him ill give it to you in the morning clean clean she snapped of course its not my fault the stupid its not your fault she said cutting him off it never was of all the childish no she was being petulant herself she needed to get a grip she needed to find the wallet and then think through what was important here she needed to decide how she could do the unimaginable of course its not your fault she said more gently and she headed outside to start sifting dirt i took kleppy on im responsible go home philip and let me sort the damage my way i can help he started suddenly unsure but she shook her head my headaches come back she said i can use a bit of quiet digging and thinking what do you need to think about weddings she said and pasta makers and dogs and other stuff she wasnt even prepared to let into the corners of her mind until philip was out of the door she dug she should have thought and dug but she just dug her mind felt as if it had been washed clear emptied of everything what was happening everything shed worked for over the last ten years was suddenlynothing stupid stupid stupid this is just prewedding nerves she told herself but she knew it was more she dug it was strangely soothing delving into the soft loam methodically sifting she should be wearing gardening gloves shed worn gardening gloves this afternoon when shed laid the netting but that was when it mattered that she kept her nails nice that was when she was going to get married there was a scary thought she sat back on her heels and thought did i just think that how could she not get married her dress two years in the making approximately two thousand beads two hundred and thirty guests people were coming from england people had already come from england her spare room was already filling with gifts shed have to give back the pasta maker and that was the thing that made her eyes suddenly fill with tears it made her realise the impossibility of doing what she was thinking of handing raff finn back the pasta maker and saying here i cant accept itim not getting married why raff why was his gift so special she knew why she knew the impossibility of what she was thinking made her choke this was stupid nostalgia childhood memories not all childhood memories raff yesterday at the scene of the accident standing in front of her car giving orders raff caring about old mrs ford raff we always wish for what we cant have she muttered to herself and shoved her hand deep into the loam so hard she hit the wire netting and scraped her knuckles she hauled her hand out and an edge of leather came with it she stared down at her skinned knuckle and philips wallet she needed a hug kleppy she called i found it you want to come lick it clean fat chance it was a joke she should be smiling she wasnt smiling kleppy hed be back on her bed she thought how long till he came when she called kleppy she really did want a hug she wiped away the dirt and headed inside no kleppy how many hiding places were there where was he not here not in the house the front door was closed he could hardly have opened it and walked out he was clever but not memory flooded back philip throwing open the door to stare at the front path shed gone to look for kleppy then shed headed straight out to the garden philip leaving slamming the door behind him the door had been open all the time theyd talked her heart sank she should have checked shed been too caught up with her own stupid crisis her own stupid prewedding jitters kleppy was gone chapter eight abby searched block by block first on foot and then fetching the car and broadening her search area how far could one dog get in whathalf an hour more how long had she sat out in the garden angsting about what she should or shouldnt be doing with her life how had one dog made her question herself where was he she wanted to wake up the town and make them search but even her friends to wake them at midnight and say please can you help me find a stray dog was unthinkable theyd think she was nuts sarah wouldnt think she was nuts or raff her friends she thought of the kids shed messed around with when she was a kid theyd dropped away as she was seen as philips girl philips partner philips wife those who remained she winced wondering how shed isolated herself shed done it without thinking how many years had she simply been moving forward with no direction or in philips direction so now who did she call when she was in the kind of trouble philip disapproved of she knew who no she searched for another hour one oclock this was crazy she couldnt do it by herself do not go near raff finn that man is trouble it had been a mantra in her head for years but now it had changed trouble had taken on a new dimensiona dimension she wasnt brave enough to think about she pushed the thought of raff away and kept searching wider and wider circles a small dog hed be safe until morning she told herself he had street smarts he was a stray he wasnt a stray he was isaac abrahams loved dog he wore his owners medal of valour on his collar he was her kleppy she drove on round the town she walked through the deserted mall she walked out onto the wharves at the harbour and then there was only one place left to search isaacs up the mountain in the dark to isaacs she hated that place she couldnt he had to be somewhere after this time logic said that was where hed be she couldnt make herself go alone she justcouldnt dont do it do it at two in the morning she phoned the police the police singular raffs patrol car pulled up outside her front door ten minutes after she called he had the lights flashing he swung out of the car six feet two inches of lethal cop ready for action shed been parked waiting for him in the dark not wanting to wake the neighbours his flashing lights lit the street and curtains were being pulled turn the lights off she begged this is kleppy he said seriously i thought about sirens you want to wake the town how much do you want to find him a lot she snapped and then caught herself i meanplease so how did you lose him you let him out iyes he looked at her face and got an answer dexter let him out by mistake im sure by mistake she snapped how long ago three hours three hours youve only just discovered hes missing there was a whole gamut of accusation in his tone like what had she and philip been doing for three hours that they hadnt noticed theyd lost a dog ive been searching she said through gritted teeth can we just i dont know find him he suggested and suddenly his voice was gentle the switch was nearly her undoing she was so close to tears yes please where have you looked everywhere that just about covers it you sure hes not under your bed im sure thats where we find most missing kids he said within two hundred yards of the family refrigerator you want to look again i trust you is dexter out hunting silence she wasnt going to answer she didnt need to answer imim sorry to call you out she ventured this is what i do hunt for lost dogs when you should be home with sarah sarahs used to me being out in the night she has her dogs are you on duty this is a two cop town when theres an emergency keith and i are both on this is an emergency kleppys definitely an emergency he said hes a loved dog with an owner i was never more relieved than when you said youd take him on for all sorts of reasons he said enigmatically but then kept right on you want to ride with me well check out main street morrisy drapers is his favourite spot ive been there its all locked up the bargain bins are inside no kleppy youve what he demanded brow snapping you walked the mall alone this is kleppy at two on a saturday morning theres the odd drunk and nothing else in the mall yeah and no kleppy his mouth tightened but he said nothing turning the car towards the waterfront he likes the harbour our kleppy isaacs been presented with a live lobster before now isaac had to get kleppys nose stitched but he got him home live and fighting oh she said and choked on a bubble of laughter that was close to hysteria a lobster almost bigger than he was cost isaac a hundred and thirty dollars for the lobster and another three hundred at the vets they had a great dinner that night he had his flashing lights on again now he hit another switch and floodlights lit both sides of the road the law on the hunt ive checked the harbour she said in a small voice already knowing the reaction shed get and she did also by yourself his tone was suddenly angry hell woman you know the dropkicks go down there at night they havent seen kleppy you asked this is kleppy you asked you approached the low life that crawl round that place at night where the hell is dexter in bed she snapped she caught herself fighting back anger in response i know i should have phoned him but hes nothes not quite reconciled to having a dog which is why he left the door open he did not do it deliberately you make one stubborn defence lawyer he said more mildly and went back to concentrating on the sides of the road she fumed or she tried to fume she was too tired and too worried to fume have you tried up the mountain raff asked and she caught her breath the mountain isaacs place n no she swallowed time to confess thats whythats why i called you you didnt go up there i havent not since she paused tried to go on couldnt tonight shed walked a deserted shopping mall tonight shed fronted a group of very drunk youths down at the harbour to ask if theyd seen her dog but the place with the most fears was kleppys home isaacs place up the mountain where ben had been killed to go there at night the last night shed been there would stay in her mind for ever the phone call the rain the dark the smell of spilled gasoline the sight of its just a place abby raff said gently you want to stay home while i check ino she had to get over this ten years she was stuck in a time warp an aching void of loss im sorry you must hate going up there too theres lots of things i hate he said softly but going up the mountains not one of them its isaacs home he was a great old guy he was she remembered isaac the night of the accident of course hed heard the crash hed been first on the scene hed been cradling ben when shed got there all the more reason to love his dog all the more reason to face down her hatred of the place you know you cant block it out for ever raff said work it through and move on like you have she heard the anger in her words and flinched like i try to raff said evenly it always hurts but limbos not my idea of a great time you want to spend the rest of your life there whats that supposed to mean meaning youve never come back he said youre as damaged as sarah is in your own way she shook her head no no im not im fine just find my dog raff ill do my best he said gravely you know taking kleppys a great start kleppys forcing chinks in your lawyerish armour and im not so sure you can seal them up again lets see if we can find him so he can go the whole way isaacs place was locked and deserted a ramshackle homestead hidden in bushland through the fence they could see isaacs garden beautiful in the moonlight but they couldnt get in the front gate the gate was padlocked and a cyclone fence had been erected around the rickety pickets isaacs daughters worried about vandalism before she can get the place on the market raff said she sacked the gardener hired a security firm and put the fence up raff headed off striding around the boundary searching the ground with his flashlight as well as through the fence abby had to run to catch up with him the ground was unsteady raffs hand was suddenly holding hers she should pull awaybut she didnt call him raff said she called her voice ringing out across the bushland eerie in the dark keep calling raffs hand held hers strong and warm and pushing her to keep going well call from the other side he said if hes down nearer the road near the road where ben was killed move on she did move on and raffs hand gave her the strength to do it how inappropriate was that but she called and she called and then unbelievably out through the bush tearing like his life depended on it kleppy came flying straight to her she gasped and stooped to catch him and the little dog was in her arms wriggling with joy she was on her knees in the undergrowth hugging maybe even weeping hey klep raff said and she could hear his relief where have you been hiding she hugged him tight and he licked herthen suddenly he wrenched out of her arms backed off and barkedand tore back into the bush raff made a lunge for him but he was too fast he disappeared back into the darkness you could have held his collar raff said but he didnt sound annoyed he sounded resigned oh my she started to run but raff put his hand out and stopped her we walk we dont run wombat holes logs all sorts of traps for the unwary in the dark but kleppy wont have gone far he said taking her hand firmly back into his you saw himhe was joyful to see you this is isaacs place kleppys territory but i reckon youre his now it seems youre his person to replace isaac thats a fair responsibility abby callahan i hope youre up to it just find him for me she muttered kleppys person she didnt want to think about where that was taking her she didnt actually want to think at all kleppy had headed back down the hill towards the road they were now within two hundred yards of where the cars had crashed it had rained this week the undergrowth smelled of wet eucalypt scents of the night scents she hated shed never wanted to come back here move on raff said holding her hand tightly you can she couldnt the thought that it had been raff the man holding her hand right now raff she could not depend on this man this man was dangerous he always had been hed been dangerous to ben now suddenly he seemed dangerous in an entirely different way but he was the one searching for kleppy not philip that would have to be thought about tomorrow for nowjust get through tonight if hes gone back down to the town why would he do that this is isaacs place youre here everything he knows is here and then before she could respond his flashlight stopped moving and focused kleppy was fifty yards from the road digging he was nosing his way through the undergrowth pawing at the damp earth wagging wriggling digging kleppy she called and started towards him kleppy looked up at herand headed back in the direction hed come from back to isaacs raff sighed you dont make a very good cop he said letting the suspect go sneaking up and then breaking into a run at the last minute whats he doing they were following him again back through the undergrowth once more raff had her hand she absolutely should let it go she didnt i suspect hes one very confused dog raff said he knows where isaac lived but he cant get in hes forming new bonds to you but his allegiance will be tornhell still want isaac and whats back there buriedwho knows some long hidden loot or a wombat hole or something he sniffed on the way past and thought was worth investigating but now hes weighed everything upyou wombats isaacand decided he needs to go back to his first love and raff was right they emerged from the bush and kleppy was waiting for themor rather he was waiting for someone to open the gate his nose was pressed hard against the cyclone fencing and he whimpered as they approached he was no longer running he was no longer joyful to see them abby knelt and scooped him up and he looked longingly at the darkened house hes not there any more she whispered burying her nose into his scruffy coat im sorry kleppy but im it will i do hell grow accustomed raff said and his voice was a bit rougha bit emotional you want me to take you both home she looked at the darkened house then turned and looked out towards the road to where ben had been snatched from her hell grow accustomed ten years her parents would never forgive raff finn how could she its okay kleppy she whispered well manage you and i thank you raff wed appreciate it if you took us home he drove them down from the mountain a woman and her dog and he felt closer to her tonight than he had for ten years maybe it was what she was wearing the normally immaculate lawyercumabby was wearing old jeans a faded sweatshirt and her hair had long come loose from its normally elegant chignon she still had flour on her face from pasta making there were twigs in her hair her face was tearstreaked and she was holding her dog as if she were drowning she made him feel like hed felt at nineteen when abby had started dating philip he and abby had been girlfriend and boyfriend since they were fourteen and sixteen kid stuff not serious she hung round with sarah so she was always in and out of the house she was pretty and she laughed at his jokes she was alwaysthere then hed come home and she was dating philip and the sense of loss had him gutted he should have told her how he felt then only hed been too proud to say okay abby wise choice i know at seventeen you need to date a few people see the world hed been too proud to say that seeing her and philip together had made him wake up to himself had made him realise that the sexiest loveliest funniest happiest most desirable woman in the world was abby he had known it it was just he thought hed punish her a little he and ben had even been a bit cool to herben had hated her dating dexter as well theyd backed off the night of the crash where was abby home washing her hair home being angry with all of them that probably saved her life but what was left afterwards the sexiest loveliest funniest happiest most desirable woman in the entire world had been hidden under a load of grief so great it overwhelmed them all then she was hidden by layers of her parents hopes their fixation that abby could make up for ben and their belief that philip was the ben they couldnt have hed watched for ten years as the layers had built up until the abby hed once known once loved had been almost totally subsumed and there was nothing he could do about it because he was the one whod caused it he felt his fists harden on the steering wheel so tight his knuckles showed white one stupid moment and so many worlds shot to pieces ben and sarah and abby condemned to live for the rest of her life making up for his criminal stupidity you know i once loved you he said into the night and she gasped and hugged kleppy tighter dont i wont he said gently i cant but abby if i could wipe away that night as if anyone could do that no he said grimly and i know i have to live with it for the rest of my life but you dont i dont know what you mean i mean you lost ben that night he said for which im responsible and ill live with that for ever but ben was my mate and if he could see whats happening to you now hed be sick at heart there was a long silence she wasnt talking he was trying to figure out what exactly to say he had no right to say anything hed forfeited that for sure but then forget himself he thought forget everything except the fact that ben had been his best friend and maybe he needed to put what he was feeling himself aside make it about ben he told himself abby hated him already saying what he thought ben would say couldnt make things worse abby your parents and dexters parents are thick as thieves he told her they always have been after the accident your families practically combined the dexters had philip the callahans were left only with abby two families a son and a daughter when ben died you were about to go to university and study creative arts afterwards philip told you how sensible law was your mother told you how happy itd make her to see you at the same law school as philip philips dad told you hed welcome you into his law firm and you justrolled i did not roll she said but it was a whisper he knew didnt even convince herself you used to wear sweaters with stripes you used to wear purple leggings i loved those purple leggings silence i never saw you wear purple leggings after ben died so i grew up we all did that night he said gravely but abby you didnt just leave behind childhood you left behindabby if you mean i left behind stupidity yes i did she snapped how could i not all those years keep away from the finn boy hes trouble thats what my mother said but i never listened not once did i listen and neither did ben and now hes dead he couldnt answer that the car nosed its way down the mountain he could drive faster he didnt keep away from the finn boy he knew ben and abby had been given those orders he even knew why his grandfathers drunkenness his mothers lack of a wedding ring his familys poverty the prissiness of abbys parents secure in their middle class home with their neat front lawn and their nice children i dunno about the callahan kids he remembered gran saying it when he was small as she tucked him into bed you be careful raff love they dont fit with the likes of us theyre my friends and theyre nice kids his gran had said but one day theyll move on dont let em break your heart as a kid he didnt have a clue what she was talking about hed figured it out as he got older but ben and abby never let it happen they simply ignored their parents disapproval and he was a friend regardless but for how long if ben hadnt diedwould abby have gone out with him again and now she was a defence lawyer and he was a cop never the twain shall meet except she was staring ahead with eyes that were blind with misery and she was heading into a marriage with dexter and he couldnt bear it im not talking about us now he said and it was hard to keep his voice even as you say weve both grown up and theres so much baggage between us theres never going to be a bridge to friendship but im not talking about me either abby im talking about you you and dexter hes burying you hes not mrs philip dexter wheres the abby in that equation leave it you know its true would mrs philip dexter ever spend the night trawling banksia bay looking for a dog of course she would she gulped no that isill hang onto kleppy from now on and if dexter leaves the door open he wont dont do it abby butt out they were pulling up outside her house she shoved the door open and hauled kleppy out she staggered a little but straight away he was beside her steadying her she was soso she was abby all he wanted to do was fold her into his arms and hold her dog and all hed had ten years to stop feeling like this he thought he had one stupid night hunting a kleptomaniac dog and he was feeling just what hed felt ten years ago as if here was the half to his whole as if something had been ripped out of him ten years back and this woman was the key to getting his life back this wasnt about him it couldnt be there are lots of guys out there abby he said in a voice that was none too steady guys whod marry you in a heartbeat guys whod love kleppy dont marry dexter get out of my way youre better than this abby weve had this conversation before philips better than any of us he wasnt stupid hes dependable hes boring he doesnt like this town how can you say that he lives for this town he spends his life criticising it making reasons why he should go to conferences far away where are you going on your honeymoon youre suggesting we should honeymoon at mrs macs banksia bays big breakfast no but thats what id have done if id married you her words shocked them both if id married you the unsayable had just been said the unthinkable had just been put out there abby dont she said and pushed and kleppy got caught in the middle and yelped his indignation now see what youve done kleppy wagged his tail wounded to the core think about it he said but softly knowing hed gone too far hed pushed into places neither of them could contemplate going ive thought about it thank you very much for your help tonight any time abby and i mean that ive accepted all the help from you ill ever accept you cant say that what if you need help over the street in your old age there ill be in my fading cop uniform all ready to hold up the traffic and there youll be with your pride and your walking frame dont you stop the traffic for me young man she gasped and choked laughter suddenly surfacing at the image thats better he said abby can we be friends friends she looked at him and the laughter faded her eyes were indescribably bleak no because of ben because of much much more than that dont go near the finn boy hes trouble he said more than that too she whispered you know i you know we he didnt know anything and he couldnt bear it she was looking at him with eyes that were so bleak the end of the world must be around the corner not the marriage of the year banksia bays answer to a royal couplea wedding that had been planned almost since she was a baby she hesitated for just a fraction of a second too long and logic and reason and everything else he should be thinking flew straight out of the window he took her shoulders in his hands he tugged her to himdog includedand he kissed her one minute she was angry and confused intending to wheel away and stalk into the house dignity intact the next minute she was being kissed by raff finn and her dignity was nowhere second time in two days she felt as if her body had opened to this two days ago and shed been waiting for a repeat performance ever since only this wasnt a repeat performance tonight shed been scared and lonely and emotional remembering so much stuff that her head was close to exploding even before raffs mouth met hers it was no wonder that when it did she couldnt handle it she liked control she was a control girl her emotional wiring was neat and orderly his mouth touched hers and every single fuse blew just like that her circuits closed down and every one of the emotions shed been feeling during the night was replaced overridden by one gigantic wire that sizzled and sparked and threatened to blow her tidy existence right out of the water raff finn was kissing her she was kissing raff finn ormaybe she wasnt kissing she was simply dissolving into him ten long years of control ten years of carefully recreating her life was forgotten all she could feel was this man his hands his mouth the taste of him the smell the sheer testosteroneladen charge of him raff the man who was kissing her totally unutterably mindblowingly senseless she had sensations within her right now that she didnt know existed she didnt know feeling like this was possible if she had if she had shed have gone hunting for them with elephant guns oh did she gasp did she moan who knew all she knew was that her mouth was locked on his and the kiss went on and on and she didnt care she didnt care that it was three in the morning and she was engaged to philip dexter and raff finn was a man her family hated raff finn six foot two was holding her and kissing her until her toes curled until her mind was empty of anything but the taste of him this was a pure primeval need it had nothing to do with logic it had everything to do with here and now and raffa man shed wanted since she was eight years old here now andand is that you abigail uhoh this was banksia bay it was three in the morning she lived next door to ambrose kittelty and ambrose watched american sports television all night on pay tvas well as watching out of his front window banksia bay where her life was never her own could never be her own its abby all right somehow finn was putting her away from him and she could have wept to have him so close to know she could never must never is she kissing you mr kittelty sounded almost apoplectic bit of trouble with a dog raff said smoothly im helping the lady get him under control you looked like took two of us to get him settled seems okay now you right maam thats abrahams dog ambrose said yes sir the same dog that took your boot from the bowling club finn said still causing trouble get him put down ambrose said and slammed down the window i didnt know ambrose and phil were related raff said and any last vestige of passion disappeared just like that she felt cold and tired and stupid very very stupid thank you for tonight she said and she couldnt keep the weariness from her voice dont come near you any more thats right she whispered theres too much at stake your marriage to philip you know its much more than that first things first abby he said softly figure the marriage thing out and everything else can come later not with you it cant i know that so goodnight she said and she hugged her dog closea wild dog this he hadnt even wriggled while her brain had been shortcircuitingand she walked inside with as much dignity as she could muster she closed the door as if she was trying not to wake a household there was no household just abby and kleppy and one magnificent wedding dress what will i do she whispered and she leaned back against the closed door kleppy help me out here kleppys butt wriggled until she set him on the floor he headed into the bedroom while she stood motionless trying not to think kleppy headed straight back to her carrying her jewellery box he set it down at her feet and wriggled all over see she had a guy whod steal for her what more did a girl want raff drove half a mile before he pulled over to the side of the road he needed time to think he didnt have the head space to think abby abby abby ten years hed been busy telling abby she should move on could he hed dated other womenof course he had hed set himself up with a life of sorts living in this town keith his partner was getting long in the tooth keith was senior sergeant but for all intents and purposes raff was in charge of the policing in this town when keith retired raff would be it not bad for a boy who meant trouble he was still judged by some in this town but only as someone whose background made people sniff whod been stupid in his youth he was accepted as a decent cop sarah had friends support groups the farm she loved he had everything he needed in life right there except abby how did you tell a woman you loved her he couldnt to lay that on her there was no way she could take it anywhere they both knew that this thing between them he shouldnt have kissed her it reminded him that it was more than a kids dreaming it was as real today as it had been the first time hed kissed her life had been ahead of them exciting wonderful anything had been possible but to love abby now shed closed herself off after bens death shed simply shut down retired into her parents world into philips world and shed never emerged she was junior partner in banksia bays legal firm she was philips fiancée next saturday shed be philips wife the waste do you want to marry her yourself the thought was enough to make him smile only it wasnt a happy smile hed faced facts years ago even if she could shake off the past to live with her parents condemnation with the knowledge that every time she looked at him she was seeing ben theyd destroy each other a couple of kids drove pastlexy netherland driving his dads new ford he bet old man netherland didnt know lexy was out on the tear he had milly parker in the passenger seat theyd be going up the mountain to the lookout only not to look out kids falling in love he could put the sirens on pull em over send em home with their tails between their legs no way could he do that it wasnt long before theyd be adults the world would catch up with them and theyd be accepting life as it had to be as he had loving abby then bens death then the other side where the woman he loved could never find the courage to move on he knew she was having doubtshow could he kiss her and not sense it maybe if he pushed harder he could stop this marriage but then what what would he be doing to her hed pushed her already to look seriously at the life she was facing there was nothing else he could do for ben for himself he put his head on the steering wheel and thumped it hard three times the third time he hit the horn and the dogs in muriel blakes backyard started barking to wake the dead time to move on then back to sarah back home where to move forward in this town there was never a forward chapter nine how to sleep after a night like this she did at last but not until dawn she woke and it was ten oclock and shed been meant to meet philip for breakfast at the yacht club she phoned and he was fine no problem i have three newspapers and dons here with his plans for the new supermarket as long as its safe and clean i can do without my wallet until later ive hardly realised you werent here that was supposed to make her feel better she showered slowly washed her hair took a long time drying it kleppy watched looking anxious im not going anywhere today where i cant take you she told him its the weekend he still looked anxious he climbed onto her bed and then onto the dressing table wriggled himself a spot next to her cedar box his new favourite thing i guess last night upset you she told him abandoning her hairdryer to give him a hug im so sorry about isaac its horrid loving someone and losing them like she had like raff had it was raffs fault but that mantra said over and over in her head for ten years sounded hollow and sad and bleak as deatha sentence stretched into the future as far as the horizon could she put it away find the raff shed once loved whoa what was she thinking its wedding nerves she told kleppy and on impulse she carried him into her spare room where her wedding gown hung in all its glory two years of love had gone into making this dress she set kleppy down the little dog nosed his way around the hem ducked under the fullcircle skirt poked his nose out again and headed back to her she smiled and held him and stared at her dress some more shed loved making this dress loved loved loved once upon a time this was what she was going to do sew for a living make beautiful things make people happy now she was employed getting a low life off the hook she was going to be philips wife but to draw back now the morning stretched on she sat on the floor of her second bedroom and thought and thought and thought her mother rang close to midday you ready darling ready sweetheart dont joke her mother said sharply this is your afternoon like thursday night was philips night philips mother and i will be by to collect you in half an hour dont wear any of your silly dresses now will you dear you know i hate them her silly dresses she meant the ones shed made herself the ones that werent grey or black or cream this was a wedding celebration why not wear something silly polka dots her gorgeous swing skirt with elvis prints all over ill drive myself she told her mother ill meet you at the golf club you wont be late when am i ever oh and mum what im bringing my dog there was a moments grim silence her mother would know what she was talking about the whole town would know shed expected her mother to have vented her disapproval by now hasnt philip talked some sense into you about that yet about that abrahams dog of all the stupid im keeping him well her mothers breath hissed in and abby waited for the eruption but then suddenly abby could hear her smile there was even a tinkling laugh thats okay she said and abby realised she was on speaker phone and her mother was also talking to her father philip will cope with this then back to her they dont let dogs in the club house they do on the terrace as long as i keep him leashed its a gorgeous day im bringing him this is between you and philip not you and us her mother said serenely philip will talk you into sense and we can cope with a dog for one afternoon but dont be late isnt this exciting so many plans finally come together she disconnected so many plans finally come together abby stood and stared at the phone how could she do the unthinkable how could she not im ready sarah looked beautiful hippy beautiful there was a shop behind the main street catering for little girls who wanted to be fairies or butterflies and adults who wanted to be colourful it suited sarah exactly the woman who ran it thought sarah was lovely she rang raff whenever a new consignment arrived and hed wave goodbye to half his weekly salary it was worth it sarahs joy in her pretty dresses and scarves and her psychedelic boots made upwell made up in some measure for the rest shed woken with another of her appalling headaches it had finally eased but she was still looking wan despite her smile pretty clothes were the least he could give her can you drive me to the golf club now i dont want to be late she said anxious shed been looking forward to this week for months abbys prewedding parties abbys wedding itself my car is at your disposal he said and pulled on his policemans cap tipping it like a chauffeur she smiled tell me again why youre not coming at least that was easy its girls only id look a bit silly in a skirt sarah giggled but her smile was fleeting if it wasnt only girls would you want to come sometimes she did this shooting him serious insightful questions right when he didnt need them abbys mother doesnt like me he said deciding to be honest it makes things uncomfortable because of the accident yes oh raff she said and walked over and hugged him its not fair theres not a lot we can do about it sares he told her and kissed her and put her away from him except be happy ourselves which we are how can we help but be happy when youre wearing a bright pink and yellow and purple and blue skirtand your purple boots have tassels do you like them she said giggling and twirling i love them he was making sarah happy he thought as they headed to the golf club to abbys prewedding party at least he could do that no one else no one else philip was sailing hed gone out with his supermarketplanning mates even now he was cruising round banksia bay discussing the pros and cons of investment opportunities how did you tell a guy youd made the biggest mistake of your life when he was out at sea how did you go calmly to your prewedding party when youd made a decision like this how did you call it offwhen you hadnt told your fiancé first all those wedding gifts coming her way shed be expected to unwrap them aargh but by now the gifts would already be in cars heading towards the golf club it didnt make any difference if she said dont give them to me today or if on monday she rewrapped them and sent them all back thatd be her penance sending gifts back that and a whole lot else she drove towards the golf club slowly very slowly kleppy lay beside her and even he seemed subdued she turned into the car park she sat and stared out through the windscreen seeing nothing someone tapped on her window she raised her head and dredged up a smile sarah was peering in at her looking worried whats wrong you look sad do you have another headache oh abby and on your party day raff was right behind his sister in civvies faded jeans and black tshirt stretched a bit too tight no i i just didnt want to be the first to arrive she climbed from the car and sent raff what she hoped was a bright smile a smile that said she knew exactly what she was doing collywobbles he asked and it was just what she needed it was the sort of word that made a woman gird her loins and stiffen her spine and send him a look that was pure defiance why on earth would i have collywobbles id have collywobbles if i was marrying philip go jump philips really handsome sarah said almost as handsome as lionel lionel they said it in unison distracted they looked at each other looked back at sarah lionels cute sarah said sos your dress abby i love the elvises so do i abby said thinking she had one vote at least she loved this dressa tiny bustier a fullcircle skirt covered with elvisesblack and white print with crimson tulle underneath to make it flare it was a party dress a celebration dress what was she celebrating and youve made kleppy a matching bow sarah scooped up the little dog and hugged him hes adorable hes even more adorable than lionel whos lionel abby asked kleppys friend sarah said simply ooh theres margy abbys next door neighbour was pulling up on the far side of the car park a dumpy little woman whose looks belied the fact that she ran the most efficient disability services organisation in the state hi margy can i sit next to you and she dived off carrying kleppy leaving abby and raff together lionel she said because that seemed the safest way to go theres lionel who was isaacs gardener raff said frowning i didnt realise he and sarah knew each other but sarah gets around more than i think okay have a great hens party ill pick sarah up at four raff yes he sounded testy shed said his name she needed to add something on the back of it something sensible but how to say what she needed to say how to think about saying what she needed to say how to get over the impossibility of even thinking about thinking about maybe she should stop thinking her head was about to fall off people were arriving all around them her friends her mothers friends every woman in this little community whod come into contact with her over the years seemed to be getting out of cars carrying gifts into the golf club how many women had her mother invited how many gifts would she need to return abigail that was her mother calling she was standing on the terrace shielding her eyes from the sun trying to see who her daughter was talking to your guests are here you should be receiving them there you go raff said and eased himself back into his car by the way im with sarah thats a cute dress really cute you should try wearing that in court some time raff she didnt want him to go she didnt want see you later he said he drove away she stood there in her elvis dress staring after him like a dummy abigail her mothers voice was sharp what are you thinking youre being discourteous to our guests and what on earth are you wearing a cute dress she thought as she headed up to her mother to her waiting guests abigail what are you thinking what was he thinking nothing hed better not think anything because if he did there was a chasm yawning and it was so big he couldnt see the bottom he needed some work he needed a few kids to do something stupid so he could lay down the law vent a bit of spleen feel in control abby in an elvis dress abby who was marrying philip any minute now the steering wheel was going to break raff his radio crackled into life and he grabbed it as if it were a lifeline it was keith yeah theres a bit of trouble down on the wharf couple of kids chucking craypots into the water and joe paxtons threatening to do em damage im stuck up on the ridge cos john andersons locked himself out can you deal absolutely raff said feeling a whole heap better trouble he could deal with just not how he was feeling about abby the afternoon was interminable she smiled and smiled and thought she should have run what was she thinking letting this afternoon go ahead just because she needed to tell philip first youll make such a lovely couple a credit to the town that was mrs alderson one of her mothers bridge partners were so looking forward to next saturday thank you she said and then realised that mrs alderson was carrying a rather long shoulder bag and something had peeped from the edge and kleppy had justjust he was heading under the table to the full length of his lead looking satisfied she stooped to retrieve it it was a romance novel a brand she recognised a really goodness what was that on the front she snatched it from her dog and handed it back apologising margot alderson turned beetred and stuffed it back into her bag i dont know what youre doing with that dog she snapped hes trouble if you must get yourself a dog get a nice one i have a friend who breeds pekes kleppy looked up at her from under the table and wagged his tail hed done what he wanted hed had his snatch and hed given it to his mistress i kinda like kleppy abby said and you knowi dont even mind a bit of trouble her mothers friend departed still indignant abby stared after her thinkingof all thingsabout the cover of the romance novel the cover showed a truly fabulous hero bare from the waist up i dont mind pecs either she added silently or a bit of hot romance he had two kids in the cells waiting for their parents to come and collect them take your time hed told them itll do em good to sweat which meant he was stuck at the station babysitting two drunken adolescents forced to do nothing but think abby a man could go quietly nuts it wasnt fair to interfere more than he already had he wasnt feeling fair if i was a neanderthal id go find me a club and a cave he muttered he wasnt he was banksia bays cop and abby was a modern nonneanderthal woman who knew her own mind he had to respect it i miss the old days he said morosely itd be so much easier to go set up a cave it was over the last gift was in her fathers van being taken home to their spare room abbys old bedroom pink pretty i wish youd come home for your last week her mother said hugging her its where you belong abby said no as she always said no they left leaving abby sitting on the terrace with kleppy philip was coming by to meet her she had to tell him her mothers words its where you belong where did she belong she didnt know what do you mean you dont want to get married to say philip was gobsmacked would be an understatement he was staring at her as if shed lost her mind maybe she had i cant she muttered miserable shed tried to get him to go for a walk with her to get away from the people in the bar he wouldnt they were out on the terrace but they were still in full view philip was tired from sailing he didnt want a walk he wanted to go home have a shower take a nap then take his fiancée out to banksia bays newest restaurant that was what hed planned he hadnt planned on abby being difficult he hadnt planned on a broken engagement its just kleppy she said in a small voice and philip stared at her as if she were demented the dog hes made me what what indeed she hardly understood it herself how one dog could wake her from a tenyear fog you dont like him she said of course i dont like him philip snapped hes a mutt but im prepared to put up with him i dont want you to put up with him she took a deep breath tried to say what she scarcely understood herself the thing in the middle of the fog i dont want you to put up with me what are you saying you dont like me philip he looked at her as if shed lost her mind of course i like you i love you havent i shown you that over and over this is craziness prewedding nerves to say you dont like this dress do you he stared down at the elvises and he couldnt quite repress a wince no but and you painted your living roomour living room when i move inbeige i dont like beige then well paint it something else i can cope see thats exactly what i mean youll put up with something else like you put up with me this is nonsense they were sitting at the table right on the edge of the terrace with a view running all the way down the valley to the coast below it was the most beautiful view in the world if anyone looked out from the bar right now theyd see a man and a woman having a tête à tête she flashing a diamond almost as wide as her finger he taking her hand in his visibly calming down mum said this was bound to happen philip said she felt like this when she married my father a week before the wedding prewedding jitters philips mother a mouse totally dominated by philips fatherand by philip himself shed seen philips mother looking at her dress today not brave enough to say she liked it but justlooking i dont want to be beige she whispered you wont be beige youll be very happy theres nothing you want that i cant give you i want you to like my dog she felt as if she was backed into a corner trying to find reasons for the unreasonable trying to explain the unexplainable ill try and like your dog but why she said there are women out there who like beige there are women out there who dont like mutts why do you want to marry me i was always going to marry you thats just it she said and it was practically a wail weve just drifted into this we did not drift i made a decision ten years ago you wanted to marry me ten years ago of course i did he sighed exasperated its okay i understand one week of prewedding nerves isnt going to mess with ten years of plans philip i dont want to she said and before she could think about being sensible she hauled the diamond from her finger and laid it on the table in front of him i cant i knowi know its sensible to marry you youre a good man i know youve been unfailingly good to me i know youll even put up with my dog and paint your living room sunbeamyellow if i really want but you know what i want someone who likes sunbeamyellow what the is there someone else someone else at the thought of who that someone else wasat the sheer impossibility of saying his name voicing the thought her courage failed her her courage to say raff but not her courage to do what she must right now i cant she said quietly no matter what this isnt about someone else philip its about what im feeling finding kleppy yeah its crazy but he makes me laugh hes a little bit nuts and i love it i wish you loved it you dont and its made me see that i dont want to be mrs philip dexter youve been wonderful to me philip you deserve a woman who thinks youre wonderful in return you deserve a woman wholl love the life you want to live instead of putting up with it and you deserve a woman who youll think is wonderful instead of putting up with her abby he was truly shocked now ashen and she felt dreadful appalling she had to do this she pushed the diamond closer to him so close it nearly fell off the edge of the table philip was a sensible man this diamond was worth a fortune he didnt let it fall he took it looked down at it for a long moment and then carefully zipped it into the pocket of his sailing anorak he rose im damp in these clothes he said pale and angry i need to get changed and you you need to think about what youre throwing away youre being foolish beyond belief insulting even i know its prewedding nerves and ill make allowances think about it overnight ill come and see you in the morning when youve had time to reconsider i wont reconsider you have twentyfour hours to see sense he snapped after all ive done for you i cant believe youd be so ungrateful to walk away from me of all the crazy why dont you just get on a slow boat to china and be done with it a slow boat to china right now the concept had enormous merit but she wasnt going anywhere she couldnt move she sat and stared sightlessly over the golf course and she thoughtnothing someone came and cleared her glass asked if shed like another drink asked if she and philip were going to china for their honeymoon finally let her be theyd be muttering in the bar wondering what she was doing just sitting expecting philip to come back maybe theyd seen his anger his tight lips his rigid stance as hed stalked to his car maybe the town already knew she wouldnt tell anyone she couldnt philip had given her twentyfour hours to come to her senses she owed it to him to wait to make him see it was a measured sensible decision is there someone else she thought of philips demand was there raff had kissed her twice hed made her feel she couldnt afford to acknowledge how he made her feel klep the call jolted her out of her misery an unfamiliar voice filled with joy it was one of the golf course groundsmen striding up from the first tee she looked closer and recognised him lionel isaacs gardener a big burly man in his midthirties slow and sleepy and quiet he reached her and knelt on the terrace and kleppy was

anger and he said its all about that stupid dog are you out of your mind she laid back on the pillows and listened to her mothers hysteria and thought about it was she out of her mind kleppy was asleep on her feet she could sleep with kleppy for ever if she didnt do something about raff she couldnt do something about raff there was nothing to do its okay mum ill sort it she said sort it tell philip its all a ghastly mistake you know if it means the difference between whether you marry or not your father and i will even keep the creature the creature nuzzled her left foot and she scratched

practically a wail because i dont want to be sensible i like being a dog owner i like that my dogs a thief she thought about it and decided why not go for broke her mother could hardly be any more upset than she was now i might as well tell you i dont think i want to be a lawyer either youve lost your mind her mother moaned john come and tell your daughter shes lost her mind darling well take

think i need to find out and i cant do that as mrs philip dexter rumour is shes thrown him over rumour is she met some guy at that conference she went to in sydney last month chinese millionaire loaded couple of kids by a past marriage but thats not worrying her rumour is she wants to take the dog raff spent the morning feeling surprised go away im not home she was pretending not to be home the first couple of times the doorbell rang kleppy barked which might be a giveaway but she fixed that she tucked him firmly under the duvet and she put her jewellery box down there with him which reminded her should she give the box back to philips grandfather hed given it to her as a labour of love on the premise she was marrying his grandson maybe he was one of those out there ringing her doorbell sent by her mother to tell her to be sensible it couldnt matter go away go away go away how long could she stay under the duvet she started working out how much food she had in the place when shed be forced to do a grocery run she thought of the impossibility of facing shopping in banksia bay maybe she and kleppy could leave town for a bit where could she go somewhere raff could find her if he wanted to find her dont think of that dont think of raff get this awfulness out of the way and then look forward please the doorbell rang again go away it rang again more insistent and it was followed by a knock too loud to be her mother philip go away abigail callahan the voice was stern with authority and it made her jump raff raff was right outside her front door panic what did he think he was doing hiking up to her front door as bold as brass she peeked past the curtains and his patrol car was parked out front with its lights flashing she practically moaned this was all she needed who knew what the town was saying about her but she did not need raff in the mix it was all too complicated kleppy whined sensing her confusion and she hugged him and held her breath and willed raff to go away but raff finn wasnt a man to calmly turn away abigail callahan i know youre in there answer the door please or ill be forced to come back with a warrant a warrant what the go away she yelled it to the front door and there was a moments silence and then a response deep and serious and only someone who knew him well could hear the laughter behind it miss callahan im here to inform you that your dog is suspected of petty larceny i have information that stolen property may be being stored on your premises open the door now please or ill be forced to take further action her dog petty larceny she lifted the duvet and stared at kleppy who gazed back innocent as you please what the he hadnt been out how could he have stolen anything shed given back her mothers friends romance novel kleppy was clean he hasnt done anything she yelled and then had to try again because the first yell came out more like a squeak go find some other dog to pin it to kleppys innocent there speaks a defence lawyer sorry maam but the evidence points to kleppy what evidence mrs fryers diamanté glasses case given to her by her late husband its said to be worth a fortune plus it has sentimental value its alleged it was stolen from her bag which was parked underneath the table you were sitting at yesterday i have reason to believe your dog was tied under that very table circumstantial ill grant you but evidence enough for a warrant uhoh she thought about it kleppy lying innocently at her feet through yesterdays lunch a big table twelve or so women twelve or so handbags at their respective owners feet uhoh uhoh uhoh i have more serious things to think about this morning than glasses cases she managed and she heard the laughter intensify youre saying theres something more serious than grand theft i thought it was petty larceny that depends whether the diamantés are real mrs fryer swears they are i knew old jack fryer and im thinking otherwise but i need to give the lady the benefit of the doubt he hasnt got them she wailed hed have given them to me by now i need to search go away let me in abigail he said stern again the neighbours are looking oh for heavens sake raff walking in here if anyone in this town got even the vaguest sniff of what she was feelingof why shed been jerked out of her miserable life into something resembling a future her future the word somehow steadied her she wasnt marrying philip she had a future okay maybe she needed to step into it rather than hiding under the duvet she climbed out of bed and shrugged on her brand new honeymoon wrap where was her shabby pink chenille shed got rid of it of course she had that was what a girl did when she was getting married so now she was stuck with pure silk pure silk and raff she shoved her toes into elegant white slippers pasted a glower on her face and stomped through to the front door hauled it open raff was there in his cop uniform he lookedhe looked maybe how he looked wasnt the issue whoa he said his gaze raking her from the toes up and she felt herself start to burn shed had fun buying herself wedding lingerie shed never owned silk before it was making her body feel well something was making her body feelas if it had been a really bad idea to give all her shabby stuff to the welfare store the way raff was looking stop it she practically stamped her foot raff was a cop he was here to search the place what she was thinking she knew what she was thinking and shed better stop thinking it right now instead she concentrated on keeping her glower at high beam and stood aside as he came in i dont want you here what a lie needs must you say you dont have a glasses case maam if you say maam once more i may be up for copicide copicide whatever justifiable homicide kleppy didnt pinch anything are you sure she winced at that um no he grinned not such a good defence lawyer then so whats with the millionaire the millionaire the guy youve thrown philip over for the millionaire if he only knew i hate this town she muttered and she didnt need to try and glower so its all a lie whats a lie that youve tossed philip aside and found another yes no i mean he caught her hand and held it up for them both to see shed been wearing philips ring for two years now a stark white band showed where the ring had been proof raff said softly if i ran off with someone else i wouldnt be here now she snapped and if he was a millionaire id have a rock to match but youve given philip the flick philip and i are taking time to reassess our positions he surveyed her thoughtfully once more taking in the silk thats lawyer speak for a ripper of a fight and no ones speaking does this mean sarah and i get our pasta maker back that was a punch below the belt but still the pasta maker and philip or no pasta maker and no philip no choice how had she changed so much this time last week shed been the perfect bride now here she was standing in the hall with her criminal dog behind her with raff right here right in her hall big sexy smiling raff ill check my bag she muttered but he put her aside quite gently no maam ill check your bag i dont want evidence tampered with youre thinking of taking paw prints he chuckled a lovely rich sound that filled the hall that made her feellike there might be something on the far side of this awfulness her bag was by the front door where shed tossed it when shed come in yesterday big bright covered with elvises shed made it as a picnic bag thinking wistfully her elvis dress would look cute on picnics as if mrs philip dexter would ever go on picnics now the bag was stuffed with legally gathered lootall the small gifts shed been given yesterday these were the gifts shed have to sort and send back with a note saying very sorry she wasnt marrying philip shed have to reword that she wasnt sorry at all especially now raff was here he squatted beside the bag and started laying gifts out on the floor candle holdersvery tasteful place matsa girl cant have too many place mats whats with the scentopine air freshener oh thats from mrs fryer she really doesnt like your kleppy hey his and her key ringsvery useful oh and whats this this was a glasses case exceedingly tasteful pink and purple studded with huge diamantés worth a billion raff said appreciatively every diamond over a carat but not a one out of place lovely soft mouth our villain the villain had come to investigate pushing his way through the crack in the bedroom door nosing his way to the crime scene checking out the glasses case putting his paw on it then looking back to abby and wagging his tail dont say a thing klep abby said no admissions his dnas all over it he put it on just now hes as horrified as i am and you youve let the suspect himself contaminate the crime scene im appalled he grinned and rubbed kleppy under the ear and kleppy wriggled his tail lifted the glasses case delicately from his hand and headed back into the bedroom straight under the duvet with the rest of his loot raff looked through to the bedroom thoughtful maybe i should search in there too dont you dare she said suddenly panicking and he straightened and his smile faded i wont you okay ill live you have a hard few days ahead i hope your millionaires going to take care of you raff mmm he was watching her justwatching the laughter had gone now he was intense and caring and big and male andand i think i can put ben behind me she said and his face stilled sorry i how to say the unsayable how to get it out shed never intended in a few months maybe when the dust had settled but now here i think i might love you she whispered and the thought was out therehuge filling the house with its danger danger that was what it felt like she thought a sword hanging over her head threatening to fall falling in love with the bad boy i knowthis is dumb she was stammering stupid with confusion its not the time to say it i shouldnt i mean i dont know whether you want it im not sure even that i want it but i fell in love with you twenty years ago raff finn and i cant stop this weekits jolted me out of everything its made me see your craziness broke my heart but it hasnt changed anything i cant i cant stop loving you if i can forgive what happened with ben is there a chance for us for us his face was emotionless still wary once upon a time we were boyfriend and girlfriend she hadnt got this right she knew it but she didnt know how to get it right i was hoping we might get together again yes now youve forgiven me iyes but theres no chance at all he said and suddenly there was no trace of laughter no trace of gentleness nothing at all his voice was rough and cold and harsh he looked stunnedand unbelievably he looked as if shed just struck him if i can forgive what happened to ben what sort of statement is that its what i need to do what do you mean he demanded if im to love you i need to forgive you if im to love you all im saying is that i can all im saying is that i think i have silence silence silence and more silence she couldnt bear it she wanted to dive back under the duvet and hide hide from the look on raffs face but there was no escaping that look there was such pain theres no such thing as forgiveness for ben he said at last and the harshness was gone it had been replaced with an emptiness that was even more dreadful if you have to say it its still there of course its still there of course he repeated how can it not and it always will be he took a deep breath another the silence was killing her she had this wrong she didnt know how she didnt know what she could do to repair it would it ever be possible to repair it abby ten years ago i was crazily criminally stupid he said at last speaking slowly emphasising each word as if it were being dragged out of him i cant think about it without hating myself but you know what ive moved on youve if i hadnt then id go insane he said how do you think i felt my best friend dead my sister irreparably injured and me with no memory of it at all i was gutted by bens deathi still am to lose such a friend to inflict such pain on everyone who loved him and more every time i look at sarah i know what ive done but after ten years another deep breath another silence after ten years i have it in perspective he said ive seen a lot of stupid kids a lot of appalling accidents theres always a driver its always someones fault but in those situations you know what there are other things too kids egging other kids on being dumb themselves that night ben wasnt wearing a seat belt we had em fittedmy gran insisted on it sarah wasnt wearing a seat belt eithershe was wearing a cute new dress she knew would crush none of us should have been up there on that track in the rain it was totally dumb yes i was driving yes i must have veered to the wrong side of the road and philip says i was speeding ive taken that on board ive convicted myself and ive received my sentence ive lost ben as youve lost ben ive lost parts of sarah and my actions hurt so many had so many repercussions they can never be repaired thats what i live with abby every day of my life and im not adding to it i donti dont know what you mean if we took this further waking up every morning beside a woman who says she forgives me what sort of sentence it that this weekokay ive kissed you and yes ive wanted you ive given you a hard time about marrying philip and you know what last night when the whispers went round that youd given back his ring for one breathtaking moment i thought maybe we could figure out some sort of future but now you forgive me graciously lovingly thanks but no thanks i cant live with that abby you do what you need to do but dont factor me in fetch mrs fryers glasses case please i need to go raff dont push this any further he snapped figure it out for yourself its your life ive done what i need to survive and forgiveness doesnt come into it acceptancethats a much harder call she stared up at him confused shattered knowing thoughknowing in the back of her mind that he was right she forgave him where was a future in that raff returned the glasses case to mrs fryer who took it with suspicion and examined it from all angles for damage she glared at him and he thought that if it had been his dog that had taken the case hed be up on charges by now even though the case was worth zip diamonds hed seen a diamond that big and he knew what a real one looked like that diamond was sitting in philips security safe by now he thought that it wasnt sitting on abbys finger he couldnt afford to go there did you see her mrs fryer hissed see who maam abigail i did shes extremely apologetic i believe she may come round later and apologise in person was there anyone with her her dog raff said neutrally and mrs fryer sighed in exasperation no dummy i mean a man is there anyone else i believe the crime was the dogs own work raff said and turned and left before mrs fryer could slap him anyone else no only him shed tossed philips ring back at him because she lovedhim i think i might love you the words echoed over and over in his head where did a man go with that without thinking he found himself driving past his little farm further up the mountain up near isaacs place to the road where one night ten years ago his world had been blasted to bits how long did a man suffer for one moments stupidity hed stopped suffering almost hed almost found peace until abby had said i think i might love you he couldnt afford to let her words rip him apart he had his life to get on with and she had hers it might be a good idea if she did go to china chapter eleven on sunday afternoon abby decided that she did need to speak to philip it was only fair what followed was a very stilted phone call philip sounded appalled and angry and confused she crept back under her duvet and hugged kleppy and decided she didnt need milk or bread she could live on baked beans for a while the whole town was judging her on monday she decided she couldnt hide under her duvet for ever she had to pull herself together she was not a whimpering mess she was not hiding a millionaire under her bed she needed to get on with her life that meant getting out of bed dressing as she always dressed smart and corporate for the last time today shed wind up this court case with philip and then shed resign shed talk reasonably to her parents shed start sending gifts back and then figure slowly and sensibly where she wanted to take her life from here she did need to be sensible she no longer wanted to be a lawyer but that didnt mean stranding philip or stranding her clients without reasonable notice that was the sort of thing an hysterical exbride would dothe sort of woman whod throw philip over for some crazy unreasonable love she wasnt that woman shed ended an unsuitable engagement for totally sensible reasons and she was totally in control she entered court with her head held high she sat in court and concentrated on lookingnormal she was aware that the courthouse held more people than it had on friday thatd be because people were looking at her the woman who ditched philip dexter no matter she was in control kleppy was safely locked up she looked neat and respectable and her court notes were beautifully filed in her lovely italian briefcase in the order they were needed as the morning stretched on she decided she hated her briefcase shed give it back to philip she thought that was sensible he might find a use for a matching pair back home her wedding dress was packed in tissue waiting for someone to make another sensible decision what to do with two thousand beads decisions decisions decisions she concentrated on taking notes for philip handing him the papers he needed keeping on her sensible facebut it was really hard and when raff entered the courtroom she thought her face might crack quite soon philip had called raff back on a point of law just clarifying the prosecution case just decimating the case raff had put together with such care raff wasnt a lawyer and he had no help the crown prosecutor was hopeless she wanted to cross the room and shake him but malcolm was eighty and he looked like if she shook him his teeth would fall out or hed die of a coronary wallace baxter would get off she could hear it in philips voice philip might not have had a very good weekendyes his fiancée had jilted himbut there was nothing of the destroyed lover in his bearing as the morning wore on he started sounding smug he was winning he sat down beside her after pulling the last of raffs evidence apart and he gave her a conspiratorial smile he didnt mind she thought incredulously he didnt mind that shed thrown back his ringor not so much that it stopped him enjoying winning her sensible face was slipping this is brilliant wallace hissed beside her philips great the stuff hes done to get me off but whats this i hear about your engagement being off youd be a fool to walk away from a guy this great a guy this great wallace was beaming she felt sick she stared around to the back of the court where bert and gwen mackervale looked close to tears because of wallace baxters deception theyd had to sell their house they were living in their daughters spare bedroom she thought of lionel a lovely gentle man whod live in a rooming house for ever because of wallace and because of philips skill in defending him she looked at wallace and philip and the smile between them was almost conspiratorial the vague suspicions shed been having about this case cemented into a tight knot of certainty the stuff hes done to get me off she was lawyer for the defence sensible defence lawyers did not question their own cases shed stopped being sensible on saturday afternoon or she thought she had maybe there was more sensible she had to discard she looked at wallacea guy whod systematically cheated for all his life she looked at philip smug and sure she looked at raff whod lost control of a car one dark night when he was nineteen years old forgive its nailed philip said lets see finn get out of this finn get out of this wallace surely but she looked at philip and she knew he hadnt made a mistake morality didnt come into it raff was on the other side therefore raff had to be defeated how could she ever have thought she could marry philip how could her life have ended up here her head was spinning define sensible sitting in a banksia bay courtroom defending wallace baxter wallace and philipsmug winning wallace and philip the stuff hes done to get me off her thoughts were racing suspicions surfacing everywhere she didnt know for sure but in philips briefcase the briefcase that matched hers what was she thinking raff was leaving now his evidence finished she could see by the set of his shoulders that he knew exactly what would happen hed done his best for the townfor a town that judged him wallace was smiling philip was smiling there were only a couple of minor defence witnesses to go and then summing up unlessunless she couldnt bear it philip smiling the model citizen raff grim and stoic the bad boy she was a mess of conflicting emotion she was trying to get things clear but it was like wading into custard all she knew was that she couldnt stay here a moment longer excuse me she said to the men beside her i need to go where philip said astounded to check on kleppy he gets into trouble alone you cant walk outto check on a dog no she said not just to check a dog much much more she rose and the eyes of the court were on her too bad she wasnt sure what she was doing but there was no way in the world she could sit here any longer bye she said to the courtroom in general dont be stupid philip snapped and she looked at him for a long moment and then she shook her head i wont not any more bye philip she lifted up the glossy italian briefcase from under the desk swiftly checking she had the right discreet initials and she strode out of the court her pert black shoes clicked on the floor as she walked and she didnt look back once raff paused in the entrance to take a few deep breaths to think there was no one to punch hed wanted to punch dexter for maybe ten years he couldnt good cops didnt punch defence lawyers dexter was just doing his job another deep breath raff he turned and abby was closing the courtroom door leaning against it closing her eyes hey he said and she opened her eyes and met his gaze full on hey she sounded like someone just waking up you taking a break i need to go home and check kleppy fair enough he hesitated thought about offering her a ride thought that might be a bad idea her sports car was close in the place marked abigail callahan solicitor her spot was closer than the one marked police it wasnt as close as dexters though dexter and the judge had parking spaces side by side dexters porsche was the most expensive car in the car park get through the other side of anger he told himself harshly was there another side abby had passed him now walking into the sunlight to her car she raised her briefcase to lay it in the passenger seat hesitated she lowered her briefcase fiddled with the catch raised it again tipped papers went everywhere a sprawl of legal paperwork fluttering in the sunlight and tapes a score of tiny audio cassettes whoops she said as tapes went flying the abigail callahan hed known for the last ten years would never say whoops but she didnt look fussed she didnt move she didnt begin to pick anything up he didnt move either he wasnt sure what was going on you know these should probably be picked up she said they might be important might they im sorry to trouble you but i seem to have taken the wrong briefcase she said sounding carefully neutral but im in such a hurry would you mind putting the stuff back in and returning it to philip what the theres no rush she continued philip has his notes on the desk so he wont miss these for a while maybe you could go back to the station to sort them into order before you give them back im sure philip would think that was a kindness she sighed then looking at the mess of tapes and paperwork this is what comes of having matching briefcases she said theyre so easy to mix up i told philip it was a bad ideai did want a blue one but at least i do know this is philipsbecause of the tapes philip always records his client appointments hes a stickler for recordingeverything he always has my briefcase holds files for submission to court philips files and tapes are always in much more detail they stood staring at each other in the sunlight abby the tapes raff she said gently and she gave him a wide impudent smile it was a smile he hadnt seen for years it made him feel it made him feel as if abby was back youll take care of them she asked iyes what else was a man to say have fun then she said and she climbed into her car im sure you will he collected the tapes with speedsomething told him it might be important to have them collected and be gone before dexter realised the mixup he thought about abby he headed back to the station thinking about abby life was gettinginteresting have fun he should be thinking about tapes he was but he was also thinking about abby she went home but only briefly she changed into jeans collected kleppy and headed up the mountain she had some hard thinking to do and it seemed the mountain was the place to do it for a little bit she thought about philips briefcase but by the time she reached the mountain shed forgotten all about philip shed moved on she parked out the front of isaacs placethe safest place to park kleppy whined against the fence and she cuddled him and thought ben was here that was why shed come ben had died up here in the thick bushland on the mountain a place that had magically been spared logging where the gums were vast and the scenery was breathtaking after all these years suddenly it felt right that she was here with him her brother for the last ten years ben had been lost and shed been empty with kleppy carefully on the leadwho knew what hed find hereshe walked along the side of the road where the crash had happened the smells were driving kleppy wild he tugged to the place hed been digging the night she and raff had been here but she pulled him away no wombat holes she told him sorry klep but this trip is about me she reached the foot of the crest the road was incredibly narrow the trees were hugethey were so close to the road two cars colliding at speed theyd never stood a chance she thought of that night of how theyd been before five kids fledgling love affairs the things theyd all done stupid kids trying their wings theyd been so sure they could fly the only unknown was how far theyd been kids who thought they were invincible one stupid night she sank onto the verge at the side of the road and hugged her dog raffs right she whispered the emotions of the past two days kaleidoscoping and merging into one clear vision to forgive that means he was wrong the rest of us were right thats how weve acted and thats what hes worn hes accepted total blame how hard must that have been a truck was approaching slowly a rattler it came over the crest and slowed and stopped lionel climbing out looking worried are you okay he asked then he saw kleppy and kleppy saw him it was hard to say who was most delighted and it took a while before lionel finally told her why he was here i keep coming up hoping shes left the gate open lionel told her mr isaacs daughter shes locked the place and i cant water the spuds we were growing blue ones this year just to see what theyre like its a lovely garden it was a lovely garden he said sad again and he gave kleppy a final hug and rose the gates still shut yes id better slope off then he said sadly back to the golf course he sighed and glanced towards the garden you gotta put stuff behind you ill be good at growing grass you will too i might go out to see sarah some time he said diffidently you be out there too iprobably not im not sure youre sarahs friend i am and the coppers friend raff i hope so hes good lionel said when i wanted to keep kleppy he came to see my landlady told her how much i wanted him didnt make any difference but he tried i reckon a man like thats a friend hehe is and i bet hes pleased kleppys found you lionel said and he hugged kleppy one last time and headed off back to his golf course she sat on the verge with her dog for a while longer letting her thoughts go where they willed she fiddled with the medal on kleppys collar thought about lionel thought about isaac isaac abrahams was a brave man she thought hed been through so muchand hed gone through more for his dog and raff hed faced condemnation from this community from the time he was a kid and after bens death it had been overwhelming hed been based in sydney at the police training college when the accident happened all hed needed to do to escape censure was move sarah into a sydney apartment and never come back hed come back and faced condemnation because this was the place sarah loved what you did for love she hugged her dog and looked at his collar and thought about what brave meant and what forgiveness was tears were slipping down her cheeks now and she didnt care these tears should have been cried out years ago only shed shut them out shut herself down turned into someone who couldnt face pain turned into someone she didnt like could raff like her in time maybe if she changed and waited for a while but then she thought about the expression on his face as shed told him if i can forgive what happened with ben how could she have said it how could she be so hurtful kleppy whined and squirmed and she hugged him tighter than he approved she let him loose a little and he licked her from throat to chin she chuckled oh kleppy i love you love the word hung out there four letters a concept huge in what it meant love she whispered it again trying it out for size thinking of all its implications love i love raff she told kleppy and kleppy tried the tongue thing again no she set him down and rose staring along the track where ben had died i love you kleppy but i love raff more ben i love raff was it stupid to talk to a brother whod been dead for ten years who knew and it was probably her imagination that a breeze rustled through the trees right then a soft embracing breeze that warmed her that told her it was okay that told her to follow her heart just as well she told her big brother in a tone she hadnt used for ten years you always were bossy but you cant boss me out of this one i love rafferty finn i love banksia bays bad boy and theres nothing you or anyone else can do to change my mind chapter twelve the sight of wallace baxters face as the crown prosecutor asked a seemingly insignificant question about a bank account in the seychelles was priceless as crown prosecutor malcolm might be too tired to do hard research but when something was handed to him on a plate he shed twenty years in twenty seconds raff slipped him a question with a matching document and suddenly malcolm was the incisive legal machine hed once been wallace baxter was heading for jail the people hed ripped off might even be headed for compensation and thered be more raff thought with grim satisfaction raff had spent half an hour with keith poring through documents listening to snatches of conversation before raff found the seychelles document and they knew they had enough to pin baxter they also suspected this was the tip of an iceberg philips tapes might have been intended for blackmail or maybe they were simply a product of an obsessive mind but they covered this case only and thered been murky cases in the past by the time philip finished in court thered be forensic investigators on his doorstep raff thought with satisfaction with search warrants keith though was in charge at that end he was calling for backup raffs role was to return to court focusing on this case only so he listened to malcolm ask his question and wave bank statements he saw the moment philip realised abby had taken the wrong briefcase and he watched his face turn ashen what had philip been thinking to record everything who knew all he knew was that he was very very pleased abby was no longer marrying him he wanted to find her but that was stupid wanting abby had been stupid last night and it was stupid now he could leave the case to malcolm now he left he should go back to help keithbut he didnt instead he stopped at the bakers to buy lamingtons sarahs favourite theyd sit in the sun and eat them he thought he needed to settle but when he got home he remembered sarah was at the sheltered workshop on mondays what was he thinking to forget that maybe hed been thinking about why he couldnt go find abby stupid stupid stupid should he go back and help keith keith would do just fine without himand for some reason he didnt want to see the grubby details of philips profitmaking he didnt want to think about philip instead he turned his attention to the garden there was plenty here that needed doing his grandmother would break her heart if she could see how hed let it run down this was a gorgeous old house but huge there were four bedrooms in the main house and there was another smaller house at the rear where he and sarah had lived with their mother before her death to give them some measure of independence sarah would like to live there now she hankered for independence but she couldnt quite manage she loved it here though to move away he couldnt even if it meant spending his spare time mending and mowing and tending animals and feeling guilty because his grandmothers garden was now mostly grass and he was too close to abby do not go there he told himself he started tugging weeds but then the sound of a car approaching tugged him out of his introspection abby the car door opened and kleppy flew to greet him as if he was his long lost friend missing at sea for years feared dead miraculously restored to life this was the new renewed kleppy sure again of his importance in the world greeting friends as they ought to be greeted he grinned and scratched kleppys stomach as he rolled and kleppy moaned and wriggled and moaned some more i wish someone was that pleased to see me abby said she was right by her car she was smiling he couldnt roll on his back and wriggle but the feeling was similar shed been crying he could see it he wantedhe wanted to back off what shed said if i can forgive what happened with ben hed gone over it in his mind a hundred times and he couldnt get away from it he could not afford to love this woman i came to apologise she said he stilled thought about it thought where it might be going and thought a man would be wise to be cautious why would you want to apologise he rose kleppy gave a yelp of indignation he grinned and scooped kleppy up with him got his face licked didnt mind abby was apologising the forgiveness thing she said and he could see it was an effort to make her voice steady i didnt get it and now you do she was standing beside her little red sports car and she wasnt moving he didnt move either he held her dog and he didnt go near neutral territory between them a chasm ivechanged she said he nodded still cautious you got rid of the diamond thats got to be a start it wasnt the diamond it was kleppy one dog and my life turns upside down he hasnt ended you in jail not yet how much did you know about what was in dexters briefcase was there anything she couldnt disguise the eagerness she didnt know he thought with a rush of relief though hed already felt it the abby he once knew could never have collaborated with dishonesty she hadnt changed so much maybe she hadnt changed very much at all this was the abby he once knew right here theres enough to convict baxter he said mildlythere was no need to go into the rest of it yetand he watched the rush of relief im so glad so are a lot of people me included is that why youre here to find out no i told you i came to say sorry sorry what did that mean he couldnt help her he knew she was struggling but she had to figure for herself where she was going abby he wanted to walk towards her and gather her up and claim her right now he ached to kiss away the tracks of those tears but he had to wait to see if the figuring would come out on his side kleppy and i have been up at isaacs she said weve been sitting on the road where ben was killed mmm nothing more was possible we were all dumb that night we were still he was neutral he was having trouble getting a breath here abby took a deep breath for him sarah and i were seventeen you and ben and philip were nineteen id made my debut with philip and you were mad at me sarah was mad at you so she accepted a date with philip to make you madder still ben was fed up with all of usi think he wanted to go out with sarah so he was fuming then the car the rain it would have been far more sensible to wait till the next weekend but ben had to go back to uni so he was aching to try the car abby let me say it she said im still trying to figure this out for myself so let me say it as i see it now okay what else was a man to say my dad came up here that afternoon and he was angry with ben for spending the weekend here and not sitting in our living room giving mum and dad a minute by minute description of life at uni so dad didnt take any interest he should have said dont try the car until next weekend or even offered to go with you and watch and sarah i remember her trying on the dress id just finished making for her and your gran saying dont you crush that dress sarah after all the time i spent ironing it and i was home fed up with the lot of you so so it was all justthere she said pressure on you to drive on a night that wasnt safe excitement knowledge that no one used that track except loggers and no loggers worked over the weekend stupid kids and unsafe decisions and a slippery road and pure bad luck sarah not wanting to crush her dress ben being too macho to wear a seat belt philip wanting to show off his car his girlfriend you werent charged with culpable driving raff and there was a reason my parents took their grief out in anger their anger souredlots of things it enveloped me and ive been too much of a wuss to fight my way out the other side and now you have it was a hard question to ask it was a hard question to wait for an answer but it seemed she had an answer ready you kissed me she said simply and it made me realise that i want you i always have that want that need got all mixed up buried subsumed by grief by shock by obligation ive been a kingsized dope raff it took one crazy dog to shake me out of it the dog in question was passive now shrugged against raffs chest raff set him down with care it seemed suddenly important to have his arms free so youre saying im saying i love you she said steadily and surely i know it seems fast weve been apart for ten years so maybe i should gradually show you ive changed but you know what i cant wait ive messed the last ten years up do i need to mess any more he didnt move he didnt let himself move not yet there were things that needed to be said your parents hate me he said at last because it was important hate always was they have a choice she said steadily now and certain her eyes not leaving his they can accept the man i love or not its up to them but it wont stop me loving you ill try and explain but if they wont listen she took a deep breath i cant live with hate any more raff or with grief i cant live under the shadow of a tenyearold tragedy you and me she gazed round the disreputable farmyard you and me and sarah and sarah she was going there shed accept sarah he knew she would he could never leave sarah that fact had coloured every relationship hed had since the accident but this was the old abby emerging and it was no longer an issue this was the abby who held to her friendships no matter what whod never stopped loving sarah the abby with a heart so big so big she could ignore her parents hatred so big she could take on the finn boy and then he paused another vehicle was approaching travelling fast its speed gave it a sense of urgency and he and abby paused and waited it was a silver porsche philip for ten years abby had never seen philip angry shed seen him irritated frustrated condescending shed always felt there was an edge of anger held back but shed never seen it she was seeing it now his car skidded to a halt in a spray of gravel and the hens clucking round the yard squawked and flew for cover kleppy dived behind her legs and stayed there philip didnt notice the hens or kleppy he was out of the car crashing the door closed staring at her as if she were an alien species raff was suddenly beside her taking her hand in his holding her against him uhoh she should pull away holding hands with raff would inflame the situation she tugged but raff didnt let her go instead he tugged her tighter his body language was unmistakable my woman dexter threaten her at your peril how had it come to this so thats it philip snarled staring at the pair of them as if theyd crawled from under raffs pile of weeds you slut its not polite to call a lady a slut raff said and his body shifted imperceptibly between them you want to take a cold shower and come back when youre cooler you sabotaged the case philip said incredulously ignoring raff the bank accounts suddenly you leave and my briefcases gone and in comes finn and the prosecutor has a whole list of new evidence you gave it to finn baxters a mawworm abby said trying to shove raff aside so she could face him this was her business not raffs i didnt know there was anything in your briefcase to convict him but if there was we shouldnt have been defending him its what we do do you know how much his fee was we can afford to lose it you might he was practically apoplectic and she knew why shed had the temerity to get between him and his money philip and his reputation philip and his carefully planned life so what about this he hauled the diamond out of his top pocket and thrust it towards her but he was holding it tight at the same time do you know how much this cost do you know how much ive done for you youve been how to say hed been wonderful he had but right now it didnt seem like it ive sacrificed everything he yelled everything do you think i wanted to practice in a dump like banksia bay do you know how much money i could have earned if id stayed in sydney but here i am doing the books of the banksia bay yacht club stuck here seeing the same people over and over even mowing your parents lawn i could never figure out why you offered to do that she whispered but he wasnt listening ive done everything and you throw it all away for this his tone was incredulous he was staring at raff as if he were pond scum a finn theres some pretty nice finns she said mildly and raff grinned and tugged her a little closer just a little but philip noticed youd leave me for thisthis for raff she said and she gazed steadily at philip and she even found it in her to feel sorry for him im sorry philip but im not who you think i am ive triedreally hardto be what everyone wants me to be but ive figured it out im not that person im abby and i love bright clothes and sleeping in on sunday and i hate business dinners and i dont like spending my whole life in legal chambers i like dogs and dogs philip snarled the new brave kleppy with his brave new life had emerged from behind abbys legs and was nosing round philips feet checking him out for smells philip looked down at him with loathing thats what this is about a dog i know you dont like dogs abby said it was generous of you to say youd take him generous he gave a laugh that made her wince yeah id even put up with that the word made her know exactly what he thought of kleppy because you love me she asked in a small voice and raffs hand tightened around hers love philip was staring at her as if shed lost her mind whats love got to do with it ieverything you have no clue not one single clue enough you and your parents have messed with my life for ten years thats it ive paid a thousandfold im out of here and if i never see this place again ill be delighted he turned away fast only kleppy was in the way he tripped and almost fell kleppy yelped philip regained his feet but kleppy was still between him and his car and suddenly no raff snapped but it was too late they were both too late philips foot swung back and he kicked all the frustration and rage of the last two days was in that kick and kleppy copped it all the little dog flew about eight feet squealing in pain and shock kleppy abby screamed and ran for him but philip moved too heading for another kick abby launched herself at him throwing herself down between boot and dog philip grabbed her by the hair and hauled her back and then suddenly he wasnt there any more raffs body was between hers and philips raffs fist came into contact with philipshe didnt know where she couldnt seebut she heard a sickening thud she saw philip lurch backwards stumble and she saw raff follow him down he had him on the ground on his stomach his arm twisted up behind his back and philip was screaming lie still or ill really hurt you raff said in a voice she didnt recognise abby the dog she turned back to kleppy but kleppy was no longer there hed backed away in terror whining horrified she saw him bolt under the fence and into the undergrowth beyond he was yelping in pain and fear and he ran until he was out of sight she couldnt catch him beyond raffs fence was black mountain wilderness kleppy she yelled uselessly into the bushland but he was gone she turned and stared back at philip with loathing and distress you kicked him hes a stray hes mine i cant believe she gulped and turned back to the fence knowing to try and follow the little dog into the bush would be futile he was running raff said he was hauling philip to his feet none too gentle if hes running he cant be too badly injured mores the pity philip snarled and raff wrenched him over to the porsche with a ruthlessness abby had never seen before he shoved him into his drivers seat like shed seen cops put villains into squad cars only this was philips car and he was sending him away or not before philip could guess what he intended raff grabbed the keys to philips car and tossed them as far as he could out into the bush youve lost your keys he said conversationally abby get the handcuffs theyre in the compartment on the passenger side of the patrol car what she said and raff sighed you want to hold your fiancé or get the cuffs hes not my fiancé it seemed important sorry he said get the cuffs abby then as she glanced despairingly at the fence he softened cuffs first kleppy second move she moved and thirty seconds later philip was cuffed to his own steering wheel you cant do this he snarled watch me raff said then he lifted his radio keith you know we were getting a search warrant for dexter thinking it might be better to do it when he wasnt home i have another suggestion you come up to my place and pick him up hes cuffed to the car in the driveway he kicked a dog pulled abbys hair take him to the station charge him with aggravated cruelty to animals plus assault ill be there with details when i can but meanwhile he stays in the cells the paperwork could take quite some time you talk among yourself dexter he said abby and i have things to do dogs to rescue and if i find hes badly hurt his look said it all come on abby lets go hell be headed for isaacs and i hope for all our sakes we find him they drove in silence there was so much to say on top of her fear for kleppy there was so much to think about philips invective philips words ive paid a thousandfold it was a statement that made her foundations shift from under her she cast a look at raff and his face was set and grim had he heard was he thinking about it philip but her thoughts kaleidoscoped back to kleppy he cant be too badly hurt no raff said he cant be hes a dog whos given me my life back i owe him more than putting dexter behind bars where where they reached isaacs place and it was fenced and padlocked as it had been fenced and padlocked since isaacs death all the way up the mountain shed held her breath hoping kleppy would be standing at the gate his nose pressed against the wire he wasnt she called they both called no kleppy weve come fast on the track raff said kleppys having to manage undergrowth he could be lost not kleppy our farm is on his route down to town from here his route to his source of stolen goods hell know every inch if hes hurt he could creep into the undergrowth and raff tugged her tight and held her close he was running he said if hes not here in ten minutes ill start bush bashing he tugged her tighter still and kissed her hard and fast enormously comforting enormouslyright if we dont have him in an hour ill organise a posse he said well have an army of volunteers up here before nightfall for kleppy we have two things going for us raff said and his smile was designed to reassure first kleppys one of henriettas dogs she hates having them put down shes over the moon that youre taking him and she has a team of volunteers shell have searching in a heartbeat second if i happen to mention to about half this town that if we find an injured dog well put dexter behind bars how many raised hands do you reckon wed get is he that bad she said in a small voice you know he is she did know it the thought made her feelappalled what had she been thinking to drift towards marriage shed been in a bad dream that had lasted for years of all the stupid dont kick yourself raff said we all have dumb youthful romances she tried to laugh she couldnt a youthful romance that lasted for ten years i seem to remember i did have a youthful romance yeah he said they were walking the perimeter now checking i should have come home and been your partner at the deb ball she did choke on that one her debutante ball the source of all the trouble shed been seventeen years old a girl had to have a really cool partner for that raff had been in sydney shed been annoyed that he couldnt drive home twice a week to practice two hours here two hours back just to be her partner of all the selfish dont kick yourself he said again dexter does the kicking not us but why it was practically a wail why shed always assumed philip loved her hed given up sydney hed come home hed been the devoted boyfriend the devoted fiancé for ten years why if he didnt love her lets walk down to the road raff said taking her hand he held her close not letting her go for a moment as they walked down the driveway to the gravel road where their world had turned upside down ten years ago kleppy she yelled and then paused did you hear call again she did and there was no mistaking it a tiny yelp and then the sound of scuffling she was off the road and into the bush with raff close behind through the undergrowth pushing through and there he was kleppy digging philips kick had hit his side she could see grazed skin and blood on his wiry coat he looked up from where hed been digging and wagged his tail and she came close to bursting into tears klep but he was back digging dirt going in all directions his whole body was practically disappearing into the hole he was creating you dont need a wombat she told him feeling almost ill with relief she reached him and knelt not caring about the spray of dirt that showered her klep he tugged back from inside his hole he had something he was trying to hold it in his mouth and front paws tugging it up as he tried to find purchase with his back legs she didnt care if it was a dead wombat buried for years she gathered him into her arms mindful of his injured side and lifted him from the hole he snuffled against her a grubby bleeding rapscallion of a dog quivering with delight that shed found him and better still he had something to give her he wiggled around in her arms and dropped his treasure onto the ground in front of her raff was with her then ruffling kleppys head smiling his gorgeous loving smile that made her heart twist inside how could she have ever walked away from this man for philip like kleppys buried treasure his smile had been waiting for her to rediscover it she had rediscovered it she wasnt going to marry philip raff was smiling at her the thought made her feel giddy with happiness hey raff said in a voice that was none too steady and he gathered them both into his arms he held them just held them his woman with dog in between happiness was right now but there was only so much happiness a small dog could submit to he submitted for a whole minute before wriggling his nose free and then the rest of him he started barking indignation personified because abby hadnt taken any interest in his treasure too bad raff was kissing her she had treasure of her own to be finding but kleppy was nothing if not insistent he was hauling his loot up onto her knees it was a dirtcovered box a little damaged at one corner but not much it was pencilbox sized or maybe a little bigger she took it and brushed the worst of the dirt offand then she stilled this box philips box no philips grandfathers box he made boxes like this for all his relations for all his friends this one though the shape slowly now with a lot more care she dusted the thing off it was almost totally intact cedar did that it lasted for generations something had nibbled at the corner but had given up in disgust cedar was pretty much bugproof obviously it tasted bad except to kleppy it would have been the smell she thought the distinctive scent showing him that something was buried here something like the box he loved back at her place what is it raff was watching her face figuring this was important im not sure she said hardly daring to breathe a box made by philips grandfather buried not fifty yards from where ben had been killed a box she might just know her fingers were suddenly trembling raff took the box from her a bomb there was the beginning of a smile in his voice no she whispered and then thought about it maybe you want me to open it i think we must there were four brass clips holding it sealed raff flicked open each clip in turn he opened the box but she knew before she saw it what its contents would be and she was right shed seen it before it held cassette tapes filed neatly slotted against each other in the ridged sections of huon pine that philips grandpa had carved with such skill she didnt need to take them out to know what they were music tapes with a couple of blank ones at the back there was an odd one not slotted into place the ribbon had been ripped from its base and the tape looked as if it had been tossed into the box in a hurry it wasnt labelled her mind was in overdrive what do you do when youre panicking you grab the tape from the player rip the ribbon out throw it into the box with the others that might point to the fact that this tape might exist and then you head into the bush you bury it fast deep in the undergrowth and then you come back to the car and you face the fact that a friend is dead and two others injured even if you tried to find it later you might not itd take kleppys sense of smell but why im guessing what this might be she said bleakly and she knew she had to take this further she was feeling sick do you think we could still play it it looks like its just a matter of reattaching the ribbon is it important i think it might be chapter thirteen they took kleppy to the vet and fred declared hed live while he did raff made a quick call to keith dexters nicely locked up and hes staying that way keith said i have a team organised to swarm through his files you look after abby how did he know you and i abby said and raff grinned and shook his head banksia bay dont ask with his wound cleaned and dressed they took kleppy back to raffs an hour later a hearty meal demolished kleppy was watching television with sarah lionel was with them hed just sort of turned up heard kleppy got kicked he muttered and abby thought how does this town do it abby and raff were in the back room standing over grans ancient tape player waiting for a repaired cassette to start abby felt sick raff was curious worried watching her she hadnt told him what to expect it might not be anything but why was it buried there if it wasnt anything and as soon as it started she knew she was right at least in thinking she knew what it was shed watched philip over the years as hed recorded his client discussionsin case i miss something shed attributed it to his meticulous preparation shed believed him all those years ago when shed found the christabelle tape shed used it as a reason to break up with him but had hardly thought any more of it but in the box buried by the roadside where ben diedthere was more evidence maybe philip taped all his girlfriends for this was sarah ten years younger but still unmistakably herself young and excited and a little bit nervous it had been set to record as soon as philip picked her up and they knew immediately it was the night of the crash they listened to sarah asking if they could go up the mountain and see if the boys had their car going sure philip was amenable i wouldnt count on it going though lets show em what a real car can do you like my wheels your cars great but even from the distance of ten years they could hear sarahs increasing nervousness from almost as soon as they started driving philip slow down these curves are dangerous i can handle them its raff and ben who should worry they can hardly drive more talk sarah asked if he liked her dress even then philip wasnt into bright dresses not so much whyd it have to be red a terse response sarah sounded peeved movies afterwards philip asked im not sure if you dont like my dress sense theres no need to be touchy silence an offended huff then sarah again phil be careful that was a wallaby its fine wallabies are practically plague round here anyway why are they using the fire track they cant go on the roads their car isnt registered that hunk of junkll never get registered not like this baby watch it go philip no slow down youre scaring me therell be more wallabiesits getting dark theres nothing to be scared of you reckon theyre on this track philip philip no you nearly hit it and then youre on the wrong side of the theres ruts on the other side no one uses this but its a crest her voice rose philip its a crest no thenawfulness then nothing nothing nothing and nothing the tape spun on into silence dear god raff changed colour held onto the back of the nearest chair she moved then closing the distance between them in a heartbeat linking her arms around his chest and tugging him to her she held him and held him and held him shed had some inkling the moment shed seen the buried box but raff this was a lightning bolt raff hed been her hero since she was eight years old he was her wonderful raff her love i didnt he said and it was as if he was waking from a nightmare i believed philip he said i was on the wrong side thats why there was never a court case she whispered the storm hit just as the crash happened there was only philips word theyd believed him theyd all believed him it had been so hardso unthinkableto do anything else she saw it all philips stupidity had killed ben had desperately injured sarah he couldnt admit it but what followed some part of philip was still decent he was a kid raised in banksia bay and hed been their friend in childhood his parents were friends with her parents theyd loved ben to bits hed have been truly appalled so a part of him had obviously decided to do the right thing and in his eyes he had hed come back here to practice law playing the son to her parents devoting himself to banksia bay as ben would have hes been making amends for ben she said and she was trying hard to hold back the anger raff didnt need her anger now he just neededher he came back and tried to make amends to us all and then despite what shed intended anger hit a wave so great it threatened to overwhelm her no not to us all he tried to make amends to me and to my parents he would have married me as if that somehow made up for bens life but to you for ten years hes let you think you were responsible for ten years hes let you hold the blame tears were coursing down her cheeks now shed thought she was comforting raff but her rage was so great there was no comfort she could give if philip walked in the door right now ill tear his heart out she stammered if he has a heart i cant bear it hes lost you years no raff put her back from him then holding her hard by each shoulder hed regained his colour and unbelievably he was smiling i believe you told me you loved me before you found this tape yes but then its philip whos lost the ten years ive faced it and come out the other side he took a deep breath whew this takes some getting used to we can tell the world oh raff i cant bear anyone thinking a moment longer that you that i was dumb as a teenager i was dumb he said gently i shouldnt have been up there that night none of us should i believe i might even cut philip slack on this one no hes lost you raff said and he tugged her against him and let his chin rest on her hair winner takes all thatd be me and i need to think things through before i do anything rashlike spreading this far and wide she stared at him as if he were out of his mind why on earth you know my reputation does no end of good for my street cred he said thoughtful now how many local kids know the local cop was dumb and someone died because of it you get experts lecturing kids on speed and they shrug it off they see how mrs fryer treats me for a cop thats gold i reckon its even saved lives raff dont think its not important he said laughter fading he was holding her at arms length and meeting her gaze with gravity and truth to look at sarah now and know i wasnt responsible for her pain to look at you and know it wasnt me who hurt you i cant tell you what that means but philip has some pretty heavy stuff coming to him anyway i can cope without my own pound of flesh believe me i can cope all i need i have right here this tape is a great gift abby but the greatest gift of all is you he tugged her to him then and he held her close enough so their heartbeats merged she was dissolving into him she thought she loved this man with all her heart no matter what he decided to do about this tape they could go forward from this moment marry me he said and the world stood still marry she could barely get the word out i hear on the grapevine you have a perfectly good wedding dress im a man who hates waste raff dont quibble he said sternly just say yes youre in shock youre emotional you need time to think he put her away from him again held her at arms length smiled ive thought he said marry me okay okay as an acceptance of a marriage proposal it lacked a certain finesse but it was a great start for a lawyer he found himself laughing a great explosion of happiness that came from so far within hed never known that place existed he lifted her up in his arms and whirled her round as if she weighed nothing she did weigh nothing she was part of himhis abby his love hiswife he set her down laughter fading joy was taking its place a joy so great he felt he was shedding an old skin and bursting into something new she tilted her chin and he kissed her so slowly so thoroughly satisfactorily that words werent possible words werent needed for a very long time she held him tight she kissed him and she placed her future in his hands she loved him so much she felt her heart could burst he was banksia bays bad boy no longer he was just raff if he insisted then maybe she wouldnt tell the town about philip she concededbut she would tell her parents and she would tell philip that she knew and then this was banksia bay if things got around things always got around but right now it was becoming incredibly hard to care all she cared about was that raff was holding her as if hed never let her go he was kissing her as hed kissed her when she was sixteen only more so a lot more so he was grown into her man he was her love for ever and ever i cant believe this is happening he said at last in a voice that was changed different it was the voice of a man who was walking into a future hed never dreamed of abby are you sure and then he hesitated i do need to care for sarah there was sudden doubt i believe theres room enough here for all of us she said deeply contented she pulled back enough to peep through to the next room where lionel and sarah were watching television they were covered in three dogs two cats and a vast bowl of popcorn they were lookingselfconscious on closer inspection they were holding hands there must be something in the water she said and grinned and raff tugged her close again smiling wide enough to make her dissolve in the happiness of his smile so youd take us all on this place and sarahs dogs and guinea pigs and hens and ponies and and whoever else comes along she said and chuckled at the look on his face he caught his breath youd i think i would she said a bubble of joy rising so fast it was threatening to overwhelm her it might be fun youre talking babies he said feeling his way i believe i am you know she said thoughtfully if we sold my place we could even do up your other house as well as this one he took a deep breath looked through to the sitting room saw what she was seeing sarah and lionel we might just have found ourselves a gardener abby said smiling and smiling enough this was going so fast he was being left behind a man had to take a stand some time so he took his stand right there right then a simple okay was not satisfactory for what he had in mind he dropped to one knee abigail callahan will you marry me ive already said she started you said okay i dont think okays legally binding you want me to prepare contracts in triplicate she smiled down at him for how could she help it she smiled and smiled and then she thought this moment called for gravitas it was a very serious moment it was the beginning of the rest of her life she stepped back and stood a little way away looking down at him at all of him at this man whod be her husband she could still see him she thought the spikyhaired tenyearold who her eightyearold self had fallen in love with that dangerous twinkle her bad boy her love if i turn out to be a sewing mistress instead of a lawyer she ventured suits me if im not struck off the professional roll for this mornings unprofessional conduct i might help out the crown prosecutor from time to time you cant get struck off for dropping a briefcaseand malcolm surely needs some help you know im feeling a bit dumb kneeling over here when youre over there she hadnt finished i do want babies how many he asked and there was a trace of unease in his voice six she said and laughed at the look on his face can we try one out for size first sounds a plan raff yes my love thats just it she said feeling suddenlyshy my love let me say i need to explain only once and then its over but i do need to get it out raff ive loved you all the time without stopping but my pain stopped me thinking with my heart i forced myself to think with my head thats done im so so sorry that i cant take back those ten years hush he said i have to say it youve said it he murmured i dont like to mention it but theres no carpet here im kneeling on wood i didnt have the forethought to use a cushion any more quibbles no but he sighed then how about saying youll marry me and taking me out of my pain okay abigail she laughed and she hardly felt herself cross the distance between them she knelt to join him and he tugged her close he kissed her again so thoroughly so wonderfully that doubts unhappiness emptiness were gone and she knew they were gone for ever we cant take back those ten years he whispered into her hair as the kiss paused before restarting how about we give ourselves the next ten instead ten and the ten after that and after that too decades and decades of love and family and and something was bumping against her leg kleppy he was tugging the popcorn bowl to his mistress with care she giggled and lifted him up and popcorn went flying hed tugged it with such care and shed spilled it who cared a lawyer might not abigail callahan not the wife of banksia bays bad boy decades and decades of love and family and dogs she said and raff took kleppy firmly from her and set him down so he could kiss her again definitely my love definitely family definitely dogs definitely love for now and for ever for as long as we both shall live so now abigail callahan for the third and final time will you marry me i want more than okay i want properly soberly legally and with all your heart why yes rafferty finn she managed between love and laughter where would you like me to sign abby didnt wear two thousand beads to her wedding for a start it didnt seem right that she wear a dress shed prepared for her marriage to philip almost as soon as raff put a ring on her finger she was planning an alternative rainbows so sarah wore her dresssarah whod looked at her dress of two thousand beads and burst into tears its the most beautiful thing ive ever seen and sarah needed a wedding gown for lionels not staying in that horrid boarding house a minute longer she declared but lionel was oldfashioned he was delighted to move to raffs farm he was incredibly happy to start renovating the little house at the rear but hed marry his sarah first they were even thinkingif lionel got his money back from philipisaacs place wasnt so far from the farm maybe they could be even more independent so raff gave his sister away abby was maid of honour and if she was as weepy as any mother of the bride then who could blame her her gown of two thousand beads had found a use she could hardly have dreamed of and then it was abbys turn for her wedding a month later but on a day just as wonderful they were to be married in the churchthe church shed been baptised in the church ben had been buried from half banksia bay came to see even mrs fryer for things had shifted for the towns bad boy rumours were flying true to his word raff refused to make public the contents of the tape but the people of banksia bay never let lack of evidence get in the way of a good rumour and there were plenty of pointers saying raff might well have been misjudged for a start abbys parents were trying their best to get to know raff and suddenly they wouldnt hear a bad word against him they even offered to move into raffs house while raff and abby went on their honeymoon in case lionel needed help with sarah and people remembered raff had been judged on philips word and nothing else but now philip had abandoned the town and moved to sydney he was facing malpractice charges and more philips parents were appalled they owned an apartment in bondi and rumour said they were thinking of moving themselves leaving banksia bay to be with their son they were the only ones behind philip though even philips grandpa was right here at the wedding what was more at abbys tentative request hed made a beautiful box for the ring bearer the ring bearer raff stood before the altar waiting for his bride and he couldnt help thinking the choice of ring bearer might be a mistake abby swore itd be okay shed spent hours training him the plan was for her mother to hold kleppy and then when raff called hed trot across bearing the ring what could possibly go wrong who knew but raff organised for keith to carry a backup ring in his pocket it wasnt that he didnt trust kleppy umyes it was he stood in the church waiting for his bride and he thought he definitely didnt trust kleppy but suddenly he could no longer focus on abbys dog the doors of the church swung open and abby was right there holding her fathers hand looking along the aisle to find him his bride his abby shed wanted rainbows and that was what she was to be married in shed made this herself as well and it was as individual as she was the gown was soft white silk almost transparent floating over panels of pastel hues every shade a man could imagine her tightfitting bodice clung to her lovely figure and the skirt flared out in clouds of shimmering colour with the softcoloured silk shimmering from underneath she was so beautiful she wore her hair simply no longer in the elegant chignon hed hated for years but dropping in tendrils to her bare shoulders she wore a simple halo of fresh flowers in her hairand she took his breath away sarah followed her in proud fit to burst matron of honour she wore a matching dress also rainbowcoloured but without the translucent overskirt that made abby seem to float sarah was also supposed to be wearing a ring of flowers in her hair but that had been the one hiccup of the morning it might give me a headache shed said doubtful why dont you take it and leave it in the car raff had suggested that way you can wear it for the official photographs and take it off if it starts hurting shed approved his suggestion she was happy now bareheaded beautiful a married woman fussing over her best friends gown she wasnt as happy as raff not possible his abby was smiling at him his abby was about to be his wife what could be more perfect the music filled the church abbys father led her forward beaming with pride and raff stepped forward to receive his bride his abby what could go wrong with today kleppy could go wrong there was a scuffle in the front pew abbys mother had retired behind her handkerchief and forgotten her kleppyclutching duty she made a wild grab but it was too late he was free kleppy was groomed to an inch of his life he was wearing a bow of the same rainbowcoloured fabric lining abbys gown he was off and running he trotted straight up the aisle tail high a dog on a missionand he disappeared out of the door uhoh what was a cop supposed to do now what was a groom supposed to do leave him to me keith growled setting a hand firmly on raffs shoulder lights and sirens handcuffs padded cell if necessary ill pull him in no time kleppy abby faltered you two get on with your wedding keith told them and they looked at each other and knew they must a hundred people were watching them these people loved them and they were waiting to see them married but he has the ring abby faltered we have backup keith said and handed raff the spare oh raff he could tell she didnt know whether to be thankful or indignant its not that i didnt trust him raff saidunconvincinglyand then he paused kleppy was back with a ring he had two rings now the plain band of gold in the tiny box hanging round his neckand sarahs halo of flowers left on the front seat of the bridal carriage it was a ring of fresh flowers to match abbys he carried it straight to abby and sat and wagged his tail and waited to be told how good he was hes brought us a ring abby said and choked the congregation was choking as wellor laughing out loud kleppys reputation had grown considerably in the last couple of months but raff had his priorities in order now there were things to be done before he acknowledged his soontobe wifes dog he took her hands in his tugged her to face him and lightly kissed her you he told her are the most beautiful woman in the world you make my toes curl she said there was a light harrumph from before them they were after all here to get married raff smiled and stooped and held out his hand and kleppy laid his ring of flowers into his palm he lifted it up and gave it to abby i guess this is kleppys wedding gift ill treasure it for always she managed you should for with this ring i thee wed he said softly with this dog i thee marry before this community with these friends i pledge you my troth there was a murmur of delighted approval abby was lookingin love kleppy however was still looking expectant raff knelt and lifted the small gold band from the box around kleppys neck he pocketed it carefullyand then he placed the ring of flowers around kleppys neck sarah he said to his sister can you hold kleppy i have things to do sure sarah said beaming lionel will help me so sarah and lionel held kleppy raff took abbys hands in his and he faced hera man facing his woman on their wedding day enough he said softly for her ears alone dogs have their place as do sisters and friends and flowers but for now are you ready to marry me if youll take me and my crazy dog well take whatever comes with both of us he told her strongly and firmly as long as we have each other oh yes she smiled at him mistily through tears he kissed her again lightly on the lipsand then the ceremony began as it was meant to begin as rafferty finn and abigail
