mark chadbourn destroyer of worlds the final age i am the caretaker i keep a light burning in the darkest night i serve all who come to me whether their hearts are filled with hope or tainted by despair here i stand at the end of the world where the night is darker than ever and the lamps have gone out one by one what lies ahead is mystery but the road to the end is clear it began one misty morning close to albert bridge in london where jack churchill wandered lost in the depths of grief for his dead girlfriend marianne drawn by the sounds of struggle jack an archaeologist known as church stepped away from his world and into a stranger and more real one when he encountered one of a race of shapeshifting creatures from the depths of celtic mythology the fomorii also known as the nightwalkers though the creature fled jack met the woman who would become the great love of his life ruth gallagher and together they uncovered the first signs of an invasion by the fomorii but church and ruth were also inducted into a greater and more uplifting mystery that of the blue fire an energy that ran through the land along leys its power focused at ancient sacred sites for more than two thousand years this force for life existence had chosen groups of five champions the brothers and sisters of dragons who would fight to protect the land bound together by the pendragon spirit church and ruth were only the latest members and they soon met the other three of their team an asian mystic shavi the acerbic laura dusantiago and ryan veitch a tough excriminal from south london the fomorii were engaged in battle with their ancient raceenemies the golden ones the tuatha de danaan who had been the gods of the ancient celts many of these goldenskinned gods were contemptuous of humans fragile creatures as they named them and manipulated them to their own ends the tuatha de danaan however had an odd symbiotic relationship with their mysterious shapeshifting companions the caraprix which at times appeared to be more powerful than the gods with the brothers and sisters of dragons in the middle this war thrust britain into an age of misrule science and reason were overthrown and magic returned to the world church and his comrades found their abilities honed in the crucible of battle ruth became an exponent of the craft drawing on the long heritage of wise women tapping into the power of the land laura became more nature spirit than human under the guidance of the celtic god cernunnos also known as the green man veitch found his destiny as a powerful warrior and lost a hand in the process shavi grew into a role as seer and wise man and church became the great leader the world needed in their quest they were accompanied by their elderly guide tom who had been kidnapped from his home in the middle ages and altered by the gods at the terrifying court of the final word to become the great hero of myth thomas the rhymer who had the power of prophecy he was not the only human to be caught up in the gods manipulations callow a bitter wanderer joined forces with the fomorii and almost caused the downfall of the brothers and sisters of dragons as the war raged across britain the brothers and sisters of dragons overcame numerous hardships shavi was killed but veitch journeyed to the grim lands the land of the dead to reclaim his spirit and return him to life this heroic act however had unforeseen and devastating consequences callow was eventually killed but he was not the only one tom too gave up his life as did niamh one of the tuatha de danaan who had fallen in love with church and in the battle of london where the fomorii were finally defeated ryan veitch lost his own life a tragic figure veitch had been manipulated by the gods to betray the brothers and sisters of dragons in the cataclysmic battle against balor the great god of the fomorii church was flung back through the ages separated by more than two thousand years from ruth the woman he loved though victorious the brothers and sisters of dragons had paid a high price the survivors went their separate ways and existence set about forming a new band of five who could be champions in the devastated world that remained but these brothers and sisters of dragons would be different veitchs journey to the grim lands had broken one of the great rules and thereby attracted the attention of a terrible dark force beyond the edge of the universe the void also known as the devourer of all things the dark reflection of existence antilife the true ruler of the universe through the mundane spell it kept humanity in thrall and deflected it from magic and wonder which could eventually lead to the dark gods rule being usurped now that the void had noticed magic had returned it was coming back to earth to ensure the mundane spell remained unbroken and so existence needed to find five brothers and sisters of dragons who could operate beyond the attention of the void from another reality it plucked mallory who had killed himself in his own world after committing an undisclosed terrible crime in salisbury mallory joined the ranks of the new knights templar and learned to become a warrior there he met the first sister of dragons sophie tallent who had mastered the craft and miller whom existence had gifted with the power to heal meanwhile rural doctor caitlin shepherd also became a sister of dragons after a plague claimed the lives of her husband grant and son liam caitlin escaped the voids attention because her consciousness was fragmented known as the broken woman she developed several distinct personalities and was eventually possessed by the morrigan one of the tuatha de danaan the goddess of death and violence sex and life in her travels caitlin encountered several helpers amongst them carlton a young boy who was killed during their quest jack who like tom had been kidnapped by the court of the final word and had the destructive force of the wishhex embedded inside him jacks sociopathic girlfriend mahalia and their guide the dissolute academic crowther the final two brothers of dragons were hunter a government special forces officer and trained killer and hal a lowly clerk so insignificant that he escaped the voids attentions completely the void eventually realised that the only way it could maintain the mundane spell was by completely changing reality back into its familiar form the ageold ways of money and power where magic and wonder did not exist all the brothers and sisters of dragons were locked into fake mundane lives forgetting their true heritage except hal who gave up his corporeal existence to become part of the blue fire his mission was to seek out church the true king and help bring him back from the past to defeat the void in the iron age church had been adopted by a celtic tribe in the village of carn euny in what would become cornwall he lived a simple life but the void recognised him as a threat and set out to destroy him through time it despatched its agents the army of the ten billion spiders the libertarian a sardonic brutal killer with lidless red eyes and one other a rejuvenated ryan veitch corrupted by hatred who blamed church for his death and the loss of the woman he truly loved ruth time became the battlefield in different ages church fought the voids agents while in the modern world the brothers and sisters of dragons began to awake from their fake lives paradoxically church established the line of brothers and sisters of dragons in carn euny long before he was chosen to be such a champion but the first group were killed by ryan veitch and eventually reanimated by the void as the brothers and sisters of spiders to help veitch destroy church the paradoxes continued thick and fast church was taken to the mysterious otherworld also known as the far lands by niamh who would fall in love with him over time and there he also encountered tom in his younger days in niamhs court church befriended jerzy the mocker a surgically altered fool who would play a large part in what was to come the magical far lands were timeless and church realised that he could while away his days there while centuries passed in the real world and eventually return home when his own age rolled around again on occasional trips back to the real world under niamhs control church encountered many other brothers and sisters of dragons in roman york in ad he met the dacian barbarian decebalus and the roman briton aula fabricia candida both of whom returned with him to the far lands when they discovered that ryan veitch was systematically killing off the line of champions over the centuries church rescued many others and brought them back to the otherworld where they formed an army of dragons in waiting the great powers continued to manipulate humans to their ends the void controlled many human leaders through the spiders while gaining power over several gods from other pantheons in earths mythologies amongst them the dualfaced janus god of doorways and loki the norse trickster god in elizabethan times janus arranged the capture of many humans to be slaves in the voids fortress in the far lands amongst them were the new world colonists of roanoke including the young girl virginia dare the first european to be born in the americas meanwhile the tuatha de danaan continued their own manipulations dian cecht and the gods of the court of the final word were involved in a desperate attempt to probe the heart of existence not only to ensure their survival in the face of the devourer of all things but also to prevent the golden ones from being supplanted by fragile creatures in one of their experiments they inserted a caraprix inside jerzys head to control him and use him against church in at stonehenge jerzy mysteriously disappeared from churchs side he had been kidnapped by the shapeshifting trickster puck also known as robin goodfellow one of the oldest things in the land to undisclosed ends as veitch the libertarian and the army of the ten billion spiders continued a campaign to stop church they also launched a search for a worldshattering magickal artefact the extinction shears which could cut through all reality locating them the voids forces used the shears to sever the blue fire from its source and condemn the world to the mundane spell but after this act the otherworldly market of wishful spirit reclaimed the supremely powerful artefact and disappeared with it at the woodstock festival in the libertarian offered a worldweary church a deal if he allowed himself to be placed in the sleep like death and locked for ever in a casket in the far lands ruth shavi and laura would not be killed church believed this was the only way to save his friends as church slept in the casket events he had previously experienced continued apace the fomorii invaded and his pastself fought them through the age of misrule tom and niamh died the battle of london took place locked inside his head church experienced what he thought was a dream or a hallucination he met me and the daughters of the night the true owners of the extinction shears and then he was guided to a cave that housed the axis of existence which he perceived as a great realityaltering machine using the axis church changed events in the same way that the void had done though not as catastrophically both tom and niamh returned to life but there was a price to pay as there always is for these things and niamh became an agent of the void returning to the fray ruth laura and shavi rescued church from the casket in the far lands and returned to earth for a final confrontation with veitch in the battle veitch was killed his body taken away by the brothers and sisters of spiders but now the brothers and sisters of dragons faced their biggest test to destroy the void before it could reshape the world in its image for all time from the depths of the blue fire hal told them what they would need the missing extinction shears and the two keys two humans one with the power to create life the other with the power to destroy hidden by existence somewhere amongst the worlds billions church knew that they could not complete this quest alone and so he set out to locate mallory sophie caitlin and hunter still living the fake lives the void had given them with tom once again joining them they split up into two teams mallory sophie and caitlin travelled to the far lands in search of the extinction shears under the guidance of a returned jerzy with the libertarian hounding them at every turn church and the others raced to norway in search of the first key but there they discovered why they had encountered only the celtic gods during the age of misrule each pantheon of gods from earths mythologies had their own great dominion over which they ruled for centuries they had slept but every time the brothers and sisters of dragons trespassed in a new great dominion they woke the old gods in norway church and his team were confronted by gods from the cold northern climes including tyr and freyja to save the lives of his friends tom agreed to an undisclosed but clearly tragic deal with freyja who gave him the cursed ring andvarinaut to help them locate their hearts desire in this instance the two keys veitch meanwhile had returned to life through a ritual in the grim lands and with the help of the brothers and sisters of spiders he kidnapped ruth feeling even more betrayed and bitter veitch had turned his back on the void and was now determined to bring all of reality crashing down around him in oslo veitch found the first key before church mallorys former friend from salisbury miller who was using his existencegiven power to heal the sick and so the brothers and sisters of dragons set off across the world in pursuit of veitch ruth and miller awakening the gods of several great dominions in the process in the far lands mallory sophie and caitlin had fallen under the manipulation of niamh not realising that she had become an agent of the void the influence of the devourer of all things was spreading across the otherworld its fortress was growing the army of dragons was missing as were many of the tuatha de danaan and the enemys forces were on the march destroying everything they encountered meanwhile at the enemys fortress the burning man was being created a giant flaming matrix that would contain the essence of the void on its return at the last niamhs corruption was exposed and the army of dragons and missing gods were discovered but at a terrible price niamh used a magickal artefact to wipe sophie from existence a fate truly worse than death where the sister of dragons would never have existed and therefore be forgotten by everyone who knew her niamh escaped and though mallory liberated her court he failed to find the extinction shears unbeknownst to him they had been hidden with the market of wishful spirit somewhere in the grim lands back on earth the brothers and sisters of dragons closed in on veitch ruth and miller though veitch was still bent on revenge ruths influence gradually began to strip away his encysted bitterness allowing his former heroic nature to surface in the process the pair grew closer in egypt many of the old gods had agreed to help the void and were destroyed by the brothers and sisters of dragons only seth escaped vowing revenge soon after in the forbidden city in beijing the gods revealed to church a shattering truth the libertarian was churchs future self he was given a vision of the moment when he would transform into the psychopathic killer thus betraying existence and ensuring victory for the void churchs only hope was that in the fluid nature of time the future could be altered and his vision would never come to pass in china the brothers and sisters of dragons did claim one great victory the connection to the source of the blue fire was reopened and magic flooded back into the world the second key was hidden in new york jack caitlins former associate who still carried the vast destructive force of the wishhex here veitch finally overcame his hatred and agreed to help his former comrades though he was still treated with suspicion by all realising it faced defeat the army of the ten billion spiders set about remaking the world in the process closing all the gateways to the far lands with hardly any time to spare church and the others escaped earth on the supernatural last train ready for the final battle with the void and so the pieces move into place for the final battle at the end of the world prologue the worldtree the snake came crawling and struck at none but woden took nine glory twigs and struck the adder so it flew into nine parts from the anglosaxon nine herbs charm it is the beginning of the end church church wake up youre dreaming please wake up church maybe its just time it is the beginning of the end where is the meaning in life what is real there are signs certainly but in the end who knows you dont have to leave me church it is the beginning of the end so cold oh please why are you letting this happen everybody describes it differently like a shadow falling over them or a jolt of electricity i wish i could be more helpful chilled to his bones and aching church wakes and then he wakes again and there is the rhythm of the train like the pulse of blood it is the beginning of the end snow falls a flurry caught in the unforgiving wind blowing relentlessly across the frozen wastes that stretch to the horizon in that wind there are whispers lost souls telling of the end of the world of all worlds their stories are caught in the ruddy glare reflected in the rolling snow dunes and the crested waves of ice high in the silver sky the burning man looks down on this place and the shimmering city of gold and glass at its heart as he looks down on all places waiting to cast the final judgement the towering outline of fire is still waiting to be filled but it will not be long now it is the twilight of the gods and men and all living things ragnarok dreaming yet awake you understand this as you move out from the confusion of the worldtrees branches and drift across the desolate landscape the whispers have told you what was and what will be what is real and what is not you move on quickly you want to see more worry knots your thoughts that perhaps this time it will not be all right see there at the top of the tallest tower of the city of marvels where hunter looks out at the seething figure and feels its words in his heart his quarters reveal that he is treated with respect sumptuous furnishings fill the chamber furs piled across the wooden floors and tapestries hanging on the walls while floortoceiling windows on three sides give a grand perspective on the world but though a great fire blazes in the hearth hunter still feels the chill like the city hunters appearance belies the true nature beneath rakish piratical a flair for flamboyance concealing an iron will intriguing you still believe there is hope is this what it means to be a brother of dragons then faith over reason math the great sorcerer of the tuatha de danaan stands beside the stone fireplace oblivious to the heat sometimes hunter wonders if there is a person inside the black robes and the brass mask that rotates every minute or so to reveal one of its four faces boar salmon falcon bear reason is overrated hunter pours himself a goblet of fruity wine and downs it in one whats the point in sitting on your arse and ruminating on the logic of what is by any rational persons yardstick complete bugeyed screaming craziness lifes for living when some gits swinging an axe at your head or a woman is pressing her lips against yours you feel it and you react you start reasoning about either one youre a dead man he pours himself another goblet of wine drinks it quickly your drinking is a mask like mine math notes wryly were just two peas in a pod the long wait ends as the door opens silently to admit the goddess freyja wearing a black dress to mark the gravity of the occasion her delicate features are emphasised by the thick animal fur she wears across her shoulders for once her potent sexuality is tightly controlled another sign of respect for the visitor the council of asgard is convened she says brother of dragons and cousin she nods to math you will accompany me past hissing torches she leads them down the majestic staircase to the great meeting hall of oak and glass at one end of the room an enormous window looks across the expanse of snow to bifrost the rainbow bridge shimmering like the aurora borealis its far end hangs in tatters earth cannot be reached the hall rings with the voices of gods bellowing at each other or flirting or fighting hunters senses take a moment to adjust to the combined presence of the powerful beings faces slowly arising from a swirl of impressions features he vaguely recalls from childhood stories or dreams fiery red beards and wildman hair glittering lupine eyes that have seen seas of blood flow over the rocks and ice of the northlands women with hair glowing like the sun and a beauty primal and terrifying and sexual muscles like iron and hideous jagged scars they carry weapons nicked axes great swords or pluck on ancient stringed instruments everything about them speaks of blood and battle and sex and honour hunter feels quite at home let the council begin the crowd falls instantly silent at freyjas command and all eyes turn towards hunter freyja gestures towards the great empty throne at the far end of the hall these are dark days the allfathers whereabouts are unknown he has followed his ravens hugin and mugin to an uncertain future and so this decision falls to us now before the allfather departed he placed his trust in the brothers and sisters of dragons and so we must give fair hearing to their plea a murmur races around the room support or dissent hunter cannot tell theres a war coming he begins the war to end all wars you know it this is the final battle foretold in all your old stories ragnarok one intones gravely redhaired he is taller and stronger than all the others and from the enormous hammer that stands by his side hunter knows he is the thunder god thor it blows towards us like a storm at sea inevitable inescapable the end of us all the norns will be gathering around their well beneath the roots of yggdrasil sighs an elderly man with a long white beard unconsciously his fingers play over the strings of the harp in his lap urd verdandi and skuld who hold us all in their hands hush bragi this is not a time for your eloquent misery tyr stands his scarred hairy body now recovered from the terrible injuries hunter had seen inflicted on it in norway that sly trickster loki has not been seen for a season tyr continues if we find him and carve his body with my axe ragnarok will not unfold simple its too late for that hunter insists loki is already with the enemy and hes not alone a lot of others from across the great dominions are under the enemys control theyre all following the lead of janus two faces neither of them pleasant if it is too late what is the point of this council bragi asks with a roar thor crashes his hammer mjolnir on the stone flags and sends lightning flashing across the hall the aesir have never turned from battle even when all hope appeared lost we fight and if the norns so decide we die thundering his support for thor tyr drives the gods to their feet with a deafening martial clamour with a sigh hunter waits for the bravado and bloodlust to subside freyr the shining lord and brother of freyja says why do we need to listen to you brother of dragons what can you possibly offer the aesir allies the enemy force is greater than you can imagine however powerful you think you are you wont be able to hold them back alone but with an army of gods from all the great dominions now that would make a difference hunter gestures to math observing silently with his hands folded in front of him the tuatha de danaan have already agreed to stand with us i have a message from lugh guaranteeing the support of the golden ones an army of gods tyrs laughter roars to the rafters thor though remains grave as he considers hunters words youre facing the true organising force of the universe the god above gods hunter continues the void represents the opposite of life and its slowly focusing its attention on us through that burning man you can see from your windows once that receptacle is filled it will act but until then there is an opportunity thor asks not for any of us alone even together there might not be a chance hold pressed against the great window the goddess frigg looks out across the wintry wastes something approaches the horizon is a blur in the blizzard that rages constantly around asgard but gradually shapes coalesce in the snow moving towards the city a handful at first then a score then hundreds brutish figures range speedily ahead of the main force redcaps wearing their clothes of human skin and organs followed closely by the shimmering insubstantial gehennis tearing at their wild hair and the shrieking vampiric baobhan sith behind them a great army pulls slowly out of the storm dead yet alive axes and swords and lances merged with their limbs armour rusted and bloodstained purple mist drifts around the lamentbrood and even at that distance their keening song of despair is clear they attack us here in our home thor intones incredulously we fight tyr bellows now i dont want to pour cold water on your war party hunter says but this is where i advise you to run across the far lands ashes drift in the wind in your dreams you taste the bitterness on your tongue listen there is a sound like a heartbeat throbbing behind the breeze under the rustling of the leaves deep in the land itself it is the sound of war drums it is the sound of a heart it infects your dreams so that you cannot sleep peacefully for you know what it is and from where it comes against one of the foothills of the great mountain range sprawls an enormous walled city you stare in awe at its jumble of buildings its winding streets its towers and turrets gambrels and chimneys ramparts and spires once you would have been troubled by its claustrophobia the darkness beneath the upper storeys of the buildings overhanging the cobbled streets but no more now the streets are flooded with light and a new mood of hope fights to establish itself the court of the soaring spirit has a new lord you see his long dark hair and the note of irony in his dark eyes but most of all you see the unfathomable sadness in his heart despite that mallory brother of dragons possessor of llyrwyn one of the three great swords of existence projects only optimism a necessary quality for his city now lies on the brink of destruction the palace of glorious light lives up to its name golden illumination shining from every window it is a beacon that can be seen far and wide across the far lands and it rings with beautiful music earthly songs that mallory has taught the strange band of musicians drawn to him from across the city he hoped it would ease his emptiness it has not but all the other residents will never forget its joy yet still it faces destruction at the heart of the palace is a formal garden tranquil amongst its honeyscented alyssum spicy lilies and sweet strong jasmine its sparkling fountain its elegant statues and winding walkways amidst the fluttering butterflies and the lazy drone of bees caitlin shepherd sister of dragons practises a relentless series of martial routines with her axe from the upper cloisters mallory watches her brown hair flying her fragile features tense and determined no peace he mutters ever as if to underline his words decebalus the dacian barbarian marches up another attack is imminent he growls i have ordered the sounding of the alert mallory curses we need to get everyone indoors man the defences already done decebalus nods towards caitlin in the garden below as they march to the stairs you are concerned about her its just difficult to get used to the new caitlin there was always something gentle about her a healer not a fighter gentle she remains deep inside but she is so much more now so many people in one small body five personalities its not the human ones im concerned about caitlin herself amy briony even that old crone brigid with her doommongering and predictions it is the morrigan decebalus nods a human possessed by a god what good can come of it not just any god the morrigan is terrifying blood and death and sex and life decebalus interrupts with a wink no i love her dearly but not like that shes a friend as they hurry along the cloisters where beams of sunlight and deep shadow form a complex interplay they pass brothers and sisters of dragons hurrying towards the rooftop defences an army of existence brought to the far lands from their own longgone times to a person they look to mallory with hope and respect as he passes the brothers and sisters of dragons are ready for the fight ahead decebalus observes they shouldnt be they dont stand a chance do not let them hear you say that decebalus cautions sternly im not stupid but im really not comfortable sending them all to their deaths this is their sole reason for existing more than two thousand years of history the shaping of the brothers and sisters of dragons it has all been leading to this point live or die this is what they were made to do it is their destiny i dont believe in destiny you are a strange and troubling little man you do not believe in anything i am a poor uneducated barbarian yet even i have learned to understand the thing you call reason its overrated decebalus curses under his breath but his mood is too vibrant to be constrained you should see them when they train he says a twinkle in his eye the very air of the room becomes alive the iron smell of the blue fire so powerful he smacks his lips it makes my skin tingle and my heart sing existence chose well all of them and it is not just the pendragon spirit their hearts are strong they will face any odds they will risk their lives for what existence requires of them you should be proud to be a part of it mallory yeah theyre heroes so whos killing them decebalus high overhead the alert sounds a lone tolling bell that ignites in mallory the chill of dread every time he hears it two dead he continues holes punched in the centre of their foreheads church didnt save them from slaughter in their own time only for them to be murdered here you know there is an enemy in our midst the force we oppose attacks from without and within it will not allow us the space to take a stand time is running out i know mallory snaps you dont have to remind me every damned minute of the day the bell tolls again and again turning his stomach im sorry its the waiting for hunter to build his coalition of gods who refuse to acknowledge each others existence for church and the others to find the two keys for the location of the extinction shears for us to do anything before we get wiped out frustration drives an edge into his voice you are a man of action i understand that this period is difficult but soon there will be action enough for all of us stepping onto the palace roof mallory sees that the defences are already in place here and on the other highest points around the city he knows decebalus has trained them well since the first attack that had killed so many ranks of goldenskinned archers from the elite forces of the tuatha de danaan face the roiling black clouds on the distant horizon behind them the army of dragons prepare to use the bizarre but devastating weapons created in the vast armoury of goibhniu creidhne and luchtaine the tolling bells continue to sound clang clang clang in the city below the streets clear rapidly in a mood of fear and desperation doors and shutters are bolted mallory watches the black clouds move slowly across the great plain i dont know how much more of this we can take he says we cant just sit here under siege until every building is reduced to rubble huh the enemys full army has not arrived yet decebalus grunts thanks for the reassurance as the storm clouds near they part to reveal the creatures at their core three riotbeasts each with twin leonine heads eyes rolling with idiocy as they silently roar their bigcat bodies covered with scales feathers and fur they are engines of destruction throwing out crackling bolts of energy more devastating than any missile each time he sees them mallory is unnerved by the way they float without wings or any other visible means of staying aloft the day becomes like night as the storm clouds fill the sky and a low bass rumble vibrates through everything as the riotbeasts reach the city walls plasma balls sizzle erratically exploding rooftops and sending out waves of superheated air towers crash to the ground in a rain of masonry as the creatures blunder across the city now decebalus roars and a hail of arrows arc majestically some hit their target but the riotbeasts show no pain if they can even feel it mallory nods and decebalus orders the firing of the greater weapons from the vaults of the tuatha de danaan the air becomes glassy or boils in a wave of fire and bolts of energy shriek like banshees sometimes the riotbeasts are knocked off course mostly they continue on their paths of destruction occasionally bursting into flame until the wind or gusting rain extinguishes the blaze we havent got anything that can hurt them mallory says redundantly his anger boils within him but he maintains a cool demeanour for the sake of his troops whatever we send out a message decebalus replies we will resist unto death very poetic with an unnerving knack for premonition the battle continues for fifteen full minutes across the city buildings collapse and roofs are torn off many die finally the riotbeasts drift away as if they are leaves caught on the wind the storm clouds follow the thunders rumbling decreasing until the sun eventually breaks through as soon as you have the figures let me know how many died this time mallory orders why do you punish yourself because until i find a proper defence im responsible for every one they wait until their exhausted troops file off the rooftop before making their way down there have been too many attacks and little chance to rest now the attack has passed you prepare to move on you are unsettled the threat here is palpable but you know there is still more to see the far lands is a place of subtlety and intrigue and many things shift behind the surface of all that you see in the ringing corridors of the palace a woman staggers blood streaming from a gash on her temple her name is marie a scullery girl in a large london house during the regency period of george iv ignored by those who believed themselves to be her betters she gained renown as a brave sister of dragons here though she is disoriented terrified the world has shifted beneath her feet as mallory and decebalus come down from the roof engaged in deep debate about tactics she comes to a halt wideeyed seeing her wound mallory and decebalus rush to her aid but she only shrieks and presses against the stone wall as if hoping it might swallow her an accusing finger points at mallory stay back she says and then to decebalus he tried to kill me when the barbarian asks not five minutes ago during the attack impossible mallory was at my side then up on the roof marie wavers her eyes flashing from side to side he tried to kill me i tell you decebalus motions for mallory to step back as he attends to the young woman this is not the truth marie either you are mistaken or it is some kind of magic magic then she stares at mallory accusingly his face decebalus he came at me as the fire rained down in the dark of the upper floors instinct made me turn at the last good fortune was all i had but it was enough i did not see his weapon but i felt it as it tore through my flesh i did see his face she points again and i ran here think marie decebalus says sharply you ran into us mallory was not pursuing you he was ahead the woman wavers tries to make sense then who the one whos already killed two brothers and sisters of dragons mallory says the enemys sent an assassin to pick us off one by one if it uses your face then it attempts to undermine our spirit decebalus says gravely if it can use any face then who can we trust troubled mallory and decebalus deliver marie to a healer and then seek out comfort and the sun in the herb garden which lies beyond a maze of lavender in a walled area at the rear of the palace the air is heavy with rich perfumes decebalus and mallory find aula tending her herbs as she does at that time every day at first mallory does not recognise her her blond hair shimmering in the sun the roman britons face is strikingly peaceful as she immerses herself in the gardens atmosphere a far cry from the fierce looks that usually accompany her caustic tones her mask returns when she sees them both so little to do you must trouble me here she says tartly no wonder we face disaster your day would be bereft without a visit from the one who gives your life meaning decebalus replies with a broad grin aula snorts unconvincingly then turns to mallory she plays in the maze she says past clouds of honeybees mallory weaves through the heavily scented bushes and eventually sees the top of a young girls head in the centre of the maze virginia dare never smiles occasionally a heartbreaking haunted look will appear in the depths of her eyes in that moment it is possible to comprehend the many atrocities she has witnessed since the army of the ten billion spiders kidnapped her and her fellow settlers from roanoke in the new world almost five hundred years ago she has spent her formative years in the heart of horrors the voids fortress on the edge of the far lands until her escape though only eight years old her eyes say she is a hundred is it time she cradles a doll made for her by one of the kitchen staff who had hoped it would bring back some aspect of childhood not yet but soon i need to ask you if you are prepared to do it you have asked me twice already now im asking you a third time yes she says without hesitation i will travel with you to the enemy fortress and show you the secret way i discovered under the walls you know what it will mean you want to protect me mallory she replies in tooold tones but it is too late for that i am ruined mallory cannot look in her face it makes him too desperately sad shell be fine frequently these days he never hears caitlin come up on him she stands at the entrance to the mazes central rest zone still slick with sweat holding her axe loosely mallory searches her eyes to see who is in control this time he doesnt know why he tries for even when he sees the bright innocence of amy there is always the dark of the morrigan just behind its me mallory caitlin the one the only the original she smiles kisses him on the cheek virginia hugs caitlin tightly the first time she has looked like a little girl have you come to play with me i said i would didnt i with a whisper of desperate thanks virginia buries her face in caitlins midriff no hide and seek she says i dont like that when virginia has raced away to fetch a board game from her room mallory observes she likes you we have an understanding i still dont want to take her to that place shes tougher than you think mallory when it comes down to it we all are he watches the bees and the clouds scudding across the blue sky do you think its enough he enquires wanting to do the right thing no its not enough she replies but we do it anyway and so you move again through the twisting evermultiplying branches of the worldtree and now you watch the walls of asgard crumble from out of the swirling blizzard blazing rocks crash with a steady beat of destruction the enemys siege machines never rest the monstrous troops wash out of the snow in a black tide that hunter wills to ebb but which never does they swirl around the foot of the walls throwing up ladders as quickly as the aesir can despatch those who scurry like insects to the ramparts but their greatest weapon is insubstantial a potent atmosphere of despair radiating from every fibre of their being infecting any who allow their defences to slip a moments doubt is all thats needed hunter sees shoulders sag heads bow weapons fall to their sides it is only a matter of time before we are overrun baldur mutters in a daze of abject disbelief this is a taste of whats to come hunter intones above the din of battle cries clashing weapons the screams of the dying and the constant howl of the icy gale nobody survives on their own amidst peals of deafening thunder a storm cloud races along the ramparts towards them lightning bolts flying in all directions only when it nears does hunter recognise thor his face consumed by volcanic fury swinging mjolnir with the devastating force of a hurricane he shatters the face of a redcap attempting to climb over the wall the god grips the siege ladder and thrusts it back out into the blizzard howls rise up from those falling below asgard shall not fall he bellows to the wind at intermittent points along the walls the lie is being given to his words hordes of decaying lamentbrood haul themselves over the ramparts losing an arm here even a head there but continuing relentlessly aesir warriors run to confront them at the points where they have broken through the defences but the lamentbrood attack the moment their feet touch the walkway an aesir warrior is impaled on a rusty sword embedded in the handless wrist of one of the lamentbrood the sword is roughly twisted and the warrior explodes in a cloud of golden moths gleaming against the white snow a single moment of beauty at the instant of his death all along the walls the aesir stop what they are doing and watch aghast disbelieving fixated on each individual moth as it struggles to pick a path through the gusting snowflakes a single teardrop rolls slowly over thors cheek and then along the ramparts bursts of golden moths rise up here and there the interval between each explosion growing shorter like bursts of smoke and light in a magicians stage show no thor thunders and renews his furious hammerattack the aesir return to action blades and axes flashing but hunter can see something has gone out of them their attacks are less sure they glance at each other seeking reassurance finding none forseti one of the younger gods who had been responsible for justice in the city is surrounded by six redcaps before hunter can react the god is hacked to pieces as the moths soar baldur cries out my son consumed by grief he races towards the redcaps we must leave at hunters shoulder maths fourfold mask turns implacably there is no hope left here from his backpack hunter removes a silverscaled gauntlet with brass talons it would be impolite to leave at the height of the party what is that math asks suspiciously a weapon the court of the final word called it the balor claw gritting his teeth hunter slips on the gauntlet and now its mine he arrives at the fray as the redcaps surround baldur as they had done his son one sweep of the balor claw takes the first redcap apart another falls as he turns the claw breaking the bonds of his body at the molecular level after his slaughter in the court of the final word hunter has grown used to the sight of bodies unfurling but the other redcaps are for the first time in their existence rooted in a frenzy of despair baldur despatches three with his sword and hunter kills the last catching his breath the god represses his grief and looks hunter deep in the eyes in that one moment he accepts everything hunter has attempted to communicate to the council the age of gods and men is passing baldur admits it is time to make the final stand the aesir fight furiously but the enemy keep coming devoid of fear wave after wave with no purpose save destruction their atmosphere of despair is corrosive the clouds of golden moths are now indistinguishable from the snow fall back baldur yells to the groerland square piercing the crackling lightning he grips thors arm this is no place to make a stand we must leave with the brother of dragons but the golden city will fall stone and wood brother it can be rebuilt the true glory of the aesir is a light that must never be extinguished thor weighs the words for only a second and then roars fall back do as the bleeding god says he grins at baldur lead the way brother i will protect your back baldur snatches the horn from his side and blows one blast loud and clear rising up above the howling gale and the thunder of battle along the walls the gods retreat down the steps to the avenues of asgard radiating out from the groerland square youve made the right choice hunter says as he and math follow baldur into the streaming mass of warriors asgard is surrounded you can free us from this place as long as your man with the hammer can keep the enemy off our tails for a little longer he does not stand alone baldur indicates a balcony on a tall tower where freyja stands arms raised to the sky she uses her seior in the citys defence the direction of the wind changes suddenly hurling many of the enemy to their deaths from the walls the aesir will make good allies hunter thinks but will even they be enough in the groerland square a large public space centred on a statue of the worldtree yggdrasil the axis mundi around which all reality turns the gods silently look towards hunter the unfamiliar expression of confusion etched in their faces the only sound is the heartbeat of the enemys missiles against the walls are you sure you can take them all hunter asks we shall go by winterside math replies there will be no enemy there yet at the foot of the yggdrasil statue the sorcerer utters an incantation in a language hunter does not recognise amidst a sound like rending metal a section of air as big as a barn door shimmers and appears to become a twodimensional sketch of what had previously been there math pulls it open to reveal a cavernous darkness we go into the worldtree to follow the branches to other worlds math explains its just a statue hunter replies the depiction of the reality is the reality have you not learned anything as math beckons baldur hesitantly leads the aesir into the dark hunter waits until thor and freyja come running from the battlelines tears stream down the thunder gods face the eternal city is falling he says how can this be youll get your chance to make amends hunter replies this isnt the end along the western wall a sheet of flames rises up they watch it for a moment and then step into the dark the door that is not a door closes behind them and the snow fills their footprints and for the first time there is silence within the walls of the eternal city in your dreams you see these things across the worlds there is a sense of winter approaching of the dying of the light the steady rhythm in the ground and behind the sky now sounds less like a heartbeat and more like the ticking of a clock growing imperceptibly slower you see all this you know you are now a part of it you travel across the infinite far lands to a point that is neither here nor there that anomalous place on the distant edge where the otherworld breaks up and opens onto another infinity words mean nothing here ideas have more substance than things but you see as you move that numbers underpin everything repeating patterns that form the basis of a greater pattern at a distance the mathematical complexity creates the illusion of chaos it is all random you would have said in another time under other circumstances move closer and you see the truth the structure the plan you understand the mechanics of chaos theory without needing to know the name that within seemingly chaotic systems there is a hidden order masked by a complexity so great our brains cannot comprehend it five you say that is one of the numbers it is familiar by now comforting you know it well but there is another important number too hidden till now waiting to be called into the light odin the great god of the nordic lands hanged himself on the cosmic ash tree yggdrasil for nine nights in order to learn the wisdom of the dead that great tree of life around which all reality revolves sheltered nine worlds beneath its branches nine books of wisdom tell a story that is more than a story in which you now play a part nine symbolises completeness in the bahai faith to the celts the ninth wave is the boundary between our world and the otherworld king arthur was brought in on the ninth wave the chinese consider nine to be lucky because in their language it sounds the same as the word for longlasting the japanese consider nine to be unlucky because it sounds like the japanese word for distress or pain the cat is believed to have nine lives the forbidden city in beijing is filled with the number nine it is linked with the chinese dragon a symbol of power and magic there are nine forms of the dragon it has nine attributes and nine children there are secrets here you realise if only you could divine them but you are distracted by a terrible sight the fortress of the void sprawls across a blasted desolate terrain of rocks and dust it is bigger than any city you have ever seen as big as a country and from a distance it resembles a gigantic squatting insect indeed part of the city appears to be organic amongst the walls of fused volcanic glass and the detritus of failed civilisations are areas that appear to be constructed from spoiled meat it continues to grow by the day new wings new towers spreading in all directions consuming the land the fortress swarms with the worst that the universe has to offer not just the lamentbrood the redcaps the gehennis and baobhan sith but things worse still things you cannot bear to examine for fear you would be driven insane and above it all towers the burning man so close you can feel the heat from its blazing outline here is the place where it was born within the burning man you can see writhing figures being consumed these are gods or ones who consider themselves gods providing the fuel that gives the burning man shape and allowing it to shine like an infernal beacon across all worlds you cannot hear their screams but you can see their mouths fixed in a continual o on a balcony overlooking the suffering stands a man living a new life of perpetual cruelty a mirrorimage man who still sees echoes of his former existence but he can discard them for he is better at peace now unlike before he emphasises his flamboyance wearing all black like a silentmovie villain or all white however the mood takes him his eyes are bloodred with no lids so he can never shut out the horror he sees the horror he causes he is wedded to the idea of peace and stability through control not the torments that come from the uncertainty of free will he believes hope is a debilitating virus and love and that contentment only comes from not looking to the distant horizon it is a simple philosophy but many things spin from it they may be the most efficient warriors in all the worlds but they could do with a few tips on interior design the libertarian says he takes a deep draught of sour air and turns back to the austere chamber where fires rage continually in the braziers a futile attempt to bring warmth to bodies that can feel none niamh former queen of the court of the soaring spirit now truly queen of the waste lands wears a black headdress with six horns like the arms of shiva and ebony armour etched with silver she is filled with spiders she considers a geometric design that resembles a mandala or a mandelbrot set revolving slowly in midair it glows gently with a rich white light though you only see three dimensions she sees more it is a map of the worlds and the trail they make through time her brow knits for what she sees changes continually nothing is fixed everything is fluid she finds that puzzling the libertarian takes her hand and pulls her away from the map and into his arms dont you find that all this power and destruction make the sap rise he says pressing his groin into hers she smiles not without affection i find the patterns of existence a mystery my heart yearned for you from the earliest times in your past life and we danced back and forth across the ages until it appeared we would never share the same space yet here we are all good things come to those who wait together now and always and in all time before this moment a headache stabs briefly at the libertarian a nagging thought hardening by the moment of troubled times ahead sights disturbingly that he cannot see an area of insecurity of disconnection a tolling bell echoes dully through the fortress its time he says niamh nods takes his hand they make their way along corridors of pulsing meat down echoing stone steps until they come to a hall so large that the far walls are not visible you will not want to enter even in your dreams it affects you the stink the feeling of subsonic vibrations in the pit of your stomach but most potently a dread so terrible it would drive you insane if you lingered you want to shut it out pretend you never experienced it but it will haunt you for the rest of your days amidst a seething mass of shrieking foul creatures floats the great god janus his two faces switching back and forth black on white white on black he holds aloft the golden key to open the doors and then the ironwood stick to drive away those who have no right to cross the threshold the monstrous beings shriek louder the noise rising and falling and you realise that hideous sound is singing a form of celebration in their ecstasy they fight and tear at each other like animals in a pit in a circle around januss feet lopes the god loki partman partwolf his head rolling as he mouths incantations lost to the ritual lost to the dread and the frenzy round and round in circles niamh smiles closes her eyes and breathes deeply of the foul atmosphere you can smell it an ending she says and a beginning the serpent eats its own tail janus raises the key once more and a door opens behind him listen that beat steady growing louder it is the sound that lies behind everything you see and feel he is coming niamh says the void the devourer of all things the essence of antilife approaches the door preparing to coalesce in this place this time and fill the receptacle that has been made for it the burning man for once the libertarian has nothing to say a tear stings his eye it could have been joy had he not relinquished that emotion long ago niamh claps her hands it is over she sighs quickly you must leave before it is too late for you the pounding grows louder and the beasts fall silent and still and look towards the door and wait chapter one god only knows the last train thundered out of the world behind it swarming spiders tore apart the land and rebuilt it with a boiling intellect and a cold eye hope and wonder and magic could not survive under that scrutiny the unequivocal image of the void was all that would remain through the carriage window church attempted to see some pattern in the dark pressing in on all sides but the dream was still heavy on him distracting haunting lying on some kind of bed or trolley or bench faces loomed over him uttering familiar yet unrecognisable voices on awakening he had been convinced of some lifechanging meaning just beyond his grasp but it was slipping further away with each moment it felt very much like a death dream his reflection in the window revealed the burden of responsibility carved into his brooding features there was too much darkness about him from the black hair to the eyes lost in shadow to the hollowness of his cheeks was this the chrysalis state before he would emerge as the libertarian bloody eyes staring from the gloom veitch came up silently behind him his features carried the hardness of a life lived on the street his eyes registering every hurt every betrayal every disappointment all too close to the surface church still didnt know how much he could trust him you know what we need some music veitch said sinatra church replied nah something something sunny a bit of heart bit of hope ive got this beach boys song stuck in my head cant remember what its called he quietly hummed a few offkey bars lounging back in a seat veitchs silver hand caught the lamplight the glow illuminating another hint of uncertainty in veitchs eyes lauras never going to accept me he commented surprised she never liked you much before now she knows youve killed about ten times as many people as the worst serial killer in history all of them brothers and sisters of dragons veitch gave nothing away any regrets church pressed i did what i did you had the spiders whispering in your ears dont blame them i knew what i was doing the void deals in despair ryan once you get infected with that you can believe black is white and up is down nothing looks right youre the one always banging on about accepting responsibility what i did felt right then now veitch gave a shrug that was supposed to represent easiness all that matters is i did it im never going to put it right no chance ive got to accept what i did and live with it veitch rolled up his shirt to reveal the mass of colourful tattoos that covered his torso he indicated a promethean figure strapped to a rock being attacked by ravens see that thats me being punished for ever for what ive done no relief just pain you fuck up like i did you deserve to pay the price church felt a pang of pity youre here now when we need you most so you trust me i do youre an idiot then even i dont trust me their eyes locked and church was acutely aware of the weight that lay between them veitch loved ruth as much as he did and neither of them was wholly sure where ruth stood what would happen when the time came for choices to be made could he trust veitch to walk away could he trust himself his transformation into the libertarian would be sparked in some way by his relationship with ruth before he couldnt comprehend how that could possibly happen now he could see with startling acuity the road begin to appear before him the question was clear how far would he be prepared to go for the woman he loved something similar unfolded in veitchs face none of us are heroes mate veitch said quietly in the end we just do the best we can and sometimes we fail veitch nodded but thats the thing about five if one screws up theres always someone else to make sure the job gets done veitch pondered this for a moment weve all got a part to play thinking about this too hard does my head in but its like even bad stuff is important like you couldnt have had some of the good if the bad things hadnt happened to cause it so its all linked pull back a bit and you start seeing things for what they are theyre just part of some he struggled to complete the concept pattern its like were so far inside it we dont see how it all fits together but if you could float above it somehow you know listen to me i sound like bleedin shavi he laughed looking forward to spending some time with that fucker i missed him he keeps me calm we go well together yeah we do outside the carriage the impenetrable black was like deepest space punctuated every now and then by a burst of fire in the far reaches a beacon crying for help quickly extinguished briefly a vast mountain of stone came into view topped by a sharp spire with gargoyles and carvings and windows but no sign of life the watchtower between the worlds you think miller and jack are enough to stop the void veitch was lost to the gloomy view not without the extinction shears maybe not even then its not going to end well for us is it no happy endings i never expected that for me but you lot you deserve better youve fought hard maybe dying wont be so bad i just feel so tired all this running and fighting they were interrupted by the silent arrival of ahken the host of the last train his heavylidded eyes staring from a skulllike face his black robes were pristine but he smelled of the grave and when he clasped his hands before him in a show of obsequiousness it hid something darker brothers of dragons he said is there anything that would make your final journey more pleasurable his words chilled church yeah some dancing girls veitch replied ahken smiled slyly you feel at home on the last train veitch stroked the leather seat its weird it feels a bit egyptian some chinese arabic victorian oh the last train is very old ahken said it was here in the earliest time before the golden ones before even the drakusa before the oldest things in the land church asked ahken did not reply what are you going on about veitch asked theres a hierarchy the gods manipulate us the oldest things in the land manipulate the gods and us puck the caretaker with an involuntary shudder church recalled the two figures he had seen or imagined hovering over the cauldron that was not a cauldron while he suffered the sleep like death in the casket of gold and ivory theres always something higher apparently defiance hardened veitchs features humans are on the way up and were not taking any bollocks from anyone any more church nodded in agreement this whole period is ushering in the next step of our evolution if we can follow the right path not fragile creatures any longer a lot of the ones above us dont like that he eyed ahken who smiled giving nothing away so does that mean we get one of those little silver rats like all the gods veitch said a caraprix ahken flinched you know something about them church asked him i know the last train and that is all ahken lied the tuatha de danaan cant live without them veitch said but what use are they they change shape yeah but i mean so what right its not like they serve up your dinner theyre like pets except i can never tell which is the pet the caraprix or the god church said laura kept one eye on her reflection in the window of the adjoining carriage as she teased her whiteblond hair the end of the world is no excuse for looking less than perfect she hummed further down the carriage a piper played a heartwrenching lament to the four lost cities of the homeland of the tuatha de danaan the king of the seelie court maintained a cold dignity but the queens head was raised eyes closed tears streaming down her cheeks do you miss hunter shavi sat crosslegged on the opposite seat laura noted the tinge of rawness around his left eye where the stolen alien orb had been inserted but it only emphasised the beauty of his bone structure the gleam of his black hair his flawless skin like i miss crabs his smile revealed he recognised the truth behind her words all right so hes not a complete loser and trust me ive shagged enough of those in my life to tell one at fifty paces shavi continued to smile will you stop that she sighed hes not had the experience weve had i mean weve all died and come back for a start he is a strong and capable man there is little in the far lands that would give him pause im going to be really pissed off if he goes and dies on me at least before ive managed to suck the life out of him you deserve a little happiness yeah tell that to her laura nodded towards ruth who stood apart from the strange members of the seelie court lost to the music and her thoughts she leaned on the spear of lugh as if it was a crutch ruth does not think badly of you she doesnt like it that im not a frosty miserable moaner and she envies my beauty wit and charm you know you do not have to be afraid to be honest about your feelings ive never been honest in my life why start now she fixed him with a telling gaze but for once shavi did not notice the subtle signs when are you going to tell us your real name he asked its dusantiago shavi nodded another faint smile so hows the new eye causing you a great deal of pain it appears to have settled in remarkably well for an eye stolen from an otherworldly construct to replace the one it stole from me shame she saw the briefest shadow cross shavis face whats up the eye doesnt always show him things he wants to see ruth stood in the aisle laura felt a charge in the air as if ruth were some kind of generator it was both comforting and unsettling at the same time so what are you seeing shavster or should i cross your palm with silver nothing laura grew serious im going to throw back at you all that shit you tell me about friends you shouldnt keep all this stuff inside you itll eat away at you and drive you mad trust me i know shes right shavi ruth prompted i do not see specifics just fleeting images impressions he shrugged he sees death ruth said shavi flinched how do you know that laura asked its circling all around us cant you feel it ruth hugged herself a coldness that brief feeling of a shadow passing over you laura shook her head what do i know thanks to cernunnos im more plant than human a beautiful little nature sprite maybe its my craft ruth accepted come on shavi share your burden reluctantly he replied yes death is all around as it comes closer symbols of its presence will arise as they always have done but we are usually oblivious to their presence youre creeping me out now laura said what are you talking about in life death is an anomaly it is like a weight dropped onto a taut rubber sheet bending the patterns all around throwing up indicators of its presence in the midst of them we discount them as coincidences randomness only after death has passed do we see those things for what they are patterns ruth said symbols thats where the true magic lies who dies shavi laura said sharply the pendragon spirit responds to the gravity that lies ahead so if i can cut through all your verbal wankery laura said youre saying brothers and sisters of dragons us one more the details are not clear laura couldnt tell if he was lying the musician came to an abrupt end of his piece and with silent awe the seelie court moved to one side of the carriage the last train emerged from the gulf into a crepuscular zone and then rapidly burst into a blaze of colour and detail they had arrived at the distant edge of the far lands but the members of the travelling court were not entranced by their return to the land the golden ones now called home their apprehensive attention was fixed on the fortress that sprawled to the lip of tir na nog as big as several cities and growing with every moment as armies of labourers relentlessly scurried with antlike organisation to erect annexes walls towers courtyards keeps from one angle it didnt resemble a fortress at all but an enormous insect squatting on the land all around was blasted dry and dusty and devoid of life and over it all loomed the burning man everyone remained silent until the fortress had passed from view and then they returned to their seats muttering darkly to those beside them the last train moved rapidly across the blasted zone past the long columns of monstrous beings marching out from the enemys fortress their great war machines shook the ground as they rumbled towards the centres of habitation soon the train passed onto rolling downs where the breezeblown grass looked like waves on a green sea and then to misty valleys and treecovered slopes in the carriage beyond the one occupied by the seelie court tom perched on a seat studiously constructing a rollup from the small tin he carried in his haversack with his silver hair tied back in a ponytail he still carried with him the spirit of woodstock scared he said no of course not crowther watched the passing scenery intently he was a bigboned man wrapped in a voluminous overcoat topped with a widebrimmed hat that made him appear even larger i have been here many times in my dreams nightmares speak for yourself our world is a place of low horizons here anything is possible yes death from nowhere torture the dismantling and rebuilding of the body in infinite agonising variations its one long funfilled holiday of the mind if you dont have the intellectual capacity to see the possibilities crowther sniffed theres little point in discussing it further tom eyed him coldly intellect is a poor substitute for experience as people without intellect always say oh look the old folk are arguing again this journey is like one neverending visit to a rest home youll be fighting over the rich tea biscuits next at sixteen mahalia had the cutglass tones of an expensive private education but her eyes suggested easy violence and a much greater age oh yes the teenage delinquent tom said move along no mobile phones to steal here for gods sake dont engage her crowther sighed youll only find ground glass in your food mahalia snorted i can be much more inventive than that her hardness fractured briefly as she glanced back along the carriage to where her boyfriend jack sat in gloomy conversation with miller at seventeen with his shock of blond hair and healthy farmboy appearance jack was a stark contrast to the older millers sickly pallor only emphasised by the lank brown hair falling around his ghostly face you need to do something about those two theyve got some kind of death wish mahalia added realising they were the subject of the conversation jack and miller approached tell them mahalia pleaded with tom and crowther just because theyve been given these special abilities doesnt mean they have to go out fighting dont mahalia jack had a worldweariness that belied his age everyone can see how this is going to turn out no they cant refusing any sign of weakness she quickly brushed away a tear jack took her hand my memorys back now i know what happened snatched from my mum when i was a baby and taken to the court of the final word where they worked on me tom winced they made me into a weapon jack continued the ultimate weapon the wishhex that they buried inside me is like he fumbled for words to describe a concept he could barely comprehend like a nuclear bomb that can devastate the very fabric of reality crowther interrupted so its there mahalia said so what that doesnt mean it has to be used you can have a normal life jack silenced her with an affectionate squeeze of her hand you know ive got a part to play all right she snapped so you release the wishhex there has to be a way you can do that without destroying yourself jacks sad smile stung more than any words could have we all want a little happiness but sometimes we have to give that up so everybody else can have a chance to be happy miller said tom saw in him an echo of shavis inner peace shut up you simpleton mahalia sighed refusing to be deterred miller took a seat across the aisle ive got something inside me too but mine heals you dont know what its like to have these gifts mahalia gifts she snorted they are jacks too though its hard to see it at the moment they speak to us in a way i cant explain and they tell us weve got a job to do if theres a chance we might be able to stop the void might might might weve got to try to have an ability and not use it and everybody suffers because of it how could you live with that i could she said were the keys jack said miller me theres no chance of winning without us theres no chance with you mahalia stormed down the carriage so no one could see her tears jack and miller followed trying to comfort her crowther watched toms face and saw an echo of mahalias desire for peace and happiness after a long period of responsibility they say you have the second sight crowther said one of my many wonderful attributes and the tongue that never lies oh yes but that doesnt mean i have to answer can you see how all this plays out crowther asked hesitantly victory or defeat who lives who dies tom smiled tightly rose and made his way to the opposite end of the carriage where he sat with his back to the others and closed his eyes the gentle rocking of the train should have calmed him but nothing did any more instinctively his fingers went to the gold ring in the shape of a dragon eating its tail that the goddess freyja had given to him in norway known as andvarinaut it was cursed to bring misery to anyone who owned it he had bartered away his future to help church laura and the rest and soon enough he would be forced to pay the price dont worry jerked alert by the voice tom saw a boy of about nine or ten sitting opposite him he was black his hair shorn to a bristle and a little overweight but he had the most expressive eyes tom had ever seen who are you tom growled my names carlton tom glanced back at crowther and the others they cant see me carlton said tom searched the boy for any suspicious signs you dont look like one of those damnable fairy folk im not then youre with the enemy im a friend ive come to help you carltons face was open and honest but tom wasnt going to be fooled he smoked and waited time is running out the devourer of all things is almost here his army sweeps across the far lands his assassins are abroad attempting to kill or disrupt key elements of your opposition you know little children do not talk like that tom noted acidly but there is one important thing you must know in the battle to come there will be people you can trust and people you cant and youre going to tell me which is which i suppose even those closest to you are not above suspicion tom snorted i want to help youll forgive me if i dont trust you tom returned to crowther and the others and when he glanced back the boy was gone when he described his encounter mahalias face filled with sadness and then anger youre lying her voice broke that cant have been carlton carltons dead in the great debating hall in the palace of glorious light mallory and decebalus were distracted from their strategy meeting by cries coming from the direction of the city gates a crowd of excited tuatha de danaan flooded into the courtyard outside the palace where lugh and an anxious cadre of the city guard waited uneasily for a caravan speeding up the winding streets the goldenskinned outriders wore heavy armour their faces grim but several of the horses had empty saddles behind them the royal carriage clattered so wildly over the cobbles that it was in danger of careering into the surrounding buildings the first of them lugh said when mallory arrived at his side the god stood tall and handsome and was filled with the burning power of the sun but since he had discovered the true extent of his sister niamhs betrayal it was as if a dark cloud had gathered within him the twenty great courts of the golden ones are answering our call all of them lugh still barely believed he had gained the support of his unruly people we have received responses from all save three he replied the seelie court who wander the worlds eternally their dark brethren the unseelie court but they will never follow our path and the court of the final word as lugh watched the gathering riders the weight of his leadership lay heavy on him i am concerned we sent a messenger to the court of the final word but he reported it sealed and silent and cold i fear the worst reiningin their mounts the outriders leaped down as the royal carriage skidded to a halt with a resounding crack the rear axle shattered the carriage sagging the horses rearing up guards ran to help the occupants the remainder of the caravan trailed through the palace gates and down the steep hill to where they had entered the court from the great plain aristocracy and soldiers merchants musicians and magicians who are they mallory asked the court of the yearning heart beware them brother of dragons though they are my people they are sly untrustworthy and dangerous from the carriage climbed the queen exuding a supernaturally charged eroticism so powerful that a tense silence fell over all those present of either sex she wore a transparent gown that only served to draw attention to her breasts and pubis accompanied by two young womeninwaiting she approached lugh no love was lost in the curt bow they exchanged but she found time to cast a curious sexually predatory gaze towards mallory i trust your journey was safe lugh enquired it was not we left as my court was overrun and from there to here we were harried continually many of my subjects were slaughtered in the process she noted without a hint of sadness imagine golden ones eradicated how can this abomination come to pass there are worse things ahead i fear is that a brother of dragons i spy leave him alone lugh said sharply he is an ally the queen snorted contemptuously more than an ally lugh continued he may well be our saviour and he has more to concern him than being idle sport for you the season has turned sister and fragile creatures have joined our kind at the high table you must adapt to this new arrangement the queen batted a dismissive hand see also what has been wrought upon our kind she marched to a covered wagon surrounded by heavily armed guards who kept the curious at bay haughtily the queen snatched back the cover to reveal six of her guards writhing in indescribable pain their bodies had been transformed by some disease sprouting scales horns patches of exposed bone and weeping sores what could do this to our kind the queen asked rangda behind them stood a young man of about twenty tall and thin dressed in a green crushed velvet suit with a hat a cane and sunglasses the whiff of the sixties lay heavily on him what can you tell us doctor jay mallory asked we had a runin with her in haightashbury in sixtyseven the doctor tapped the brim of his hat with his cane to emphasise his words the demonqueen of bali they call her she leads an army of evil witches and spreads plague wherever she goes the enemy sends her out to spread chaos he peered into the back of the wagon theres nothing you can do for them its just a matter of time refusing to believe the queen raged impotently mallory decebalus and doctor jay left lugh trying to calm her and returned to the doctors chaotic apartment in the palace it was packed to the brim with magickal items crystals boxes and parchments potions candles and skulls all moved from maths tower before the sorcerer had departed with hunter the curtains were drawn and it was too hot and claustrophobic jerzy moved studiously around the room reading from several volumes as he mixed a concoction his bonewhite skin and rictus grin glowing spectrally in the halflight when they entered he gambolled over and danced around them like a child mallory had a sense of a second jerzy behind the fool he had been made into by niamh and the court of the final word secret real serious and hidden with his own agenda are you ready to try again good friend jerzy said to doctor jay well give it a rest for a while mister mocker i need to refuel my mojo if you know what i mean the doctor flopped wearily into a large chair and put his head back he kept his sunglasses on despite the gloom still no success mallory prompted man if you only knew what id achieved here the doctor replied wonders and miracles its this place the blue fire all stirred up together im supercharged he sat crosslegged but yeah youre right not the wonders and miracles we need decebalus growled an epithet you cannot contact the king church i cant contact earth man its like its closed off all the shutters pulled down the voids made sure no ones getting in or out of our home at least not yet and no informations getting through either we dont even know if church or the others are still alive mallory said good friend jack giantkiller will not be defeated he will be with us soon jerzy said is that a platitude or a snippet of information from your mysterious friends and allies mallory asked suspiciously those higher powers youre secretly working for jerzy looked hurt sorry im an idiot ignore me mallory rested one hand on his sword llyrwyn in times of stress it calmed him whispering mysteriously through the pendragon spirit they shared you think theres hope for church he asked the doctor because if he doesnt turn up with the two keys theres no hope for us even if by some miracle we do locate the extinction shears doctor jay shrugged ive been reading researching talking to people out in the city all the races out there have their own myths about these times the end of the world myth you know theyre all in code like all stories but with the information weve got now you can read them in the right way its all the same story just told with different emphasis the battle between two great kingdoms the light and the dark in the tuatha de danaan version the fight between a spider and a snake that destroyed the universe for jerzys people the christians talk of the apocalypse and the antichrist decebalus mused the doctor nodded its all over our world too prophecies hints who is the antichrist or is that just another symbol the libertarian mallory suggested revelation talks of the people of god opposing the evil and two prophets called the two witnesses is that the two keys i thought revelation was supposed to refer to some roman emperor or something back when the bible was written mallory mused animated the doctor fetched more books from the shelves the patterns man theyre everywhere the true template behind reality see the patterns and you get what its all about a trip the biggest trip of all numbers are the key see he giggled the key numbers are the key in music music is the key to the universe mallory sighed youre having a rush doctor sorry man sorry but its the numbers science and magic maybe its the same thing the pattern is everywhere the aztecs had the legend of the five suns five was an important number to them each sun was an age and when a sun died there was chaos and the gods destroyed the world and started again were on the fifth sun now the last one this is the sun of movement tonatiu the rising eagle and when its over the world gets torn apart if thats a prediction it doesnt sound like theyve got a lot of faith in us mallory said doctor jay hesitated maybe we dont fail maybe we cause it your brain is addled decebalus spat the indian myths are like the aztec one in a way the universe goes through cycles of birth and death and rebirth the hindus believe that vishnu the preserver of order comes during times of chaos to save humankind he appears in a different form each time an avatar and he will appear in ten forms before the universe ends youre saying that number is significant mallory asked like the number of the last two groups of brothers and sisters of dragons except except there are only nine he rubbed his forehead where the familiar painful emptiness had risen again dont know man but vishnu has appeared in nine of his forms already for the tenth he will come as a man riding on a horse to destroy the earth they considered this for a moment sensing a darkening mood doctor jay moved on the norse had their myths of ragnarok the end of gods and humans when the world is destroyed after a final battle theres more from all over the world but i think you get the picture decebalus snorted patterns can be broken and stories are like the gods they tell you one thing but mean another the truth is slippery a sudden crash made them all jump jerzy had pitched forwards sending phials and bottles flying spasming on the floor his eyes rolled back so that only the whites were visible mallory decebalus and the doctor struggled to stop him hurting himself a seizure mallory said as jerzy finally grew still the court of the final word changed him so much its impossible to tell whats going on inside him doctor jay said jerzy remained unresponsive but as mallory carried him to the bed in the adjoining quarters a lowpitched hum emanated from the mocker growing more intense by the second until it set all their teeth on edge what the hells that mallory reeled away from the bed doctor jay clamped his hands over his ears strange days are upon us man it sounds like some weird radio signal all attempts to revive jerzy failed a silvery substance like mercury emerged from his tear ducts and slid across the surface of his eyes until they were like mirrors reflecting the troubled faces of mallory decebalus and doctor jay get all the courts medics together mallory said i want to know whats happening to him why its happening now and what it means with a screech of metal and a billowing cloud of hissing steam the last train juddered to a halt at the gates of the court of the soaring spirit you ready to face all those bastards again leaning on the window veitch watched the massive obsidian gates creak slowly open as puzzled guards emerged weapons drawn to investigate the arrival were on the same side now church replied this war is going to make a lot of difficult allies tell me about it veitch flashed a knowing glance at church common aims right whatevers happened youre one of us ryan you always were and you always will be veitch grunted noncommittally but the brief glance he exchanged with laura as she made her way along the carriage ahead of ruth and shavi spoke clearly of the problems ahead congratulations dude she said you finished a whole train journey without killing one of us leave him alone ruth snapped oh yeah you would say that is there a man around here you havent tapped her cheeks flushing ruths eyes flashed angrily shavi stepped in with a gentle hand on her arm its just laura he said softly amidst an odour of loam and a sound like dry insect casings rattling ahken arrived his obsequiousness undiminished your journey on the last train is over he said and it is time to make payment as he spoke tom crowther and the others made their way into the carriage whats the price church asked more than you can bear tom raced up thrusting himself between church and ahken most peoples of the far lands and the fixed lands only ride the last train once and their destination is always the same ahken continued with an unsettling edge to his voice out of deference i have allowed the seelie court free passage on their flight back to their homeland they will join me again shortly but you brothers and sisters of dragons have journeyed on the last train three times and three times is the limit outside the window on the dusty approach to the city the members of the seelie court waited curiously for the other passengers to join them instinctively church felt that the train had already started moving imperceptibly gradually building speed you must let them alight tom insisted you allowed them passage from the fixed lands the last train was summoned by blood ahken said you cannot take them to the final destination the survival of everything depends on them as ahkens smile broadened church had the uneasy feeling that something was squirming just beneath his skin your kind has little respect for the eternal patterns of existence and the great inviolable rules that one ahken pointed to veitch transgressed the ultimate law when he travelled to the grim lands to bring back this one ahken indicated shavi that has not been forgotten indeed the current crisis that grips all the lands is a direct result of that action you are architects of this suffering church and veitch stepped forwards hands on their swords tom held them back dont he said quietly you cant hurt it what you see is not what is you were our only chance to escape earth when the spiders came church said we had no choice but to call you every action has repercussions seen and unforeseen you must take responsibility for them wait tom said they are too important for their lives to be forfeit no one is too important there was a crack like thunder to ahkens voice take me in lieu tom pressed i have you anyway true thomas you knew the price asked the last time you travelled with me but you have traded away your future and now you are worthless to me recognising that ahken would not back down church partdrew caledfwlch and the blue fire fizzed and crackled around him the gravity surrounding ahken grew by the moment and church was now in no doubt as to whom he represented they could not defeat such a force quick now be swift like mercury like the wind the voice rose up around them before church caught a glimpse of a figure slipping low and lithe along the carriage more mischievous grin and sizzling eyes than substance at the same time ahken was altering into something that filled church with dread clasped hands became hooked claws and the smell of the grave intensified but church only had an instant to glimpse it for there was a flash of blinding light and then utter darkness the carriage door opened with a sound like escaping steam and church instinctively propelled those nearest to him out into the bright daylight as he sprawled in the dust he saw the others urged unceremoniously out around him before a flash of brown sealskin bolted out to pause close by his ear he looked deeply into yellow eyes and saw world upon world before their colour changed grasped from the jaws of dark disaster you merry wanderer are the pucks prime spark enjoy your good fortune happy fool and lover for falling so neatly in my purview thank you church said still shaken by what he had sensed in the carriage no thank you brother of dragons it serves me that you serve me but the puck cannot always be on hand to pluck you from the fire the end can only be achieved by your own devices and perhaps not even then that is the way of the weft and the weave and we are all at its mercy even the oldest things in the land in the space between thoughts the puck was gone he had saved and guided them several times but church feared he was shepherding them towards an uncertain future that would benefit only the puck with a belch of steam the last train raced away amidst the billowing cloud and the rising dust church had the impression that it wasnt a train at all but a long black insect scurrying across the land the roar of its wheels an angry cry that promised retribution another day i saw the puck too shavi said helping church to his feet he plays a long game but at this moment i am glad he has chosen to act as our protector until the time arises when he needs to sacrifice us to achieve his ends church said were always pawns and im sick of it the nowexcited guards hastily ushered the seelie court through the gates while others rushed to collect church and the others to one side etain and the other brothers and sisters of spiders stood stiff and isolated by death and their former allegiance church hadnt even realised they were on the train he tore his attention from ruth wiping the dust from veitchs cheek and turned to tom what did ahken mean that youve traded away your future stop asking fool questions tom adjusted his glasses in a manner that church had come to recognise as defensive you cant keep secrets from me any more tom i can do what i damn well like i should be dead by rights and youve made my life a misery by bringing me back ive got no purpose here now so dont you start telling me i need to speak my mind to you its you that owes me to keep your nose out of my business its the least you can do for the pain youve caused church winced and tom instantly appeared to regret his words theres a more pressing matter he said on the train i encountered a boy who im told is dead he said his name was carlton and he told me something you ought to consider church saw that toms hand was trembling he tucked it quickly in his jacket pocket he said in the battle ahead there are people we can trust and people we cant you believe him who knows what to believe in this madhouse but if i were you id keep a close eye on those around you and the ones at your back the streets of the court of the soaring spirit were filled with a cheering throng that left the brothers and sisters of dragons baffled and embarrassed by the obvious adulation they were receiving many of the disparate races of tir na nog were represented from the tuatha de danaan whose calls had an uneasy edge of desperation to animals that walked and talked like men squat dour mountain folk batwinged sableskinned people from the forest of the night short tall fat thin bizarrely attired veitch was surprised by his reaction he had forgotten the peculiar rich uplifting qualities of the far lands the potent scents spices fruit and perfumed candles colours more vibrant than his home and the rich textures of the stone metalwork and carvings demanding that he touch them it felt as if he was in a dream it felt like coming home what are you smiling at ruth asked him between nods to the wellwishers lining the way do i need a reason you usually at the palace of glorious light drenched in the midmorning sunlight they were guided to chambers that had once been occupied by niamh the courts former queen where mallory hunter and caitlin now waited i didnt believe it when the guards told me mallory exclaimed he shook churchs hand forcefully and then the two groups hugged and greeted each other like longlost friends laura and hunter adopted a blase attitude but were soon sequestered together deep in conversation their eyes gleaming oblivious to the high emotions that whirled around them after the reunion mallory said we couldnt find the extinction shears we failed i failed thats because you were looking in the wrong place church said reassuringly the market of wishful spirit is in the grim lands why on earth would it be in the land of the dead caitlin asked it doesnt matter well start working on a plan to get to them immediately mallory said not going to be that easy mate veitch interjected we come in and out of this place like its a tourist destination but there are strict rules about getting to the grim lands ive been there twice the first time i brought the void back and caused all this mess and the second time i had to die to get there leaving the others to share stories mallory led church along the sundrenched corridors to doctor jays laboratory as they neared the constant lowpitched hum set their teeth on edge when church saw jerzy unconscious silvercoated eyes wide and staring his heart went out to his friend whats wrong with him ive got math everybody working on it no one has any idea its got to be linked to the voids return in some way yeah but jerzy what could he have to do with anything the puck took an interest in him even kidnapped him for a while that could be it he cursed under his breath im useless all these important details and i never see them at the time why didnt i question why the puck got involved with jerzy what would you have been able to do mallory led church out of the chamber and closed the door to muffle the unsettling noise all these connections half the time they could be random no one sees their importance till after the fact i hope hes going to be all right church cast one last glance back at the door separating him from his friend it had been too long since theyd spent time together yeah hes one of the good ones mallory replied so this is going to sound harsh but weve got too much else to worry about right now doctor jay is doing what he can for jerzy and if theres any significance to this change well find out quickly we saw the enemys army all over the far lands church said mallory nodded theyll be here soon weve already been softened up by the riotbeasts the enemys going to throw everything at us theres an assassin loose in the city trying to pick us off one by one weve got strategies in place to tackle it no brother or sister of dragons travels alone trebling patrols but sooner or later someone will make a mistake tonight we rest and plan church replied tomorrow we start fighting back too many suspicious glances from the others eventually drove veitch out into the deserted corridors where his incipient guilt over the last few violent months gradually subsided for a while he wandered deep in thought about ruth and his belief that if he had any chance of redemption it was through her until a faint echo told him he was not alone he waited watchfully and when no one materialised he slipped around a corner ready to draw his sword hesitant footsteps heralded the cautious approach of a woman of around twentyfive her delicate face framed by blond ringlets in an oldfashioned style that veitch had seen many times during his stays in victorian london oh she said startled that he was waiting for her why are you following me veitch growled you are ryan veitch she replied in a cockney accent thats what the guards say all the fellers and the girls are talking about it downstairs whats it to you she smiled let me tell you ducky rough hands grabbed veitchs arms and threw him against the wall three men had come up behind him with the stealth of brothers of dragons strong arms strong faces sharp eyes but he could see the hatred in their eyes he struggled to throw them off but in a second the woman had a knife against his throat names cathy lovey and as god is my witness im going to carve your flesh for what you did to me ive never met you before which is why im still here im one of the lucky ones but back in my old time you murdered three of my brothers and sisters we never got the chance to be five and im not alone there youve got a lot of blood on your hands ryan veitch a voice said at his ear good decent people just trying to do their bit for existence i saw my fair share of twisted slaughter at dunkirk but nothing like what you did you betrayed the pendragon spirit you betrayed everything existence stands for you killed people who would have been our friends and lovers and now youre going to pay veitch opened his mouth to account for himself but cathy pricked the knife deeper into his flesh no lies she hissed just a quick cut and you wont be hurting any more of us before she could thrust there was a shift in the quality of the light and shadows appeared source unknown a background drone swelled like the hum of a generator a charge to the very air itself ruth rounded the corner eyes crackling with an unearthly power hair snaking around her head as if it was alive from her outstretched hands whirled a storm of blue light veitch had seen her like that once before during the battle of london when her craft had consumed her and she had become a lethal weapon that could destroy friend and foe alike cathys knife slipped from trembling fingers as a gale flung her and her three helpers across the flags the knife whisked up and embedded itself to the hilt in the thin join between two wallstones youre protecting him cathy raged ruths appearance slowly normalised hes working with us now no one forgets all the people hes killed but we need him we dont need him cathy shouted hell always be a danger at the end hell turn youll see veitch winced when ruth cast an unguarded glance his way see he knows it himself the three men helped cathy to her feet their expressions no less murderous we owe it to all the others to kill him before he destroys everything never forget never forgive tears of anger streaming down cathys face she ran back along the corridor with the others close behind thanks veitch said i should have expected that probably best if you dont go wandering off on your own from now on veitch tried to put out of his mind how much he had thrown away the camaraderie the sense of being on the side of right respect love all for some immature desire for revenge that had become more undefined with each passing day he felt pathetic he hated himself seeing some of this in his face ruths expression softened with pity and that made him feel even worse dont worry she said its going to be tough but people will come around you know what i dont care ive got a job to do thats the important thing the sooner i can start using this blade to cut things down the better a window framed the distant shape of the burning man hazy in the midmorning sky and for the briefest instant veitch thought it was looking deep into his very heart fiddles and pipes and voices created an exuberant music that rippled out from the palace of glorious light across the rooftops of the nightshrouded city and raised the spirits of everyone who heard it the celebration centred on the great hall of feasting though the thronging revellers spilled out into corridors and antechambers musicians from the court of the yearning heart and the seelie court took it in turns to play the former chose long rich dense reels that exuded eroticism and could ignite passion with a simple run of notes while the latter selected uplifting melodies that exhorted the listener to love life and focus on higher purpose dancers whirled continually collapsing in corners when exhausted for new couples to take their place the sprawling kitchens at the heart of the palace had been working all day to prepare the feast in clouds of steam and ferocious heat from the ovens that left every worker stripped to their underclothes pies and roasts and delicately spiced dishes stews and soups fruits and cakes and sweetmeats were piled high on the tables around the edge of the hall goblets were never empty a small army of servants moved steadfastly around with flagons of wine and ale the atmosphere was one of wild abandon from the dancers to the staggering drunks to the couples who made love in the shadows not caring who saw them the festivities had been called to celebrate the reunion of the brothers and sisters of dragons as they prepared for the next and final stage of the campaign but it was also a statement that even in the sight of the burning man life was a powerful driving force shavi mildly drunk and happy watched the proceedings with one foot on a beerwashed table and a goblet clutched tightly to his chest this is the reason why we do what we do he said sipping his ale mallory watched laura grab hunter by the hand and drag him behind a pillar free booze shavi laughed we lived in a world where strange and wonderful things happened on a daily basis yet we barely raised our eyes from our work to see them we were truly blessed to exist in the fixed lands everything that is writ bold here in the far lands was there moving quietly on the edge of our vision just waiting to be discovered i never saw that much of it then you never looked every magical thing is invisible until you find the right eyes to see it whether it be love or joy or friendship or a small flying pixie do you ever get depressed if you saw the world as i did you would not yes there is hardship yes there is pain and suffering and if you focus on each instance in detail then the only thing you will find is pointless misery but the mysteries of cause and effect are far beyond our abilities to understand them because we love science so much we believe there is a process where a simple action has a straightforward reaction but the system in which we operate is massively complex and what may have started at the beginning of time caused a billion billion connecting reactions that are only now bearing fruit pick any point along that chain and you would not see what came before or what the final result would be only that instant good or bad in and of itself oh yeah the butterfly effect flap flap big storm a world away indeed we fool ourselves into believing we understand cause and effect but we see nothing we know nothing that is why you cannot plan to influence the world for good or bad in the same way that the butterfly cannot plan to create the storm no one can predict the repercussions in a complex system in the end all you can do is trust your heart and hope then why are you so upbeat it could all be trending towards misery because if you examine your own life you will see that the universe is kindly and that it does its best to help you lauras right you really are an old hippy mallory sipped his ale thoughtfully so nobody knows anything and we just trust our instincts our hearts i wish id had somebody like you on our team to keep the morale up hal would have fulfilled that role if he had not become part of the blue fire be kind of good to get him back mallory stirred uneasily i still dont understand why theres only four of us every other team gets five but us he shrugged i keep expecting somebody new to walk through the door i cant shake the feeling that somethings missing perhaps it was simply meant to be that your team has only four members why i dont get it that is my point we cannot see the patterns we can only trust that things will work out for the best i really wish i could see the world like you do shavi i just feel sad we all have our pain mallory because in the vast indecipherable pattern we are all insignificant while at the same time we are each and every one hugely significant for our actions small and large make up that very pattern we are threads in the warp and the weft in the centre of the room caitlin danced alone lost to herself the morrigans love of sex and life evident in each seductive movement loading his plate with roast meat veitch ignored the pointed stares of the other brothers and sisters of dragons from across the ages they milled around the hall as they tried to avoid being dragged into decebaluss ribald revelry as he stalked back and forth swilling ale by the flagon while indulging in outrageous flirting to make aula jealous for much of the evening church and ruth had been involved in intense conversation but they broke off to join veitch as he made his way over to shavi and mallory you know how to throw a good party church said one of the perks when you get your own great court mallory replied i still cant believe the tuatha de danaan let you take over ruth laughed they owed me big time church surveyed the brothers and sisters of dragons with pride they seem like a great crew from what i can tell brave fierce well do well with them on our side would you expect the pendragon spirit to choose any other shavi said you think theyre formidable you wait till you see the gods mallory said with a sly smile norse greek chinese the whole terrifying insane collection where are they ruth asked weve got them in their own separate camps outside the city walls if you think the tuatha de danaan are fractious when they get together you really dont want to see this lot mixing with time on their hands theyd be at each others throats in a second imagine them side by side on the battlefield church said whatever troops the void can throw at us are going to be up against it as long as our lot dont kill each other first the revelry was disrupted by the crash of the main door slamming open in staggered ronnie kelly a brother of dragons in a field uniform from the great war his expression devastated he flailed for a moment before raising his hands in a silent plea they were covered in blood murder he eventually stuttered theres been a murder the band came to a sudden halt church veitch and mallory raced towards ronnie before the others realised what he was saying in one of the branching corridors off the main approach to the hall a woman in a pink satin georgian dress was sprawled eyes wide open a neat hole had been punched in the centre of her forehead marie mallory mouthed all he could think of was her accusation the previous day that he had attacked her haunted he dropped to his knees to check her pulse though it was clear she was dead angry voices rose up from a small crowd of brothers and sisters of dragons further down the corridor a man in a georgian morning suit pointed an accusing finger at veitch he did it he killed our marie no church stepped quickly between veitch and the group hes been with us all the time dont jump to conclusions why not the man brushed away a stray tear that is what he does fearing they would attack veitch shavi held up his hand and drew all attention to him on the periphery of his vision his alien eye glimpsed hidden shapes and amidst the dislocation he heard the distant whispers of the invisible world the murderer is still here in the palace and more we are under great threat fan out across the palace church said stick to the core groups that decebalus has defined for you nobody goes alone reluctantly the brothers and sisters of dragons moved off along the echoing corridors this wasnt me veitch said eyeing the body we know church replied i was stupid to think the enemy would give us time to regroup come on shavi followed church veitch ruth and laura along the corridor mallory hunter and caitlin headed for the stairs to the next level as the groups separated shavi heard a rasping unfamiliar voice issuing from caitlin that chilled him to the bone it said death is circling blood will come navigating the deserted barely lit upper reaches of the palace was not easy hunter led the way with a torch snatched as they climbed the stairs in the east tower to his left mallorys sword provided its own blue light to guide them while at the rear the morrigan had risen in caitlin who now moved like a jungle cat the possession brought physical change too her eyes becoming a deeper black her muscles tauter gripping her axe effortlessly she appeared to hear things beyond even her comrades sharpened perceptions climbing the last flight of stairs they entered an echoing loft space beneath the ancient oak rafters that supported the palaces pitched roof sleeping birds rested on every beam and in every nook and cranny above their heads the floor white with their excrement caitlin rested an unnaturally cold hand on hunters shoulder her head halfcocked as she listened theres someone up ahead you need to get yourself a sword mallory said dont you worry about me hunter replied now who loves the stink of bird droppings enough to hide out up here the loft area branched right and then broke off in three directions over the palaces wings as they reached the junction an earsplitting highpitched shriek ripped out of the dark the birds erupted from their roosts driving mallory hunter and caitlin apart as they surged around the enclosed space one glimpse of caitlin wielding her axe in a cloud of feathers and blood reached mallory before he was driven away by talons and beaks bodies battering him like stones disoriented by the beat of wings he staggered back until he felt the wall against his shoulder amidst the chaos he glimpsed a figure ahead seemingly unmoved by the storm a womans hair a cheek an eye in the gradual accumulation of information a deep cold ran through him driving out all rational thought he propelled himself through the birds towards her his worst fears were confirmed a woman in her late twenties stood before him blond hair tied back face weary from too much struggle too soon a woman from his old life before he was a brother of dragons forced to endure an atrocity of mallorys making that ironically set him on the path to becoming who he was the emotions her face dredged up blinded him to the knowledge that she couldnt possibly be there he grasped her hand desperate to tell her all the things he should have said but never had the chance but all that came out was a weak im sorry the womans eyes glittered hatefully through the haze of his crushing guilt mallory finally noticed something offkilter about her pain jabbed into the back of his hand drawing his attention to fingers that were no long the slender pale ones he had grabbed but made of twisted blackthorn a drop of his blood gleamed on the end of one sharp protrusion the womans face unpacked altered until what remained was a head that appeared to be constructed of crumpled paper with black blinking eyes hovering above a malicious grin the body was now constructed wholly from the same twisted strands of blackthorn mallory threw himself back i saw you in ogmas library the creature lifted its hand high tilted back its head and dripped mallorys blood into its open mouth now we are joined for all time it said in a voice like rustling paper and that will not be for long it advanced on mallory one finger outstretched as if accusing him scrambling to his feet mallory hacked off the blackthorn creatures arm with a crackle the forearm regrew from the stump the index finger extending into an even more brutal point you cannot stop me the creature said nothing ever stops me mallory lopped off the arm again but it grew back just as quickly from out of the whirling birds hunter exploded into the creature an instant later caitlin was at his side axe at the ready should have brought some defoliant hunter watched the creature pick itself up and turn those chilling black eyes upon him take it easy mallory said your weapons cant hurt it for a second the creature weighed an attack and then another highpitched shriek increased the birds wild activity battering her way through the wall of feather beak and talon caitlin searched for their adversary but there was no longer any sign of it they retreated to the only entrance to the loft space and waited until the birds had calmed and returned to their roosts a careful investigation throughout the branching wings of the loft found only a ragged hole into the night and a potential escape route across the roofs of the city as they looked out over the lights of the court of the soaring spirit hunter said you hear that at first they thought it was the thunder of an approaching storm until faint metallic notes rose up amongst the pounding the enemy caitlin said theyve reached the great plain it wont be long before theyre at the city walls mallorys attention was caught by the distant outline of the burning man simmering in the night sky the fires rising within it see he noted its nearly done soon the void will here and when that happens the clock stops its the end of the world for all of us chapter two ten degrees of hell from the window it appeared as if a black cloak had been laid across the rooftops surrounding the palace of glorious light as the night receded with the first silvery light of dawn that cloak gleamed with an oily sheen that eventually revealed itself to be thousands of ravens perched in eerie silence the beady eyes of the morvren all turned towards the palace what is it with birds hunter said since that thorny bastard attacked last night ive spent all my time picking feathers out of every crevice and now this blame church theyre his laura carved her name in the stone with a small knife i think he might debate the ownership issue with you a supernatural omen of death following you around to pick the bones of the fallen isnt quite the same as a budgie looks like theres more of them laura said casting a bored glance out of the window they know something we dont youre lucky youve got me to protect you then sorry did you say torment a gong resonated along the silent corridors summoning them to a gloomy chamber where the walls and windows were hidden behind purple and scarlet drapes magickal artefacts were piled high on the tables and floor suggestive of some hidden ritual pattern skulls crystals athames statuettes jewels candles and more parchments and books were stacked headhigh in one corner with a long delicate brush math carefully inscribed protective runes on a section of wall that would soon be hidden again behind the drapes his fourfaced mask turned slowly and deliberately even though church and shavi talked intensely in one corner there was an unshakable feeling that something had just departed the space nobody thought to lay on a muffin basket hunter said you cant have a breakfast meeting without muffins funny man laura shied away from math and went to annoy tom who had just lurched in grumpy and tired soon the two teams and tom were gathered with math observing silently from one corner all of them were aware of the bond they shared despite their personal differences the air was electric with the pendragon spirit what lies ahead is more than weve ever faced before and theres a strong possibility that none of us will be getting out of this alive church said its important were under no illusion about that its the job hunter said no point grumbling about it thats easy for you to say youve got a death wish laura said tartly we know where we stand mallory said the question is where do we go and just as importantly what do we do about that thing we found in the loft last night if as you describe it can change appearance at will it could remain amongst us picking us off one by one shavi mused whos to say its not here now ruth said they all shifted uneasily math what did you find out church asked the creature is known as the hortha maths voice echoed hollowly from behind his mask it is mentioned many times in our histories as an agent of destruction and death and chaos an agent of the void caitlin added the hortha is a hunter a tracker once it has identified its prey it cannot be deterred or stopped it will continue until it has killed okay you got a load of gods lined up out there ready to fight for the cause veitch began but from where im standing the biggest threat to the void is the army of dragons if i was the enemy id send that thing out to pick the whole lot of us off one by one cut out the heart were not going to be sitting back letting the hortha get on with it church said ryan so what he gets to call the shots now laura said were all here because weve got individual strengths that benefit the group as a whole veitch and hunter theyre the strategists what am i the cheerleader laura said sullenly give me a cun lets focus shall we church insisted were taking the fight straight to the void veitch said starting right now decebalus is going to lead the army of dragons the gods and the tuatha de danaan against the enemy forces our troops can be organised before the enemy reaches the city ruth asked i reckon decebalus is a big bastard hes not going to let people drag their feet in the meantime were going to split into two teams one lot is going to get the extinction shears once theyve done that theyre going to rendezvous with the other group who are going straight into the fortress of the void when you say it like that it sounds simple hunter looked around the room does anybody else fancy some wine hunters right laura said youve already made it clear the rules say nobody gets into the land of the dead and that fortress must be swarming with the enemy never mind the burning man hanging right over the top of the place what are you going to do walk up to the front door and ask nicely actually well be using the back door church said a group of colonists in roanoke back in elizabethan times were kidnapped and taken to the fortress one of them was virginia dare that little girl laura said she escaped from the fortress church continued she knows a secret way back in you cant take her back there ruth protested laura and i both spoke to her last night shes completely traumatised by what happened to her in that place it would be cruel to make her go back its not like i havent wrestled with this ruth church no we dont have a choice he said firmly theres too much at stake shes just a little girl shes stronger than you think caitlin said if this has to be done well protect her as much as we can so its a suicide mission hunter said into the fortress blow up the burning man last post and medals all round delivered to the ones we leave behind of course and what part do miller and jack play in this shavi asked a touch of weariness was evident in church as he shook his head maths been trying to work that out all we know is that the two keys are needed along with the extinction shears to stop the void so were winging it veitch said with what the others thought was an alarming note of relish we trust our instincts once we get in there thats what we do right i usually prefer what we in the security business call a plan hunter said but im willing to try your way for the novelty death wish laura muttered im going to take virginia miller and jack to the fortress alone church began mallory hunter and veitch all cut him off but ruths voice was louder you dont get to play hero on your own she said church saw the truth in their faces you dont trust me he said you know im fated to turn into the libertarian and you think im going to sell you all out its not that mallory said unconvincingly we just dont want to take any risks the more of us we can get in there the better chance well have the sting of betrayal was evident in churchs face for a brief moment before he continued then we all choose the two teams im going to the fortress so the other team needs a leader mallory mallory nodded ive seen stoke after that the grim lands is the only place left to visit ryan ruth suggested you told me the dead worship you as some kind of hero sounds like you could use that to our advantage they should know where the market is in their own home no mallory said firmly i dont need to be looking over my shoulder all the time in a place like that fair enough veitch replied your loss mate ill go caitlin flashed a brief smile at mallory we make a good team we trust each other and two of us should be enough travel light travel fast mallory began to protest but caitlin silenced him dont try to protect me ive got a goddess of death inside me you goon okay thats a plan hunter said and it only leaves one question outstanding how do they get to the grim lands after a long moment of silence veitch said the same way everybody else does they die the great council chamber in the court of the soaring spirit was almost as large as the colosseum with marble pillars supporting a domed glass roof that brought shafts of morning sunlight onto the chamber floor basreliefs of events from the long history of the tuatha de danaan lined the walls and high overhead gothic carvings of strange beings echoed the works of the master medieval stonemasons the buildings enormous scale generated a reverential atmosphere and even though it was almost full barely a whisper ran around the tiered seating caitlin stood on the floor of the chamber next to the speakers wishpost turning over what veitch had said the chatter of her three personas had stilled for long periods since the morrigan had joined with her but she could always feel the goddesss brooding presence at the back of her head the morrigan was a being of contrasts cold of will and hot of passion deathdealing and lifeaffirming but always dangerous very very dangerous mallory entered the chamber with lugh rhiannon and two other gods caitlin didnt recognise with each passing day she found mallory more impressive as he rose to the challenge of dealing with the responsibilities that had been thrust upon him yet she was troubled by the deep sadness that now suffused him there appeared to be no cause for it but it had gained such a powerful grip on him that it was almost as if he had decided that the best of his life now lay behind him and only duty and sacrifice were ahead he was concerned about her too it was visible in his face whenever they were together and after their decision to travel to the grim lands it had become even more intense mallory believed the morrigan was a corruption that would eventually eat away the essence of the caitlin he knew how could she explain to him that she finally felt whole with the morrigan inside her doubts faded like the morning mist her slowly creeping black despair was now walled off her mind was clear and fresh her thoughts sharp and she fizzed with an energy and unshakable vision it was almost like a drug it was almost as if it was meant to be mallory took her to one side church and the others are getting a briefing from decebalus on the gods and the readiness of the army of dragons but hell be along if you need him im fine youre sure he pressed as a sister of dragons theyd listen to me but you know theyve got a deepseated prejudice against fragile creatures with the morrigan inside me though im one of them they have to listen doubly so because theyre scared of the morrigan and a sister of dragons and the morrigan combined is just too much for them to contemplate if you cant win them over with rational argument give them your spooky stare and terrify them into submission nice strategy he squeezed her hand good luck as mallory left hunter sauntered up seemingly oblivious to the weight of the historic occasion still no sign of the last two courts he noted so were missing the unseelie court and the court of the final word yeah i wouldnt hold my breath for that last one oh we had a bit of a falling out thats never stopped them before caitlin said puzzled they had a lot of big plans but in the end they came to nothing hunter smiled tightly caitlin shrugged apparently the unseelie court hates everybody and theyve got a real grudge against the human race from hundreds of years ago so this is it eighteen of the twenty great courts he looked around at the silent ranks glowing in the sun with a diffuse golden light all the arrogant bastards hanging on the words of one fragile creature he surprised her with a kiss on the cheek knock em dead literally if possible hunter joined mallory lugh and rhiannon on the edge of the floor and caitlin immediately went to the speakers position these are the endtimes she said in a strong clear voice you know it in your hearts you can feel the ashes on the wind and if you still doubt you can look up into the sky and see the burning man looking back ready to judge you i know for a race like the golden ones its easy to dismiss these signs you have existed and exerted your power far beyond the time of fragile creatures and all other beings in the far lands and the fixed lands you have always believed this rule would continue for all time unshakable yet i know you understand the rules of existence and that you know the most important one for the wiser ones amongst you have stated it many times there is always something higher what you now face is higher and you have been expecting this time because it holds such a powerful place in your own stories and mythology the time when the devourer of all things will return to end the days of gods and men to wipe the board clean and to set out its dark vision for a new age as she looked around the audience caitlin experienced a startling moment of clarity once again she was the smalltown doctor whose only aim in life was to heal the people who came to her and here she was addressing a congregation of gods she was so out of her depth it was laughable yet astonishingly they were heeding her every word the power of the tuatha de danaan was so great she could feel the throb of it in the air some of the lower ranks had the plasticky features of shop dummies as though they had been freshly minted but the oldest were barely human in shape at all some she perceived only as balls of brilliant light and amongst those she knew was the one the others spoke of in reverent tones as the dagda this is an historic meeting she continued the first time the great courts have joined for a council since you left the four cities of your homeland youre all suspicious of each other i know that but above all you recognise that this is about the survival of your race caitlin placed one hand on the wishpost in the air above it an image coalesced until everyone in the room felt as if they were standing amidst the scene they witnessed there was the enemy fortress sprawling on a scale that took the breath away the smell of rotting meat and burning clouds of greasy smoke obscuring the sky the constant beat of heavy machinery overhead the burning man glowed through the billowing smoke the image closed in on the shape until everyone could see the figures writhing within the conflagration you always thought yourselves the most powerful things in existence but in the end thats all you are fuel caitlin continued the burning man has been created to provide a space in which the void can manifest some aspect of itself its power is normally diffuse across the entire universe a faint background energy that keeps the whole mess running it needs to focus that power in one place at one time to change the structure of things it already has immeasurable power enough to transform the fixed lands with the help of its agents the army of the ten billion spiders so why does it need to come here why is it intent on drawing itself into an overwhelming force because it knows its success is not guaranteed it knows that somewhere in this land are the keys to a force that could stop it in its tracks perhaps even destroy it the image above the wishpost changed to a view over the great megalithic structure at callanish on the northwest coast of the scottish isle of lewis in the hazy predawn the standing stones shone like silver against the rolling green landscape shaped by the blasting atlantic gales as the golden rays from the rising sun touched one of the stones lines of blue fire ran out in all directions crossing interlinking until an intricate network blazed across the landscape a communal intake of breath whispered around the chamber the blue fire is the mark of existence in our reality caitlin said it is the lifeblood flowing through everything can you feel its power the wishpost ensured the observers lived the image it revealed an exhilarating feeling of rejuvenation of hope and awe connected everyone in the room existence is the equal and opposite of the devourer of all things life to the voids antilife hope to its despair and small shards of existence are embedded in all fragile creatures we call it the pendragon spirit the brothers and sisters of dragons can access that power but soon all fragile creatures will be able to bring it to life inside them you call us fragile creatures but we are not we are gods all of us caitlin expected some resistance but as she looked around the intense beautiful faces she saw the first signs of mute acceptance the pendragon spirit was planted in fragile creatures at the very beginning and it is there for a reason she continued its the secret weapon ready to be unleashed when we need it most and that time is now the final battle with the void to decide our survival or destruction to decide the shape of all reality to come the biggest stakes of all amidst the thunder of the blood in her head she could hear the morrigan urging her on this is not the time for the golden ones to remain aloof or to indulge in petty squabbles amongst yourselves this is the time to reach your potential to rise above your limitations put aside your arrogance and recover humility to reach out to those who can help you and thereby help yourselves individually we can achieve nothing together we can change reality caitlin searched the faces for some sign that she was winning them over but they all remained implacable i hereby call upon the great courts of the golden ones to stand together as one united for the first time since you left your homeland i ask you to join with the other gods your cousins from across the great dominions to create the greatest force the far lands have ever seen and i call on you to stand shoulder to shoulder with the brothers and sisters of dragons as allies in this great war stand now with the kingdom of the serpent which symbolises the full force of existence and the power of the blue fire together we can defeat the kingdom of the spider together we can win a long moment of silence followed her words until lugh said loudly the court of souls ease stands with the brothers and sisters of dragons as equals and allies one by one the kings and queens of the great courts rose to announce their support in steady if at times bemused voices her heart pounding caitlin glanced towards mallory who nodded in return she felt warmed by the look of pride she saw in his eyes this is an historic moment she announced when the final golden ones had returned to their seats we stand together now and for evermore a formidable partnership go back to your courts and celebrate what has been achieved this day in the meantime battle plans are being drawn up and we will shortly call your leaders together to discuss tactics as the tuatha de danaan began to drift away mallory came over caitlin could tell he wanted to hug her but he restrained himself and clapped one tentative hand on her arm instead now for the hard part he said lets celebrate our little achievements shall we before he could respond a lowpitched hum rose up growing louder until they were forced to cover their ears thats the same sound that came when jerzy fell sick mallory shouted all around the tuatha de danaan were reeling some fell back into their seats while others clutched at the walls for support rubbing their temples as if afflicted with acute headaches there was a dimming of the faint golden glow that exuded from their skin so that they looked unaccountably sickly whats wrong with them caitlin said the sound appeared to emanate from every part of the vast chamber as caitlin prepared to scramble out of the room she caught sight of hunter pointing towards the upper tiers following his finger she saw rapid movement across the highest row of tuatha de danaan spreading to each row in turn the caraprix mallory exclaimed the shapeshifting creatures that held a symbiotic relationship with the gods were separating from their hosts where they had been disguised as clasps and amulets buckles jewellery and daggers silvery flashes caught the sunlight as they fluidly transformed into mercury eggs that slithered across golden bodies down walls onto the floor and away beside mallory rhiannon cried gently one arm across her stomach as if gripped by a physical pain of loss the cauterised wound of her missing hand reaching out with invisible fingers for the disappearing caraprix they are deserting us she whispered our friends our souls they have been with us from the very beginning and now they are going is this the first sign that the end is near lugh cried we are abandoned here when we need them most the tuatha de danaan collapsed into their seats at the devastating emotional loss of separation but they also appeared to be physically weakened our luck is gone lugh continued our power mallory grabbed caitlins arm and with hunter they escaped from the chamber and the teethjarring drone several questions spring to mind hunter said as they moved along the corridor why now where are the caraprix going what power do they have are they a threat to us my instinct is to plan for the worst mallory replied we know theyve been used to control people before but weve never seen a sign that theyve got any real kind of consciousness caitlin said theyve always been pretty benign changing shape and doing what theyre told by the golden ones the tuatha de danaan arent telling them to scurry away hunter observed so who is i think i might be able to answer that mallory sprinted ahead it appeared he was right for soon they intersected with a stream of caraprix heading in one direction covering their ears they joined the silvery flow until they arrived at doctor jays chambers where the caraprix massed around the door seeking out every gap around the jamb to ooze inside jerzy has a caraprix inside his head mallory said the court of the final word put it there so they could control him and these others are trying to get to it caitlin asked the droning came from jerzy first mallory replied i think the caraprix in his head was calling to the others why caitlin said maybe they just want a big old shapechanging party hunter threw open the door they had one brief glimpse of jerzy standing in the centre of the chamber with the caraprix forming a growing silver pool around him and then the door slammed shut of its own accord however much they tried they could not get it open again beyond the walls the great plain stretched to the purple mountains on the horizon where the dark smudge of the enemy gathered faint tremors already ran through the ground the approaching threat was starkly contrasted with the peace of their surroundings where only the gentle breeze stirred the long grass accompanied by the sound of crickets all right ruth said you got me where are they veitch continued to scan the grasslands before announcing got to be some kind of magic hidden in plain sight kind of thing glamour church replied the enemy wont see them till we want them to be seen they wont be able to judge the scale of our forces or make preparations for our secret weapons he led them forwards a few paces until they felt the sensation of passing through a heavy curtain with a pop they emerged into the same scenery now filled with more than a hundred brothers and sisters of dragons standing in ranks decebaluss barking voice emerged from their midst blimey veitch said hes got some lungs on him mallory made a good choice for sergeant major we are all going to die decebalus bellowed as he marched through the army of dragons enjoy your last moments and take five of the enemy with you when you pass behind the brothers and sisters a flag bearing a blue dragon on a white background fluttered above their small hastily assembled camp you may think you are few in number but you are worth more than ten more than twenty more than a hundred of the enemy decebalus roared the pendragon spirit glows within our hearts joining us together as one one mind one body we care for each other we protect each other and we strike as one weapon filled with pride church watched the brave determined faces as decebalus split the army up into groups of five to prepare for the tasks he had assigned them do you think theyre up to it ruth asked we learned on the job and theyve not been through a fraction of the things weve experienced look at them theyre great church replied decebalus summoned the three of them over to a group of five strapping themselves into silver and blue armour greet our brave decebalus said they have volunteered to scout the enemy lines a dangerous task church felt uncomfortable when the brothers and sisters of dragons looked at him with clear awe who are you he asked sound off decebalus shouted when the group simply gaped leon corbett the first said with a strong midlands accent he towered over the others and had long wavy hair and a tribal tattoo around his upper right arm kelly broadbent ventured the woman next to him she had auburn hair and something of ruth about her church thought adam garrett this one had spiky brown hair and darkbrown eyes hunter or veitch church thought he was still astonished how existence played out the same archetypes through each team the fourth introduced herself with the lyrical name of aurelia verdin she was in her early twenties im the horse expert she said confidently the others wont be able to keep up and im richard flynn church saw he was definitely the shavi of the group a gentle glaswegian barely out of his teens with greengrey eyes and a touch of the mystical about him im proud of you all church said shaking each of their hands in turn its a dangerous mission but the information you bring back will help us win once the group had mounted their horses and were looking towards the horizon ruth said decebalus introduced them to us because he thinks theres a good chance theyre not coming back they looked like a strong team if any can get back its them how many of these people are going to die church ruth pressed you saved them all from being killed in their own times she flashed a glance at veitch who didnt meet her gaze only for them to die now veitch studied the groups as they put on their armour and inspected their weapons a jarring combination of strength and innocence nobody lives for ever thats a cliche its true all of us were privileged for a short space of time weve been given something that no one else gets to have that connection with something big knowing that weve got a part to play that we mean something that were not just here to work and earn and eat and drink and die thats a big thing his eyes blazed theres a price for everything thats one of those hidden rules you lot keep banging on about and if the price for that is you give up your life i reckon its worth paying and i bet that lot do too once youve tasted it nothing else compares tom waited on the edge of the army of dragons camp smoking furtively if youve finished with your morning constitutional theres something you ought to see he said he gestured towards a vast expanse of rolling grassland what church said why isnt shavi here tom snapped hes the only one of you with any sense look church ruth and veitch looked again and this time they saw a faint wavering in the air over the plain like a heat haze more glamour church said break out the cakes and ale tom strode ahead an additional layer of camouflage as much to protect the delicate sensibilities of mortals as anything follow me the sensation of the heavy curtain passed again before they emerged into a cacophony of song and music bellows roaring laughter incessant chatter and the clatter of weapons followed a split second later by an exhilarating blaze of colour and movement sprawling for several miles was a tent city comprising numerous camps merging into one chaotic mess banners flew above the largest tents marked with runes or symbols dragons birds lightning bolts ruth involuntarily put her hands to her ears at the volume they were all mesmerised by the sensory assault the rich aromas of roasting meat and campfire smoke spices and perfumes the sulphurous blast of furnaces oiled leather mead everywhere people surged talking wrestling arguing fighting having sex drinking laughing barking orders calling for aid not people church thought gods the camp nearest to them belonged to the aesir now recovered from the wounds he had received in norway tyr engaged freyja in sexual banter before winking and moving on through a cascade of sparks where a blacksmith worked an axeblade on an anvil in the entrance to a smoky tent these are all the gods whove joined the fight ruth asked from every great dominion bar one the egyptians which you appear to have decimated tom replied that hunter has an annoyingly flamboyant personality but he makes a convincing argument these gods have barely communed since the beginning of this cycle of existence yet here they are cheek by jowl and more importantly they are not killing each other as one would expect what you have achieved here is huge and only the brothers and sisters of dragons could have done it i dont understand why they listened to us veitch said thats because youre an idiot they respect you god knows why they see things in you that you dont see yourself they see in you themselves as infants you mean humanity is going to end up like them ruth said how depressing no youll be better because youve got the pendragon spirit youre existences new refined model a tremendous clamour drew them to a large tent filled with aesir swigging from flagons of mead as they cheered and argued around a large oaken table where two men armwrestled the veins on their foreheads standing out faces like stone from the concentration sinews bulging most were so drunk they could barely stand they have been locked in struggle for two hours neither of them gaining the slightest advantage freyja appeared beside them her potent sexuality making their heads spin one of the men was thor his wild mane of hair a fiery red his eyes as grey as the skies over the northern wastes the other was chinese his body just as strong his features marred by a ragged scar that necessitated a patch over his left eye he was bald with a long black ponytail a silver axe etched with red chinese characters rested against the table next to thors hammer mjolnir leigong church recognised the figure from the assemblage of gods beneath the forbidden palace in beijing stop now freyja called we have honoured guests brothers and sisters of dragons reluctantly thor and leigong broke their grip this pretender lays claim to control of the storm and the lightning and the thunder thor bellowed you are the pretender leigong said and so it begins tom sighed do not heed those two freyja said they are both hotheaded the rest of my brothers and sisters and my cousins have experienced a revelation during our brief time here a rude awakening tom interjected do not diminish us true thomas during all our time we have each family group believed ourselves to be the pinnacle of existence to accept that we have equals is a shadow crossed her face crushing tough veitch said sardonically yet also liberating freyja continued i have found much in common with my cousins and a greater understanding of our place within existence we all ultimately seek wisdom do we not and that is its own reward will that make you any less manipulative church asked freyja smiled it is the nature of all living things to have their own agenda and to have their own flaws she gently took toms hand and the others were all surprised to see him flinch how i admire your ring true thomas andvarinaut why is that not cursed to bring destruction to all who possess it her smile felt like the wind across a frozen plain she gave a slight ironic bow and left whats going on with you two church said when you said freyja gave you that ring to help us find what we were looking for you didnt say it was cursed though your arrogance tells you otherwise i do not answer to you whats the curse what have you done tom a terrible haunted quality sparked briefly in toms eyes and then he almost ran from the tent and lost himself in the throng outside entranced church veitch and ruth moved amongst the camps of the tent city each one with its own particular flavour each wild and untamed they avoided the gaze of a snakehaired woman and were mesmerised for almost half an hour by the mercurial tongue of hermes speaking what at first appeared to be nonsense as he addressed a small crowd more snakes slithered in streams from a black tent where damballah watched them with burning eyes birds flocked around the beakfaced tangatamanu ishtar ignited barely controllable erotic desires as she attempted to summon the three of them to her tent and the shichifukujin travelled in a boat that floated a foot above the ground offering church good fortune for the coming battle finally they could take no more in the midst of the gods every sense was forced to operate at its most heightened and they began to feel queasy from the power that radiated off each of the beings despite the status of the brothers and sisters of dragons the sense of threat from many quarters was palpable and on more than one occasion they remained unsure about the virtue of having the gods at their backs emerging from the bubble of glamour it felt as if they had escaped into a quiet room where they could finally catch their breath in the shadow of the walls etain and the other brothers and sisters of spiders waited on their mounts dead unblinking eyes fixed on veitch look ill catch you later he said to church and ruth uncomfortably im just you know going to say a quick word he went over to the group and for the briefest moment etains eyes snapped onto church and then ruth i dont trust her church said i thought she was an old girlfriend of yours ruth said tartly oh wait and what about niamh psychotic bitch and archmanipulator a lack of trustworthiness seems to be the defining factor you certainly know how to pick the rotten apples in every barrel i picked you didnt i a brief lapse in your bad taste acutely aware of the time for their departure drawing closer church led the way back to the city gates so are things all right with us he asked hesitantly this isnt the time to have that kind of conversation ruth replied before adding were fine what about veitch its complicated how he needs me and ive got to help him because we all need him church set his jaw i know thats not what you want to hear ruth continued church i dont want anyone else but you in my life but i meant what i said to you in norway is this where you give me the casablanca talk we dont amount to anything compared to whats going on around us i disagree with you so profoundly i can barely put it into words you and me what we have is the entire reason why we do what we do its a symbol dont start intellectualising just to win your argument i cant help who i am ruth i think deeply about everything including you and me and veitch i know hes trying to win you over and im not going to stand back and let it happen her eyes flashed and church felt as if he was looking into a deep well of blue fire okay lets get one thing straight she said i am not a ball that bounces back and forth between you and ryan i am not here to be fought over it is not my role to be the girlfriend you love your archetypes but im not playing that one i didnt mean that accept that i love you deeply and then give me space to find my own path to where you want me to be she didnt wait for a reply marching through the gates and up the winding cobbled street towards the palace of glorious light in every word and every movement he saw the strength and sensitivity that had first attracted him to her undiminished she was right he knew that and he hated his own insecurity but he was more afraid of losing her than anything else he wanted to claim that hed accepted the heros role for the sake of humanity and existence and all the good decent reasons that the storybooks liked to claim but it was for ruth always ruth and while he could rise above that for most of the time and do the right thing if he didnt have ruth he was afraid of what he would do the depth of his feelings was not only the source of his strength but also his greatest weakness and in them he could hear the first seductive whispers of the libertarian sickened and afraid he hurried into the city the sun was at its height when mallory slipped into the room in the most secluded part of the castle in a mood of intense brooding silence veitch laura shavi hunter and caitlin waited there were no windows and the only light came from two small lanterns in opposite corners all here then mallory said clearly expecting there to have been some nonarrivals ruths a frosty cow but i dont like it that shes not here i feel like a backstabber im a lot of things but im not that laura said it would not be fair to place this burden on ruth shavi said she cannot be expected to make rational choices youre just afraid she might stop you before you go insane laura muttered so youre opposed to it caitlin pressed nobodys opposed to anything yet because we havent come to any conclusion mallory took a chair in one corner where he could keep an eye on the door ive got an entire book of cliches just for this occasion hunter remained standing arms folded laura was convinced he had chosen the position so the lamplight would illuminate the best aspect of his features but ill select one or two choice ones to start us off war demands that people do unpalatable things because war is all about winning especially this one where the stakes are higher than anything i ever dreamed of back in my notsoglory days what about moral purity shavi argued our fight is meaningless if we are as bad as the enemy you think the moral high ground will look so pretty when your family and friends and everybody have been raped and slaughtered and the bad guys win for all time hunter responded if you dont win nothing matters the morrigan is telling me this is the right thing to do and not to be sentimental caitlin said but as a doctor and having sworn the hippocratic oath i cant condone hurting anyone which is rich coming from the psycho with the axe laura said but were on the same side you know why a lot of military and security service people havent got any time for the protesters back home because theyre like people who eat sausages but dont want to know what goes into them hunter said firmly people have the luxury of arguing about the moral high ground because they dont have to make any of the hard choices at the sharp end they pay people to do that so they can sleep in their beds and put it all out of their pretty civilised minds but lets understand some of the realities of war here its nasty and brutish and thrives on the worst of human nature nobody loves it nobody wants it but we have to do it or we die and everything we believe in dies once again are we prepared to say that we sacrificed all of humanity but we played fair this isnt some hypothetical officer training debating point laura snapped its personal that makes it different no it doesnt hunter said okay you seem to be arguing a very clear point here mallory began this goes against everything we stand for shavi pressed his voice cracked and he was close to tears of frustration in someone so placid the sight was shocking theres no black and white hunter said no good and evil choices whatever thoughts you might like to comfort yourselves with its grey its messy and thats my final cliche of the day moral relativism underpinned the holocaust and apartheid shavi said sharply hunter bristled and mallory stepped in before he lost his temper a first that would have been just as shocking as shavis desperation reviewing events in the coming days are going to turn church into the libertarian if that happens existence loses its champion and the void wins we all know that time reality everything is fluid it shifts new presents subtle alterations to the past anything to maintain the voids control if we can prevent the sequence of events that turns church into our worst enemy we stop the libertarian existing and maybe maybe we win maybe shavi interjected bitterly and if we cant prevent it happening we kill church the libertarian doesnt exist the void loses its prime agent mallory looked around the faces slowly you know we dont have a choice we cant let church become the libertarian shavi looked away caitlin remained impassive laura nodded reluctantly one of us has to be prepared to do it hunter said theres no point waiting until the crucial moment and then finding nobody is prepared to pull the trigger so it looks like its me ive done it before i can do it again a brief glimmer of selfloathing burned in hunters mind no veitch had remained so silent until now that the others had forgotten he was there in the darkest part of the room between the two lamps its not right you should have to live with it however much it needs to be done he said stepping into the light you know it has to be me ive got nothing to lose ill kill church mallory spent the rest of the afternoon preparing for that evenings ritual an oppressive apprehension mounted with the fading of the light and by the time night fell the feeling was so potent it appeared to have spread across the entire city fewer lights burned in the windows of the houses and none of the familiar songs rose up from the inns and public squares beyond the walls the war camps were silent the burning man hung over all as mallory looked out across the city from the window of his chamber his attention was drawn by one particular light in the winding streets below it was blue and moving from side to side in a manner that suggested it was signalling after a moment or two he became convinced it was signalling to him although he knew how ridiculous that would have seemed to anyone else with little else to do until the ritual he made his way down to the approach to the palace to his surprise the light still wavered gently in the street ahead intrigued he headed towards it only for the light to move away he followed for a while but when he stopped the light stopped too and that was when he realised it was leading him on remembering the hortha in the palace loft he let one hand fall to his sword and proceeded with caution along winding streets down alleys and across deserted courtyards he pursued the light always the same distance ahead just when he thought he really was taking an indiscriminate risk he came to a part of the city he had never visited before and an overgrown area in the centre of a square fenced off by rusted sagging iron railings stone monuments engulfed by ivy rose from the long yellowing grass it reminded mallory of an abandoned victorian cemetery the gate hung open and the blue light flickered amongst the statues and mausoleums ive played the game this far time to own up mallory said as he stepped through the gate brother of dragons draw nearer mallory recognised the resonant voice relaxing he pushed through the long grass until he encountered a towering figure waiting in the lee of a statue a wild mane of black hair and a thick beard coal eyes simmering beneath an overhanging brow a belted shift of what appeared to be sackcloth a thong fastened around his left forearm bore several cruel hooks the blue light came from the dancing flame of a lantern caretaker mallory said you found your way to me again mallory recalled the first time he had encountered the mysterious stranger in salisbury and discovered that he was if not a friend then a benign guide through the dark places i will always be near you brother of dragons why are you here now the caretaker raised the lantern so the illumination picked out the strength in his features my lamp the wayfinder with this i walk the boundaries of this world and all worlds a light burning brightly in the long watches of the night i know the lamp its guided the brothers and sisters of dragons on more than one occasion and so it shall again as the caretaker lowered the wayfinder the flame moved with a life of its own all there has ever been has been leading towards this time millions upon millions of interlocking events grains of sand one bumping into another shifting the course of a mighty river and i have shepherded them all but soon my work will come to an end you work with the puck the oldest things in the land are agents of a higher purpose how do i know you havent been manipulating me i have been manipulating you his eyes glowed but that does not mean that i do not look on you and the other brothers and sisters of dragons with fondness your road has been long and hard and i have shone the light for you whenever you needed to see your way but soon your journey will be over i dont know if i like the sound of that after a moment of silence the caretaker said remember brother of dragons that even terrible events from one perspective may lead to great good from another greater perspective the view across existence is limitless and within that all things have their place leave the deep sadness in your heart behind and turn your attention to the distant horizon the caretakers words reminded mallory of something ogma had said to him in his great library and as then they touched him on a level he couldnt comprehend so youre here to show me the way mallory asked an old friend will show you the way the caretaker smiled and as he raised the lantern even higher the blue flame leaped and grew mallory took a step back as the flame jumped from the wayfinder and surged into the crackling shape of a man hello mallory it said within the blue fire features flickered it was hal mallory knew the fourth member of his team who had sacrificed himself to the currents of the blue fire to help and guide the brothers and sisters of dragons across the ages hal everyone says youre hot stuff laughter rose and fell as the flames danced i like you mallory ive been keeping a particular eye on you from the depths of my blue home pity we couldnt have hung out you know when i had a body not exactly a bundle of laughs at the moment lot on my plate which is exactly why im here youre going to the grim lands or the grey lands why does that place get two names its a big place mallory infinite in fact the chance of you just stumbling across the extinction shears is well its not going to happen we like our missions impossible i bet youd like some help more say a lantern with a flame that will point relentlessly to the object youre searching for mallory grinned that might come in handy thought youd say that only one problem the blue fire doesnt reach there you couldnt have such a powerful force for life in a place of death right and that means the wayfinder wouldnt work properly unless you took your own powerhouse of blue fire with you you me i have to detach myself from the flow which will be a wrench its amazing in here mallory like being in touch with everything feeling everything seeing how its all interconnected how it all means something can you imagine what thats like the note of loss in his voice was powerful but youre still going to do it mallory asked of course how could i not and what you get to be the genie in the lamp yeah thats me ill be able to help you out in a much more personal and direct way than i can now but youre going to have to look after me too once i cut myself off from the flow of the blue fire i lose so much power in that form i can be i hate to use the term killed for a living flame but that about sums it up i die i dont go back to the blue fire again that palpable sense of loss in his voice well look after you hal you can count on us then its done take the lantern mallory and lets strike out for the great adventure the figure flickered faded and disappeared back into the lantern the caretaker held it out for mallory to take be strong brother of dragons and trust the light to guide your way when mallorys fingers closed around the wayfinder there was an electric burst and a feeling of wellbeing rushed through him the flame engulfed his whole vision and when he finally looked around he was alone on the roof of the fortress of the enemy amidst the smell of rotting meat and the thick greasy smoke the libertarian watched the stars how i hate them he sighed niamh took his hand not long now yes nearly there he turned his attention to the crackling outline of the burning man now halffilled with fire tell me how it happens she said with a note of glee he cast a dismissive glance her way a bitter desire for revenge is not a very attractive quality you know you must feel it too hatred for him for all of them and everything they stand for actually no theyre misguided poor lambs who have lost their way unfortunately once they are back on the path they become sheep to the slaughter tell me how it happens she repeated only i get to know that this whole business is hmm let me select a cliche for your enjoyment a house of cards so fragile a mass of subtle interconnecting events change one and the whole thing falls apart even now especially now as we approach the end everything is in a state of flux so many variables but do not worry my bitter twisted love i intend to keep a firm hand on the tiller if the currents try to push us away i will steer us back into the flow of the blooddimmed tides subtlety is the key a shift in emotion can be just as effective as a slice across the jugular more so in fact but you wait here niamh said why are you not influencing the brothers and sisters of dragons because he said with a faint smile as he turned back to the stars all goes to plan after sharing the news about the wayfinder mallory and caitlin made their goodbyes in a bright manner that belied the nature of what they were about to endure they took themselves to maths chamber where the sorcerer had already marked out a ritual space in the centre of the floor he stood in one corner quietly mouthing incantations that left the atmosphere charged veitch perched on the edge of a table flexing his silver hand rhythmically you ready he said youre joking mallory said dying is the biggest human fear you condition yourself to spend all your life running in the opposite direction its not an ending caitlins axe was strapped in a harness across her back if anyone should know that its the brothers and sisters of dragons easy for you to say with the morrigan riding you like a horse this is home ground for her if it makes it any easier ive been through it veitch said it doesnt why did you do it caitlin asked i wanted to break any control the spiders had over me veitch replied i wanted to be my own man again he paused this is going to sound weird but the grim lands are the only place i ever felt at home thats sad caitlin said no its weird mallory cast a suspicious eye towards math whose incantation had grown louder whats it like he added uneasily pain just for a bit then its like being on a roller coaster heading down the biggest dip queasy and then nothing next thing you know youll be waking up in the temple in the grim lands dont touch anything there right its the voids place get straight out and the dead caitlin asked dont expect them to be friendly they welcomed me with open arms i dont know why but theyre not usually so happy about the living trespassing on their ground how do i know this isnt just one of your ploys to do me in mallory asked look mate i know you dont trust me and i know you dont like me but honestly if i wanted to do that id just gut you in your room at night when you werent looking you could try all right caitlin sighed lets put the whole men thing behind us this is serious just dont worry veitch continued i wasnt going to take any risks with this i went out of my way to find a ritual that could take me over the barrier in one piece i was primed and fully charged when church got me down in cornwall half an hour after they carted my body off i was in the grim lands and here i am i look okay to you mallory took a deep breath and looked to caitlin okay then weve got a job to do she took his hand and led him into the ritual circle its the ride of a lifetime mallory imagine how much more youre going to appreciate life when youve died and come out the other side how do you know i havent died and come back already mallory said caitlin fixed him with a quizzical gaze but he didnt respond maths voice grew louder the rhythmic chanting taking on a hypnotic quality the atmosphere became more intense strange shadows flitted across the room here veitch handed them each a goblet of dark liquid so you wont feel a thing how are you going to do it mallory asked veitch held up a long silver knife the handle carved with symbols mallory eyed it for a moment then downed his drink in one death here we come he said with as much bravado as he could muster night was falling as the thick smudge of black moved across the entire span of the great plain storm clouds boiled above it throwing out jagged bolts of lightning that turned the darkening sky white and with it came the deep resonant heartbeat in the ground thoom thoom thoom the enemy had arrived with a mounting feeling of dread church watched from the battlements of the great wall even with the army of the ten billion spiders and the burning man he had never really comprehended the true scale of what they faced how many of them are there he breathed perhaps a million beside him lugh remained phlegmatic perhaps more how can anyone survive this kind of battle church said we do what we can as do you lughs faith was touching but church had a more immediate concern how are we going to get past the enemy lines there may be another route maths eerie echoing voice rose up behind church where the sorcerer had just arrived with veitch and tom all done church asked veitch nodded but wouldnt meet churchs eyes the killing had clearly affected him what other route church asked there are paths that cross lands and time and everything we know one only needs to locate the correct door math replied through winterside which shimmers just a breath away from this land stories tell of many routes you can show us the way math shook his head there are only stories one speaks of a door in the halls of the drakusa which exists like this great court in both summerside and winterside then we could get into winterside here and back out again there veitch said how do we find it church asked there are only stories math repeated tom sighed all you great heroes and as usual youre at a loss its a good job im here he showed them the ring freyja had given him one of its more pleasing abilities is to guide the owner to their hearts desire that led us to ruth so you know it works i suppose if you ask me nicely i can accompany you to winterside and show you the way woo hoo veitch said with weary sarcasm us and the old git on the road again just like old times thoomthoomthoom the walls shook as the enemy neared night fell chapter three the halls of the drakusa in the centre of an unremarkable cobbled square stood the gateway to winter a stone arch marked with a leafless tree on the keystone around it a still black pool reflected the glittering stars so that it appeared as if what was above also lay below gathered before the arch church and the others were dressed in thick furs despite the summery warmth winterside has many dangers lugh said to church who was carrying out a lastminute check of provisions my people have always avoided its desolation but the stories of the terrors that lurk there are rife some say it was the original home of the fomorii and anywhere that could birth that foul race cannot be a good land were not complacent church replied we know the void is going to do everything it can to stop us reaching the fortress of the enemy its worried that we might be able to stop it and that means we stand a chance despite all evidence to the contrary laura muttered as she passed tugging with irritation at the furs on the fringes of the group a tearful mahalia quietly but intensely confronted jack but he remained resolute if sad church was impressed by how the teenager had risen to the responsibility of being one of the two keys as had miller who shuffled awkwardly nearby trying to ignore the outpouring of emotion crowther watched the two with fatherly concern but did not interfere i can understand how mahalia feels ruth said its awful to feel so powerless when someone you love goes into danger i bet youve never felt powerless in your life church said that shows how much you know for the last ten minutes tom had been sitting on the low stone wall surrounding the pool smoking and talking intently to shavi as it had been for several hours most of the conversation was about the caraprix and the meaning of their sudden evacuation from the tuatha de danaan to doctor jays lab where jerzy still lay since then no one had been able to gain access to the room to find the reason for the light blazing under the door and the constant jarring noise shavi saw church looking and came over i have a question he said to rhiannon and lugh we are searching for the halls of the drakusa who are the drakusa tom has spent a lifetime amassing knowledge of the far lands and he has never heard tell of them the golden ones do not talk of them rhiannon said we rarely acknowledge they existed even amongst ourselves the golden ones have survived and found strength in selfdelusion lugh began cautiously that we are the first and that we are the last that we are at the heart of existence that we are the strongest we are not rhiannon said and we might have climbed higher on the ladder of existence if we had found the wisdom to recognise the truth earlier the drakusa came before you church asked they and others lugh replied what happened to them shavi queried no one knows the footprints of those lost civilisations can still be found across the far lands if one looks carefully rhiannon admitted in ruins so overgrown they have almost become part of the landscape in artefacts in rumours and prophecies and stories where their existence is clear in what is not said rather than what is veitch and hunter arrived with virginia dare who was wrapped in a cloak so thick there was only a hint of the pale moon of her face her head was bowed her arms wrapped around her locked so deeply within herself she appeared oblivious to her surroundings im not sure shes up to this ruth whispered we dont have a choice church said shes been traumatised her mind keeps shutting down to protect her from what shes been through and thats going to make her a burden for us when we hit danger he paused and i know how cruel it is to take her back there if i could think of any other way to do this i would within a quarter of an hour they were ready to make the journey to winterside shavi cast his eyes over the group ten of us he said six brothers and sisters of dragons tom miller jack and virginia nine would have been better great nine potential sources of irritation laura said it was bad enough when there were only five of us a moment after lugh and rhiannon said their goodbyes church passed through the arch and found himself in the same square only now footdeep in snow an unearthly stillness lay over the normally bustling city once the others had joined him they made their way along the winding cobbled streets through the eerily deserted city noting how the streetplan and the buildings echoed their counterparts on summerside but were subtly different a sense of menace pervaded the court engrained in the distorted proportions of the architecture or the odd way shadows fell or the occasional sound that echoed through the stillness a dogs howl snow suddenly falling from a roof something that sounded like a baby crying but was clearly not the high buildings protected them from most of the elements but when they ventured beyond the gates onto the great plain they were blasted by a bitter gale that propelled snowflakes into their flesh like burning needles bowing their heads they drove on through the kneehigh snow tom guiding them with every subtle tug on his ringfinger when the pink glow of dawn finally warmed the horizon their faces fingers and toes were numb and snow encrusted the front of their furs laura complained vehemently and tom miller and jack found it hard going but the others maintained the pace of all of them hunter appeared to be thriving on the hardship it took most of the day to cross the arc of the plain that took them to the foothills they made camp on the gentle slopes in a hollow filled with spiky gorse bushes and rocky outcroppings hunter lit a fire with remarkable speed and soon they had four tents pitched around it with water boiling for a warm drink they ate their dry biscuits in two of the tents clustered together for warmth and soon fell asleep from exhaustion church woke in the middle of the night unsettled without knowing why crawling out into the bitter darkness he found that the snow had stopped falling and the stars glimmered icily it was veitchs watch but something was wrong church could see him prowling the edge of the camp beyond the red embers of the fire his sword drawn occasional flickers of blue amongst darting black flames whats up church followed veitchs gaze to the snowcovered lip of the hollow something out there an animal or worse dunno yet i caught sight of it against the skyline just a flash it was big dont know if it was looking down here or just prowling around youll be able to smell the smoke from the fire for miles maybe the campfire wasnt the smartest move nah we needed to stay warm besides weve not seen any sign of life since we got here as far as we knew this was a dead place i see you didnt wander up there to investigate veitch laughed quietly right cause im a total nomark stumbling into the night to investigate a noise my big slasherpic moment theres two of us now still not a good idea theres no cover best i just sit down here and keep an eye ill keep you company you dont need to four eyes are better than two and it gets lonely on your own veitch eyed church curiously for a moment and then nodded they sat on the leather provision bags while veitch stoked the fire until the flames licked up again as they warmed conversation came easily and after a while church realised how much it was like the early days of their friendship he could see that veitch felt it too but neither of them spoke of it when dawn broke they roused the others who emerged stamping their feet and complaining to fight for space around the fire they ate a quick breakfast of more dry biscuits and then veitch and church ventured up to the ridge the snow was disturbed and large tracks led off across the landscape what do you reckon veitch said i dont get it church replied the tracks change see here these look like some kind of animal print these are more like a reptile and these he paused at a series of circular holes in the snow disappearing into the distance unable to find the words whatever it looks like it was watching us veitch peered towards the horizon its not here now maybe it thought we were too much trouble for a snack those black clouds look full of snow church noted wed better get moving before it hits were going to freeze to death out here if it gets any colder church slid down the bank to the camp veitch inspected the tracks for a moment longer casting his gaze across the expanse of snow and then he followed church troubled without knowing why at noon the storm struck with a ferocious force that battered them this way and that making any progress difficult the blizzard was so intense that the ground and sky merged into one sheet of white that left their senses reeling laura was worst hit by the whiteoutinduced vertigo and she pitched forwards into the deepening drifts at regular intervals cursing loudly as her frustration and anger grew each time hunter helped her to her feet only for her to shake him off furiously im a hothouse plant she shouted im not meant for these conditions yeah youre just a frail little flower he said lightly but he was worried about her the strange state imposed upon her by cernunnos was still a mystery and he had no idea how the cold would affect her although he was concerned by the blue tinge growing around her mouth and eyes he struggled over to church and said im worried about laura shes not coping well with this weather we need to get to shelter church pulled the scarf from his mouth and shouted over the gale okay if we can find somewhere but its impossible to see anything in this at least were moving uphill there might be more shelter when we get into the mountains if we do hunter yelled back frustrated he turned towards laura and noticed that he could now see only seven other black smudges in the swirling white someones missing he called to church get everyone huddled together now once the group had packed into a tight knot they realised it was jack who was missing he was right next to me a minute ago miller said as he hugged virginia close to him if he wanders off well never find him tom snapped why cant you organise things better he wiped the snow off his spectacles if we all start looking for him well never find our way back together hunter said let me go ive experienced worse than this in nepal how are you going to find your way back to us church asked the footprints are filling up quickly im like an animal i have an unerring sense of direction dont be an idiot laura said but before she could stop him he disappeared into the blizzard rapidly he followed their footprints back and then searched for jacks outlying track church was right their trail was already becoming a ghost and he guessed he would only have a few minutes before he lost his way back to the group he called jacks name but the wind stole his voice only a few feet from his mouth after a moment he came across a set of tracks that peeled off from the main body of the others keeping his head low he pressed on into the face of the gale he hadnt gone far when his senses picked up movement nearby jack he called again even as the name left his mouth he realised any movement he might have perceived came from something much larger than a teenage boy another shape loomed and was gone in the blink of an eye this time he glimpsed something black dense and powerful before the white folded around it a second shape this time to his left though blurred as if in a state of flux another and another they were all around but they didnt appear to be circling him perhaps they were as snowblind as he was how many he thought stockstill he listened and watched for any sign of movement but then his attention fell on jacks rapidly blurring footprints and he realised he would lose the trail if he waited too long without a second thought he drove on fast and low hed barely gone twenty feet when the ground shook with a thunderous approach behind him without looking back he threw himself to one side burying himself deep in a drift he had the impression of something almost eight feet tall crashing by a glimpse of gleaming oily black skin and then it was gone hunter moved quickly back onto the trail more of the beasts converged upon the location the ground shaking from their movement their shapes passing through the intense whirl of white like massive ships in a sea fog one of them came out of the blizzard directly at him a swordlike limb with a serrated edge slashed but he ducked just beneath it and kept running it turned rapidly and pursued too late for the snow had already swallowed him the footprints he was following were more defined he was closing on jack if by some slight chance he was still alive the rising ground crested a ridge and descended into a hollow filled with boulders scree shifted under the snow beneath his boots the rocks allowed him some cover as he ducked and raced amongst them occasionally the black creatures loomed over him sparks flying as their limbs scraped against the stone each time he glimpsed one his perception changed he thought they were giant insects then lizards then something resembling a crab crossed with a piece of machinery and then the footprints ahead disappeared he ranged around hearing the beasts crash closer amidst low rumbling noises that he guessed was some form of communication he had convinced himself that jack had already been killed when he heard the boys quiet voice hunter ducking down hunter found jack pressed into a crevice in the rock wall beneath an overhanging boulder the boys face was as white as the snow his eyes ranging with a deepseated fear hunter quickly pressed himself into the crevice shielding jacks shaking body from the roaming creatures nice spot room with a view he whispered dont worry were going to be all right what are they jack said whatever they are theyre not the smartest or theyd have methodically tracked us down by now one of the beasts tore past their hiding pace jack flinched then calmed himself im all right i know you are delving into his pack hunter found the silverscaled brasstaloned balor claw whats that jack hissed a weapon you cant use it here there are too many of them you wont last a minute hunter couldnt tell jack he had it ready for a last stand to take one or two of the creatures with them im just keeping it where i can see it he said with a grin i cant feel my feet jack said just a little while longer theyll move away soon when they realise they cant find us hunter tried to sound reassuring but he knew if they stayed in the crevice much longer theyd freeze to death and they wouldnt stand a chance if they ventured out amongst the hunting creatures beyond that the tracks back to the rest of the group would probably have been lost jacks lips were already turning blue and the familiar signs of hypothermia were evident in his skin and breathing hunter pulled the boy close to him and wrapped his arms around him forget the whole men dont hug thing he said this is about staying warm well be fine well be out of here in no time the court of the soaring spirit felt empty without mallory caitlin and the others decebalus stood outside doctor jays lab for long minutes mulling over his new role as leader of the army of dragons happy to accept the responsibility although missing the camaraderie of his friends he barely spared a thought for the gently pulsing light and the noise grinding out from the sealed room the caraprix were not a threat he had decided and so they were an irrelevance weighing his strategy carefully he sought out the sorcerer math in his shadowy rooms i have never met a sorcerer who has not deserved to be hacked into bloody chunks the barbarian said as he watched the slowly turning mask you will be happy to know that in this matter i have learned some restraint from my good friends but only some so hear me out the mask turned math said nothing the enemy approaches my forces are strong but a good general always keeps something in reserve i need something possibly magickal and i want it to be a response that will take their breath away to such a degree they will never return math contemplated for a moment and then said how far do you intend to go decebalus grinned should we go after hunter ruth ventured theres no point doing anything until this blizzard lifts church replied we could be stamping around in circles and getting nowhere lauras face was emotionless hell be fine hes tougher than you bunch of wimps she turned away from them quickly shavi suddenly became animated involuntarily clutching at his alien eye whats wrong veitch asked hurry we must leave this place immediately shavi said urgently something is coming church peered into the blizzard as faint tremors ran through the ground growing stronger okay lets move on what about hunter laura snapped if we leave here hell never find us hell find us hes good tom grabbed churchs arm as they struggled up the slope i dont like this there have always been terrible things in this place the words died in his throat as one of the beasts emerged from the snow behind them inky black at first glance it resembled a giant spider rising up above them on long sharp legs that looked as if they were made of iron it wavered for a second so they felt they were under the scrutiny of a cold alien intellect and then it began to change armoured plates resembling an insects carapace unfolded out of the black body and locked into place spikes and a horned ridge emerged along with other razorsharp appendages bloody hell veitch gasped fomorii the others scrambled up the incline as fast as they could but miller continued to gape veitch hit him like a runaway train and propelled him away stand still youre dead veitch hissed theyre killing machines the way became much steeper littered with outcropping rocks and huge boulders that made it difficult to advance behind them the fomor raced only feet away breath burned in their lungs as they wound around the obstacles echoing through the howling gale came the sounds of more fomorii joining the pursuit a haunting deep call and response that became more frenzied as though the creatures recognised their prey they came up hard against a cliff rising high over their heads a path wound around the foot of it barely wide enough for one person with the ground plummeting away steeply as veitch and miller passed the last boulder before the path began they caught a glimpse of someone crouching out of sight when the fomor pounded up behind them church jumped out at the last and swung caledfwlch in an arc a trail of blue fire sizzling through the snow sparks flew as the blade hacked into one of the creatures front legs as the creature halfrounded on church it lost its balance with a roar church rammed into it with the sword bracing against the boulder and levering it onto the slippery snowcovered slope the fomor hovered for a second and then went crashing down until it was lost in the swirling snow nice one mate veitch called as church caught up with the group lets not start cheering yet church shouted back the others are coming up fast behind with the wind lashing them they pressed their backs against the cliff face and edged around the path were still going in the right direction tom said as long as we dont fall to our doom this path in such a deserted landscape is here for a reason what are they miller asked again struggling to cope with the terror surging through his system race enemies of those goldenskinned bastards the flickering black flames of veitchs sword were a stark contrast to the snow we fought them before beat em too at the battle of london miller glanced back and almost lost his balance it changed shape they do that a lot veitch looked to church you think theres just a handful of em all of them disappeared after the battle of london what if they came here to lick their wounds church paused what if this is the voids secret army just like we have the army of dragons and the gods you stopped them once right miller said hopefully you can do it again looking out into the blizzard veitch had the odd sensation of a sea of white in which they could float theyre coming church said lets move this along behind them the call of the fomorii echoed off the cliffside it contained a note of jubilance perhaps that their old enemies were finally in their grasp and it was followed by a metallic grinding that set their teeth on edge the beasts limbs dragging on the rockface from the rear church urged them to move faster but the path soon became more precarious as it crawled up and around the lower stage of the mountain they knew was hidden above their heads in the blizzard as they rounded a bluff they became more sheltered from the buffeting gale and visibility improved they could see the path dropping down towards a horseshoeshaped area enclosed by the towering rock a single twisted ancient hawthorn stood in the centre bleedin great veitch said no way out we cant go back you old bastard youve led us to the perfect place for a slaughter shut up tom snapped he examined his ring and church could see from his face that he feared freyja had planned this all along the hunting cries of the fomorii rang out through the blizzard ten joining twenty more each second echoing from out across the great plain as they converged on the mountains you know what im starting to think youre right veitch said all the fomorii are here in winterside were screwed after theyd skidded down the path into the horseshoeshaped area church and veitch moved quickly around the rock walls looking for any sign of a hidden passage or footholds that would help them climb to safety do you see anything here ruth asked shavi he turned in a slow arc letting his alien eye focus on everything after a moment he shook his head fucking brilliant laura blazed first you lose hunter now this tears stung her eyes the low hunting calls grew louder from out of the blizzard emerged the fomorii some descending the winding path others clinging to the rockface still more rising up on the edge of the horseshoeshaped area from where the land fell away precipitously church and veitch faced them drawing their swords so that blue and black energy sparked between them ruth joined them blue fire crackling around the tip of the spear of lugh laura brushed away her tears to take a flank but when she saw shavi joining them she urged him back lets face it shavster youre about as useful as a wet towel in a fight like this go help team loser find a way out of here we have travelled the worlds together and you are all more dear to me than anyone else in my life we have truly lived together and we should die together he replied she set her jaw were not about to die because hunters going to come over that hill with the cavalry and crush these bastards dead now go in shavis look of sad fondness they both accepted the lie in lauras words and then he turned and hurried to tom and miller who were scrambling around the foot of the cliffs virginia watched them blankly an oily flow of fomorii washed into the horseshoe area until they stood ranged from cliff to cliff it was like looking into a haze as their edges blurred with the constant shapechanging armour plates snapping into place human forms becoming insectile cruel spikes and horns bursting from the hard skin ive not missed them church said you know what makes me sick veitch said theres nobody here to write about how bleedin brilliant well be when we go down fighting ruth smiled to herself thats all youve ever wanted isnt it to be seen as one of the heroes yeah i want my name up in lights why not not going to happen you tattooed psycho laura crouched down and buried one hand in the snow until she was touching the ground concentration darkened her face and after a second a row of bramble crawled slowly from the frozen ground along the ranks of fomorii with a gasp laura sagged back onto her behind god this place is too frozen im as useless as shavi you tried church said drop back with the others the fomorii held back for a second and then they broke like a wave at the shore no ruth whispered defiantly a sound thundered at the base of church and veitchs skulls ruth had uttered a word of power her eyes rolling back to reveal the whites she appeared greater than the mere dimensions of her form magnificent and with each passing second more terrifying the wind roiled into a fist and slammed into the approaching line of fomorii smashing them back bullets of snow and ice tore into them and lightning crashed from the sky leaving charred circles in the snow and the twisted remnants of bodies in a trance she levelled the spear of lugh and blue fire surged from the tip the fomorii recoiled from contact with it only one of the creatures made it through ruths assault but church and veitch were ready for it they attacked from either side hacking and thrusting screeching the fomor lashed out its limbs changing shape as it moved to find the most lethal aspect one glancing blow sent church sprawling but veitch was already in the space church had occupied before he hit the ground preventing the fomor from delivering a killing blow at the cliff wall miller and shavi were drawn by the furious battle but tom continued to search furiously virginia observing him with angry frustration he took a step back and shouted at shavi somethings here youre supposed to be a saviour of the universe find it i see nothing shavi responded no hidden door or path wait miller pointed hesitantly to the lifeless tree that stands in such a perfect position in this space is it natural shavi ran his hands over the bark yes tom said yes symbolic its a sign a message here in this desolate frozen rocky place shavi continued with a smile is life as he moved his hands over the rough bark he felt the faintest pulse deep within resting his forehead against the trunk eyes closed he held it fanned it drew it out from the sleeping core millers hand went to his stomach where he felt an involuntary connective warmth a faint blue light appeared on the trunk breathing in the smell of burned iron shavi concentrated forcing the longdormant power to grow stronger the light became a single flame that appeared to die in the cold breeze until suddenly it erupted along the length of the trunk and the entire tree blazed with the blue fire each shimmering finger now a leaf on the oncedead branches at the foot of the tree the earth energy crackled into the snow moving in a rapid dizzying spiral until it sizzled in a direct line towards the cliff wall and up the rock face where it illuminated the sign of a dragon eating its tail here tom yelled here now shavi raced towards it and slammed his hand into the centre of the symbol a flash dazzled them all for a second and then with a judder that threw them from their feet the rock tore itself open to reveal a door into a dark space church ryan ruth come now shavi called church and veitch continued to whirl around the remaining fomor their swords leaving fiery trails in the air they were both covered with cuts that spattered blood onto the snow but ruth was almost unrecognisable she hovered six inches above the ground arms outstretched head back the blue light from the spear washing around before driving out intermittently at the stormtossed ranks of fomorii still closing in she held them back though just barely to shavi she looked like one of the gods as frightening and enigmatic as a force of nature he ran to her but when he placed his hand on her side her head snapped around her face filled with fury and he was thrown ten feet back with a blast that left him close to unconsciousness churchs cry shocked ruth from her trance and she crashed to the ground still dazed she was at first unable to comprehend shavis smoking form as he staggered to his feet but gradually realisation dawned on her her devastation was clear in her face ruth church called urgently the lines of fomorii gradually recovered and prepared to attack although they held their enemy at bay church and veitch could not find an opening to escape towards shavi gathering herself ruth dived beneath the attacking beast and rammed the spear of lugh up into the creatures belly amidst a burst of blue light the fomor exploded as the body parts rained down church and veitch grabbed ruth and halfdragged her towards the gaping hole in the cliffface where shavi beckoned urgently behind them the howls of the approaching fomorii echoed diving through the open doorway they had one last look at the horde of shapeshifting beasts bearing down on them before the door slid shut and they were plunged into darkness as they caught their breath tom struck his flint and found a cobwebfestooned lantern hanging on a hook next to the door the flame guttered then leaped they stood in a vast entrance hall amidst blocks of fallen masonry and discarded swords spears and shields as if a final battle had been fought there columns soared up into the dark and ahead of them a few cracked steps led up to a towering archway beyond which lay only shadows tearfully ruth hugged shavi im so sorry i could have killed you a slight singe here and there but i am fine wed all be dead if not for you church said youre a scary woman veitch added where did all that come from the powers been growing in me for a long time she ran a shaking hand through her hair back on our world i could feel it but didnt really know how to get to it here she chewed her lip im afraid i might not be able to control it its always about you laura snapped hunters still out there and jack we cant leave them we cant go back out veitch said sharply sensing the mounting tension church stepped between the two of them hunters one of us and we dont abandon anyone and we cant go on without jack we need him maybe if we wait until the fomorii have dispersed shavi shook his head i can find no way to open this door from the inside theres got to be laura insisted you are right shavi replied but there is no source of blue fire in here there must be a different mechanism for opening it cursing loudly laura booted a rock furiously into the shadows where it bounced off walls with a series of echoes that was unnerving in the stillness what is this place miller scraped his boot through the thick white dust on the floor it doesnt look like anyones been here in centuries these tom replied are the halls of the drakusa in the narrow view of snowy ground from the crevice hunter counted the passing fomorii as they ranged by their resonant call and response rumbling through the rock itself he estimated at least twenty were still hunting for him and jack and they were drawing close to their hiding place even with the balor claw he guessed he wouldnt last more than a moment or two out there beside him jack shook violently from the cold and hunter could barely feel his own feet as far as he could assess he had only two options freeze to death or get torn apart by the beasts as he turned his head away from the opening to whisper more words of encouragement to jack he felt a current of air move across his face instantly he registered that it had come from within the crevice he urged jack to move to one side so he could crawl to the back of the crevice where he found a dark hole leading in and down barely big enough for him to squeeze inside he motioned to jack and said quietly theres a draught that means it leads to a cave system with some kind of egress youre insane jack hissed look how small it is well get stuck in there and die horribly were going to die horribly if we stay here and thats the truth you need to take my lead on this jack jack examined the hole anxiously look at it hunter if we get in there and find its too small to go on were not going to be able to back out well be trapped in a space about as big as a coffin i think i might go mad i know im asking a lot of you jack but this whole business is asking a lot of all of us weve got to rise above our fears because everyone is depending on us if you die here the hope that church is fighting for dies with you have you done anything like this before without missing a beat hunter replied in the former yugoslavia i was buried alive in a mass grave about one hundred dead muslim villagers on top of me i had to work my way through the bodies and then dig myself out with my bare hands i rate this as slightly better odds jacks terrible fears fought on his face after one brief glance back at the fomorii he nodded all right good lad ill go first its going to be pitch black in there but if you can feel my boots ahead of you youll be okay hunter manoeuvred himself and then wriggled his head into the hole the air smelled of deep wet places he forced his shoulders in the granite above dug deep into his back and for a moment he feared he was wedged jack was right there would be no coming back out the same way pressing hard he constricted his breathing and ignored the burning compression in his back and chest after a second he had forced his way under the lip of rock into an area that allowed him little more than an inch on every side jack wriggled in close behind him occasionally reaching out to his bootheel for reassurance hunter was overwhelmed by the boys bravery few others would have been able to suppress such a basic human fear for the greater good there was only room to reach out ahead and use his fingers to drag him down the slight incline with a gentle push from his boottips for a little extra thrust it was going to take a long time to get wherever they were going and he refused to entertain any other thought than that there was a definite destination ahead breathing was difficult and increasingly painful he had to take small regulated gasps to prevent hyperventilation in between gulps he instructed jack to do the same his fingers were numb but he was convinced they were tearing from the exertion against the hard rock he was sure he could smell blood the fissure continued down a little steeper their body heat in the confined space eased the freezing temperatures but water regularly dripped and ran under their fingers another fear drowning in an enclosed space hunter came to a halt at a sharp right turn jack called out in a panicked voice worrying that hunter had reached a dead end it took several moments to calm him and then a further fifteen minutes for hunter to edge squeeze and twist halfway around the bend once again he was convinced he was wedged in place twisted at right angles in complete darkness with barely a chance to breathe and listening to the whimpering of a traumatised boy behind him heart pounding the blood thundering through his head he closed his eyes thinking of laura and the last night they had spent together gradually his breathing regulated and he eased and pressed forwards a fraction of an inch at a time once around the turn the fissure broadened and the incline became steeper so he could drag himself faster which eased jacks anxiety ten minutes later it became steeper still and before he had time to think the slope was so sheer he began to slide he called out to jack to hold fast but by that time he was speeding out of control cracking bones and tearing skin he went over an edge and into free fall for a split second before hitting icy water it was barely five feet deep and his arms protected him from the worst of the impact but he sucked in a mouthful of water before he managed to surface feeling around he discovered that the fissure continued horizontally again but most of it was filled with water only a tiny air space remained and he had no idea how long that continued in any useable form jack was calling his name frantically its all right im here he called back its only a short drop and theres water at the bottom yell when youre coming and ill try to catch you or at least try to stop getting brained when jack was next to him relieved at the prospect of standing upright with room to breathe hunter broached the news about the almostsubmerged tunnel jacks mood changed instantly and he released a couple of wracking sobs before he calmed i cant do it he whimpered you said that about the crawling and the squeezing but look at what you did there distantly but unmistakably within the fissure came the teethjarring rumble of the fomorii sounds like theyve found out where we went hunter said we cant hang around here echoes of scrabbling in the fissure drawing rapidly closer hunter was unnerved by how speedily the fomorii moved youve got to trust me jack well get through this i do trust you hunter hunter flinched unsettled yet oddly moved by this new experience hold on to my jacket and give a tug if anythings wrong taking a deep breath he ducked under the water jack followed closely in the floating dark the claustrophobia and fear of suffocation were even more intense hunter measured his pace to jacks endurance pausing regularly to grab a breath from the tiny gap against the tunnel roof at one point jack began to thrash as if he were drowning and hunter was forced to grab him and hold his head up tightly in hunters arms jack relaxed still trusting the journey felt as if it was taking an age and just at the point when hunter started to fear hypothermia would set in they emerged from the tunnel into what felt from the air currents and echoes like a large cavern hunter dragged jack from the water onto a flat rock surface and held him tightly until he had warmed i never knew my father jack said after a moment hunter didnt know how to respond the tuatha de danaan stole me from my mother when i was a baby and took me to the court of the final word where they put the wishhex inside me they made me into a weapon then they kept me prisoner till caitlin and mahalia set me free he wiped the snot from his dripping nose with the back of his hand doesnt sound like youve had much of a life mate that just makes me want to fight for it even more hunter was impressed by the determination in jacks voice it reminded him of himself before the sourness took hold of his life keep hold of that thought kid because now we need to find a way out of here before those things pop up out of the water following the air current they moved tentatively away from their resting place feeling into the dark ahead of them in case there were any gaping pits or more sudden inclines hunter put out of his head the possibility that the breeze came from a tiny fissure and that there might be no way out of the cavern progress was slow and the fear of the fomorii emerging from the water behind them grew but then the texture underfoot changed from hard rock to smaller items that rolled and crunched in some areas several inches deep harder objects lay amongst them what is that dry wood jack asked down here hunter knelt to investigate his fingers ran over dry fragile things some tubular some sharp some curved and what were clearly metal artefacts scattered amongst them i think theres a sword here and a shield he ventured a helmet they continued treading tentatively over the cracking shifting surface for several more minutes until jacks foot caught something that clanged and bounced he felt around for it in the dark and raised it letting his fingers see the surface a lantern he said with his flint hunter lit the wick the flame was weak but held on to life the shadows rushed away dancing back menacingly with each flicker of the light oh jack said as he looked around with mounting uneasiness hunter followed his gaze in a wide arc across the cavern you can say that again human bones lay everywhere the vast sea of dirty yellow and brown was a civilisation in essence skulls smashed limbs torn apart ribs broken the clothes that had contained them long since rotted away with only the metal remnants of weapons and armour still remaining what the hell happened here hunter said the scale of the halls of the drakusa spoke of grandeur ceilings soared cathedrallike overhead and huge chambers that could have accommodated a small army rang with their hesitant footsteps church led his group past pillars of marble and extensive murals that must once have gleamed with colour but were now faded and barely visible the most obvious symbol of the decay and great age that shrouded the halls a desert of white dust interspersed with piles of shattered masonry and discarded everyday objects covered the stone flags only darkness and shadows remained in a place that had once thronged with life shavi examined some of the murals as they passed who were the drakusa he asked every race has the arrogance to believe they were the first and best tom said joining him the old stories hint at others who came before races that rose up established civilisations and were then wiped clean and forgotten through their own hubris or at the whims of angry gods you dont really think that could happen to us ruth said with all our technology our learning you think these people didnt have their own technology different from ours maybe more powerful their own wisdom intrigued tom brushed away some of the dust and cobwebs that obscured the mural shavi saw what tom was seeing and joined him from beneath the grime of ages faint images emerged of oval shapes giant in scale compared to the human figures prostrate before them some of the egg shapes appeared to be spouting tentacles or were in the process of becoming something else those shavi said puzzled are caraprix his expression troubled tom studied the mural never seen any that big laura said its symbolic tom muttered so the drakusa knew of the caraprix long before the tuatha de danaan raising the lantern church looked around the walls in a new light images of caraprix were visible everywhere on the walls behind the dust in mosaics on the floor and carvings on the marble pillars emerging in part here and there barely recognisable in isolation but taken together presenting a temple to the shapeshifting creatures this place implies that theyre gods or something whoever did all these pictures why are they making such a big deal out of them veitch asked the caraprix are just pets right those goldenskinned bastards have them around for entertainment i think we have been a little blind and stupid tom began all the time the caraprix have been before our eyes and we have misjudged them we have not seen their true nature a flicker of blue fire sizzled randomly at the tip of ruths spear and they all jumped what do you mean ruth asked we have been told many many times that the closer things are to the heart of existence the more fluid they are tom replied and these are the most fluid things of all they have no fixed shape no definable purpose they can be anything they want what i wonder are the limits of that what could they really be church indicated another image a figure with arms outstretched strings connecting his fingers to a row of dancing marionettes the puppeteer he said ive seen him before in venice back in elizabethan times and in the court so he existed before the current age before the tuatha de danaan why would he be painted here its not that i dont find your noodling and navelgazing so so fascinating laura snapped but what say we forget all this and move on before those fomorii find a way in here and hunt us down like rabbits shes right veitch said this isnt important we need to find the gate to summerside and this place is so big we could be searching for years tom glared at veitch about to launch an angry comment when church dropped a hand on his shoulder this isnt the place for a fight he nodded towards miller and virginia who were sitting together on a piece of fallen pillar miller had a reassuring arm around the frightened girls shoulders but his fixed expression revealed his own repressed terror we forget theyre not like us church continued theyve not seen the things weve seen and theyre not built to deal with what theyve found here theyre not like you tom said pointedly their unease mounted as they continued through the empty ringing halls the scale of the place the silence the darkness the decay combined to create a thick oppressive atmosphere that was profoundly unsettling though none of them gave voice to it they all felt as if they were being watched by hateful eyes from the shadows just beyond the extent of the thin lantern light the stillness was so intense that even the slightest sound was magnified and all their senses were heightened after an hour they heard a short dull grind that could have been a door opening it was so faint and distant that they would have dismissed it at any other time but in that place it sounded like a tolling bell i dont think were alone in here church said theyre coming they all turned to look at virginia who had thrown off her hood and was smiling it added a macabre cast to the desperate terror glittering in her eyes the fomorii church asked virginia shook her head worse than that claustrophobic darkness and hard stone all around the ragged heat of his breath pain fading quickly flashes of images in his memory so terrifying that his consciousness recoiled at their touch thankfully the images subsided as mallory came round he choked back bile at the abiding recollection of the touch of hard steel at his throat the sensation of what followed and the scream of his mind as it wound down into darkness and knew that it would haunt him for as long as he lived but he was alive the ritual had worked everything was subsumed beneath the rush of wonder and relief and he began frantically to feel around his environment he was in a stone box as veitch had told him to expect pressing his hands against the lid he lifted the lid ground to one side and flickering torchlight added another level of relief dank air rushed into the dry dusty interior of the box once he had clambered out he found another stone box on a plinth next to him scuffling sounds came from within he eased the lid off and helped caitlin out she clutched the wayfinder to her chest the blue flame providing welcome relief in that gloomy place look after me caitlin said in the fragile voice of her amy personality mallory hugged her to him course i will he held her until she released herself its okay shes gone back to brigid and briony now she forced a wan smile her eyes dark and limpid the morrigan is waiting she stared into his eyes for a moment longer and her gaze was briefly filled with all the powerful emotions she kept repressed she broke off when she realised what she was revealing although she knew he understood come on weve got a job to do when she held the lantern aloft it revealed a huge chamber built from cyclopean stone blocks beyond the ability of any human to carve or move wall paintings also beyond human scale soared up into the shadows incomprehensible and troubling and here and there were effigies of squat misshapen figures or tall spindly beings not human a temple mallory said here what do the dead worship mallory couldnt answer with a shudder caitlin turned her attention to the lamps flame which was bending unnaturally to point away from them so hals in there somewhere how do we talk to him if we call on him hell come mallory said but weve got to protect that lamp with our lives hal can die here though die might not be the right word hell be fine we just put our heads down follow the flame and well be at the market in no time i like your optimism as they searched for an exit they found an area where a foothigh egg of swirling sapphire and emerald stood on a waisthigh stone column every instinct told them to move on but it drew them in nonetheless what is that caitlin said it feels electric is it pulsing mesmerised they stepped onto the dais surrounding the column when they got within three feet of the egg they passed through some invisible boundary where everything became greentinged and all sounds from the chamber beyond were muffled cautiously caitlin reached out towards the egg every warning instinct suppressed when her fingers came within an inch of its surface there was a shimmer and they found themselves standing in a threedimensional view of a dark hall where church and the others stood around virginia its some kind of viewing thing like the wishpost in the great courts mallory said he paused wheres hunter and jack the scene shifted to reveal the cavern of bones now why are they not with the others caitlin asked the scene shifted again this time unprompted mallory looking younger happier standing in salisbury cathedral caitlin standing in the rain crying covered in clay stonehenge in the morning sun blue fire flickering above each trilithon church on his knees before the libertarian covered in blood someone reading a book looking directly at mallory and caitlin a bolt of pain struck mallory between the eyes and instead of looking into the egg something was looking out at him he had the overwhelming sensation of a crushing consciousness focusing the full extent of its power upon him it sizzled into his brain crawling into his thoughts turning over every aspect of who he was and what he wanted flames flickered around his perception and the image of the burning man began to fall into relief around them caitlin grabbed mallory and propelled him out of the active zone around the egg he cried out as the consciousness was painfully torn from his mind the void he gasped it was looking into me it recognised me he sucked in a breath of air it knows who all of us are every human it knows our strengths and our weaknesses our desires i think we make a vow not to touch anything else in this world caitlin said helping mallory to his feet nothing goods going to come out of anything here as mallory recovered they heard a noise coming from the direction of the two rebirth boxes creeping back to the chamber they saw an arm of twisted blackthorn rise from one of the boxes and then another the hortha rose up and turned its crumpledpaper face towards them in that briefest contact mallory had a premonition of his own death chilled he guided caitlin quickly away while the hortha adjusted to the transition to the grim lands they moved quickly through the dark chambers until they found the exit tunnel that veitch had described it led out into a fissure in the rock in which the temple had been carved overhead a slategrey sky was occasionally revealed by gaps in the constantly drifting mist black shapes moved across it birds they guessed although the perspective suggested something much larger every sound was dampened the rattle of a kicked stone so muffled it could barely be heard six feet away they scrambled up a screeslope onto a bleak featureless terrain of hard rock and shale though the mist made it impossible to see too far ahead although there was no breeze the mist continued to fold and twist licking at them enswathing them until they moved on rapidly to leave it behind nice place mallory said reminds me of a day i spent in harlow i guess the dead dont need much in the way of scenery the timbre of caitlins voice had changed subtly most people wouldnt have noticed but mallory was always struck by the slight physical alterations that came over her when one of her personalities took over this one he recognised as the morrigan not in full control but far back in her head slackly taking the reins we got out of that temple just in time he said were not leaving a trail here that should make it difficult for the hortha to follow us no trail you can see caitlin corrected youre not going to let me hide away in my allisrightwiththeworld fantasies are you that wont benefit us we need to be aware to keep moving if that thing crossed the barrier into the grim lands its not going to give up easily the worst thing about that lantern is that it gives no indication of distance what happens if weve got to follow that flame for thousands of miles im not sure distance or time mean much here it just is caitlins voice dried up as the first feature emerged from the mist a pair of iron gates in a victorian style one of them hanging askew from a broken hinge they were supported by two stone columns on which black gargoyles perched in the centre of the wroughtiron arch above the gate was a skull resting on crossed bones on either side rusted iron railings stretched out until they were lost in the shifting mist beyond sprawled a graveyard markers mausoleums tombs statues of weeping angels some of them sagging at angles or broken suggesting great age the lichencovered stone glowed spectrally in the strange diffuse light ivy grew up some of the monuments obscuring their meaning and long yellowing grass grew amongst the graves along with wild flowers that were splashes of queasy colour in the grey apprehensively mallory and caitlin halted at the gate but the wayfinder continued to point directly ahead youre just asking for trouble going through a place like that in a place like this mallory said caitlin followed the line of the railings into the mist i have a horrible feeling this graveyard goes on a long long way i dont think well be able to go around it mallory sighed yep makes perfect sense standing before the gate he glanced up at the arch and briefly thought he saw his own face on the skull the illusion passed quickly and he took hold of the sagging gate which emitted a protesting resonant scream from its rusted longunused hinges it was the only sound that carried any distance and seemed to go on and on and on into the mist im living in a really bad horror movie he said his palms unbearably sweaty if the hortha was on the move it would have heard that metallic wrenching once again they came to a halt on the threshold every sense told them not to enter the graveyard but the wayfinder continued to urge them on come on dont be scared the voice startled them mallory exchanged a glance with caitlin and then drew his sword the blue fire around the blade was barely evident caitlin reached behind and removed her axe from its harness what fine weapons what a sword what an axe but that sword yes one of the three great swords of existence if i am not mistaken and i am rarely mistaken unless i am in my cups which admittedly has not been much of an option in recent times the deeply theatrical voice hid any true emotion mallory had an impression of some old stage ham living on past glories whos there he called a friend nothing more somehow i doubt that as mallory and caitlin crossed the threshold they felt a sudden tingle of uneasiness as if the barrier had been real and not just imaginary whoever was there was hidden amongst the clutter of mausoleums and grave markers dont worry i wont bite indeed i am utterly desperate for invigorating human conversation why we are social beings we are not meant for this dreary unstimulating place where i might add i should not be but enough about that travesty for now lest i find myself carried away on a wave of bitterness which will only wash me up on the bleak shores of despair mallory pushed through the long grass searching all around the mist hid objects then revealed them then hid them again so they quickly lost all sense of direction they could no longer see the gate although they had not gone far but as the great shelley said the speaker continued some say that gleams of a remoter world visit the soul in sleep that death is slumber so perhaps i perhaps all of us happy breed are only sleeping as mallory and caitlin rounded an ivyclustered mausoleum they finally found the speaker sitting crosslegged on a tomb he was a strange figure though in his midforties he had long silver hair and a gaunt face he wore a black suit shiny from wear offset by a flamboyant red brocade waistcoat his boots were worn and holed on the soles what are you doing here caitlin asked just resting my old bones he chuckled revealing a gap between nicotinestained teeth who are you mallory asked who am i the great existential question who am i there are many possible answers who are you mallory repeated fiercely i am the bard of the hedgerows the king of the open road alley sloper gourmand and wit he held his arms wide my name is callow chapter four death at the groghaan gate the halls of the drakusa were endless and silent the tip of the spear of lugh burning with blue fire to light her path ruth led the way through chamber after chamber where the shadows pressed hard against them and the oppressive sense of threat grew by the moment more energy burned at the rear of the column where church and veitch had their swords drawn to defend the group from any attack this place is a bleedin maze veitch hissed we could be going round and round in circles shavi seems to have his bearings or at least his eye does church paused to listen intently as he had done so many times since virginia had warned them that they were being pursued anything veitch asked church shook his head maybe she was just spooked by the dark shes only a kid the noise echoes stones he wasnt even convincing himself lets close the door on this room barricade it if there is anything behind us it might slow them down church agreed and they called on ruth to stop the column while they ran the length of the huge chamber the doors closed easily and quietly and there was a heavy oaken bar to lock them in place then they dragged numerous chunks of shattered masonry against the doors to add to the barricade veitch wasnt impressed wish we could booby trap it as well blow the bastards up church laughed i dont know how i survived without you ryan neither do i he grinned to himself before growing serious once more were doing all right arent we weve not killed each other yet yeah after recent times thats a definite success story halfway across the chamber churchs eye was caught by a disturbance in the dust off to one side of the path they had taken theyd been careful to obscure their tracks as much as possible but here an arrow had been drawn with a symbol he didnt understand and a serpentine squiggle that he guessed was meant to signify a dragon ryan he called quietly veitch skidded to a halt and ran back when he saw the mark in the dust he snarled weve got a snake in the group or a spider church nodded theyre marking the way for whatevers coming up behind i didnt see anybody do this but then we were always looking back he glanced towards the group who were all looking his way and now they know were on to them veitch scrubbed out the sign bollocks im going to carve it out of them we cant torture everyone until we find out who it is veitch still appeared to consider this a viable option we might be able to use it in our favour church said play it cool screw with their heads a bit something like that veitch nodded works for me church looked back at his friends faces i know we were warned there was a traitor in the group i just cant believe it its the girl virginia veitch whispered got to be look at it logically how the hell did someone that young get away from the enemy fortress come on millions of the worst things there are all around and she manages to wriggle out travel god knows how many miles and then just hooks up with decebalus church eyed the fragile girl they let her out sent her back primed to explode right in the middle of us ive spoken to her ryan i believe what shes saying she believes it thats the point you know how clever all these bastards are at manipulating us poor humans she doesnt know shes set up to do us all in he paused same as i didnt know back in the battle of london a moment of tension passed quickly dismissed by veitch with a quick smile dont blame you though not any more nobody could have known a pause you couldnt have saved me when they returned to the group ruth asked what they had been inspecting but they brushed her off with a comment about feeling for vibrations of pursuit in the floor she didnt believe them but said nothing church carefully watched the others faces but no one showed any suspicious sign two chambers on and shavi brought them to a halt he was rubbing his eye as if it was causing him some discomfort there is something around here he said hesitantly before pointing tentatively to a room off to their left that they had all missed whats in there laura asked i see connections shavi began places where the invisible world interacts with our own something in that room calls to me they all hesitated until ruth pushed her way through them to the chambers door we cant ignore anything that might help us she said and we cant ignore anything that might like kill us laura added tartly the chamber was more intimate than the others with a series of runic symbols painted on the walls in an oily black that had not become obscured by dust like the many murals they had passed as shavi ventured into the chamber one of the symbols began to glow faintly virginia buried her face in millers chest shavi looked back and forth with urgency seeing things that no one else could shadows he whispered rising from the stones locked here for an age suddenly he grew stock still his eyes fixed on a place far beyond the four walls a droplet of blood trickled from his nose his mouth opened and his lips moved but no sound issued for a full five seconds and then it came with a boom that made their ears ring a word of power gradually the shadows became visible faint smudges in the air coalescing on one form standing in a proscribed circle etched into the stone flags in the shimmering air a bearded longhaired man appeared more than six feet tall wearing furs and chain mail a shield strapped to his back swords and axes hanging from him and a spear with a silver tip clutched in his right hand he wore a horned helmet of black and silver that protected his cheekbones and nose so that his eyes lay deep in shadow he appeared grainy not wholly there like a bad hologram the age of warriors has passed he said in a deep rasping voice that did not sound human behind him in the air itself images of what he described played out in vivid colour since time before time the drakusa have been the greatest race our forges produced weapons that could bring the stars down from the heavens our armies scourged the far lands and the fields and hills ran red with blood no one could stand before us and our battles became legends sung over fires in the long nights reducing the women to tears at the wonder of our courage and yet the drakusa are no more from our victories we forged a peace based on blood and iron a warriors peace in which no man or woman lived in fear a golden age of prosperity for all and yet the drakusa are no more how could we fall so far so hard here then is a cautionary tale peopleyettocome here is our gift to you the race of warriors that lies beyond the sun know your enemies do not look for the iron raised against you the sword or the axe or the spear do not seek out eyes that promise hatred and death the true enemies are cleverer they pose as friends they pretend to be part of your dreams and to offer you your hearts desire they stand at your side and then move to your back when the time comes in the air around him the shifting scenes of carnage and warfare became mellower autumnal hues painted deep forests and a low sun behind mountaintops seasons turn nothing abides for ever even the greatest can be laid low in the blink of an eye across the image shadows flitted their shape changing as they moved familiar glints of silver flashed like the sun caraprix church said the drakusa were torn down by the ones we raised highest the warrior continued know this the caraprix cannot be trusted they are the enemy of all there is their purpose is to wipe clean like the maggots in a corpse leaving only bones behind when they turned on us we could do nothing our weapons meant nothing our courage meant nothing one thing we created in the final days to prevent our destruction but time slipped through our fingers like the sands of farelquah it waits here still in the end everything we had achieved in our great age was wiped away nothing remains know the terrible sadness of the drakusa warriorsyettobe and despair the warrior bowed his head silently for a moment the flickering images behind him died away when he looked back up he spoke quietly but his voice was filled with emotion if the caraprix still infest this place flee now go to the groghaan gate return to the land of always summer and fill your heart with hope that you can run far enough and fast enough go to the groghaan gate and seek the heart of the drakusa but beware the way has been made treacherous to slow the vile beasts courage will prevail a pause the age of warriors has passed the warrior winked out and the room returned to normal reeling from his trance shavi staggered back until he was caught by church bloody hell veitch said the caraprix back at the court so what theyre just going to wipe us out laura said like the spiders did on earth church said wipe everything out and start again what can we do shavi asked you cant do anything tom snapped this is bigger than you youre just little cogs in a vast machine turning slowly not even knowing what youre doing following the pattern someone else has set for you he gnawed on a knuckle longstifled desperation breaking through his carefully devised exterior did you know the caraprix were a threat church asked i dont know anything either you idiot i just see flashes of whats to come do i have to explain it to you again he said with bitter sarcasm disconnected images like the views from windows as you climb a tower who knows how they all link together who knows what it all means meaning can only be divined by a true perspective and neither you nor i have that we live in ignorance and do our best as we fumble around in the dark what are the caraprix church pressed are they just the equivalent of the spiders i dont know tom marched out of the chamber a forlorn figure i thought he was supposed to be our guide laura said he does his best church said we just dont do our best for him the warriors message hung heavily over them as they continued their journey worming its way into their thoughts and infecting them with a mood of hopelessness i thought the caraprix were supposed to be close to existence ruth said to church does this mean weve been lying to ourselves all along that were on the wrong side maybe the libertarian is right people dont want the torment of trying to be better than they are all that insecurity and worry and struggle and pain the things weve had to face they just want to live in stability with as much happiness as they can grasp before it all falls apart the mundane spell might actually have been a blessing church had no answers for her questions but her words struck a chord and he pondered them in silence as they continued through the gloomy halls decebalus had risen with the sun climbing the highest tower of the court of the soaring spirit to get the clearest view across the great plain to the mountains and the sprawling forest of the night that bordered it what he saw left him with a chill that even the warmth of the sun couldnt lift only the whitestreaked mountaintops were visible the forest not at all the army surrounding the city was so large he had the impression of standing on a lighthouse on an island in the centre of a black turbulent ocean war machines belched out thick black smoke to fill the sky mingling with the odd purple mist clinging to some of the enemy three riotbeasts came and went their roving eyes revealing their idiot power that blasted out in a directionless fury that occasionally hit their own forces it was like no army decebalus had ever faced in his lifetime of battle in his mind he felt as if he was looking at a seething anthill but what his eyes saw was even worse and his consciousness squirmed and skittered across it refusing to accept the reality they know we are not defenceless lugh had joined him silently they fear the brothers and sisters of dragons in our midst and they wonder what other powers we have at our disposal as well they should but they will attack soon enough what makes my blood boil is that this is no true battle its outcome is meaningless to the enemy it is simply a way of harrying and distracting the brothers and sisters of dragons until the void has claimed its place in this world and yet we must fight and we must die and what do we gain survival lughs face was drawn yet to decebalus he appeared to have grown in stature since the barbarian had first encountered him all things under existence are in peril extinction waits for fragile creatures and for gods when the void remakes this place we will no longer be in it replaced by supine peoples who will live in peace within the mundane spell and never challenge the will of the devourer of all things decebalus nodded you make sense for a slippery manipulator of men for all time until this time there was always a chance the void could be deposed however slim that chance might be if this war is lost there will never be a chance again the void rules for all time and we play our part here by distracting the enemy and deflecting the bulk of its forces from hunting jack giantkiller and his fellows there is little glory in any victory here he smiled wryly but we play a part and sometimes that is enough they were interrupted by a sister of dragons with dyed red hair her name was sarah mazzarella a thoughtful and intuitive woman to whom decebalus had given the onerous task of liaising with the gods theyre ready she said her voice weary theyve agreed to accept your orders in the battle she glanced at lugh but no other as it should be lugh said we would only fight amongst each other if one of us tried to gain ascendancy you are an irritating and troublesome kind decebalus sighed it would be easier to herd cats with a stick and a flute he nodded to sarah tell them we march onto the field of slaughter within the hour i may reword that she said as she left you have a strategy in place lugh asked yes run hard at the enemy and see if they fall down lugh eyed decebalus unsure if he was joking i have a plan the barbarian said with a grin he glanced towards the tower where smoke belched from the windows and lights flashed mysteriously math was hard at work as they made their way down towards their troops there was a loud disturbance at the gate soon after the chief of the guards ran breathlessly to them the enemy has sent an emissary to talk he gasped we are not going to surrender decebalus said lugh caught his arm let us listen to what he has to say at the gate a skeletal figure in black robes with a sly smile and staring yellow eyes waited with three redcaps who could barely contain their bloodlust they all stank of rotting meat perhaps i should cut you down here and save time decebalus mused what would it profit you the skeletal man nodded mockingly i am lorca charged to speak for the one your kind knows as seth sole survivor of the great dominion of the desert lands who commands this mighty force ah he seeks revenge lorca gave a chittering laugh revenge is for equals fragile creature we come here to with a wry expression lorca searched for words that decebalus might understand and finally settled on save trouble save trouble why i have been looking forward to this fight for a long time i have organised my week around it you wish to die so soon if needs must but i have a bet on with the drinkers down at the hunters moon how many of you will i take with me that is the question lorca nodded patronisingly say your piece and then we can get down to the sport decebalus said give up the caraprix taken aback decebalus shared a glance with lugh give them up now and we will leave you in peace here to live out the rest of your days however long that may be lorca continued why would you want those silver rats why would you they are no use to fragile creatures they were no use now that you have raised the matter i think they may well be of great use indeed then you do not know their true nature you harbour the seeds of your own destruction fragile creature the caraprix are not benign they are a force of destruction ah so you are doing us a favour by taking them off our hands i had the same proposition in the market this very morning a ducat for my axe to save me from cutting myself lorca nodded and smiled but his eyes were filled with a deathly cold understand that you may make a gift of the caraprix or we will take them the only difference is the life or death of everyone in this city run along now i am tired of talking lorca held decebaluss gaze for a moment before giving another contemptuous nod and retreating with the redcaps an interesting development decebalus mused then the enemy has a reason to be here lugh said there is a reason for everything the question then is of what use are those shapeshifting rats to the army of ultimate destruction they must be of great value indeed lugh pondered for a moment and then said and why did the enemy not simply crush us and take the caraprix there is something here i think there is something indeed decebalus gave a pleased grin if the enemy wants the caraprix so badly that they are prepared to wheedle for them our course of action is decided they shall not have them hunter and jack spent the better part of an hour searching the reaches of the cavern for an exit far behind them in the dark the fomorii hunted through the field of bones drawing closer with every passing minute the sign would have been easy to miss if jack had not been resting his forehead against the rock to calm his mounting panic faint vibrations rippled through the wall a steady rhythmic beat he called hunter over who pressed his ear to the damp rock you can hear it he whispered boomboomboom like machinery in here what could it be when hunter edged along the wall in a particular direction the beat grew fractionally louder until he could hear it clearly at that point he spied handholds in the rock leading up to a small dark opening about ten feet off the ground boosting jack up he followed him into a tunnel large enough for them to stand upright cut through the rock the beat emanated from somewhere ahead the tunnel wound steadily upwards presenting occasional roughhewn steps for them to climb the beat growing louder the closer they drew to the source soon it was ringing off the stone walls and vibrating beneath their feet boomboomboom they entered a large hall that smelled of sulphur and coal with enormous furnaces along opposite walls still black with soot the tools of the smiths protruding from the dead cores halfcompleted swords and chain mail rusted on the ground amidst anvils and scattered hammers looks like weve found the back door into the halls of the drakusa hunter said if the others got in we could meet up with them jacks eyes gleamed with hope i was afraid we might have to go back the way we came beyond another chamber was given over to industrial production but here its purpose was less clear a faint chemical smell hung over benches covered with glass bottles and jars bones had been swept into the corners mysterious implements lay abandoned on the floor and on the benches as if the occupants had been rudely disturbed the floor of the following chamber was covered with runes and ritual marks and contained an overwhelming atmosphere of threat hunter and jack couldnt bear to tarry in it for too long finally the booming was so painful they had to cover their ears the source was a huge iron door set in the wall of a long corridor but the moment hunter grabbed the handle with both hands and dragged the door open silence fell jack futilely urged his friend not to venture into the room but hunters curiosity had got the better of him the chamber was lit by a shaft of natural sunlight falling from an incredible height overhead stone steps wound around the walls up the dizzying stretch to whatever lay in the dim upper reaches the floor of the chamber was occupied by a giant with a brutish bare heavily scarred torso its head covered with a leather hood its arms outstretched and fastened to the floor by shackles it was stockstill head cocked listening how long has it been here jack whispered the drakusa disappeared long before the tuatha de danaan arrived on the scene an age ago all that time what does it feed on what does it feed on the giant repeated jack started it heard me it can speak hunter pushed jack back towards the door as they stepped out of the chamber the giant wrenched at its chains again and again creating the deafening booming sound they had followed hunter took them back into the chamber and it stopped waiting its been trying to break free all this time hunter observed its been trying to break free the giant repeated why is it mimicking what we say jack asked i dont think it is hunter replied thoughtfully lets forget how it survived all this time why did the drakusa imprison it here the giant continued to listen intently i dont like it jack decided one hundred and ninetythree cried like a baby the giant said whats it talking about jack asked before he saw hunter staring mouth open sixtyseven spilled blood and urine on the tiles the giant continued get out of my head hunter shouted whats it saying jack asked whats one hundred and ninetythree and sixtyseven never you mind lets get out of here the door slammed shut a lock fell into place youre here now the giant said the thunder of the barricaded door being torn open echoed through the halls and was followed by a grinding metallic sound of something being dragged over the stone flags dammit church said under his breath they were only three halls away from where he and veitch had discovered the sign in the dust did you really think youd be given a free run right up to the gates of the enemy tom mocked theyre going to be hunting and harrying you at every turn the void wont want to risk you getting anywhere near enough to do any damage everything at their disposal will have been put in place long ago to keep you away spies traitors hunting parties the kind of sentinels that cant be avoided that never stop why didnt you say this before church said sharply what was the point you never had any chance of getting through better to let you keep your hopes up to the last and now youve decided to get my hopes down refusing to answer any further questions tom moved away but church was already wondering if hed made the wrong decision to suspect virginia was toms comment about spies and traitors a cry for help the grinding metallic sound drew closer theyre outpacing us veitch said glancing back we could barricade each door we pass through but i dont reckon itll do us much good better hope we get to the gate back to summerside pretty quick then you think theyre going to stop at the gate weve lost any advantage we had crossing through this godforsaken place theyre going to be straight on us the minute we crash back into the far lands ruth had overheard their conversation as she helped miller and virginia who were flagging we have to stop them here its the only way ahead tom and shavi conferred intensely we both feel we are near to the gate shavi said but we cannot find the way the warrior said we had to find the heart of the drakusa if we wanted to get to the groghaan gate church peered around the gloomy chamber but it appeared to be as bare and forlorn as all the others the line of sight through the great doors of the chambers revealed flickering lights in the distant dark now would be a good time for inspiration laura said everyone except church rushed to search the chamber with urgency dragging blocks of masonry aside brushing the thick grime and cobwebs from crumbling murals sweeping away the dust covering the flags the echoes of the metallic grinding filled the room the heart of a warrior church mused aloud the heart brave fearless aspiring no no reaching for greatness a connection was made quickly but methodically church began to investigate the walls trying to see into the shadows that clustered overhead as church moved the lantern it brought a subtle shift in slivers of shadow on the stone near him revealing protrusions only a few inches wide broadly spaced footholds wound up into the dark invisible to the casual eye he called the others over as the lights drew into the adjoining chamber ill go ruth said handing her spear to church no youll break your neck veitch tried to pull her back no ones gonna get up there ruth threw him off ill go she said fiercely im lighter more agile and if anyones going to break their neck it ought to be her laura said pressed flat against the wall ruth put one foot on the lowest step and reached for the next she had to stretch her fingers to find even the flimsiest handhold and then with a shaky precarious step she leaped to the next stone when she almost fell from the fifth step now well above their heads veitch had to look away get underneath to break her fall he said to laura as he turned to join church facing the approaching lights were going to have to fight if we can hold them off at least the others can get through were doing this all the way to the enemy probably from the shadows emerged a figure eight feet tall with rusty iron plates on chains at the front and back of his body muscular arms smeared with blood he wore a helmet of smaller iron plates bolted together haphazardly the nowdeafening grating came from an enormous sword that he dragged behind him church and veitch recognised the iron slaughterman from the description mallory had given them of his encounter with the being in ogmas library in the flickering torchlight twenty figures swarmed around him keeping low they had the heads of wolves and rats but the bodies of men snapping at the air in a hunting frenzy behind them church could just make out further movement like clouds of smoke unfolding towards him how are you doing church called out still clinging on if thats what you mean ruth shouted back without slowing his step the iron slaughterman began to swing the sword which was as big as he was veins bulged on his straining sinews and the rusty bloodstained sword began to gather speed in an arc hes never going to hit us with that big bleedin thing veitch mocked the sword swung round and round over the iron slaughtermans head as he ran at the last he lowered the angle so it drove towards church and veitch who leaped out of the way the sword hit the flags with such explosive force that chunks of stone hurtled through the air church and veitch were thrown from their feet and a massive fissure opened in the floor snapping and snarling the wolves and rats attacked church rolled back to his feet bringing caledfwlch up sharply to bisect one from groin to shoulder and then taking the head off another veitch had already despatched three but the others were darting and retreating trying to get past church and veitch to their more vulnerable companions heaving his sword off the ground and whirling it in another slow powerful arc the iron slaughterman attacked again church ducked beneath the whistling blade at the last second and it crashed through a marble pillar bringing down part of the ceiling in a cloud of billowing dust bastards going to bring this place down around us veitch coughed as he and church took the opportunity to retreat a few paces unseen when the dust cleared church saw a figure floating a foot in the air behind the attackers bonewhite skin framed by black hair becoming black skin and white hair and back janus the god of doorways and new beginnings raised his golden key and ironwood stick one to open the path the other to drive away those who had no right to cross the threshold brothers of dragons he said in a scraping voice your doors shall be closed for ever above them they heard a cry of exultation from ruth and then a door ground open in the wall behind them you see thats irony church said to janus this place is winding down and all places joined to it janus continued the lamps are going out the doors are closing one by one by one you cannot hold back the dark were the ones who carry the light veitch said defiantly a little blue spark and thatll never go out as the rats and wolves circled church said to janus youre a god youre not controlled by the anubis box youve still got free will why did you choose to side with the void and the army of the ten billion spiders i am not just a god i am divom deus the gods god the first i am one of the oldest things in the land before church had a moment to reflect on what janus had said one of the rat creatures darted under his guard and flung itself into the newly opened doorway to block their retreat it had only backed a few paces into the space beyond the door when the tubular corridor began to revolve and axes swung like pendulums at intermittent spaces along the way one blade planted itself firmly in the rat creatures chest with a strangled bestial cry it fell to the floor in a gout of blood and began to revolve and fall revolve and fall that was a spot of luck veitch said the warrior told us the path to the gate had been boobytrapped church retreated with veitch to the door this might only be a part of it ruth joined them in the entrance to the revolving corridor as the iron slaughterman launched another attack the sword ripped through wall and floor bringing another deluge of masonry from the precarious ceiling let me go first follow my steps ruth shouted above the roar of falling stonework darting into the revolving corridor she performed intricate steps to dodge and duck the pendulum axes while fighting to keep her balance church held his breath as more than one came within a hairs breadth of her but then she was through to the other side urging shavi then laura to follow the rat and wolf creatures leaped snarling only to be cut down by church and veitch another assault by the iron slaughterman tore through the walls on either side of the door forcing miller and virginia to fall to their knees screaming as tom dived into the revolving corridor resonant creaks and groans warned them that the entire stone ceiling was about to come down once tom miller and virginia had made it through the axes church and veitch followed dancing amongst the blades with such balletic skill that they made it appear effortless ruth waited at the foot of a winding stone staircase she held up a hand to halt church and veitch then jabbed her spear up the stairs blades shot out from both walls and snapped back into place they would have sliced off the legs of anyone climbing them with the sounds of pursuit drawing closer along the revolving corridor ruth yelled see the gaps in the walls from which the blades extend if youre careful you can go over and under we havent got time to be careful veitch barked move almost rigid with fear virginia was helped by ruth and miller the others followed as quickly as they could the kaching of the blades became a steady terrifying beat as they worked their way up the steps a cry rang out as one clipped toms boot and he sprawled narrowly missing another blade his stream of abuse told everyone he was all right a quaking at the foot of the steps warned church that the iron slaughterman was close behind the sound of shattering blades revealing how he was putting his sword to good use freezing air brilliant white light and the dying blizzard greeted them as they stumbled from the top of the steps onto a stone terrace on the side of the mountain across a dizzying gulf on another rocky slope of the range they could just make out what had to be the groghaan gate a soaring arch of gleaming gold a bridge had once spanned the gulf between the two peaks but it had been shattered at intervals so that sections were suspended on either side of columns that dropped down into the white wastes below were never going to get across there veitch said peering over the lip of the first section of bridge vertigo made him wobble and he took a step back from the edge then we make our stand here church said in the chamber in the depths of the halls of the drakusa jack frantically wrenched at the door handle but it remained resolutely closed standing his ground before the chained giant hunters face revealed the strain of keeping the creature out of his thoughts who are you hunter asked who are you the giant said okay we could keep doing this all day but its already getting old getting old wiping away a dribble of blood from his left nostril hunter continued clearly the drakusa saw you as too much of a threat to leave you wandering around are you responsible for all the bones in the basement bones of course if thats what remains of the drakusa it doesnt explain who chained you up here hunter became aware that jack was no longer rattling at the door in panic the boy now watched hunter with hooded eyes his body held in an odd posture with one shoulder slumped before hunter could ask what was wrong jack attacked in a murderous rage screaming and attempting to tear at hunters flesh throat eyes it was an effort even for hunter to hold him off but as he wrestled jack back an insidious darkness crept into the back of his head he saw himself pressing his thumbs into jacks throat and squeezing the life from him before tearing off his skin ripping out his eyes brutalising his body beyond all recognition his head swam with the last desperate expressions of all the people he had killed their fear of what was to come on the other side of death their grief for the ones they were leaving behind the terrible sight of the intelligence winking out in their eyes and then he was hanging himself from a short rope in the corner of the room his face turning black the skin decaying the insects moving in for anyone else the creeping infection of morbidity would have destroyed them but death had been hunters companion for too long he wasnt scared of it nor did it revolt him it was simply a necessary if distasteful part of life he snapped himself back from the flood of oppressive images and forced his thoughts to right themselves jack rolled on the floor gasping for air his throat still bearing the red marks of hunters fingers the deathimages assaulted his mind driving him slowly insane the giant cocked his hooded head towards hunter i am eldigahwislor the final judgement of the drakusa the dark at the end the breath of the grave he began i am death and i bring death brought into being for one purpose to end the plague of the caraprix i was not allowed to fulfil my destiny and so i have waited and waited and my urge for death has risen with each season and now you are here and i will have my way blood flew in droplets as hunter shook his head to clear his mind all well and good except youre unfortunate to have the wrong person in here you see i am death and im a bigger badder death than you hunter tore open his bag and rammed his hand into the balor claw it sang eagerly when it bonded with its master now well see skull for skull and bone for bone from beyond the door he could hear the low rumbling sound of the approaching fomorii jack whined spat blood drawing them closer bounding at the giant hunter tore off the hood red eyes that had not seen in an age rolled in a devastated face that resembled a melted candle when they fixed on hunter he saw within a monstrous intellect unknowable uncaring whose sole purpose was to destroy him destroy every living thing for the first time in his monstrous debased life he shuddered and then he brandished the balor claw in front of the giants face and said this is worse than death it can reduce you to nothing in an instant do you understand hunter wanted to look away when those hideous eyes revolved back to him i have learned your words i know your mind we are death despair washed through hunter when he heard his worst fears given voice leave the boy alone he said the red staring eyes focused on jack then snapped away as if they were removing a hook and line jack rolled onto his back gasping and crying the door throbbed with a ferocious pounding that would rend it open within seconds hunter glanced at the stone steps winding around the chamber walls but then a notion struck him you can control minds he said can you control them the nightwalkers they nested here in recent times i have felt them scurrying and searching directionless hopeless can you control them the answer was clear in the giants red eyes then open the door the blizzard blasted across the terrace again limiting visibility to one little world of brutality and strife bodies of the rat and wolf creatures were scattered all around in shocking rorschach blots of colour on the blank canvas but the iron slaughterman remained impervious to church veitch and ruths attacks his skill and speed with the sword belied his enormous size a wall of iron that deflected their attacks and forced them on the defensive only the limited space on the terrace prevented the iron slaughterman from destroying them but they all knew it was only a matter of time find a way to get across to the next part of the bridge church yelled to the others as they shielded their heads from the raining chunks of rock in the far corner of the terrace does he expect us to fly tom snapped at least janus has not ventured this far shavi said peering over the edge of the terrace he could just make out the next section of shattered bridge through the blizzard if only we had a rope he said if we dont hurry we wont even be able to see where it is miller whined i might be able to help her voice filled with uncertainty laura joined shavi at the edge and showed him a handful of seeds she had retrieved from her pocket i brought these from the court thought they might come in handy some time you know with my freakish ability to make things grow shavi smiled at her that shows excellent foresight yeah well i only did it so i could hear that lovely patronising tone in your voice a boulder dislodged from the cliff face by the iron slaughtermans sword crashed so near it almost flung them over the edge with a scream virginia buried her head into millers chest laura cursed loudly weve got to try this now but heres the deal its too cold i cant keep things alive here for more than a minute or two i might be able to get something to reach across the gap but theres no guarantee it wont wither when youre halfway across and especially with all this she glanced anxiously at the furious battle i dont know if i can keep my concentration if that goes you go shavi took lauras hand i trust you we all do lauras face fell but she quickly hid it behind a mocking smile god youre such an idiot loser shavster placing one of the seeds in a crack in the edge of the terrace she closed her eyes and bowed her head the sight of the seed bursting into green life unfolding and extending rapidly still left her breathless with disbelief and excitement who was she to have these kinds of abilities she restrained the part of her that didnt believe she deserved to be special and concentrated so that the strand of dense twisting vine thickened and spread across the gap go shavi go she urged without a second thought shavi leaped onto the vine wrapped his legs and arms around it and shimmied across it swung wildly with his exertions the wind threatening to tear him off fighting to maintain her concentration laura held the vine together but in the bitter cold the leaves were already blackening as fast as they had grown and the strand began to unravel and die through the wall of snow laura glimpsed shavi scrambling onto the shattered edge of the next section of bridge grinning he gave her the thumbsup before the snow obscured him sagging back with a gasp laura let the vine fall away the strain was already telling on her but she was determined not to let them down ignoring the rocks falling around her she placed another seed in the crack and grew it quickly go on old man youre next she said i just hope your arthritic joints hold out if i fall let it be known she did it on purpose tom said to miller with surprising agility he shimmied across the vine and disappeared into the blizzard when laura felt the vine grow less taut she let it fall away your turn miller she said ill carry virginia she can wrap her arms and legs around me itll be too much for you laura shell never make it on her own the girl kept glancing at the dizzying drop her face as white as the snow lauras heart went out to her okay she said hesitantly ill try to make the vine stronger just just be quick but before she could use the third seed a cry rang out the iron slaughterman had struck ruth a glancing blow propelling her into the mountainside where she slumped unconscious her injury had distracted both church and veitch laura called out as the great sword hurtled towards veitch and while her warning came in time for him to take one brief step back the blade still ripped across his chest releasing a spurt of blood veitch staggered backwards into the snow miller youre going to have to heal him laura shouted the iron slaughterman drove church back against the wall where veitch lay when the giant sword pounded into the rock near where his head had been the resultant explosion of shards of stone laid him flat despite the threat miller scrambled towards church and veitch but the iron slaughterman rounded on him instantly this is it laura gasped so fast was the attack on the iron slaughterman that laura barely saw it a second or two had passed before she realised he was battling furiously with a pair of fomorii their oily black shapes snapping and changing claws and spikes and horns tearing through the iron slaughtermans defences before they clung onto him their snapping jaws darting his arm fell away and in his frenzy to throw off the fomorii he careered to the edge and over taking both beasts with him as miller ran to help veitch laura scrambled to the edge but the iron slaughterman had already been lost in the swirling blizzard i hope you were expecting me laura whirled at the familiar voice hunter sauntered up jauntily jack creeping out from the top of the stairs behind him for once laura gave in to honest emotion and threw her arms around hunter kissing him passionately on the edge of the precipice oblivious to the drop the cold the wind i take it from that greeting that you werent expecting me hunter said with a grin behind him a soft blue glow rose up as miller healed veitch who was unconscious from the shock of his wound and the blood loss youre always full of surprises she said heres another one ive got my own giant hes roaming around in the hall down there turns out he can control those shapeshifting things his grin was swaggering but his eyes told of a deeper emotion that made her ache so did you miss me he asked im sorry she said he pulled back puzzled for what laura placed her hands firmly on his chest and pushed for only the briefest moment she had to bear the searing look of betrayal in his face before hunter went over the edge and was lost to the snowstorm laura his face torn with horror miller raced towards her what have you done with a flourish laura flicked one of the seeds into the air green shoots burst from it rippling and extending rapidly until they lashed around miller holding him fast laura grabbed the other end of the vine and yanked him towards her aghast he tried to force out a question that would make sense of her devastating actions but she elbowed him sharply in the face and as he reeled in a daze she propelled him over the edge after hunter jack and virginia were rooted and though they struggled briefly she was too strong and too determined church and ruth came round as laura returned from the edge of the terrace dazed they struggled to their feet not yet noticing who was missing laura helped veitch up his wound already healed thanks to miller although still weak the pendragon spirit would soon have him back to full strength church its terrible laura said when she saw the questions start to surface in his face that bastard with the sword she choked back a sob he killed hunter and and he took miller jack and virginia over the edge with him tears streamed down her face the others stared in abject shock until ruth stepped forwards to comfort laura with a hug hunter shit veitch looked to church who already understood the implications not just hunter weve lost the two keys and our way into the enemy fortress church said its all over in the timeless grim lands only seconds had passed mallory and caitlin watched as the flamboyant callow did a little jig on top of the tomb youve got a lot of energy for a dead man mallory said ah but then i am not like others you will find in this dismal place when i walked the world i was filled with more life than any of the grey workaday drudges i encountered on their morose treks into the coffin they called the office i drank deeply of the heady cup of life i imbibed all there was to offer and more mallory and caitlin exchanged a glance but if callow noticed he didnt appear to care and then it was all so cruelly snatched away callow added im betting one or two others here would say the same thing mallory said no i was not meant to die it was an error of cosmic proportions and if proof you need it is the simple fact that i am still here caitlin eyed him curiously what do you mean i am not allowed to continue the grey lands is simply a waiting room the vast majority of shades you find here are in the process of moving on to where i do not know heaven hell why this is hell nor am i out of it perhaps back into the innocent foetus with all the possibilities once again lying ahead to do right or wrong learn or not and find their way where back here mallory began to grow weary of callows chatter and prepared to head off callow instantly read the signs and leaped in front of him some of the shades get trapped here true for reasons i have not yet discerned but you can tell their type instantly consumed by bitterness infected with despair none of them exhibit the joy you see here in my humble form no i am a true anomaly neither dead nor alive caught in a web not of my own making and no one prepared to throw up their arms and admit to their mistake we cant waste time here caitlin said with irritation take me with you callow pleaded grabbing hold of mallorys jacket prising him off mallory said nice story but im pretty sure youre meant to be here and i wouldnt want to get on the wrong side of whoever sets the rules in this place please callow started to cry you dont know what its like here mallory caitlin pressed when she held up the wayfinder to examine the direction of the blue flame callow stopped crying instantly and his eyes narrowed mallory noticed the sudden change in his demeanour and asked whats wrong that lantern i have seen it before in the possession of my very good friends callow slyly watched mallorys interest grow the remarkable the astonishing jack churchill and ruth gallagher and the lovely laura shavi and the other one you know church and the others caitlin asked we were travelling partners for a time during that age of upheaval that age of misrule oh how they mourned my passing oh how they would celebrate joyously if i returned to the land of the quick the resonant creak of the cemetery gate echoed through the mist callow started and ran to the edge of a mausoleum to peer uneasily into the grey where he plucked at the fraying sleeve of his jacket mallory and caitlin left him there and tried to pick a path through the cluttered mass of monuments to the dead but within a moment he had joined them again let me guide you he said youll never find your way through this sprawling city of the departed without my help there are many hidden dangers and sometimes a slight detour could save you a limb or a life you really would not want to be permanent residents here from behind them came the dull sound of something dry and scratchy being drawn across stone whos there mallory asked i saw no one i would not expect the dead to be passing through here at this time unless of course they have learned of your arrival then it would be a time to beware they are jealous of the living and their bitterness drives them to extremes and unpleasantness bring him along caitlin said it wont hurt all right but any sign of deceit and youll wish youd stayed in your tomb mallory said bluntly and dont get any ideas about coming back with us this is a shortterm deal through this godforsaken place of course of course callow said slyly but once we are firm friends on the road of life or death who knows i know mallory said firmly move with a bow callow swung one arm out flamboyantly to guide them on their way they were soon lost amongst the mausoleums and grave markers and leaning ivycovered statues and though callow whistled jauntily a few yards ahead of them they were left uneasy by the constant morbidity of their surroundings is this what death is caitlin asked one neverchanging bleak landscape that goes on for ever hugging her arms around her she fought off the creeping desolation imposed by their surroundings dont start asking me about the afterlife mallory said i never used to think there was one for me life itself was enough of a purgatory you too i didnt use to think that i was arrogant everything was just a big sweetstore where i could pick and choose until i grew fat then life slaps you around the face and shows you what its really like he caught himself now i sound like a pathetic selfpitying loser i dont really believe that theres a lot of good its just that once youve experienced the worst there is its impossible to see the world in that totally innocent way any more but we still have hope dont we thats what keeps us going it would have been so easy to give in when grant and liam died but if i had id never have met you it was caitlins turn to catch herself afraid shed said too much she added hastily what happened to you in my arrogance i attracted the attention of a particularly nasty bunch of people i thought i could control them beat them until i realised there are people in this world who are capable of harder more terrible things than you can ever dream and if you come up against them you cant match them you always lose they gave me a choice that no person should ever have to make i killed someone and it destroyed me i couldnt live with it and then i tried to kill myself he paused i did kill myself dont ask me how i ended up here maybe there are just a whole load of successive lives you die in one you get bumped up to the next but theres a reason you came here caitlin pressed if you hadnt killed yourself you wouldnt have been here to try to save this world and wed have lost long ago out of that awful thing something good is happening itd be nice to believe that mallory clearly did not believe but it still sounds naive to me its like shavi kept saying the pattern the hidden pattern she said its all too complex so everything seems random and punctuated with all these bleak horrible events but the big picture it could be something beyond our dreams i can see the pattern here youve been sent to make sure i dont turn into a miserable grumpy old git that the children throw stones at in the street its mutual mallory with a sudden urgency he caught her arm theres someone here he tried to pinpoint the direction of the noise he had heard but with the deadened sound of the cemetery it was impossible oblivious callow punctuated his progress with bursts of whistling caitlin became darker her posture more aggressive the morrigan drew forwards a faint rasp away to his left mallory turned sword drawn but there was nothing to see then a whisper of movement ahead just beyond the visibility the mist allowed him circling he thought looking for an opening though they were both on their guard neither were prepared for the silent figure rising up beside a tomb they had just passed the hortha gripped caitlin across the mouth with a twisted blackthorn hand spun her around and extended the index finger of its right hand to drive it between her eyes and into her brain with a muffled snarl caitlin drove her axe down into the horthas thigh dry blackthorn shattered as the blade almost severed the limb as the hortha lurched to one side his attack was thrown offbalance and the fingerspear tore open the flesh along the side of her temple wriggling free caitlin flipped back to land on her feet axe ready to attack pausing only to watch with disgust as the hortha raised its finger to drop a minute amount of her blood into its paper mouth the axe crashed into the horthas torso but as soon as caitlin withdrew it the blackthorn was already growing back into place with a snap and a pop i taste your thoughts it said there is nowhere to run now caitlin and mallory attacked together but the hortha evaded them with a speed that made it a blur it used the folding mist to hide itself before coming at them rapidly from another direction they cut off chunks here and there a hand half a leg but it regrew just as quickly and their sense of futility mounted with their unease hailing them from the cover of a mausoleum callow beckoned frantically mallory signalled to caitlin with his eyes and when the hortha withdrew into the mist they both ran were just wasting our time mallory said breathlessly as they moved away through the cemetery were never going to stop him like that how did he follow us here from the temple caitlin said we left no trail no time for that now callow said the great lord gave us brains to use in situations like this brute strength is all well and good but it pales behind the advantages of the grey matter used well and wisely he led them on a fast winding path through the grave markers until he came to a mausoleum that had been marked with a red cross on the door whats so special about this one mallory asked these are all houses of the dead callow replied but some are home to worse things than the dearly departed once i open the door venture no further than the light reaches into the dark stand on either side of the door and when your friend enters emerge victorious at first mallory wasnt convinced but when he read the repressed fear in callows face as he wrenched the stone door open he stepped in with caitlin right behind callow had been right the light died unnaturally quickly and sound was deadened close to the source beyond the few inches of grey illumination around the doorway the darkness swam like oil it had dimension and texture and gave off a quality that made them feel dread as they stood on either side of the door looking into the dark their skin prickled and they had the unmistakable sense of something looking back at them their fears were confirmed when a faint voice whispered closer there was nothing inherently threatening in the tone but it chilled them nonetheless the hortha was in the mausoleum before they realised moving low like an animal rapidly searching the dark depths caitlin planted her axe in its back to disable it while they both darted out callow slammed the door shut the moment they were in the light the sounds that emanated from the mausoleum were chilling a highpitched shriek a frantic rustling something crashing from wall to wall and a wild thrashing noise then an unnerving silence callow gave a deep bow no more will your enemy trouble you what was in there caitlin asked callow blanched and held up a hand speak of the devil and he will appear in some aphorisms there is a deeper truth trust the wisdom i have learned in hedgerow field and forest there are times when it is best to speak and times when silence must rule shall we he swept an arm to guide their way and perhaps a word of thanks caitlin who had once again lost the dark sheen of the morrigan said with a smile thank you mr callow you were a great help and i intend to carry on in that manner indeed it is my hope to make myself indispensable to you my travelling companions oh the joys of being part of a band once more let us walk on and not look back but mallory couldnt resist one final glance at the silent mausoleum and at the others that lay all around and wondered what other threats lay hidden in the mist the blizzard continued to tear its bitter path between the mountain peaks as laura became the final surviving member of their band to make the precarious journey from the last section of the shattered bridge to the terrace that lay before the groghaan gate the mood was desperate church veitch ruth and shavi stared into the middle distance while tom sat in a nook in the rocks smoking veitch extended a hand to help laura up onto the terrace i know weve given each other a hard time he said awkwardly but you saved us here and i wanted to say you know thanks all right tattooboy dont get all misty on me just doing my job they exchanged a moment of silent communication before shavi came over i am concerned about church he whispered the loss of the two keys virginia and hunter has hit him hard he glanced back at church who had one hand on his forehead deep in thought i am afraid that despair might be setting in he fears the mission is already lost and and youre worried this might be the point when he stops being church and starts becoming the libertarian veitch continued shavi nodded thats awful laura said i mean if one thing had to tip him over the edge it would be this right but still god she looked away chewing a lip ill keep an eye on him veitch said and if i see anything dodgy he steeled himself ill do what i have to do hugging her arms around her for warmth ruth called them over we cant stand around here talking well freeze to death mate you want to carry on veitch said to church church inspected the groghaan gate arching up at least twenty feet above their heads the top lost in the snowstorm it was constructed of some unknown material that sparkled like the sun and from it came a feeling of electricity what else can we do go back and die go on and die behind him shavi veitch and laura looked at each other uneasily church reached out to the shimmering arch his fingers tingling as they brushed the warm surface this is marvellous the drakusa must have passed through here every day between winterside and summerside such an amazing thing to do moving between worlds they must have thought they owned everything kings of the world and now theyre gone he turned back to the others defiantly we might not be able to win but that doesnt mean we give up were going to make life a misery for the enemy were going to show it what it means to stand for existence what it means to have the pendragon spirit what it means to be a fragile creature were going to tear the whole damned thing down from this point on this is a suicide mission as long as we know that were not going to be disappointed how it turns out the others nodded without a moments thought no happy endings he said before turning back to the gate lets go he stepped through the arch and with a shimmer he was gone chapter five diaspora in the blistering morning sun the sands beyond the jungles edge shimmered in a heat haze that gave an illusory quality to the rolling golden world from the shade of a canopy on the terrace church watched the barrens deep in thought smelling the dry desert wind as he sipped the hot spicy drink brought to him by the scaled cafe owner through the haze the figure of the burning man glowed like coals in smoke still there always there but closer now looming so large church was convinced he would soon be able to feel the heat from the moment they had stepped through the groghaan gate the journey had been hard but at least the exhaustion and the strife had left little space for black thoughts the halls of the drakusa on summerside had been reclaimed by the landscape an age ago they rested beneath a grassy mound in the northlands beyond the foothills of the mountains a few crumbling stones all that remained on the surface to mark the glory of the oncemighty drakusa and even they were so weathered that they were easily mistaken for an outcropping of natural rock they spent an hour in the halls mourning their dead though she tried to hide it behind her flinty exterior lauras devastation at the loss of hunter was clear and she had to be persuaded by all to continue in hunters name never once did she cry though for a while she disappeared into an antechamber to be alone with her emotions she sat silently in the centre of the room her head bowed her features hidden all of them felt grief for the deaths of miller jack and virginia far beyond what their loss meant for the mission the others were surprised to see that even veitch was touched particularly by the passing of miller whom he considered a friend he said even though he had never expressed it at the end of the hour their hearts were still heavy but they found the strength to go on following the deep lush river valleys that offered dense treecover and deep shadow they moved steadily north across the stinking haunted marshlands where the insects were bigger than fists and carried a poisonous punch that could paralyse and kill into the tropical jungle where the night was filled with drums and the howls of hunting beasts they avoided the mysterious tribes who worshipped brutish idols and came and went from the dense interior like ghosts just as they had avoided the warbands of the enemy that roamed across every part of the land harrying and slaughtering after the death of the iron slaughterman they knew janus would have despatched others with the specific task of tracking them down and destroying them and on one occasion they had seen something terrible silhouetted against the moon on a ridge but nothing had located them it was only a matter of time and finally they had come to the court of endless horizons abandoned by the tuatha de danaan as they raced towards sanctuary at the court of the soaring spirit now it was filled with hundreds of thousands of refugees from every part of the far lands dwarfish mountaindwellers and the willowy silvereyed hunters of the western plains the lizardskinned people from the river deltas and other stranger beings that rarely ventured from the shadows all swarmed on the streets or crammed into buildings in the sweltering heat race upon race sharing the same space begging for food sweating fighting haggling for transport or the promise of safe passage all of them united by their fear of an enemy that was alien to them in every aspect a threat that exhibited no compassion not even the slightest empathy who could not be cajoled or pleaded with or flattered who slaughtered with a devastating dispassion even in the far lands with its extremes of emotion and distorted motivations this was an anomaly the city itself was a gleaming monument to the glory of the tuatha de danaan soaring towers of brass and gold reached far above the steaming jungle that surrounded it on three sides kept at bay by walls of beaten copper and steel a sculpture of grace and beauty in the heart of a primal setting a sleek futurism in the materials and design of the buildings was set against an almost medieval confusion of tiny twisting streets and alleys leading off the broad leafy main thoroughfares yet somehow the incongruity worked the quarter nearest the gate through which they had entered was still rich with the scents of the spices that used to be stored in the warehouses along the wall and the heavy ornate incenseburners that swung from the lamps along the streets suggested the entire court would once have been filled with beautiful aromas in its time it must have been a breathtaking place church guessed now it stank and seethed filled with the hollow hopes of desperate people who knew death was always a step or two away after struggling to live off the land for so many weeks they thought they would have even more trouble obtaining food in the overpopulated city but they encountered enough people who were aware of the growing legend of the brothers and sisters of dragons to guide them to a place of shelter veitch was stunned that their reputation could earn them free food and drink in the rooftop cafe when so many were starving everything they required given freely and without obligation irritable in the heat tom joined church and was instantly presented with a cup of the hot spicy drink the waitress a tall willowy woman with a forked snaketongue bowed true thomas she lisped your presence here is recognised and welcomed tom nodded grumpily it grates on me to be treated like an elite he said when the waitress had gone all those people out there suffering and we get free drinks it makes them happy church replied they believe in us and want to hope that we can make things better for them if thats the least we can do then its something everyone deserves a little hope to make them happier tom snorted hope is meaningless if theres no chance of it being effected otherwise its just delusion he fixed a cold eye on church are you losing hope im not planning the victory party if thats what you mean im waiting for a sign that theres still some way we can make a difference the puck has helped me more than once why hasnt he appeared since winterside because theres nothing we can do the universe gives you a helping hand when you put some energy into the process yourself not when youre sitting back hoping something will just turn up we are doing something the others are out gathering information about the enemy the fortress they call it the house of pain around here what we need right now is a way into it and what are you doing thinking the morvren had gathered on every treetop around the city often silent they were now cawing as if filled with an insatiable hunger their number had increased rapidly and church didnt know if it was because they were breeding if the possibility of death that attracted them had grown more intense or if it was symbolic of the level of threat now facing him from the rooftop it looked as if a black shroud had been laid across the steaming jungle my mistake tom said blowing on his drink i thought you were doing nothing why hasnt the libertarian been hounding us church asked we have been a little elusive hes me he must know what ive done where ive been so why doesnt he just turn up out of the blue slit everyones throats dump me in a cell and be done with it time and memory are slippery things tom began edgily we cant trust ourselves we never quite remember things how they actually were and time itself is not fixed you know that on every occasion you go back something subtle alters it might not be enough to change the big events ranged through history like tentpoles supporting the whole damn canvas of everything or it might the libertarian has to be extremely cautious he wont want to risk doing anything that might stop him coming into being so that he winks out like a star at dawn it makes my head hurt thinking about it church grumbled thats because you see things in a linear way and in terms of simple cause and effect ive lived with my ragged view of the future for a long time and i can tell you that nothing is clear everything shifts and changes like the grains of sand on the beach and you can never predict which way one will go he must think like me so ive been trying to put myself in his head church continued what does he want for me to change and become him i presume if i dont he doesnt get to exist youre right this whole screwedup timeline thing is a mess but if the libertarian is still around then what lies ahead guarantees i become him things are panning out just as they should from the libertarians point of view like clockwork but hes not going to take any chance that i might change events or that the puck might push me down another path or something so hes going to keep manipulating me into situations that will make me become him basically if hes not around things are going badly if he is theres a chance i might be able to put things right i dont think its wholly wise to put yourself into the libertarians thought processes that alone may be leading you towards that destiny church sipped his hot drink thoughtfully another thing the blue fire exists all over our world if you look closely enough its here in the far lands certainly but not to the same degree and why isnt this place swarming with fabulous beasts youd have thought of all places here would be their true home where theyd thrive a hint of a smile flickered on toms lips before he wiped it away yes i wonder why that is i suppose youre not going to tell me where would be the fun in that especially when youre doing so well with your thinking tom added caustically when did things become so difficult church asked after a moments reflection it used to be so easy in our world with the blue fire everywhere seeing the magic in the world the choices were clear toms brief glance revealed an unusual hint of tenderness if the choices are clear they are usually false choices life is muddy and complex without any easy answers but these days im not even sure were on the right side i dont know what im fighting for any more i dont know why im having to make all these sacrifices youve been on the road a long time youre weary its beyond that what if the libertarian is right people arent in the world for long they just want a little security a few home comforts time to spend with their loved ones is that so bad all i want is some time with ruth to enjoy what we have why should i give that up to keep fighting for something i dont understand any more tom made to speak then caught himself his expression registering a deep concern church was distracted by the sight of the morvren suddenly taking wing as one a black cloud that blocked out the sun and cast the whole city into shade whats disturbed them he wondered the crowd smelled of lime and vinegar and allspice woodsmoke bitumen and sulphur and the hot odour that came off skin on a summers day from a feverish dream or a nightmare drawn from nursery storybooks the inhabitants of the court came in a vast wave sweeping in eddies around obstacles fallen bodies sleeping beasts surging off each other toofast tooslow with everywhere and nowhere to go it was impossible to see more than a couple of feet on any side some begged for food or board or information others ran with the hope of a destination or fled some unrevealed threat fear burning in their faces some had murder in their eyes or the sly desire to make gain from misfortune jesus christ this is worse than oxford street just before christmas veitch complained as he and shavi pushed through the throng overhead people hung from windows two or three crammed into the gap wailing or yelling to people across the way the din made his ears hurt you can almost smell the desperation these beings have known nothing but alwayssummer and now they sense the twilight coming in there you go again feeling sorry for a bunch of people you dont know veitch roughly thrust aside a man rippling with rolls of fat his clothes sodden with sweat ive missed you youre my conscience and i have missed you my friend more than you might know we were all bereft when we thought you dead after the battle of london but i felt as if i had truly lost a brother a brother more than the brothers of my own family who disowned me when i failed to follow their path dont go getting sentimental on me i cant be doing with that hey what the bleedin hells that veitch pushed through the dense flow to one side where a puppeteer was performing a show in the shade of an inn he was at least eight feet tall with long black robes that veitch presumed obscured his stilts and he wore a white mask with a curving nose like a birds beak he looked like the wall painting in the halls of the drakusa but it was the dancing puppets that caught veitchs eye they resembled church shavi ruth laura and himself the church and ruth puppets were hugging while the veitch one stood off to one side holding a sword before turning to attack veitch experienced a brief burst of anger moderated by the knowledge that he was surely imagining the resemblances he took one step towards the puppetmaster and was sent flying by a woman weaving frantically through the crowd cursing underneath the figure sprawling on top of him veitch was shocked to see she was human wearing modern clothes and gripped by such terror that her eyes barely saw him calm down he caught her shoulders as she prepared to throw herself off him to run again where the hell did you come from his words cut through her fear and she gradually focused on him youre from earth oh god oh god whats happening to me where is this place sobbing fitfully she collapsed into him veitch helped her to her feet after her fugue she was now shaking uncontrollably awkwardly veitch tried to calm her im ryan whats your name rrrachel she stuttered something was chasing me making me come this way ii remember a grin like it couldnt decide if it wanted to eat me up or kiss me and those eyes and and the memory slipped from her and she shook her head in frustration how did you get here before she could answer a column of smoke soared up above the rooftops accompanied by a boom that echoed off the metallic walls sizzling coloured lights arced out from the direction of the explosion the crowd responded with panic and in the melee veitch and rachel were torn apart already forgetting her veitch fought his way to shavi and said lets get back to church till we know whats going on no if we can help we should veitch set his jaw i bloody hate you shavi when the blast happened ruth and laura had been quietly questioning the occupants of one of the overcrowded inns but few had any knowledge of the enemy fortress itself and those that did were too afraid to discuss it only one street away the explosion shook the building so furiously that tankards flew from tables spilling ale and wine across the sawdustcovered boards fearing the worst the anxious drinkers flooded from the inn into the screaming mob outside leaving ruth and laura to edge through one of the vermininfested alleys to find a view of the blast site i can do the reconnaissance ruth suggested why dont you head back you dont have to keep treating me like im a baby laura responded with undue harshness hunters gone im dealing with it im not going to collapse in tears at the first sign of trouble sorry for thinking of you ruth bristled at the end of the alley rubble and twisted metal were strewn across the street along with the bodies of several passersby caught in the blast flickers of flame and thick acrid smoke rose up from the ruins of a demolished building as the smoke shifted they caught glimpses of a giant figure strapped to an xframe in the wreckage of the building he couldnt have been there before ruth said thered be nothing left of him he must have been brought in after the explosion why maybe its his place and someone wants to make an example of him laura replied you know like tarandfeathering he probably sold some gangster a knockoff watch the shifting smoke revealed wild black hair and a beard ruths tart response to laura died in her throat i know him i saw him back in london when the void had me living that fake life hes the one mallory said gave him the lantern the caretaker whats he doing here and who did that to him as the smoke finally cleared the extent of the caretakers plight was revealed wounds gaped on his arms his head sagged and more ragged cuts marred what skin was visible on his face jagged twists of barbed wire held his wrists and legs to the xframe and another had been fastened around his neck poor man ruth said it looks like hes been tortured hes not a man is he though laura replied hes something else that doesnt mean he cant feel pain ruth brushed away a stray tear we have to help him hes going to die there wrenching his head back painfully the caretaker said in a booming voice that would have carried three streets away brothers and sisters of dragons if you can hear me stay away my time here is nearly done and there is nothing you can do to aid me did he hear me ruth whispered before realising the enemy must be nearby hes saying it so loudly so they wont realise how close we are the caretaker sucked in a juddering breath of air the enemy knows you are here he continued they wish to draw you out you will not be allowed to get any closer to your destination they fear you brothers and sisters of dragons they fear the power that burns in your hearts ruth began to cry silently at the caretakers suffering he needs our help she said desperately we cant just leave him to die you must forget me he continued the oldest things in the land have attempted to help you as best we could during your long struggle but that aid may well be coming to an end we face our own battles with our own kind and now as the great plans fragment on both sides only chaos beckons the outcome is uncertain wincing he took another deep breath your lessons are not yet complete but this desperate time has brought the teaching to an end we must all hope that you have learned enough to defeat the enemy he paused then repeated wearily the outcome is uncertain you think we should risk it laura asked whip out there quick drag him down and bring him back we might be able to get away with it we have to listen to him ruth said dismally hes right theres too much at stake a deep shadow fell across the ruined building though the source was not visible from ruth and lauras vantage point as they craned to see a noise behind them alerted them to the approach of veitch and shavi the lights are going out all across the lands the caretaker intoned and i will no longer be there to keep the last lamp lit his eyes flickered and his head slumped forwards onto his chest as ruth stifled a cry veitch put his arms around her to comfort her if even theyre dying he began before catching himself an intense blue light burned where the caretaker had hung from the xframe and when it finally cleared his body had gone the deep shadow remained however and grew stronger across the rooftops something feline darted its shape altering as it moved into an almosthuman form a mirror glinted in its hand as they tried to perceive what it truly was darkness folded around it and briefly blocked out the sun cold fingers of dread touched them all i do not think it wise to stay here any longer shavi said although none of them knew the caretaker they all felt a deep grief at his death instinctively they recognised that something good had passed and the universe was a worse place for it for a long hour they had sat in a shady spot on the cafe terrace where they could not be seen by the other clientele drinking cups of the hot spicy drink and trying to make sense of what had just occurred ahead of them the setting sun turned the desert the colour of blood this is a right bleedin mess you dont know who to trust veitch said laura fixed a knowing eye on him very true veitch glared at her i cant believe the caretakers dead ruths knuckles were white on her spear something so powerful destroyed by the enemy janus is one of the oldest things in the land tom reminded her and he has joined the void so what this is a civil war laura said could be as church listened to the soaring dusk song of one of the many sects now occupying the city he remembered a similar moment in cairo sitting on the edge of mystery in a hot sprawling city looking into the night and wondering what the future held for them would there ever be a chance for rest or was this as good as it got a brief interlude in the chaos of life before it wound down to failure and death the caretaker said the enemy knew we were here how he looked around the group carefully the most obvious answer would be that someone told them tom said veitch sneered youre saying one of us nah you would say that laura said church saw veitch bristle and stepped in quickly im not saying anything except its something we need to keep at the back of our minds that we cant trust one of us veitch continued growing more incensed that defeats the whole point of the five a team all together when its backstothewall time that didnt stop you when you sold us out first time around laura said that wasnt me will you two stop it ruth snapped dont you get it the enemy knows were here theyre not going to sit back theyre going to come looking for us with something powerful enough to kill the caretaker accepting the magnitude of ruths words veitch and laura fell silent so should we leave the city tonight shavi asked and go where church said we came here to try to find a way into the house of pain we shouldnt leave till weve got the information we need and its a big crowded city the enemys going to take some time to find us if were smart i agree with church tom said you dont get a vote old man laura swung one booted foot onto the table and stretched out hands behind her head the others remained tense veitch sat up sharply remembering i forgot i met a girl did you hold hands and skip laura asked a girl from earth youre sure church asked looked like shed just arrived she was in a right panic being chased by something she said impossible tom snorted you know all the gateways to the fixed lands were closed by the army of the ten billion spiders she just got here i tell you church thought for a moment trying to contain his mounting excitement that means theres another path back to earth that we dont know about we can go home ruth couldnt hide her concern youre thinking about running away his mind racing church ignored her and the uneasiness the others were starting to exhibit drop everything else and turn this city upside down we need to find that woman the song of the cult reached a crescendo as darkness fell across the overcrowded city stinking of sweat and misery and desperation and filled with voices that never stopped but with the fading of the light a new degree of misery was added from the shadows where nothing had been shapes moved out into the population no one saw them pass but they felt them in their hearts and the fear began to rise stand firm decebalus bellowed as the army of dragons faced into a ferocious wind beneath a darkening sky amongst the roiling black clouds the riotbeasts advanced their eyes roving insanely bolts of lightning crashed randomly from them to sear the green plain sir how are we supposed to get a bead on those things if you dont mind me asking sir ronnie shouted above the gale hed polished the buttons of his army uniform ready for the battle and now wore the tin hat that had seen activity in flanders the enemy hope to break our ranks with their war engines they do not yet realise what weapons we wield and neither do you watch decebalus raised his eyes to the heavens ignoring the heavy rain despite numbering almost a hundred and fifty the army of dragons was a small knot of resistance compared to the seemingly neverending ranks of the enemy the dacian barbarian was proud of his troops huddled together in the face of such overwhelming opposition they came from more civilised times than he knew and he had feared their softness of muscle would hamper them in the coming struggle but they had shown a deeper seam of hardness than he could ever have hoped warriors tacticians mystics and magicians they were individuals with a group mind and a spirit that could never be broken in their eyes he could see their fear but still they stood firm heroes he thought no wonder the devourer of all things was afraid of what they could achieve under the clouds the day became like night forty feet away a bolt of lightning raised a shower of burned earth and although he could feel its heat he did not flinch instead he started to laugh heartily celebrating the storm pardon me sir ronnie said but the boys and girls will probably think youve gone mad madder let them mad yes mad with joy at the horror the enemy will feel when they see how they have underestimated us see as if on cue the glamour disappeared and the ranks of the gods were revealed all around the small clump of brothers and sisters of dragons like a sunlit mirror at the heart of the storm the powerful beings dazzled their mortal comrades crikey ronnie exclaimed is that why you wouldnt let us see them before the gods exist to make mortals mad decebalus replied the less you have to do with them the better it is for you two gleaming figures ran from the ranks at speed arching their backs as they threw themselves into a glide just above the ground before soaring up on the air currents one appeared to ronnie to be flipping back and forth between two forms a man with an ornate gold helmet and a coiled beast that appeared simultaneously to be bird serpent and something constructed of lush foliage that one goes by the name of quetzalcoatl decebalus rolled his tongue around the syllables as though it had taken him a long time to learn the word all those gods are strange but he was the strangest of all until the last i could not tell if he even understood me the other figure began to glow like the sun as he flew upwards his hair was wild like a beggars but he wore golden armour that gave him majesty and that one also hails from the great dominion of the southern americas his name is viracocha decebalus continued his melancholy is breathtaking to see and also irritating he claims that his tears will wash away the world but then they all say something like that caught in the turbulence near the riotbeasts the two gods fought to maintain their stability lightning flashed around them as the three monstrous creatures drifted towards the figures they dwarfed they wont stand a chance ronnie said when a lightning bolt finally found its way to viracocha he lit up like a star it took ronnie a second or two to realise that the flash had actually invigorated the god sparks fizzed from his fingertips and every follicle of hair until a corona surrounded him from nowhere he summoned a microweather system rain lashed like bullets at the nearest riotbeast and winds buffeted it so it drifted untethered across the plain and yet still viracocha burned like a sun the light growing more intense with each passing moment in contrast quetzalcoatl swooped like a raptor on a riotbeast raking with claws and beak that came and went every time ronnie could see him past the glare of viracocha finally with a sound like shattering glass the riotbeast careered into another before crashing down those dumb eyes rolling upwards one final time before the creature fell onto the plain the blazing sun that had been viracocha threw back its arms and a blast of the purest hottest light seared the riotbeast that had been throwing lightning at him in a ceaseless rain of crackling energy the light tore through the beast and continued across the plain to explode in a starburst over the heads of the enemy for the first time illuminating their dark ranks burning chunks of the riotbeast rained down onto the plain setting the grass ablaze holy mary mother of god ronnie gasped if wed only had those at flanders sir the world would be a happier place at an unheard summons the third riotbeast turned and drifted back towards the enemy lines their energies spent viracocha and quetzalcoatl swooped down to the gods amidst the cheers of the army of dragons and a tumultuous welcome from their fellows and that is what two of the gods can achieve decebalus said with a grim smile at our backs we have more than a hundred the odds have evened considerably on a day hotter than any they had experienced so far the court of endless horizons reflected a brassy light that made eyes ache and turned the streets into furnaces the sluggish diaspora sought out the shade of alleys and porches fanning themselves with the fronds of jungle trees praying for dusk to fall but dreading it just as much in the inns and markets there had been talk of several slayings during the course of the night beyond the usual bloody results of arguments caused by too many people with too little in too hot a place some of the bodies looked as if they had been mauled by a jungle beast others wore expressions of outright terror frozen into their features at the final moment most agreed that something had arrived in the city that would only heap more misery on their suffering aware of the rising tension the brothers and sisters of dragons moved efficiently from group to clump beggar to prince quietly asking about the female fragile creature who had last been seen racing through the streets in fear in the marketplace amidst the smell of dried fish and charcoalgrilled meat and the din of people haggling for supplies from dawn to twilight church and ruth debated leaving a note on the enormous wooden post where refugees separated from their loved ones tacked pleas for information regarding their whereabouts or notes for clandestine meetings that were rarely attended we could search this city for weeks and never stumble across this woman ruth said she was uncomfortable in the heat and wore a white cotton scarf on her head fastened in a middle eastern style with a gold band which served the dual purpose of keeping her cool and obscuring her identity to casual eyes if you really want to find her we have to make some waves if we do that were going to draw the enemy straight to us i dont understand why they havent just descended on the city in force anyway if they know were here this has the libertarians fingerprints all over it he has to play a careful game he cant risk me getting killed or badly hurt but he has to stop us doing anything that might change the established pattern hes not going to be so concerned about killing the rest of us no you know its weird how you talk about the libertarian as if hes a completely different person he is the fleeting disbelief in ruths face stung him all right he accepted theres a continuity but somethings broken in him and until i know what it is i cant do anything to prevent it but you think its something to do with you and me in that flash of precognition i had in the forbidden city in beijing the libertarian suggested i threw everything away because of my pathetic doomed love why would you do that if you died she rolled her eyes and grabbed his arm tightly sometimes you need a shaking all this is bigger than you and me im not so sure it is it is love is a weakness church all right maybe not a weakness but a luxury for people like us weve got a terrifying responsibility everybody literally everybody is depending on us she saw the touch of hurt in his face and softened you know how much i love you you and me we were always meant to be together but were expected to make sacrifices thats all we do sacrifice our lives our homes our friends who die we deserve something no we dont she said gently and thats the awful thing we have to do the job weve been given without the hope of any reward she kissed him and that made her words feel even harsher everybody says men are tougher than women but theyre not certainly not when it comes to emotions men spend all their lives putting them on one side and when they rear their ugly heads men cant cope with them they sting you harder than us were used to the pain we can feel it and put the emotion to one side get on with the job weve got to do im sorry i know how this must feel to you but youve got to listen to me if i die youve got to carry on and finish this if were torn apart like we were before you mustnt give in to despair all right he gave a convincing nod but he couldnt tell her his biggest fear that the failure of their love was a fait accompli as ruth searched for the roots of the libertarian within him her fears of what he would become would drive her away from him and towards veitch thus pushing church further down the path towards becoming the libertarian how could he break that cycle ive seen things inside myself im not happy about he admitted theres a darkness there is in all of us a shadow crossed ruths face thats one of the reasons why i accepted ryan back so readily i understand him more now im not sure thats a good thing were not pure she pressed were not heroes were just trying to do the best we can its because were all friends that we can count on each other to get past our flaws she hesitated then added if people start going off on their own were lost were five for a reason a whole thats bigger and better than the individual parts the market suddenly felt too crowded and too noisy and church longed for the intimacy that had been missing since they had left earth behind longer it felt like an age since he and ruth had been alone in the hotel room in norway but the moment had passed and ruth was already moving to question a likely stallholder who was gossiping with every person within feet of his pitch the explosion hit a second later deep in the centre of the sprawling marketplace a column of black flame sent stalls produce and bodies hurtling upwards with a boom that would have been heard across the entire city thrown wildly by the blast wave his head ringing and his hearing momentarily gone church was buried beneath a rain of vegetables jewellery votive ornaments and the heavy tarpaulin stall covers his first thoughts were for ruth and he quickly clawed his way out only to find her helping badly injured survivors some had lost limbs others were so severely burned it was clear they would not last long but ruth moved quickly amongst them helping to staunch the blood bowing her head and muttering words of her craft where they would help offering a simple prayer where nothing would church joined in but the trickle of victims from the centre of the market had become a torrent and the latest arrivals were consumed by a more immediate panic glancing over their shoulders in fear as they staggered away from the blast zone behind them lurched survivors who had been transformed by whatever magic lay within the explosion the flesh had been ripped from their heads to leave bloodstained skulls the eyes still intact and roving crazily as they attacked anyone who came near them snapping and snarling with the ferocity of cornered wolves one badly wounded man moved too slowly his throat torn open by the bite of one of the skullfaced pursuers as others fell and the panic spiralled out of control church rushed to help blue fire sizzled from caledfwlch as he attacked he could see there was no hope of the skullfaced victims recovering indeed there appeared to be nothing left of their personalities in their insane eyes they had been turned into weapons and church had no choice but to meet them head on to save the lives of others the primal savagery of the skullfaces slowed him a little but his athleticism and skill with the sword served him in cutting them down before they could harm anyone else when the last one had fallen he ran back to ruth and pulled her away from the survivors she resisted insisting on helping the wounded until church said forcefully the enemy did this to draw us out theyll be here soon and if we hang around more innocent people are going to get hurt reluctantly ruth allowed him to lead her into the maze of alleys that led away from the market when they were sure they had put enough space behind them they rested and allowed themselves to contemplate the horror of the blast they killed and injured all those people to get at us ruth said come on are you surprised they know were not going to sit back while innocents get hurt so theyll keep attacking them until we act and then theyve got us terror pure and simple and if we try to resist the people will give us up sooner or later this is the libertarian isnt it church nodded uncomfortably ruth wouldnt meet his eye and youre convinced we need to find this woman yes so we can run away do you really think i want to run away no she replied unconvincingly its just hard to see where this is going another blast punctured the silence that followed her comment somewhere on the far side of the city screams followed distant but not diminished followed by the shrill dismal cries of the morvren as they took flight the portents of death they carried with them now inescapable on the eastern side of the city in the shade of the great brass wall veitch and shavi kept their heads down to avoid recognition as they pushed through the crowd in the stifling heat the smell was choking excrement baked in the gutters and the bitter reek of urine mingled with the vinegary sweat that rose from every toohot body jostling for space in the slowmoving flow occasionally from some darkened space drifted the sourapples stink of decomposition the only breathing space came where people had fallen overcome by the heat hunger thirst or illness sprawled on the burning cobbles their chests rising and falling too slow and slowing shavi attempted to help the first three they encountered but without water or food or medical supplies there was little he could do and the simple act of stopping to offer comfort halted other passersby who wondered if there was a chance of aid the desperation in their eyes was almost too much to bear now shavi and veitch stepped over the prone forms like all the other people but veitch could see the tears glistening in shavis eyes as they edged into a narrow street filled with the shops of silversmiths and jewellerymakers a gang of dirty children in torn clothes and blankets scrambled forwards and began to beg some were human in form though their faces contained the familiar sly touch of the far lands but others were covered with thick hair or had golden triplelidded eyes or facial contusions that could have been natural or caused by malnutrition and the constant filth swarming around shavi and veitchs legs they tugged at their clothes some surreptitiously trying to slip their hands into pockets until veitch slapped them away food please one of them said just a crumb my mother is dying a crumb will keep her spark alight for another hour it sounded like a line to elicit sympathy but the savage emotion in his face offered an unbearable proof we havent got any food veitch said too harshly clear off and bother someone else a coin then it does not matter what kind one coin will buy us a day more in the far lands i am sorry shavi said we do not carry money dont bleedin engage them in conversation well never get rid of them veitch said with frustration his feelings already rubbed raw by the misery he had witnessed shavi was touched by the childrens plight bending down he tried to offer words of advice and support but it only encouraged more children to cluster around hands grasping the air for any sustenance he might be offering and that brought the attention of passing adults who kicked at the children and rolled them into the gutters to get first chance at any offerings the crowd pressing harder and harder so that veitch and shavi were trapped at its core from now on you do nothing until i say so veitch grumbled youre a bloody liability a man who towered a good two feet above everyone else his barrel chest bare thrust his way through the cluster with arms so muscular they appeared to be made of wood he loomed over veitch and shavi peering at them with blinking piggy eyes it is he exclaimed two brothers of dragons bleedin great veitch said trying to push through the tight knot without much luck here here the oxlike man announced to the entire street beckoning wildly we are saved the brothers and sisters of dragons are here in the court of endless horizons veitchs protests only drew more attention the crowd around them swelled from one side of the street to the other and the words brothers of dragons could be heard rising from awed whispers to jubilant shouts a woman in a black headdress with a third eye in the centre of her forehead clutched shavi passionately brother of dragons you will free us from the yoke of the enemy you will deliver us to salvation you will ensure that the prophecy of these last days does not come to pass another woman cried veitch was stunned into silence by the sudden ignition of hope he saw in the faces gathered around him fingers brushed his clothes with the awe one would reserve for a great leader or a religious figure struggling to comprehend he stared blankly at one outstretched hand wavering before him and then gently took it someone else took his other hand and within a moment he was forced to reach out and touch hand after hand shocked by the relief he saw rise up in everyone he graced with a fleeting contact we will do what we can shavi began to try to curb expectations but the cries only rose up louder they will help the enemy is doomed we are saved how do they know about us veitch asked shavi a bearded man in white robes answered we have always known of the brothers and sisters of dragons in the oldest stories of the far lands in the tales of all peoples from all places the champions of existence who will rise up to become the greatest heroes of alltime allplace in the earliest days they were whispered by mystics and then told to children for the entertainment of young minds but few truly believed and then oh wonder of wonders jack giantkiller stepped into the far lands and began his exploits and the truth became known and the legend of the brothers and sisters of dragons spread from mouth to mouth his voice grew shriller as his passion grew and the tales of other brothers and sisters of dragons in the fixed lands reached our ears and we realised there was hope for us the great prophecy of the devourer of all things could be averted caught up in his passion the threeeyed woman continued and so when the shadow of the enemy began to spread across the far lands we offered up our prayers and our incantations and we wished oh how we wished for the brothers and sisters of dragons to be sent to us to help us in our darkest hour and our calls have been answered you are here we are saved veitch was dragged from the adoration by a glimpse of shavis shattered expression all right were trying to keep a low profile here he shouted this isnt helping but his words were drowned out by the cries which were growing louder by the moment as more people herded into the street soon the commotion would attract more unwanted attention finally veitch put his head down and rammed a path through the crowd no longer caring if he bowled people over shavi followed in his wake the wave closing behind them attempting to turn in their direction for a moment it appeared they would be dragged down but then veitch broke through the ranks of those who had recognised them and they were running and dodging back through the flow not slowing until they were two streets away in the shade of a warehouse that smelled of beer veitch gripped shavis shoulders tightly desperately wanting to drive away the upset expression on his friends face look mate so they trust us to do the job so what he said how can we meet those expectations shavi replied destroy the devourer of all things change a prophecy of final destruction that has been around since the beginning of time they are treating us like some kind of messiahs but we are only human he shook his head so much hope invested in us they offer up their lives to us to save because they know they cannot save themselves of all of us i never expected you to give in to despair i am not giving in to despair shavi said adamantly but i am pragmatic ryan all our plans have failed the chances of progressing are slim and even then his voice trailed off veitch gave shavis shoulders a brief firm shake deep inside he felt something swell growing stronger bright with the energy of the pendragon spirit he had never felt its like before but he knew it was something he had wanted all his life listen to me were going to be the heroes they want us to be we cant let them down we dont have the luxury to be soft he planted his thumb and forefinger in an l on his forehead to be losers weve got to be hard whatever the cost and weve got to win not for us but for them because thats the job weve been given all right shavi smiled but in his eyes veitch caught a hint of pity at veitchs naivety that only made veitch more determined and for the first time he had a clear vision of his own role despair was starting to infect all of them unsurprising given the scale of the threat they faced it was down to him to stop that despair spreading to turn them around and show them the right direction this was where he could finally transcend the person he had been all his life the swelling emotions grew so strongly he thought he might burst a hubbub rose up from the end of the street and they realised word was spreading rapidly about the brothers and sisters of dragons in the city they want us to save them but theyre going to end up getting us killed thats what irony right he said with a note of pride at his use of the term come on lets get out of here before were hanging from a lamp post with the shouts and cries drawing closer they hurried down a deserted alley until they came to a secluded inn few would have known was there the sign above the entrance to the wolfs surprise showed a mans face with unmistakable lupine qualities out of place amongst the sleek metallic lines it was a squat building with a corbelled flint wall and small bottleglass windows that caught flickers of lamplight within but reflected only darkness veitch and shavi ducked into an atmosphere of ale and smoke sweat and damp but the coolness of the interior was inviting they kept their heads down and averted their eyes until they found an obscure spot at the end of a curving bar after a pause to take in the new arrivals the clientele returned to their drinks as sullen and dispirited as the crowds filling the streets a few surveyed veitch and shavi as potential opportunities but the glint in veitchs eye and the hand on his sword deterred any advance veitch looked around at the array of bizarre figures used to drink in a boozer in camberwell just like this he muttered still better than being out there with all those bombs going off what do you want fruit juice theres an old joke there somewhere veitch grinned god ive missed winding you up you have missed trying as veitch ordered the drinks the door crashed open and a voice boomed there i told you brothers of dragons not ableedingain veitch sighed striding next to the bar was a man wearing furs despite the heat with a widebrimmed hat that had seen better days and a string of lizards round his neck a blunderbuss hung from his belt behind him strode a painfully thin extremely tall man in a dark suit a huge stovepipe hat threatening to topple from his head with darting eyes that had a silvery glint the hunter clapped a hand on shavis shoulder i knew it even in the middle of a crowd i can recognise a brother of dragons what do you say shadow john leaning down to examine shavi and veitch the man in the stovepipe hat exclaimed bless my soul youre right bearskin he pumped their hands furiously how very wonderful to meet you both we had the honour of making the acquaintance of one of your colleagues young hal of oxford a fine upstanding fellow in the long tradition of your line mallory and caitlin too the legend lives on all right all right nice to meet you and all that now clear off were actually trying to be incognito veitch said very wise bearskin noted ignoring veitchs urgings this is not a time to be a brother of dragons the enemy must be hunting and harrying you we are hunting and harrying the enemy shavi said the clap of bearskins arm across shavis shoulders almost pitched him into the bar thats the spirit good brother shadow john grew lachrymose this is not a good time to be any living thing how i regret fleeing the court of the soaring spirit to seek sanctuary in a safer part of the far lands there is no safety anywhere bearskin agreed how i miss the hunters moon deep in maudlin recollection shadow john rested his hands on his silvertopped cane rocking gently from side to side best inn in all of the far lands i miss that place like the golden ones miss their longlost homeland shadow john cried veitch saw shavi scrutinising the new arrivals closely and recognised the light of an idea appear in his face you are a hunter shavi said to bearskin bearskin tapped the edge of his right eye never miss a thing i track through the thickest parts of the forest of the night or across the desert out there i can see a blade of grass move on a hillside on the distant horizon then you could perhaps help us locate someone in the heaving mass of this city a woman a fragile creature bearskin laughed heartily fragile creatures are the easiest to locate why i have tracked them across his words dried up when he caught shadow johns anxious expression well enough to say that i could sniff out a fragile creature anywhere in this forsaken place as the barman laid a tankard of ale on the bar veitch eyed it longingly and sighed okay lets go along the western wall of the city though directions meant little in the far lands where west could become north in the blink of an eye lay a walledoff garden containing rows of monuments statues commemorating some great moment from the long history of the tuatha de danaan pyramids and spires of lessobvious meaning sculptures that contained some unobtrusive element that was alien to the human sense of proportion and which caused an involuntary increase in anxiety and flutter of the heartbeat gargoyles beasts spheres that glowed with an inner light though made of stone and other more abstract designs some areas of the garden would have been a peaceful oasis in the crowded city with works of great beauty dappled by the sun through a canvas of willow or yew tropical plants with long spiky leaves grew here and there some sporting strong sweetly perfumed pink flowers and stone benches were placed intermittently in the cool shade along the gravelled paths laura scrambled over the spiketopped wall only to discover that she was not the first to gain access several men women and children had managed to haul themselves in hoping to find a cool refuge from the seething madness of the city they had all died where they sat huddled in blankets against the chill of the night or fiercely protecting a morsel of food with a knife under the shade of one tree a mother and two children lay as if asleep their faces peaceful no marks on their bodies laura was not deterred by this macabre sight she gave the bodies a cursory glance as she crunched along the path her wellhoned ability not to accept anything with which she did not agree coming into play her ego defined her worldview specifically a pleasant place that was always lauracentric she didnt even think of hunter when she saw the images of death all around she couldnt for that left her mind recoiling and placed her at risk from the rising tide of guilt and selfloathing the sun was high overhead when she came to a quiet grove at the heart of the garden where she had been summoned the trees were densely packed and it was impossible to see into their dark heart but she knew instinctively that a presence waited there her heart beat faster as she approached and a deep dread enveloped her so that she had to fight not to flee back to the comfort of people in the crowded streets ten feet from the grove she realised she could barely hear the oncedeafening sounds of the city that droned constantly in the background from morning to night it was as if an invisible cloak had been thrown over that part of the garden the silence was so intense in her mind that it had a texture soft and gluey almost liquid it was unpleasant and unnerving and felt in its own unnatural way as if it was waiting to be filled by something terrible all right she said forcing the bravado into her voice as she had so many times im here there was no response she could feel the pulse of her blood so strong she was sure she could hear her own heartbeat growing steadily faster her stomach flipped queasily the instinctive response to a hidden gaze moving slowly across her the presence was so powerful it felt even larger than the grove hiding it the electrical cloud of its inhuman intellect enveloping her holding her fast she had a mental flash of teeth of talons of being consumed and she couldnt prevent a shudder for a long moment she waited too afraid to run away for fear it would pursue her too scared to take a step closer in case it dragged her into the grove to a fate that she feared would be worse than anything she could imagine and then with such unbearable slowness that she felt she would faint with the dread of anticipation a hand extended from the trees at first she thought it was the paw of a big cat sleek with black spots on white and orange fur but within a flicker of her eye it changed to a desiccated greyskinned human hand clutching a rectangular hand mirror edged in silver with horns on each corner for some reason she couldnt explain the mirror increased lauras feelings of dread pulling in her gaze until she couldnt tear her eyes away from it the mirror glass didnt appear to be glass at all but rather some kind of liquid with the silvery quality of mercury turning slowly to black as she watched she was convinced she could plunge her hand into its depths after a second the mirror began to smoke sister of dragons the voice rang clearly in the zone of silence but it sounded unused to human words each syllable ending with a hint of an animalistic growl laura forced herself not to faint hidden within the voice were hints of blood and torn decomposing flesh of graveyards and inhuman savagery what do you want me to do she asked haltingly the time has come for another to die the voice growled after the presence in the grove had issued its order laura muttered a feeble response but her thoughts screamed in the echoing halls of her head before she knew it she was running back through the garden in blind terror throwing herself at the wall kicking and scrambling over and losing herself in the sweaty throng desperate for human contact devastated by what she had given up appalled by what she would do next whistling a jaunty tune the libertarian wiped the blood from his fingers on the clothes of the young man who had offered him a hand of friendship and the promise of shelter and then slowly climbed the steps in the tallest tower of the court of endless horizons through his lidless eyes the world always looked bloodred he wore sunglasses as an affectation one of the many he had adopted for the theatrical style he had chosen to present to the world but they had increasingly become a necessity to prevent the unpleasant psychological side effects engendered by the constantly swimming colour at times it was almost hallucinogenic plundering halfmemories from the nevertouched depths of his mind twisting them into whatmighthavebeens conjuring distorted faces of old friends longslaughtered old emotions longcrushed he could not be the person he was if he was reminded of the person he had been that was why he had created such a ludicrous public persona pieced together from silent movies vaudeville and comic books he had never been theatrical in his old life and now he was somebody else somebody so completely different that he could believe in it implicitly but still the fragmentary lockedoff recollections haunted him when they became too intense he killed for that was the ultimate denial of his pastlife enemies random strangers even those who dwelled in the daily sphere of his existence he couldnt really call them friends for there was no room for warm emotions in his sleek secure granite world and he loved who he was with a manic desperation there were no circumstances in which he would choose to go back in the restrictions of his life he was free as were all who believed in what he believed there was not the tyranny of choice the sickening insecurity of hope all the striving and failing the neverbeingcontent the world under the void was the best possible world under the circumstances of existence everyone had the peace to live out their brief lives as best they could slotting into a familiar mundane rhythm that asked nothing of them and so they too were free and when death finally came it made them freer still he couldnt understand how the person he once was had never recognised the stark comforting simplicity of that life throwing open the door at the top of the tower he stepped out into the baking midday heat a small balcony ran around the tower providing him with a threehundredandsixtydegree vista of the entire city the noise and the stink rose up from below in a sickening wave but he found it rather comforting distress was part of the voids way of letting people know they were alive how could they possibly appreciate the tiny jewels they were allowed to discover if they were not surrounded by a field of ordure yet for all the reassuring things he told himself he felt increasingly uneasy and he hated his old self for ruining the clean lines of his existence as the time neared the point of transformation when he and the void would finally be secure for ever there were too many potential vagaries shifting nodes of possibilities and blank spots in his memory events were reaching a point of flux it was a desperate time and as he always told himself desperate times bred desperate men hed waited long enough a touch on the rudder here another there subtle manipulations and nuance to guide his sheep to the place he needed them to be now it was time for grandiose actions hardness brutality and blood he could not risk any further deviation from the true line it was time to be bold gripping the rail he peered into the dizzying drop hawked up a glob of phlegm and spat before looking out across the gleaming city his heart beat harder with anticipation and then it came at first feeling like a brief shadow across the eye growing more intense by the second the high sun brilliant white dimmed as though a cloud was passing before it the temperature dropped a degree and a wind rushed across the rooftops down below the din reduced a level and as the city darkened it faded to an eerie silence stark and unsettling how long had it been since this vile place was quiet he wondered in every street heads turned up to examine the dimming sun people hung from windows craning their necks to search for clouds or flocks of birds there were none darker and darker still until finally a deep abiding gloom settled across the entire city no sun was visible no moon or stars fearful cries rose up as the inhabitants tried to make sense of the night coming down at noon frantically torches and lamps were lit but the quality of the dark was strange and intense and their illumination only reached a fraction of its usual distance then the shadows moved and all across the great city people began to die screams rose up panic swept through the streets as vast crowds stampeded for safety crushing underfoot all who fell desperately forcing their way into buildings to barricade the doors killing anyone who impeded them the libertarian smiled and nodded there was terror and there was blood and there was a night that would never end chapter six night comes down in the alleys and winding streets of the court of endless horizons the dark was impenetrable ruth and tom were en route from a false lead of a distressed fragile creature hiding in the grand marble interior of the hall of records when the gloom descended on the city as the temperature plunged and the sun disappeared from view tom dragged ruth into one of the deserted side alleys that from the vile stench had clearly been used as a toilet his quick thinking saved them both from the frenzied crush that thundered down the street people crashed through windows or had the life squeezed from them against the walls or underfoot ruth covered her ears to block out the agonised screams and dying calls of the victims which somehow stood out from the panicked roar of the crowd although tom stood next to her she couldnt see him until she brought up her spear the blue fire limning the head was just enough to illuminate the rhymers worried features what have they done she said the enemy decided killing the caretaker and blowing up huge chunks of the city wasnt enough theyve made it their place now faint lights appeared in the main street but they were so dim it took ruth and tom a moment to realise that their illumination was being smothered almost as much as the suns rays figures felt their way hesitantly along the nowdeserted street searching for the path back to the place where they laid their heads as the thin lights passed ruth occasionally glimpsed the outlines of those who had fallen we should get back to church ruth began regroup decide what were going to do now tom silenced her with a sharp squeeze on her arm do you hear something feeling along the wall they came to the end of the alley across the way someone was trying to light one of the streetlamps in the silence that had not existed in the street for many months the hiss of the oil resonated but from beyond it came the measured step of several feet on the cobbles and the ring of metal catching against walls unable to pierce the darkness that lay at the end of the street ruth and tom watched neither realising they were holding their breath in anticipation in the distance tiny lights bobbed like fireflies the dim torches of people stumbling home when one winked out ruth thought her eyes were tricking her but then a second and a third disappeared and when the fourth extinguished it was accompanied by a faint cry the enemy is coming tom said redundantly he tried to pull ruth back into the alley but she resisted i want to see what were up against the soupy darkness didnt give up its ghosts until they were almost upon ruth and toms hiding place emerging from the unfolding black were figures that echoed the transformed victims of the blast ruth had seen in the marketplace the flesh had been stripped from their skulls though the roving eyes remained and into the bone had been embedded studs that created a mosaic effect red and green feathers tufted from the back of a simple circlet headdress they wore only a metal band across their shoulders that ended in a gold amulet and a scarlet and orange cloth bound around their loins and fastened by a thick gold belt a round shield fringed with feathers was strapped to their left forearm and in that hand they carried a wooden club in their right hand they gripped a wooden spear with an obsidian blade what are they aztec mayan incan ruth whispered though her voice was barely audible the head of the nearest warrior cranked around in her direction tom pulled her back into the alley pressed against the wall and listening ruth could tell the warrior was poised to investigate before it could make any move however it was distracted by a man staggering towards the single flickering streetlamp instantly the warrior ran forwards driving his spear into the mans gut and up so that the shocked victim didnt even have time to cry out as he was lifted aloft thrashing wildly he expired within a moment the warrior dumped the body and continued after his comrades the tip of his spear rattling across the cobbles across the street others from the small band entered the buildings and brought screams within seconds though the warriors numbers were small their slaughter was systematic levelling her spear ruth prepared to run across the street until tom grabbed her forcefully take a break from being an idiot he snapped theres one of you and however good you are with that spear and your craft you wont last long out there ruth hesitated then nodded lets find the others as they set off down the alley ruth glanced back once but the dark had already swallowed the street the screams lingered though joining together to become one devastating cry of terror church jerked awake from another searing image of himself lying on a table as pale as death ghostly faces moving around him he had started to believe that the recurring dream was not a dream at all but he refused to examine his nascent suspicions of what it really was every time he skirted it he felt sick to the pit of his stomach a part of him knew the truth he was convinced a part of him was truly afraid exhaustion had left his head nodding as he waited in the rooftop cafe but now he could see that the planned rendezvous would not be happening he was alone in the chill dark with only the poor light from his sword for comfort the sticky jungle smells and the dry desert wind still reached him but he could see nothing beyond the edge of the roof the constant screams and panicked cries rising up from the street made him feel queasy all he could think of was ruth still out there trapped in the dark with the mob and he feared from some of the sounds he heard something deadlier it would have been more sensible to wait there for the others to find their way back to him but his concern for ruth overrode logic and after a while pacing around the table anxiously he made his way cautiously to the door his swords blue fire gave him barely two feet of visibility he was little better than blind in a sprawling city filled with danger inside the building it was still stifling despite the temperature drop and deafening with the cacophony of the many many people crowded into every square foot of the ten floors with only the cafe level kept out of bounds by the brutal guardians employed by the owner trailing his left hand down the dry plaster church slowly descended the stairs to the next level the stink of sweat and other bodily fluids increasing with every step each floor was a single room used for some public function a library a meeting place but their previous purpose had been almost obscured by makeshift beds and ramshackle tenthomes the disturbedhive drone of voices had increased considerably from the last time church had passed through the result he guessed of news of the descending darkness being passed on to those who were inside when it fell reaching the next floor he steeled himself for the arduous task of picking his way through the cluttered mass to the next flight of stairs against the opposite wall tiny lights bobbed here and there candles lanterns small comfort to their owners but no use to him his very first step brought a squeal from someone underfoot igniting a ripple of panic across the room and cries of whats wrong and who is there holding caledfwlch before him like a torch church picked out his steps carefully but the flickering blue light was a beacon of hope to any it fell upon soon pale faces caught in its glare were drawing up and moving in curious and desperate and as hands grasped him and pleas for assistance were issued the desperate yearning for help swept across the room like fire within minutes bodies pressed against church on every side spinning him around shaking his sense of direction fingers tore at his clothes and his skin growing harder and angrier when they received no response at first he entreated people to allow him passage but it proved hopeless and he quickly realised his only option was to put his head down and drive himself through the dense wall of bodies the next flight of stairs was located more by luck than judgement careering down them two steps at a time he almost fell out of control in the dark landing roughly on the next floor the crush of people drawn to him began almost immediately choking with the smell of bodies and the heat church continued to drive his way through the mass halfway across the room amidst the pleadings and cries a familiar ironic voice broke through at his left ear dont you just hate them stupid witless sheep church whirled but all he saw were troubled pale faces and grasping hands the libertarian had retreated back into the dark his heart pounding church renewed his efforts to press through the crowd faces came and went in the tight circle around him rough hands at his back became threatening however fast he searched around the constantly looming bodies in the limited area of visibility he knew he would never be able to see the libertarian until the killer was on top of him he resorted to throwing people roughly out of his way but that only increased the crowds anger and made his passage even more difficult soon they would be attacking him instead of pleading for help he forced himself to calm down the next two floors passed in a blur of tension church knew the libertarian would not have departed he was sickened to realise he was starting to know him as well as he knew himself there was a thick vein of sadism in the pacing of his torment how long could the libertarian hold off before moving in to strike why dont you kill them the sly voice appeared at his right ear church whirled again a glimpse of red eyes disappearing into the dark come closer and see what you get you bastard church yelled the crowd grew more agitated as he pushed forwards the flat of his blade clipped a womans head and she shrieked as if he had stabbed her angry shouts deafened him someone punched his back another tried to grab caledfwlch and he had to throw the man to one side brandishing the sword as a threat it only maddened the crowd further stay calm he told himself any more and theyll rip you limb from limb buying time he apologised to the woman and placated those near to him before moving on three more floors passed slowly but as he entered the eighth floor down he caught a wisp of smoke you bastard it was all church had time to think before the panic started off to his left a dim light flickered growing larger by the second as the blaze spread swiftly through the tinderdry building the jumble of possessions bedding and shelters deafening shrieks became one voice as the entire floor moved as a single entity towards the stairs crushing and trampling church was carried along in the flow choking from the thick acrid smoke as the temperature in the room intensified rapidly soon even the supernatural darkness could not contain the inferno and it blazed brightly as it raced across the room consuming people bringing down roof timbers in a cascade of sparks raising a wall of heat that felled the young and the old as soon as it touched them you dont have to kill them all church raged impotently torn between fury and bitter guilt that an entire building filled with people was being slaughtered just to get at him oh but i do church turned and there was the libertarian his eyes as red as the flames that formed an infernal halo around him almost like looking in a mirror isnt it before church could raise caledfwlch the libertarian jabbed a finger into a pressure point on churchs neck and he slumped to the floor unconscious for once the streets of the court of endless horizons were empty through the maze of dark alleys side streets squares and gardens bearskin and shadow john led veitch and shavi at a breathless pace occasionally bearskin would stop to sniff the air or examine the dusty ground to shavi there was never anything to be seen but bearskin would always nod and move on confidently it was shadow john who forged the way ensuring no obstacles lay in their path so they could advance at speed how the bleedin hell do you do that veitch asked him as they moved quickly through another square packed with market stalls smiling shadow john leaned in and tapped the side of his left eye i am more at home in the shadows than i am in the light he said that is where my true nature becomes clear best not to look too closely shavi closed his ears to the screams that regularly punctured the dark but his alien eye would not allow him any respite it had taken to showing him a constant procession of the spirits of the recently departed as they made their way towards the grim lands in the grey stream he saw the echoes of the terror of their final moments and the dismay and the confusion about their current state so rapidly had they been snatched from life the stream was becoming a flood he wanted to look away but could not the enemy are using the darkness as cover to slaughter in their search for us he said veitch was enough of a friend to catch the hint of distress in shavis words and he gave shavis arm a comforting squeeze we all knew it was going to get a lot worse mate veitch said quietly keep your head up were going to make the bastards pay for what theyre doing though he could not ignore the ghosts shavi responded to veitchs words and refocused on the search bearskin came to a sudden halt i smell smoke he said suspiciously here shadow john had disappeared into the gloom a few paces ahead but he raced back excitedly i think i have found what you are searching for but we have company hurrying close behind him they came to the stone wall of some impressive building its shape and identity lost to the dark a small pitchedroof porch protruded from the wall with doric columns flanking a gate of iron railings three of the aztec warriors were using their spears to try to break the gates padlock round staring eyes roving in their mosaic skulls they turned and brought their spears up sharply to attack what are they shavi asked dont bother getting into details veitch said two categories friend or foe and theyre not friends he drew his sword the blue and black flames fighting for space along the blade shavi thought obliquely that there was more of the blue fire than he had seen before with astonishing speed bearskin loaded the blunderbuss that hung from his belt and fired flames and a cloud of black smoke exploded from the broad barrel and the head of one of the warriors disintegrated the body took a couple more steps before realising it was dead coughing bearskin wafted the smoke away apologies friends of the hunt i must find myself a better gun he shook his head the number of times i have been left with a few flecks of fur and a morsel of meat you never learn shadow john agreed veitch hacked the head and an arm off the second warrior but the third was causing him some difficulty it moved rapidly ducking beneath his attacks and jabbing with the spear the razorsharp obsidian blade sliced through veitchs clothes and drew blood as veitch lunged the warrior whirled the spears blunt end against veitchs calf upending him the spear whirled again ready to plunge into the prostrate veitchs chest shavi grabbed the warriors arm as the warrior prepared to drive his wooden sword into shavis face veitch brought his own sword up into the warriors gut on his feet in an instant veitch rapidly made sure the warrior was dead what are you doing you mad bastard veitch raged at shavi dont ever get involved in a fight again youll get yourself killed sorry i thought i was saving your life shavi replied wryly well dont its my job to get hacked to pieces its your job to be all smart and mystical and bloody confuciuslike taking a deep breath veitch cleaned his sword but thanks anyway shavi grinned perhaps i could get a sword dont push it a loud clank echoed as the padlock dropped to the flags shadow john gave a flourish and swung the gate open whats in there veitch peered into the interior it was even darker than the surrounding city why the labyrinth of the court of endless horizons of course bearskin replied it lies beneath the queens palace every year the court would have a challenge with a prize of unimaginable value for any who could navigate the labyrinth and defeat whatever foul thing the queen had let loose down there youve entered it veitch enquired you know your way through entered the labyrinth bearskin exclaimed i am no fool no one has ever survived the labyrinth shadow john explained and now youre trying to get us to go in there veitch glanced at shavi is it just me or is there a pattern to our lives the scent of the fragile creature was rising up from the catacombs along our way it could only be that somehow she has found her way into the labyrinth through one of its many entrances bearskin explained shavi nodded towards the three corpses lying next to the gate they were trying to get in there the enemy must be after the woman too looks like church was right she is important veitch noted not that i doubted him all right we havent got a choice in we go shadow john shifted uneasily but no one has ever survived the labyrinth the enemy are right behind us veitch said ignoring him its what lies ahead that worries me bearskin said fingering his beard still challenges make us stronger he clapped shadow john on the shoulder and propelled him through the gate dont worry brother i will look out for you and we look out for ourselves veitch said to shavi before following them into the cold dark time seemed to stand still in the constant darkness ruth and tom crept along alleys and down side streets feeling their way constantly listening for the sound of any approach occasionally they would come across groups of the aztec warriors searching the empty streets or raiding a building to slaughter the occupants and then they would be forced to retrace their steps and find another route the warriors were everywhere and progress was excruciatingly slow theyre just running us around like rats she snapped we need to take control perhaps you should conjure up some of that scary craft tom said sardonically draw a little attention to us ruth glared at him i wasnt suggesting that besides i choose the moments when i use my craft its not like some sword you whip out whenever you need it there are repercussions for every use toms eyes glinted in the sapphire light from the tip of her spear always a price to pay ruth hoped he didnt notice the shadow cross her face if she allowed herself a moments introspection she realised she was afraid of what the craft would do if it was unleashed of herself of what she was becoming once before the power had consumed her and she had almost destroyed everyone she loved she could not let that happen again i smell smoke tom said distracted a fire in this situation could be devastating god i hope the others are okay ruth said i hope church was smart enough to stay put he wasnt and it saved his life ruth and tom jumped as laura emerged from the dark at the end of the alley how did you find us ruth asked incredulously blind luck laura glanced at tom all of it bad tom snorted what are you saying about church ruth pressed i just met him back there the idiot couldnt sit tight massive city total darkness everybody split up the first thing you do is wander around calling out names right still she added acidly love makes you do stupid things come on what are you waiting for ruth was embarrassed by the eagerness in her voice okay jesus keep your pants on till we get there laura strode back down the alley with ruth and tom stumbling behind is he all right ruth asked yeah got out just before that cafe building burned down i bumped into him while i was trying to stay one step ahead of those aztec freaks persuaded him to sit still for a while why did he let you go off wandering tom asked suspiciously because grandpa my plant eyes work better than human eyes so shut it ruth noted a harsher edge in lauras mockery the stress was telling she thought though laura would never admit it laura led them down a side alley to a small courtyard surrounded by three buildings as they moved cautiously around the edge they came across church squatting on his haunches against one wall he was holding something in his right hand that ruth couldnt make out thank god she said i was starting to get worried church stood up to accept ruths hug but as she fell into his arms tom called out wait theres something wrong church spun ruth and clamped an arm around her throat one flex of his muscles and he would crush the life from her as she struggled to free herself church craned his head around to peer into her startled eyes and she could see then that though he looked like church down to the smallest detail it was not him his eyes were filled with cruelty and his breath against her cheek smelled of raw meat she was overwhelmed by a sudden feeling of dread so strong it almost made her faint whats going on laura exclaimed tom held her back show yourself he urged the one who was notchurch held out his right hand and ruth could now see that he clutched a smoking mirror a glimmer of halfrecognition crossed toms face as he turned the mirror the hand and arm holding it became that of a jungle cat black spots against white and orange fur a jaguar ruth thought and then it changed again into a human hand but with grey skin stretched tightly across bone afraid to look at the face but unable to prevent herself ruth glanced back and was convulsed with fear it was like looking into the face of a corpse the skin hanging in tatters from decomposing flesh unmistakable feline qualities in the shape of the eyes and the tufts of fur clinging on to the skulllike pate black lines pulsed beneath the surface of his form the sign of the controlling power of the anubis box another of the gods the void and janus had chosen in the age of the sun your kind knew me as tezcatlipoca he said three spheres do i bestride he raised the mirror skywards the night death in all its forms and then he directed a lopsided grimacesmile towards tom and laura and temptation ive heard of you tom said unable to hide his fear a shapeshifter you killed the caretaker i hold this city now in my grasp as i have held so many others in times long gone this night will never lift death will never leave this place he tightened his grip around ruths throat forcing her to the brink of blacking out and soon one more will join deaths long parade church came round tied to a chair in a hot room filled with scores of sputtering lamps together they just about held back the dark that swelled in the corners of the room it was spartan with bare boards plaster walls and only an empty chair across from church his head ached and his throat was unbearably dry it took him a second or two to recall where he had been when he was last conscious and another second to recognise where he must be now where are you he called out right here the voice came from behind him slowly the libertarian sauntered into view his sunglasses reflecting the glittering points of lamplight he spun around the empty chair and sat astride it i must have seen a lot of bad eighties movies church said the manufactured flamboyance evaporated and for once the libertarian stared at church with cold contempt i am not you thats not what you said in beijing im better right now im what you could never dream of being in the same way that i could never imagine being you the libertarian continued to stare church was puzzled by the barest hint of emotion in a voice that previously had been all roleplaying and he had the strangest impression although he did not know why that behind the libertarians sunglasses there were tears in his eyes so youve brought me here to debate our different philosophies the libertarian laughed the facade returned oh whats the point in that any difference will be over very shortly not going to happen yet here i am and if there was even the slightest chance of you continuing down the primrose path with your unrealistically idealised worldview i would not be standing before you he waved a finger slowly at church to emphasise his words thousands of threads over thousands of years are finally tying together oh if you could only see the full extent of the tapestry you would marvel at the wonder of it all the rich complexity i have the luxury of standing on the mountaintop and seeing how a stitch here and another there can create the world we want while you are mired in the swamp swatting away insects and wondering when the rain will come with as little obvious effort as possible church strained at his bonds the libertarian smiled i know what youre doing i remember that quite clearly as i remembered exactly where you would be this day when my agent brought down the darkness i find im remembering more and more the closer we get to the point of transformation his lips quirked as if he was tasting something unpleasant a small price to pay i suppose for being able to interact with you at these vital junctures but there are still a lot of variables arent there or you wouldnt be bothering with me these xfactors the little pushes and shoves im getting from the oldest things in the land forget about those deluded creatures the libertarian snapped their days are numbered as you are aware we have already eradicated one of them the rest will follow you cannot understand the magnitude of what we have achieved the oldest things in the land playing their little games since your world was built out of shit and piss always a part of everything always powerful and now they are falling before us one by one by one he stood up and bowed our brilliance incarnate i thank you what killed the part of you that cared church asked sickened you think i am the villain of the piece i am not there are no villains in life my young jack churchill nor any heroes there are only people who want the things you want and people who want the opposite at the moment you are caught up with your vision that people would be happier if they were completely free that in itself is a trap the choices the striving they only bring misery no better to be happy with your lot to be content and at peace the mundane spell the lack of meaning in everyday existence surely that is a small price to pay for being content war corruption abuse sickness all small prices when seen from the view of humanity as a whole they do not affect everyone most people have steady lives church thought for a moment then said dont you miss sinatra pausing the libertarian appeared to be struggling to recall something just beyond his grasp a shadow crossed his face fly me to the moon how about your parents faces on a summer day when you were a kid dont you miss ruth no the libertarian whirled his features fixed with anger i thought i had already strangled the life from her in greece thats how little i care dont you miss the magic jack church said quietly in a rage the libertarian threw the chair to one side with such force that it shattered into pieces hurling himself at church murderously he pushed his furious face so close that it filled churchs vision when he spoke each word had the stab of an assassins knife i know how much you love her i know she is the prop that holds your fragile life together and i know that she is the thing holding you back from reaching your destiny which is why i now have her church flinched as if hed been hit do i miss ruth ill show you first im going to torture her till the pain blooms in her face and she can see no good in life and then im going to murder her slowly and agonisingly and im going to dump her body somewhere you will never find it no chance for mourning no closure your ravens will peck away at her flesh and then her bones will yellow and crumble and she will be gone as if she never existed tears stung churchs eyes im going to kill you the libertarian smiled thats the spirit when night fell across the great plain before the court of the soaring spirit the enemy began its advance lost to the gloom the first sign that decebalus had of their movement was mounting vibrations in the ground growing stronger like the first tremors of an earthquake the weather had worsened something to do with the abilities of the remaining riotbeast he guessed and now torrential rain lashed their ranks and turned the ground around them to a sea of mud they will try to overwhelm us by sheer numbers he said as he peered into the dark i am surprised they did not try it before perhaps they wisely fear your ultimate deterrent lugh responded behind him the silent unmoving ranks of tuatha de danaan warriors glowed a dull gold decebalus eyed him askance you know of that i am a master tactician after all it is what i would have done but would you have been prepared to use it thankfully i will never have to find out that is now your burden brother of dragons as a low mournful call rolled out across the great plain from somewhere in the vicinity of the city walls lugh started and looked around hopefully my brother one of the most powerful of the tuatha de danaan missing for so long is he joining the fray when he saw decebaluss puzzled look he added in the time of the tribes he was known as cernunnos but your kind have a great many names for him as befits his status the green man jack o the green he walks in the beating heart of nature and pulses with the lifeblood of existence of course i have heard of him decebalus said he has helped the brothers and sisters of dragons many times though i must say he has never seemed quite like you golden ones my brother is like us and is also greater than us his influence straddles many great dominions as befits one of the oldest things in the land he is one of those strange creatures and also one of you the oldest things in the land are a higher force and they draw to them those who can help shepherd the ways of existence a force for good then a force for a plan that transcends the concepts of good and evil that fragile creatures love to clutch to their breasts for comfort the universe is not simple brother of dragons and its pattern is lost to all of us the mournful howl rolled out again but was subsumed by the rising tramp of thousands of feet and the pounding of the downpour rain sluicing from his head decebalus said nearly here now flickering lights could now be made out in the dark the torches of the enemy stretching as far as decebalus could see in a horseshoe formation from foothill to foothill around the city closing in nowhere to run you are a strange being you sound as if you are almost enjoying this desperate situation lugh said we only truly find out what it means to be fragile creatures when we are closest to death your men are ready for the assault of course this will be as glorious as the second battle of magh tuireadh when i slew the great fomorii god balor then it is time to engage the enemy pulling his sodden cloak around him decebalus strode back to his own ranks where a bonfire hissed and crackled and pitchsoaked torches struggled to stay alight in the storm the brothers and sisters of dragons sheltered patiently in the tents looking out of the huge unfurled doors towards the enemy as decebalus moved past them nodding to the leader of each unit he saw how alike their expressions were all of them laced with fear all trying to hide it preparing themselves mentally for the battle knowing that death was likely through it all the pendragon spirit blazed in their eyes next to the fire where everyone could see him he announced loudly the time has come we go now to meet the enemy our job is to harry down the middle we strike fast retreat regroup strike again we have speed and skill on our side on your left flank will be the tuatha de danaan welldrilled relentless they will find their line and hold it until they or the enemy are gone on your right flank will be the brute force we need to blow the enemy asunder the asgardians have more power than sense a laugh ran through the group and we will use that along with a few surprises to keep the enemy on their toes raising his sword high he shouted we are brothers and sisters of dragons though we die we live on in the pendragon spirit what we fight for can never be destroyed this day this battle is the reason for our existence two thousand years of history leading to this point our brothers and sisters who are not here are counting on us to drive the enemy back to buy them time to save all existence we shall not fail do you hear me we shall not fail his voice became a roar that soared up to the heavens and it was joined by all the brothers and sisters of dragons one voice of defiance carrying out across the plain as he turned they strode out from the tents behind him those who had taken the role of cavalry to the horses the others forming ranks for the ground battle the fear was gone as if it had been washed away by the rain there was only determination come what may decebalus summoned one of the brothers of dragons andy cairns a scottish archer with black wavy hair and a sword scar on his right cheek andrew prepare your archers a moment later a hail of flaming arrows soared across the plain igniting a liquid that math had prepared in his tower and which decebalus had spread in a huge defensive arc around their forces a wall of fire rose up twenty feet into the air math had told him it would burn for at least an hour within fifteen minutes the first lines of the enemy attempted to break through the fire some continued aflame for several paces before they collapsed others fell in the midst of the inferno but wave after wave followed reminding decebalus of the red ants he had seen in the forests of dacia when he was boy nothing would deter them soon the bodies had piled so high they covered the fireliquid and the ranks behind rolled over the top of them with a roar decebalus signalled the attack to his left the tuatha de danaan washed out in a golden wave silent focused frightening in their intensity the brothers and sisters of dragons were only a step behind at the heart of them decebalus swelled with pride swinging his axe with abandon as he forced his way to the front within moments they crashed against the rocks of the enemy and decebalus was hurled into such a frenzy of flashing weapons and flailing bodies that it was impossible to see anything beyond a zone of a few square inches noise filled his world the endless shriek of metal on metal the grunts of exertion battle cries and the screams of the wounded and dying tossed around by a heavy swell he never rested for a second swinging his axe into heads shoulderblades arms bodies crushed tight on all sides no thoughts came there was only time for instinct the ranks of the enemy in front of him comprised the lamentbrood dead beings from numerous races with swords axes and spears rammed into their limbs so that they themselves became weapons that could not be killed for whom wounds meant nothing the only way to stop them was to dismember them gradually his thought process adjusted to the blistering pace of battle a sublime state where everything slowed and he floated amidst the chaos able to examine the rich detail and reflect blood sprayed in beautiful arcs raindrops on armour glittered like diamonds blades caught the torchlight as they whirled trailing gold underfoot the ground churned became liquid a swamp of gore and mud sucking at his legs his axe removed the top of a skull then spun and came down to split the face below as the lamentbrood warrior dropped to his knees another was already taking his place to his left decebalus saw a sister of dragons battling furiously glistening black hair slick from the rain as she was dragged away by the flow of battle he tried to remember her name an unusual name it was important that everyone was remembered and seen as individuals sacrificing all not as a resource to be used up to win demelza he recalled monfries he nodded happy that he had marked her place in his mind to his right three lamentbrood warriors surrounded a brother of dragons his ringletted hair and beard plastered with blood he had no chance but he kept fighting to the last decebalus struggled to recall the name cursing himself furiously until it came stephen he said aloud harding and then aula was at his side in the white and silver armour of one of the tuatha de danaan courts her blond hair darkened by the rain here he bellowed you are no warrior with her short sword she hacked off the arm of one of the lamentbrood as it attempted to drive a spear into decebaluss chest answer enough she said not quite but it will do for now even an uneducated barbarian like yourself deserves someone at your back they exchanged a brief look that said more than they ever had or ever would and then the battle sucked them in once more for fifteen minutes of furious exchanges it appeared as if the brothers and sisters of dragons and the tuatha de danaan were making no headway against the constant stream of the enemy for every one that fell two more took their place decebalus saw redcaps with their clothes of human skin unrelenting machines of muscle gristle and bone that exhibited tremendous power and endurance there were the baobhan sith shrieking spectral figures that shifted shape before attempting to tear out the throats of those nearby and the gehennis shades flapping like sheets in the wind but with more devastating substance than they presented to the world towering giants swung clubs that reduced a man to a red mist while other grotesqueries that he did not recognise ripped apart with claws and teeth the explosive bolt of lightning crashed into the enemy ranks at the point he had planned when overconfidence had taken the edge off their fighting skills body parts rained down from a blackened circle inside which everything had been incinerated more bolts blasted down at random bringing fear to the disrupted enemy ranks decebalus caught the briefest glimpse of mjolnir smashing through bodies before returning to the hand of its owner who brought down another lightning bolt before directing the storm towards the enemy decebalus grinned the gods had arrived laughing like a madman his scarred hairy body completely naked tyr waded through the ranks chopping down the lamentbrood like saplings beside him the slavic god perkunas wielded a throwing axe that sent heads flying in unison while ares lost to his bloodlust had to be continually redirected towards the enemy so that he did not attack his own side on a murderous rampage the aztecs huitzilopochtli tore out the hearts of the living enemy by plunging his hands into their chests and the caribbean war god ogoun concentrated on the lamentbrood with his machete reducing them to quivering chunks of decomposing flesh the gods were a whirlwind of fury and righteous vengeance and every time decebalus thought he had seen the last descend into the fray another dropped from the skies or drove a wide bloody path through the ground troops hundreds of the enemy were falling by the minute and despite their numbers they were in disarray and being driven back step by step lugh was at the forefront of the tuatha de danaan serious and dedicated and though covered in gore he still glowed like the sun behind him the army of all the courts fought on shoulder to shoulder for the first time since they had left their four fabled homes about a third of the brothers and sisters of dragons had fallen but the rest drove on with renewed energy faces alight with the pendragon spirit for the next halfhour as the enemy was decimated decebalus finally began to believe that despite the odds they could win the first sign that events had begun to change was a sudden retreat by the enemy that left av of unoccupied ground decebalus signalled for the army of dragons to proceed with caution it looked to him as if the enemy was encouraging them to pursue with abandon and he never did anything any enemy wanted silence fell across the enemy ranks the only sound the beating of the rain on the sea of mud what are they doing aula asked waiting decebalus replied after a moment the enemy ranks parted and a tenfoottall figure stepped through his identity at first cloaked by the storm as he neared decebalus recognised him from the description church had given during one of the numerous briefings brutish features part pig part ass added an incongruous aspect to the elegant clothes of the ancient egyptian ruling class seth god of evil and the desert raised a staff mounted with a single golden eye and a flurry of snow swirled around him fragile creatures his booming voice sounded like a boulder dragged across gravel my people were great and wondrous shining stars in the vast firmament of existence yet you destroyed them and in your arrogance you thought you could do it with impunity he is talking about the devastation wrought by church and the others in the great pyramid aula whispered decebalus barely heard her already his tacticians mind was racing ahead weighing potential options as he tried to evaluate what seth would do get back he said loudly after a few seconds before bellowing retreat the word had barely left his mouth when seth raised his other hand to reveal an object that radiated a brilliant white light there was a second when all the sound appeared to have been drained from the world and then a shimmering glassy wave washed out from seth and the entire battlefield lit up growing brighter and brighter until it felt as if the sun had crashed to the ground and that was the last thing any of them saw in the grim lands there was little to mark the passage of time sometimes the quality of light would be a shade darker sometimes it would have a silvery glint as though night and day were coming and going beyond the constantly rolling mists everywhere was grey all the time it left the spirits dampened and gradually leached the energy from both mallory and caitlin each incline became a little harder to climb each graveyard navigated with an increasing number of rest stops until they started to fear that the mood of the place would eventually bring a critical lethargy that would leave them drifting and aimless like the lands regular inhabitants sitting on the dusty gravel with her back to a tomb marked with the legend et in arcadia ego caitlin examined the flickering blue flame of the wayfinder and tried to ignore the feeling that if she closed her eyes she would sleep for ever i wonder if hal is aware of whats happening she mused sitting beneath a carved skull on an adjoining tomb mallory lazily drew a cross in the dust with the heel of his boot that was quite a sacrifice he made imagine being a part of the blue fire a part of everything there is and was and then giving it all up to lock yourself in that little lantern to guide our way it must have been like being god and then quitting to become an ant you wouldnt expect anything less hes always been one of us of our five she winced and corrected herself our four i wish wed got a chance to know him better its even more of a sacrifice than that mallory continued he can be destroyed while hes in the wayfinder hed escaped from death and now hes put himself back in the game thats brave the flame continued to point the way across the last few yards of the graveyard and out into the wilderness beyond where callow was on reconnaissance does this place make you think of your husband and boy mallory asked ive never stopped thinking of them not in a morbid way i remember the good times and what they meant to me and i know were going to be together again some day have you ever lost someone you love yeah he paused before realising i just dont know who the thought clearly troubled him so much that caitlin didnt press chewing on his lip absently he slipped back into a deep reflection in the silence that followed caitlin became aware of the presence of her other selves deep in the back of her head their whispering always ebbed and flowed like the pulse of her blood but now she could hear brigids voice growing more insistent listening intently she absently spoke the words the second they came to her hes coming run mallory started whos coming i i dont know they were surprised to see callow watching them from the shelter of a nearby mausoleum how long have you been there mallory snapped no time for that now callow replied obsequiously listen carefully and i think youll hear to whom the little miss is referring dimly the scrape of feet on gravel filtered through the blanketing mist moving quickly and silently mallory and caitlin kept low using the tombs and mausoleums for cover as the mist shifted across a wide expanse of statuary they saw the hortha stalking steadily in their direction what does it take to stop him mallory said incredulously he doesnt look like hes been hurt at all yet that thing in the mausoleum was caitlins words dried up as she considered the implications of her notion how are we going to stop him mallory theres no point thinking about it now we just need to keep a few steps ahead of him but well have to rest some time maybe well think up a brilliant idea on the way returning silently to callow they motioned for him to follow as they left the graveyard behind heading down the rough shale into a bleak landscape of boulders and stones that reminded them of photos theyd seen of the surface of mars after what they estimated to have been an hour but may only have been a quarter of that time the going became harder with sheets of shattered slate underfoot that they had to travel over carefully to avoid turning an ankle or cutting themselves on the razorsharp edges this sloped down to an area of towering rock formations that merged until they were moving along the bottom of a deep chasm over large fallen rocks through the mist they could just make out holes cut into the walls above their heads more tombs mallory guessed caitlin thought she glimpsed a head looking down at them out of one of the holes but the mist closed over it before she was sure a little further on she definitely did see a figure pulling itself out of one of the dark spaces to watch them pass yeah i see them too mallory whispered to her before she could warn him the dead are an inquisitive bunch callow said they halfremember what it was like to be alive and always want to recall more he glanced at the soaring rock walls probably best not to get caught by them down here theyre not at all like me witty vivacious company they can be a little jealous of what you have and they have lost how long till we get out of here then mallory asked sharply only forwards just a little way now if we are lucky he added im starting to question your value as a guide mallory said a thud resonated behind them and another the dead dropping to the rocks from their resting places soon the steady tramp of feet followed them now whenever caitlin glanced up she saw the grey desiccated bodies of the dead levering themselves out of their holes on skeletal arms some plummeting directly down others climbing slowly and steadily on nearinvisible handholds lets pick up the pace mallory said by then the footsteps behind them suggested a small crowd others loomed out of the mists on either side as they passed their hands grasping for the mercurial life men women children some naked others in rags or shrouds or wormeaten funeral suits caitlin was most disturbed by their gaze heavy unblinking not intelligent but not stupid either they were the eyes of animals with instincts for survival some quicker than others she started to wonder about the mythology of the place did everyone pass through when they died the dead she saw around her didnt appear pleasant was this instead some kind of purgatory if so what did that imply for a system of judgement for god the religious teachings of her childhood came back haunting her with the mystery troubling her as much as they comforted her could grant and liam be somewhere in this world if not where were they as the dead began to crowd along the walls on either side of the chasm caitlin grew more anxious they had the look of wary dogs about them docile to all appearances but capable of turning savage at any moment mallory kept them moving at a rapid pace but increasingly she felt hands on her clothes fingers flexing as if preparing to grab the drywood touch of dead skin brushing her arms goosebumps ran up her back the path between the rows of the dead was growing narrower as they drew in on either side and what then would they move in on all sides driving those fingers through her pink skin to investigate the mysteries that lay beneath one woman with lank brown hair and a head that lolled onto her chest lunged suddenly and grabbed caitlins wrist but the grip was weak and she shook it off easily yet it was a warning sign mallory i think we have a problem she said how much further callow mallory barked oh not far now a hundred yards perhaps callow said without looking back caitlin wondered why that was he usually underpinned every line with a studied expression demanding sympathy pushing through a flurry of mist they came up hard against a dead end trapped in a cleft as the rock walls converged caitlin looked back fearfully at the dead slowly advancing oh dear callow said i appear to have missed a turning you idiot mallory faced the shambling figures as he drew llyrwyn they stopped and stared dumbly at the faint blues flames sputtering and fizzing along the blade back off mallory said is there any point talking to them oh yes callow replied they hear they understand though it might take a while for their longdulled senses to flicker into life see here callow edged behind caitlin and shouted look at them pink and alive they make a mockery of you stop them mallory rounded on callow but by then he had one arm around caitlins throat and a razor blade plucked from the turnup of his dirty trousers gripped between the fingers of his other hand deep in her head caitlin felt the morrigan unfurl her wings and a surge of darkness sweep forwards caitlin elbowed callow in his gut he let out a pained gasp of air but instantly slashed her cheek with the razor and then pressed it to her jugular caitlin cried out as blood washed down from the wound but callow only dug the razor deeper youll be dead before you can release whats inside you he whispered in her ear i cut one of your kind before and i am quite prepared to do so again my shiny friend here can conduct a nice dance across your face and still slit that white throat before you have time to move you will die ugly and that thought will eat away at you in this dismal afterlife let her go mallory ignored the dead gathering at his back he raised the sword towards callows throat oh the bravado of the heroic man so false what can you do i am already dead make me more dead it is the fault of your sickening brotherhood that i am here and i have nurtured the desire for the dish best served cold for a long long time give me the lantern dont mallory caitlin cried she saw him waver you need it to carry on you dont need me oh but he does callow said slyly ive seen it in his eyes as we journeyed together knights of the road shoulder to shoulder he loves you perhaps not with the romance of a sexual partner but with the deeper love of a kindred spirit a friend you would support to the end and this most certainly is the end mallory no caitlin could now see in his eyes the same thing as callow and she recognised the same rich depth of feeling in herself a friend to the end a deep and complex love why did that have to be the weapon that ruined them mallory slowly held out the wayfinder for callow to snatch with his free hand my little ears hear all sorts of things he said about the genie inside this thing for one a vulnerable genie whose destruction would strike to the heart of the sickening brothers and sisters of dragons caitlin winced at the devastation in mallorys face in a cold murderous tone mallory said if you hurt him ill find some way to make you suffer of course you will he smiled mockingly now i know how sly you people are and i see that pigsticker youre waving around so with a flourish he slashed caitlin again missing the vein more by accident than design but cutting her deeply enough that the blood gushed thrusting her towards mallory he gripped the handle of the lantern between his teeth and leaped up the wall clutching on to barely visible handholds before propelling himself through a tunnel that lay halfhidden in the mists just above their heads catching caitlin in his arms mallory desperately tried to staunch the flow of blood not again he muttered without really knowing why the dead shuffled forwards their eyes gleaming at the sight of caitlins lifeblood mallory levelled llyrwyn at them ill cut you to pieces he said trying to keep the emotion from his voice do you understand that ill cut you to pieces i understand the voice echoed from further along the floor of the chasm though mallory knew who it was before the mist unfurled a wall of the dead separated the two of them but the hortha simply grabbed the one nearest to him extended his finger of blackthorn and rammed it through the temple into whatever remained of the brain the dead man slumped to his knees and the hortha moved on to the next caitlin found herself slipping to the edge of consciousness as the morrigan fell back into the dark but she could see mallory fighting with his dilemma the hortha was unbeatable but too close for them to make an adequate escape in her severely wounded condition leave me she croaked no never ever again as he searched around for a solution while trying to hold the dead back and keep caitlin from bleeding out his eyes gleamed with a dawning notion see him hes destroying you he yelled at the dead he hates you he laughs at what youve lost hes going to make you suffer even more than you already have is that fair you have to stop him the dead paused and turned as one fixing their unblinking stare on the hortha as he punctured another head and discarded what remained not caring whether they saw him he wants to make you suffer more mallory shouted the dead moved tentatively at first but with gathering speed as mallorys words lit up their sluggish minds with grasping hands they pressed towards the hortha and although the creature tried to drive through the flow there were too many of them they began to tear at his form ripping away the blackthorn as fast as it could regrow searching for the mystery of his life finally the hortha went down under a frenzy of tearing mallory tied a handkerchief across caitlins wounds and slung her over his shoulder grunting with strain and exhaustion he clambered up the rock wall and stepped into the tunnel sparing one quick backward glance at the churning pool of grey dead flesh the tunnel was only short the pearly mist gleaming at the end you love me and i love you caitlin said dreamily platonic deep youre a sensitive soul mallory a good man save your strength he said embarrassed thats why i love you he shifted her weight into his arms to carry her more easily and she could see the worry in his face am i dying not yet im going to sort out that wound when we get out of here but after that shaking his head he looked away she knew what he was thinking how could they find callow and save hal in this terrible bleak land how could they find the extinction shears stumbling out of the tunnel mouth mallory came to a sudden halt her head spinning caitlin craned her neck to see what had brought him up so sharply waiting a little way down the slope on the backs of their strange mounts were the brothers and sisters of spiders their dead expressions grim weve been waiting for you etain said coldly chapter seven the labyrinth caitlin had slipped into unconsciousness laying her still form on the rocky ground in the tunnel mouth mallory prepared for what he fully expected to be his last fight he had heard enough about the ferocity of the brothers and sisters of spiders to know he stood little chance of defeating the four of them on horseback sheathe your sword etain said in a low grating voice ryan veitch sent us back to this dismal place to give you whatever aid we could mallory tried to read her dead face but even looking beneath two thousand years of scars and burning it was impossible to read any emotion in her features i thought you couldnt talk he said here in the grim lands amongst our own kind we are at home her voice suddenly came alive with a shocking bitterness we are allowed some small comforts to endure this place branwen climbed down from her mount and approached in a jerky manner as if consciously forcing her limbs to move let me help the sister of dragons reluctant at first mallory eventually allowed her to treat caitlins wounds with herbal creams from a bag at her waist which she applied liberally until the blood flow stopped i tended ryan veitchs wounds many times across the great gulf of the years she said he cared for us when we were abandoned by all and we cared for him she swivelled her head creakily towards etain some more than others i dont trust you mallory said i heard how you helped veitch kill all those brothers and sisters of dragons we were brothers and sisters of dragons before we sided with the army of the ten billion spiders etain interrupted indeed we were the very first to carry the pendragon spirit into your lineage we followed ryan veitch wherever he led even into the ranks of the devourer of all things said owein his muscular thickset frame badly scarred he would have died for us we were his only friends mallory didnt think it wise to point out how tragically pathetic it was that a man could only count a bunch of dead things as friends instead he searched for some sign of the direction callow had taken if youre here to help we need firstly to get away from here as quickly as possible because i have this sickening feeling that even a collection of george romero extras are not going to be able to stop the thing on our trail and secondly to find the bastard who did that to caitlin and took the wayfinder how long would callow wait before he decided to destroy the lamp and hal a while he guessed callow was cowardly and would want to put a lot of distance between himself and mallory in case the dead were only a temporary setback tannis who had a warriors build and a leaders demeanour said chillingly nothing escapes us then lets get moving i want my hands around callows throat and i want it now with caitlins arms tied around tanniss chest to prevent her slipping and with mallory behind etain they set off into the mist after a mile or so a gentle stony incline gave way to a steaming foulsmelling marsh the brackish water gleaming with oily rainbows here etain slowed her mount to pick a careful course along grassy ridges bordered by thick yellow reeds occasionally lights glimmered briefly away in the mists what are they mallory asked the mood had become even more oppressive ignore them etain responded trapped here are the spirits of those who dedicated themselves to work instead of humanity they are as jealous and bitter as anything else in the grim lands and they would like nothing more than to entice you into the sucking bog bubbles burst intermittently on the surface of the pools deep bottomless and filled with razorworms that will feed on your flesh and bones for eternity mallory studied her for a while and tried to imagine what she had been like when she was alive im betting youd rather be with veitch than here with me his affections have turned to another and why should he not find interest in one of his own rather than a dead thing she added pointedly here he was king worshipped by the inhabitants of the grim lands because he understood them and he cared because he has died and returned thats not as rare as you might think he understands what it is like to be an outsider youre saying thats a good enough motivation to follow him into a life he paused couldnt think of a better phrase of massmurder i would follow him to the end of the world which is pretty much where we are he is a good man whatever you might think of him but he is as flawed as all mortal beings and sometimes flaws get the better of us of you it is a constant battle and judgement should not come easy we judge ourselves and we do what we can to make amends for our failings even when there isnt a hope in hell of righting the balance you speak from experience mallory didnt respond pointing to the path ahead etain said the one you call callow has passed this way and recently we will soon be upon him good mallory glanced back halfexpecting to see the hortha close behind sometimes you can run as much as you want and never get away he said to himself they rode in silence for another fifteen minutes while mallory cast an uneasy eye towards the swamp every now and then he thought he saw things moving in the black water eventually they came to a halt for several minutes tannis searched the narrow paths amongst the pools before returning to the group the trail has faded he said i thought you said you could track anything mallory protested we can given time sometimes the trail can be lost but by careful scrutiny of the surrounding area it can be located again we havent got that kind of time frustrated mallory jumped down and paced the area of solid ground until caitlin summoned him over well find him she said hoarsely some of her strength had already returned before he destroys hal this is all my fault why did i trust him we both trusted him dont blame yourself he hurt you ill be fine your face mallory traced the line of the wound across her cheek beneath the dressing branwen had applied caitlin grabbed his hand and held it tight a battle scar theres a part of me that will enjoy having that in her eyes mallory saw a deep shadow start to grow shes coming mallory caitlin said quietly and shes not going to see a sister treated so badly therell be a price to pay trust me on that the shadow filled caitlins eyes and moved out into her face the morrigan smiled deep in the heart of the forbidding swamplands callow finally paused and removed the lantern from inside his jacket he was afraid of retribution his knowledge of the persistence of brothers and sisters of dragons was extensive but he was filled with an eager glee for his own retribution sitting crosslegged next to the soupy water he examined the wayfinders blue flame oh the wonder of it all a genie in the lamp and a brother of dragons to boot can you hear me little man he roughly rattled the lantern in front of his face sadly i am a mortal like any other and prone to the melancholies of all men and yes the desire for a touch of revenge for being so badly treated and i have been oh how i have been during that terrible age of misrule i was manipulated possibly brutally coerced into helping those misshapen monsters the fomorii and did the brothers and sisters of dragons forgive and forget did they respond to my plight and offer a friendly hand in answer to my humble admission of my wrongs and my plaintive desire for redemption no they punished me and brutalised me and eventually took my sad sad life and these are champions of existence how ironic it is through their cruel machinations that events have conspired to keep me trapped in this hideous place he paused slyly or should i say your machinations it is unfortunate that you will have to pay the price for their sins callow did an excited jig before calming himself now how should i do it fling the lantern into one of these sucking pools and watch it disappear for ever then you would understand the kind of purgatory i have experienced for so long or should i smash it and watch the flame flicker and die he considered this for a moment and smiled triumphantly i think that would set my world alight drawing one of the many razor blades he had secreted about his person he attempted to carve his name into the lantern but he could make no mark on the shiny surface and the razor blunted within seconds he tossed it angrily into the water where something snapped and spat i was just a humble knight of the road when i met that overinflated pecksniff jack churchill he muttered to himself no harm to man nor beast lover of the byways lover of people a helping hand to all i met on my way and look what he did to me callow laid the wayfinder on the ground took a running jump and slammed both booted feet upon it a peal of thunder was accompanied by a fizz of blue sparks he repeated the assault three times before examining it again the lantern was dented and the glass on one side was cracked once more he muttered this may well look like a lantern but i know its true shape is different from what i see yet here in the grim lands it is as vulnerable as anything from the places where the living roam yes i think once more will do ill say goodbye to you now oh genie enjoy the great hereafter laying the lantern down once again he paced out a long runup and then with a grim smile hurled himself at the wayfinder at the point when callow hung above the lantern a column of blue fire engulfed him and hurled him back to the edge of the swamp water callow let out a highpitched shocked scream it was only when he picked himself up that he realised the flames were cold and had done little more than propel him away so its a fight you want he said drawing up his sleeves well see how long you can keep that up in this place the blue flash lit up the swamplands even through the mist followed closely by the echo of callows scream across the black water caitlin broke off her examination of the myriad paths through the swamp and removed the axe from its harness on her back etain tannis owein and branwen were already climbing into their saddles as mallory growled with any luck somethings eaten him that flash it was blue fire caitlin said coldly mallory didnt respond another blue flash filtered through the mists but this time it was accompanied by a shout of gleeful anger callow was so engrossed in his vigorous attempts to destroy the lantern that he didnt hear their approach until the last with a girlish shriek he booted the lantern towards the deep water and ran diving at full run mallorys fingertips skimmed the wayfinder before it splashed into the depths spinning it upwards where it threatened to escape him again scrabbling wildly he eventually snagged it and hugged it to his chest sorry hal he whispered i wont let you out of my grasp again with powerful strides caitlin caught up with callow in seconds brutally kicking his legs out from under him his frightened pleas quickly turned into sly attempts to explain his actions but when he saw the dark fury in caitlins eyes his voice faded away i bleed you dont she said so how do i get my revenge against a dead thing she pressed the blade of her axe against his face i could chop you into tiny chunks but would there be any conscious thought left in them to suffer being in this place is suffering enough mmmmaam callow stuttered but it doesnt make me feel any better wheres the justice in that wheres the lesson learned please callow called out to mallory have a heart i made a mistake thats all you are brothers and sisters of dragons you celebrate all that is good about life distractedly mallory polished the lantern true but unluckily for you were not churchs group theyve got compassion in spades existence brought us together with specific qualities in mind theyre the good guys were the hard bastards he gave callow a brutal smile all except hal and im betting hes not feeling very sympathetic towards you right now callow let out a small whimper caitlin dragged him to etain and retrieved a rope from her saddle his searing cries echoed across the entire swamp as caitlin bound his wrists tightly behind his back looped the rope around his ankles then threw the other end over the branch of one of the spindly trees overhanging the swamp with a jerk she whipped callows feet out from under him and suspended him an inch above the water where snapping shapes swam hungrily just beneath the surface he cried and pleaded until his throat was raw and when he finally stopped caitlin said i think the best thing would be to leave you here where you cant do any more harm with a few friends for company another jerk of the rope plunged callows head into the water up to the bridge of his nose the water boiled around him as the razorworms plunged into his eyes and ears burrowing and eating for what could be eternity half an hour later they could still hear his terrible screams as they made their way out of the swamp and onto a barren plain once again following the lanterns blue flame in the hard silvery gleam of dawn decebalus came round deep in the mire of the battlefield the storm had ended and a strained quiet lay across the great plain punctuated by the occasional cry all around were scattered dismembered corpses of both allies and enemy it took a second or two for decebaluss thoughts to flicker into some semblance of cohesion and then another few seconds to realise he was alive and intact his first thought was how seth had been prepared to devastate his own side to achieve a minor advantage the remnants of the onceenormous enemy force trailed across the battlefield towards the city in small pockets pausing occasionally to slay a survivor they skirted much of the area where the gods had fought decebalus guessed that if he lived most of the gods would have survived too seth would want to achieve his aims before they returned to the fray drawing his strength back into his shaky limbs decebalus was gripped by a flash of memory keeping low he desperately searched amongst the fallen overturning bodies to peer into blood and mudstained faces finally he located aula buried under a heap of dismembered lamentbrood she was deathly pale her eyes closed her blond hair matted with gore decebalus muttered a brief prayer before taking her wrist and locating a thready pulse relief flooded through him the pendragon spirit would work its magic she would survive bowing his head to her chest he closed his eyes and remembered dacia so far away in time and space he wished he could have shown aula the beauty of the forests on a summers twilight the great river at dawn with the sun glinting off the water and the smell of a new day rising gently he kissed the back of her hand so many things unsaid so many emotions buried deep in his heart that in his rough ways he had never been able to express but she knew he was sure kissing her on the lips he recovered her with the bodies to protect her from the enemys sight as he prepared to crawl towards the city he caught sight of a small group of redcaps moving his way emitting their deep throaty growl as they tore chunks of flesh off dead limbs if he stood and fought it would attract other enemies to him and he would not last a moment but there was no way he could escape the redcaps advance without being seen crawling on his belly he rounded a larger pile of corpses to find better shelter where he could gather his thoughts nearby two brothers of dragons slumped together bleeding heavily from fatal wounds decebalus had nursed high hopes for both of them jim davey softly spoken and with shavis empathic nature and michael koefman a messyhaired former musician decebalus crawled over to them what kind of thing destroys its own side to get at us blood leaked from the corner of michaels mouth as he spoke neither had long left something that does not care in the slightest about life he replied i have to get to the city before the enemys bastards reach the caraprix yet there are redcaps nearby who will see me when i move he let the words hang understanding what he was asking the two brothers of dragons exchanged a fleeting glance of acceptance for their fate and then jim said quietly you can count on us you are good men both i will make sure you are remembered decebaluss farewell nod couldnt begin to convey what he truly felt and he crawled away quickly not long after he heard them both begin to shout loudly the roar of the redcaps followed instantly and when he heard their savage attack decebalus ran for the city the remnants of the shattered gates hung raggedly from the twisted hinges the city beyond was still the residents cowering in their rooms at the entrance ronnie darted from a hiding place his wounds were superficial but his face had a haunted expression as the devastation across the great plain ignited memories of his terrible experiences in flanders during the great war i was going after that bastard sir he said hes on his way to the palace and the caraprix you will not be able to stop him he is too powerful decebalus said and you will excuse me sir but were both of a kind not so much ronald you are a better man than me my experiences have better prepared me for what is necessary decebalus silenced ronnies protests i have more important work for you you must find a way to raise the gods to help you no the game here is almost played you must leave this place immediately do you hear me ronnie looked unsure do you hear me decebalus gripped ronnies shoulders forcefully until ronnie nodded unsettled bring together our own survivors quickly he told ronnie where aula was hidden and then added you must strike out for the enemy fortress to offer what support you can to church and the others time is short make haste do not wait here a moment longer than necessary decebalus raced through the gates before ronnie could argue a brief detour took him to the hunters moon where crowther and mahalia waited behind a barricaded door the teenage girl had been a shadow of herself since jacks departure but now her old fire flashed in her eyes let me help she drew the small switchblade she carried with her at all times i have greater work for you two decebalus said you must save an entire city the enemys broken inside crowther asked decebalus nodded sound the alarm god knows we have practised the escape enough times in recent days there will be fear panic you must show leadership to calm them and then take them to safety in the foothills can i count on you to do this crowthers heavyset face glowed as decebalus had anticipated the gift of purpose had brought him alive you can count on us within moments of decebalus leaving the inn the first tolling bell echoed across the silent city joined soon by another and then an entire host people were already creeping from their hiding places as decebalus ran up the winding cobbled road towards the palace of glorious light where he could hear the enemy advancing his relief freed him to concentrate on the trial ahead in the courtyard before the palace seth waited with a few ranks of lamentbrood and redcaps the gods head hung to one side as though he was listening and then he nodded and forced his way through the palace doors once seth and his troops had entered decebalus slipped in behind and followed one of the many secret passages and hidden stairways that would put him ahead of the enemy maths chamber was silent but decebalus sensed the sorcerer was near he rapped on the door it is i decebalus the time has come the door swung open though there was no one on the other side math waited in an adjoining chamber so gloomy that his presence was only revealed by the glint of his mask as it revolved a quarterturn this is it then the end or the beginning of it maths voice was a low rumble the golden ones always feared that if fragile creatures rose up they would destroy what they set out to attain it is in your nature be thankful it is if existence was left to your spineless kind the void would have wiped us all out long ago and would now be feasting on our bones where is it math took a step into the shadows and returned holding a small iron casket in the palm of his hand that is it decebalus queried size is no definer of power that has never been an issue for me in any case decebalus took the casket unnerved by how it hummed beneath his fingertips i expected more resistance from you all roads have been leading to these endtimes since the beginning it is futile to try to avoid it that is another area where i am thankful that we differ we do not bow down to futility oh yes hope math said with a note of mockery make peace with yourself decebalus said he sprinted along the empty corridors towards doctor jays laboratory as he neared he could feel the raw power of the caraprix pulsing through the stone walls seth stood before the broken door of the chamber bathed in an eerie white light that emanated from within with the shifting tones playing across his face the god appeared mesmerised by what he saw in the laboratory and that in itself troubled decebalus what power could instil wonder in a god behind him the redcaps shied away refusing to look the lamentbrood stood in their dumb ranks unmoved you cannot have them decebalus said seths darkringed unblinking eyes snapped towards him you do not know what they are he said if you did you would not be so quick to defend them i know that you and your master want them and that is enough for me i have destroyed many fragile creatures today and gods and beasts yet you stand here alone seth fought to stop his gaze being drawn back to the pulsing white light you have never faced anyone like me ringing with more than bravado decebaluss words gained seths full attention when he noticed the small iron casket his mood became darker as though he knew instinctively what lay within what is that he said this is the end of you of me of everything here it is the weapon i kept in reserve the one i did not want to use until you drove me to it the light from the open door changed in quality as if the caraprix too were aware of decebaluss intent seth stared at the box i am only a poor muddyarsed barbarian from the wilds of dacia with no schooling and only my common guile to keep me alive but wiser men tell me that what lies within this box is a wishhex a shadow crossed seths face this weapon was devised by the bastards in the stinking bowels of the court of the final word it has the power to bend reality to ensnare if you will or to destroy and to destroy on a massive scale or so i am told this is only a little baby of a wishhex not like the one those bastards embedded in the boy jack who accompanies church but still i think it will suffice you would not use it you would not survive decebalus pretended to consider this point then said you gods do not live in the shadow of death like fragile creatures do it is the thing that defines us an encounter with death changes us for ever the passing of a loved one a parent like the stones the alchemists used to turn lead into gold we become something sadder but greater for the experience death is a companion to us and sooner or later we must make our peace with him i did that a long time ago he held the box up to eyelevel and examined the carvings around it i have been told that wish is an old word for soul now what do you think that means is this a small part of existence with all the power that lies in it i think perhaps it is the caraprix if they are destroyed too then so be it at least your foul lord will not use them to ensure his unending rule there was movement in the room a shadow emerged slowly from the brilliant light jerzy not conscious was suspended a few inches above the floor the light wrapped around him and entered him through eyes mouth ears and nostrils seth lunged for the box and without a second thought decebalus tore open the lid his defiant battle cry was drowned out by a deafening roar that made his ears bleed a brilliant blue light flooded the corridor and for a second that was all decebalus could see until strangely he was walking handinhand with aula through the forests of dacia he was at peace for the first time aula smiled at him and that was all he knew into the great plain wound a column of brothers and sisters of dragons gods and inhabitants of the court of the soaring spirit stragglers racing from the city to join the tail end when the soundless blue flare lit up the sky they came to a halt and glanced back only to see that the city and part of the mountain behind it were gone aula stared at the barren blackened zone for a long moment and then wiped away a stray tear holding her head proudly she nodded to ronnie who waited with mahalia and crowther and the column continued slowly on its way rough hands dragged callows head from the water he was briefly distracted by the sensation of the wriggling razorworms disengaging from his empty eye sockets and then he cried oh thank you oh thank you i knew youd come back for me forget about the eyes theyll grow back in no time and ill be as good as new i forgive you i accept my punishment for my minor misdemeanour you encountered the brother and sister of dragons the voice was low and rustling and inhuman who are you callow asked hesitantly the hortha ah and what is a hortha you should know i have been a step behind you your whole life i think perhaps i would have noticed no your kind never notices perhaps kind sir you could help me down from this undignified position and then we could talk as old friends my nature is a paradox for all living things the hortha said some cross my path at random some call me to them consciously or otherwise and some i pursue once i have been encountered i can never be stopped it is only a matter of time why this sounds like a riddle what am i i do like riddle games perhaps if i guess correctly you could reward me in the ageold fashion in this case by bringing me down to earth random or purposeful that is usually the question that follows me the hortha continued there is a pattern there is always a pattern you can beg and plead make a bargain with your gods you can try to bribe and cajole me or run faster or hide or wish but the pattern can never be changed and i am bound into the very fabric of it into the weft and the weave i have all faces and i have two faces and in the end i have only one i am both a being and a symbol good good i like this i think i am almost there give me another clue tell me what you learned from the brother and sister of dragons i learned that they are vicious beasts and that everything they say about their own nature is a lie the hortha began to lower callows head back into the water wait wait you want information i understand a valuable nugget something that will help you to find them perhaps or ah i have it something that will give you power over them knowledge is power yes indeed continue they carry a lantern that is not a lantern within it is one of their own kind a genie in the lamp one who has two faces like yourself a man and a blue flame and he is the key to everything they do not just their guide but also a manifestation of that sickening pendragon spirit callow gabbled is that the kind of thing you want yes it is then bring me down my good man once again the hortha began to lower callow into the water wait my reward you have your reward you have crossed my path and still you survive others in a similar situation would not have survived on this occasion the great forces of all there is have shifted around you and moved on no callow shouted you still do not understand your good fortune that in itself is unfortunate allowing callows head to drop back into the water the hortha moved on the razorworms returned to their eternal task and callow to his screams alone in the stifling heat of the room church worked at the rope around his wrists fastening him to the chair blood slicked the fibres and a deep ache jabbed towards his elbows but he ignored the pain focusing instead on ruth and everything she meant to him the libertarian had grown bored with tormenting him long ago but that only made church more anxious for now his other self might be with ruth exacting his promise of torture church couldnt think about that nor his other doubts did the libertarians departure mean his futureself knew church would not escape or was this another of his memory blank spots where was his sword was veitch already saving ruth while he was trapped there impotently was that a scream he had heard echoing through the wall or just his imagination if he allowed himself he could get lost in the questions and the infinite permutations focus on the now he told himself he used the pain in his wrists to clear his head the lamps and candles fizzed as they attempted to keep the dark at bay sweat coated his body but still the rope would not give shouldnt we have a rope or something or chalk so we can scribble some arrows or some other shit like they have in all those old stories veitch asked uneasily as they picked their way through the twists and turns of the dusty tunnels beneath the queens palace bearskin and shadow john had found two torches to light their way but they revealed no distinguishing features on the stone walls my nose will lead us back out bearskin said before adding with a hesitance that masked a touch of distaste fragile creatures have a distinct aroma you can smell the woman shavi asked not yet but when our paths cross shavis hand jerked to his alien eye seeing things veitch asked just flashes flickers on the edge of my vision it happens like that sometimes i cannot tell what they are until they come into focus bearskin held up a hand to bring them to a halt i smell something he listened intently the beast still roams this place but not near not yet as if in response to his words a low mournful growl echoed along the tunnels from deep within the labyrinth but veitch understood that the odd acoustics of the place could mean it was much closer than it sounded he drew his sword in readiness how do we know it hasnt already eaten the girl he asked we do not bearskin replied stooping to avoid scraping his top hat along the tunnel roof shadow john peered nervously into the dark pon my soul this place is dismal can you smell the rotting bodies of the recently departed bearskin how far am i from the parlours i usually inhabit how very disturbing this all is at least we have two brothers of dragons to save us veitch and shavi exchanged a dont count on it look for the next hour they stumbled around the maze of branching tunnels and dead ends clambering over piles of rubble or wading through ankledeep pools of water occasionally blasts of warm air threatened to extinguish their torches and bearskin and shadow john fought to shield them with their bodies the origins of the air currents were unknown but suggested some shift in the labyrinths structure or the opening and closing of doors to the outside at every junction bearskins nostrils flared as he searched for telltale scents and at one he let out a low growl more of those skullheaded warriors have entered the labyrinth he said one hand unconsciously going to his blunderbuss their journey was repeatedly punctuated by the low mournful sound of the beast that lived there sometimes so distant it was barely audible sometimes unnervingly close at hand making shadow john jump and shiver his long fingers folding into claws finally the endless blur of grey tunnels gave way to a hexagonal area about twentyfive feet across in the centre of the space was a pile of yellowing human bones arranged in a circular pattern with a hollow at the centre bearskin plucked a thighbone from the heap and gave it a cursory examination before tossing it over his shoulder a nest he said shavi spun swiftly something is here he came to a halt before one of the six tunnels that led away from the nest gone now the mournful growl of the beast issued from another tunnel so close it raised the hairs on veitchs neck hurry now bearskin insisted at a rapid pace he led the way into the opposite tunnel before a crash of bones and the sound of pursuit echoed behind them though the echoes were disorienting veitch was sure the beast moved on four feet but it occasionally issued a rasping laugh that was eerily human it was fast drawing closer were going to have to stand and fight veitch gasped not advisable bearskin shouted back the flames of his torch trailed behind him as he loped and to veitch he now looked more animal than man somehow they avoided dead ends as they ducked this way and that down the many tunnel options presented to them but the beast at their back never slowed the rasping laugh came faster accompanied now by the gnashing of teeth get set now bearskin roared furiously and run as fast as you can as they raced past the point where another tunnel crossed their path veitch glimpsed the pale forms of the aztec warriors approaching from their left a moment later the tunnel reverberated with a terrible rending and tearing accompanied by the beasts human laughter as it attacked the warriors by the time bearskin brought them to a halt the beast no longer followed resting his hands on his knees veitch filled his searing lungs but bearskin was already pacing around sniffing the air we are nearly there yes i think we are he exclaimed he set off again and after a few more minutes they proceeded down a short stretch of tunnel that ended in rooffall crouched at the foot of the rubble hugging her knees and whimpering was rachel her tearstained face was streaked with dust and her clothes were dirty she cried out as bearskin approached her let me veitch said her blinking eyes recognised on some level that they were the same species but the fear held her in thrall for several moments you she said weakly i saw you when i first arrived in this in this she gulped a mouthful of air awful place breaking into wracking sobs she collapsed into veitchs arms he held her tightly until her crying subsided yeah this place can be a nightmare until you realise how it works but well soon get you back on your feet home she said take me home please first thing we need to get you out of these tunnels can you walk nodding she appeared to see the labyrinth for the first time i dont know how i got here its all a blur since i last saw you helping her to her feet he briefly introduced her to the others though she shied away from bearskin and shadow john and refused even to look at them understandable bearskin said fragile creatures find it difficult to adjust to the wonders of the far lands if they ever do i do not understand how she got here shavi whispered to veitch once they were back in the tunnels only those with the pendragon spirit can cross to the otherworld without paying a price and she cannot be a sister of dragons thats something we can work out later if we actually get out of this hole veitch said whimpering intermittently rachel stumbled along close to veitch occasionally reaching out to touch his arm for comfort he was moved by how quickly she had placed her faith in him following bearskins nose they cautiously retraced their steps senses attuned for the approach of the labyrinths guardian at the junction of the two tunnels the halfeaten remains of the aztec warriors were scattered once the nest was far behind them their spirits eased a little but the beasts occasional echoing growls still troubled them and sent rachel into paroxysms of sobs it felt as if they had walked miles when bearskin announced we near the exit this is the most dangerous time of all the words had barely left his lips when he pitched forwards to the ground unconscious shadow john let out a cry of alarm something rushed by me he whirled round and round but his torch revealed nothing veitch prised rachels fingers from his wrist and drew his sword a moment passed as they all waited tensely and then the staccato laughter rolled out of the dark only feet ahead of them shadow john held rachel tightly against him to prevent her from fleeing back along the tunnels right you bastard veitch growled raising his sword above his shoulder lets see what youve got veitch only glimpsed a flash of the beast as it erupted from the dark into the tiny flickering circle of torchlight a human face distorted across a broad head slanting silver eyes and then the long lean body of a jungle cat ending in a thrashing sinuous tail tipped with sharp quills as it bore down on him the mouth wrenched open to reveal three rows of snapping teeth the manticore shadow john cried a weight crashed into veitchs midriff as he prepared to swing his sword slamming him into the wall and then down onto the flags winded it was not the manticore for the beast passed over him a second later turning fluidly midleap to rake him with its enormous claws instinctively veitch rolled out of the way as the creature crashed to the flags so close he could feel its hot meaty breath on his cheek disoriented veitch heard shavi shouting but his words were drowned out by the sound of rachels screaming scrambling to his feet he had a split second to search for whatever had knocked him down before the manticore leaped again his legs went out from under him before he could even raise his sword through his shock he just heard the last of shavi shouting something else here and then the manticore pinned him down the distorted human face pressed close made worse for the lack of any intelligence in the wild eyes deep in its throat the laughter rumbled and then it tore its jaws wide veitchs vision was filled by the rows of teeth suddenly the manticore convulsed and turned on shadow john whose fingers were hooked into cruel claws the manticores side had been raked open stepping in front of shadow john veitch said thanks for the help mate but stay back protect the girl i see it shavi called veitch only had a brief impression of shavi wrestling on the floor with something he couldnt see before he was surrounded by the manticores snapping jaws and rending claws rolling to one side he let the sword dance instinctively the flames painting a sizzling blue mandala in the dark the manticores laughter turned to shrieks and it fell to the floor in a frenzy veitch hacked until it was dead shavi continued to roll around the floor welts and scratches mysteriously appearing across his face and hands shaking the daze from his head bearskin lifted shavi with one hand and with the other wrenched out whatever invisible thing was clutched in shavis grasp one snap of his wrist brought the struggle to an end in his hand materialised a lifeless thing that resembled a small ape the queen of the court of endless horizons needs a lesson in fairness bearskin growled two beasts instead of the one she told her contestants they faced and invisible to boot attempting to staunch his wounds shavi said so this eye does have its uses veitch clapped an arm around his friends shoulders good bit of teamwork there pal just like the old days rachels cries ebbed away and she looked on veitch with the wonder only reserved for a true saviour as he helped her to her feet she asked with breathless respect who are you south londons finest darlin he replied within fifteen minutes they were out of the labyrinth the city was still gripped by the darkness and the intermittent screams had not diminished but now there was a new element a slow drumbeat rolling out across the rooftops it felt like a call to ceremony but there was something in the quality of it that left them all inexplicably chilled after long moments of circling with not a hint of prey the bird swooped down from the grey sky to land on a slab of granite jutting from the white slopes the bitter wind ruffled the birds feathers and whipped up a whirlwind of recently fallen snowflakes that was the only sign of movement on the lonely wastes from the niche in the rocks where he had waited with inordinate patience for the better part of half an hour miller made a desperate lunge his fingers almost closed on the bird before it took frenzied flight amidst the highpitched kookookoo call that miller had come to know so well during the last few weeks it had been there his fingertips had brushed the grey feathers and now it was gone he collapsed onto the granite slab sobbing silently his frozen fingers blue his eyebrows and hair encrusted with snow miller allowed himself one moment to wallow in the despair of his failure and then he picked himself up brushed the snow from his trousers and trudged back up the hardpacked track to the cave it lay on the leeward side of the mountain protected from the worst knives of the wind the interior contracting into a tight tunnel before opening out into a larger rock womb the refuge served the dual purpose of containing the warmth from the small fire he kept alight with kindling from the leafless trees that scattered the lower slopes and providing protection from the fomorii that relentlessly prowled the entire mountain range their oily black forms always visible against the white background sorry guys well have to delay dinner he said breezily warming his hands near the embers there was no response miller had only heard his own voice since the terrible plunge from the shattered bridge leading to the groghaan gate hunter jack and virginia lay around the edge of the cave their broken bones and burst organs now healed by the ministrations of millers hands but still only a whisper away from death the rise and fall of their chests was barely visible their eyes didnt move their skin felt as cold as the rock once the life had returned to his fingers he moved from one to the other checking their vitals and where necessary placing a hand on their heart to let some of the thin blue glow leak out of him and into them the healing energy was diminishing as his own strength flagged a lack of food the everpresent chill and the constant need to offer up the regenerative force was taking its toll how long could he keep it up death tugged at hunter jack and virginia and he fought daily to keep them on the right side of life but he only had enough energy to keep all their hearts beating not enough to give them vitality unless he let one of them die only then would he have the reserves to save the remaining two but how could he choose who should he choose if he didnt make a decision soon his abilities would be depleted and they would all die turned out cold again he joked brightly before investigating the heap of bird bones for any that had not already been picked clean he was not rewarded lying down next to the fire he added ill just grab forty winks before i head out again dont worry everything is going to be fine for ruth only one horizon now existed in the court of endless horizons and that was in the dimension of pain it had gone on for so long with such intensity that it had become the medium in which her body existed as much a part of life as the air she breathed she occasionally found herself examining it with a zenlike detachment although she knew that was a response to the natural analgesics her brain was flooding through her system occasionally she found herself looking down on her body from high above seeing her arms yanked over her head and back so that the joints were in permanent agony as she lay stretched across an oaken table now puddled with her sweat and the blood that had flowed from the thousand tiny cuts made by the obsidian knife some went deeply into the muscle tissue and though she knew the pendragon spirit would heal them rapidly she also realised that tezcatlipoca would not give her that opportunity death would be coming soon from her vantage point she saw tom tearful at her suffering held with a knife at his throat in one corner of the large hall near the top of one of the citys highest buildings and laura beside him her face pale and blank a spear levelled at her side dont be sad for me she thought obliquely i can survive this i can survive anything vast windows ran along all four walls which would once have offered a great vista across the entire city and captured every sunrise and sunset now only black lay without the hall was filled with ranks of the aztec warriors their spears banging against the stone flags with each beat of the drum ruth knew the beat matched that of her heart steady but soon it would be slowing soon it would stop wheres church the notion floated up detached from any context and then wheres ryan in a rare moment of clarity she realised her instinctive use of the craft had pulled the essential part of her from her body a flash of pride came and went she had never before achieved that state without her ritual and her herbs is this what im capable of from thought to action in the blink of an eye is this what we all could do all that potential in every person its a shame ill never find out it didnt matter in her spiritform she always had a different perception of what was important of life and death and the part all the elements played in what she had heard described as the great mystery this is what shavi meant about the patterns she realised rise above it and it all makes a different kind of sense beneath her tezcatlipoca raised the obsidian knife again ruth was pleased she could no longer smell his decomposing flesh and she had no desire to witness her body put under more duress so she took her previous thought literally rise up to the ceiling she floated and then through it into the chamber above and up until she was inside the dense darkness that enveloped everything part of her wanted to keep rising up past the darkness past the sky to search for that welcoming tunnel of light she had heard of so many times and to see again all those people she missed so dearly but she couldnt allow herself to do it and instead she swooped down so fast that the buildings passed in a blur when she reached street level she moved along inches above the cobbles enjoying the familiar exhilaration at speed she ranged through the city seeing tezcatlipocas warriors prowling the deserted streets slipping into buildings where their victims lay in a jumble and feeling a surge of guilt that she had been indirectly responsible for their deaths then investigating the other homes and shops towers halls and warehouses still packed with the trembling fearful mass of people who had no idea what was happening around them but who knew that death was creeping closer their faces burned through her dreamlike state and ignited a fierce desire to protect them she could never give up while a single one remained alive the others she thought where are they and then the streets and buildings of the court of endless horizons passed in a blur as she searched every corner at speed finally she came across veitch shavi bearskin shadow john and rachel weaving through an alley to avoid an aztec patrol as they made their way back to the cafe where they had arranged to meet church as she floated above them her hazy mind accepted the futility of what she was doing for in that state she could neither touch nor be heard or seen yet to her surprise shavis head snapped up when she came lower and he stared into her face with a shocked expression ruth veitch looked at him askance are you on the mushrooms again you can see me ruth asked holding off veitch who was urging him to move on quietly shavi smiled and pointed to his eye this thing is proving a better investment than i ever hoped what are you doing you have to come quickly she said hes killing me who is the god whos taken control of the city hes been trying to flush us out she glanced at rachel and i think find her he said he used to be known as tezcatlipoca worry underlined the recognition in shavis face one of the most important gods to the aztecs this darkness makes sense now he ruled the night and death and he loved tempting people to do great evil hes got me and laura and tom in one of the tall buildings in the middle of the city if you can follow me i can take you straight there with every beat of the drum reverberating through the walls and floor church felt his anger ratcheting up from the moment it started he knew it was counting out the remaining moments of ruths life each thoom bringing a flash of the woman he loved in pain he saw each cut each beating each agonised expression as if he were standing next to her the images seared into his mind and pushed him towards the brink of madness with his exertion in the heat of the rows of lamps and candles he had sweated himself dry he could no longer feel his wrists the constant dripdripdrip into the puddle on the floor matched the drums steady rhythm occasionally his dread for ruth shifted into blind red hatred for the libertarian who swayed before his minds eye with his sickeningly mocking grin and his lies and his contempt the architect of all his misery church knew he could kill the libertarian without a second thought the realisation no less troubling than the conundrum of whether it would be murder or suicide thoom ruth thoom ruth thoom finally the combustible mixture of dread and hatred exploded in uncontrollable rage he halfstood the chair rising with him and raced backwards crashing the seat against the wall the force of the impact jarred every bone in his body the wood of the upright smashing into his back but still the rage did not diminish in a fury he did it again and again falling to the ground struggling to pick himself up once knocking himself unconscious when he was in the kind of pain he imagined ruth was experiencing he heard a loud crack barely able to think straight he slammed into the wall one more time and the chair shattered into several pieces stepping through his bonds he ignored the tattered mess of his wrists and tried the door it was open caledfwlch stood outside stupid he thought do you really think that little of me working the rope against the blade he was free within a moment and lurching quickly down the corridor towards the drumbeat his head spun and every fibre of his body ached but his hatred kept him going a maze of stairs and corridors passed in a blur until he found himself stepping out into a small gallery overlooking a great hall filled with several ranks of aztec warriors all else faded into a mist when his gaze fell on ruth bound to a table on the other side of the hall either unconscious or dead her body leaking blood from numerous wounds the boom of the drum reverberating in the pit of his stomach only added to his queasy despair a twitch of ruths hand allowed his rage to surface once more and though the libertarian was nowhere to be seen coward he thought his attention fell on what appeared to be a decomposing corpse now looming over ruth with a black knife at the same time the door into the hall burst open with a fierce yell veitch began to chop and hack at the aztec warriors without a thought for his own safety church threw himself from the gallery into the midst of the warriors several fell beneath caledfwlch before the warriors realised they were being attacked from behind and by then church was cutting a path through them towards ruth in the enclosed space the warriors obsidiantipped spears were useless and their wooden swords were no match for caledfwlch the blue fire blazed around the blade with more ferocity than church had ever seen before filling his gaze his mind in the chaos of battle he caught only glimpses of the grotesque grey figure holding the knife above ruth his feverish prayers appeared to work for the knife did not fall instead he caught sight of a mirror that appeared to smoke and then the figure was gone and the libertarian stood in his place mocking church silently the sight of the one he hated most in the world drove the last of his rational thoughts away and then there was only a red haze of blood and bone and flesh as he cut through the final warriors and leaped onto the small dais where the table stood despite the extent of her wounds ruth had already come round she mouthed his name other words he could no longer hear and he had no idea why the concern in her face became fear slicing through her bonds he lurched past the table towards the libertarian youre not going to hurt anybody any more he roared with a devilish grin the libertarian held the smoking mirror towards him and as the smoke cleared church saw what could only have been the reflection of another world in it a hellish figure covered from head to toe in blood stared back at him wildeyed in its hands a sword of black fire remarkably like his own the truth of the reflection did not touch him or if it did he did not care for he advanced on the libertarian with a renewed rage behind him he heard one of ruths words of power a flash of lightning and a furious gale assailed the remaining warriors oblivious to the turmoil behind him church advanced on the libertarian im going to kill you he snarled someone called his name he ignored it from the side of the room another libertarian appeared to knock the mirror from the hands of his twin where it shattered on the floor a look of abject betrayal filled the face of the first libertarian but then his features began to swim church was too consumed by his passions to comprehend what was happening or to wait for an outcome as the second libertarian darted towards the window church attacked his prey even as his features began to alter back to those of tezcatlipoca an inhuman shriek made his head ring as the blade bit deep the blue flames a consuming inferno no cries for mercy would make him relent a troubling calm came over him so he did not hear the thud of the sword that matched the beat of the nowsilent drum thoom thoom thoom the libertarian was gone but still church did not stop whatever was before him was now an unidentifiable mass that had to be reduced to the smallest parts possible so he continued chopping and hacking and slicing even when there was only a slurry spread across the dais and a voice told him that he would never stop because he could never be sure he could eradicate the foulness he would become he could never change things or make them better he could only destroy rough hands grabbed him and by then he was too weak to resist caledfwlch clattered to the floor and he turned to face shavi and tom shavi was crying openly and for some reason tom would not meet his eyes reeling his gaze was drawn past them to ruth finally worried about her now that his rage had burned itself out suddenly he wondered if it was too late for him for them for everything veitch held ruth tightly comforting her and they were both looking at him as if he were the monster he had seen reflected in the smoking mirror chapter eight the warp zone in the ample shade of the roof garden the ferns olive trees and date palms swayed in the hot desert wind and the shocking pink and electricblue tropical blooms released a luxuriant perfume that attracted bees and enormous butterflies a sense of peace enveloped church for the first time in weeks sipping the hot spicy tea the grateful citizens brought him he turned his face to the sun and closed his eyes its so good to have it back rachel sat opposite him sheltering beneath a large parasol she too had found her first degree of peace in the far lands we take too many things for granted until theyre gone the darkness had risen from the court of endless horizons the moment tezcatlipoca had been defeated church wasnt wholly sure that the god was dead the vile slurry remaining after he had hacked the body to pieces had vanished shortly after along with the fragments of the smoking mirror but it was clear they had bought themselves some breathing space the citys diverse inhabitants had gradually emerged blinking into the light barely able to believe that the immediate crisis had passed while recognising that the larger one remained at least the dark had hidden the burning mans fiery glare soon the streets were packed to the brim once again despite the numbers slaughtered by tezcatlipocas followers while the city had quickly returned to the chaos that passed for normal the tensions amongst the five had not gone away church had found his equilibrium quickly but ruth was understandably taking longer to recover from her ordeal and had insisted on resting alone in a room refusing all churchs attempts to talk with her veitch shavi and laura had been caught in numerous intense discussions the conversation drying up whenever church approached and he had felt their eyes on him wherever he went as if he would somehow pick up his sword and attack them all with the fury he had shown tezcatlipoca i am not the libertarian he had shouted at one point but that only appeared to make them more unsettled and his inability to show any regret for his brutality or to temper his desire to kill the libertarian only compounded their suspicions tom had attempted to offer advice and guidance but church was not in the mood time was running out and he was more intent on departing the city and completing his plan as soon as possible this place is unbelievable rachel said her face set her eyes hard a great deal of anger was locked inside her its like a dream and a nightmare wrapped up in one all this beauty and so much horror at the same time she focused on a flower which moved slowly before lunging for a passing bird i keep feeling ive been here before when i was a child everyone feels that way when they come here for the first time i dont know why that is maybe children dream of this place or theyve got some innate connection to it that we lose as we get older thank you for helping me askance she eyed him weighing his nature still not wholly sure the elderly man tom he told me all about you im not sure how much i believe but thank you anyway no problem the next thing we need to do is get you home you can do that i was afraid id be stuck here for ever we can try how did you get here i dont know where to start she tugged at the fibres of her dirty jeans for a moment and then said im twentyeight ive had more jobs than youd possibly believe dog groomer checkout girl waitress im just one of those people who doesnt feel at home in anything always out of sorts an outsider do you know he nodded deep in thought she remained silent for an uncomfortable amount of time and then pointed to a scar near her eye you see that i was living in london with this guy scott he used to knock me around usually when hed had a bad time at work or when the car broke down or when his team lost i kept making all these elaborate plans to leave him sometimes thats all id do dream up different scenarios night and day and i never went anywhere how pathetic is that its more complex than that maybe i deserve this place she said to herself church leaned towards her sympathetically please she pointed a finger at him aggressively dont patronise me or pity me okay he sat back one day i started to notice all these weird things happening spiders everywhere she shuddered it was like i couldnt turn around without seeing them i started to think i was going crazy all the stress with scott and the worry had pushed me over the edge then this homeless guy came up to me in the street filthy like he was covered in engine oil and he reeked he started to rant at me i cant remember what he said a hand involuntarily went to her forehead its all foggy whether it was that or the spiders i just flipped i went back to the flat packed a bag and ran out there and then all that time planning and i did it on the spur of the moment where did you go salisbury why salisbury she laughed bitterly more proof that id gone nuts do you believe in coincidences not really for days everywhere i went salisbury kept popping up along with the spiders turn on the tv something about stonehenge an archaeologist being interviewed in salisbury somebody stops me in the street asks which station for trains to salisbury i get a pamphlet through the door for doubleglazing the head office is in salisbury this is going to sound stupid but at the time it felt like the universe was giving you a message yeah some people are receptive to that some arent so youre saying the universe was giving me a message she said mockingly church recognised the flicker of uneasiness he saw behind her facade and recalled the mounting panic that had risen on the day he realised the universe was not at all as he had imagined something else strange happened to you in salisbury she shook her head embarrassed now she was verbalising things that had made a halfsense in her head dreams some exactly the same some with the same sort of feel there was always a little afrocaribbean boy in there he never spoke but he always acted like he knew me then one day i saw him in the middle of town it was like he was watching me yeah it spooked me i looked away and when i looked back he was gone i was already on edge in case scott rolled in looking for me though there was no real way he could have found me after that the boy kept turning up everywhere and the dreams kept on going too and i was starting to feel really creepy it was in my mind all day and i was worrying about going to sleep every night so i decided to confront him get it out of my system once and for all and prove there was nothing supernatural about it the realisation of what that decision had cost her brought a queasy expression church poured her another hot drink turned out he was a nice kid told me his name was carlton he didnt know anything about the dreams pretended he didnt but he knew lots of things about me that he couldnt possibly have known and he said he needed to show me something i gave him a grilling said i wasnt going to go but he was just a kid you know she looked out across the desert where the morvren were circling god it feels like all that happened to a different person and it was only a day or so ago i drove him a little way out of town to this place woodhenge not the stones it was just a few concrete posts in a field as far as i could see church nodded it doesnt look like much but its one of a series of pointers that the entire area around stonehenge and woodhenge was a massive ritual site one of the largest in the world i never had much interest in that kind of thing theres a theory that stonehenge was a place where people conducted rituals of death and then processed along the river to woodhenge for a celebration of life an archaeologist called mike parker pearson from sheffield university led a massive study there called the stonehenge riverside project he found evidence of a huge temporary living area not far from woodhenge and lots of animal bones that suggested feasting its an important place she shrugged dismissively you an archaeologist then once in a past life he wondered briefly if the patterns shavi was always considering extended to everyone and if for some unseen reason everyone was led towards the jobs they were meant to do he loved archaeology but after mariannes death it had felt so unimportant yet many of the things he had learned during his studies had helped him in his struggles as a brother of dragons random or pattern meaningless or meaningful i admit i had a bit of an odd feeling when i got out of the car the sky looked funny and there was this sort of swirly mist away over the fields carlton pointed to where i should be going and i set off only he didnt come with me i called him over but he told me to keep going that id find it soon so i walked a bit further and when i looked back he was gone and so was the car and the car park and all those concrete posts except you know the landscape looked exactly the same all the hills and fields the memory was still potent and she unconsciously hugged her arms around her it looked like it would have done hundreds of years ago i totally lost it running around and screaming like an idiot and then all the fields went too and i was in that mist id noticed and then her glass fell and shattered on the floor as she started to hyperventilate church gave what comfort he could but the tears still burned in her eyes i dont know what i saw i dont know how long i was there i just remember being aware that this thing was after me this thing with a big grin and horrible eyes and it was moving low along the ground and it had this sort of brown skin like a seal she caught herself and took a deep breath it chased me out of the mist and suddenly i was standing in the heat out there she pointed into the desert where the haze shimmered it kept coming after me and i ran as fast as i could i thought i was going to die and then i ended up here she started to pick up the pieces of broken glass and then hurled them across the roof terrace do you think you can find your way back to where you first appeared in the desert he asked i dont know maybe do you think theres a way back could be he didnt want to raise her hopes but his own heart was beating faster leaving her there recovering in the sun he found tom and ruth sitting quietly on another smaller terrace ruth looked paler than he had ever seen her how are you feeling he asked her he hated the uncomfortable space that lay between them and the way her eyes didnt quite meet his better thanks the pendragon spirit works wonders if you let it so what wisdom have you discovered now tom said acidly that boy you saw on the train carlton is working with the oldest things in the land maybe hes one of them tom sucked on his rollup thoughtfully for a moment then said simply interesting the oldest things in the land conspired to get her here the puck chased her into the city they wanted us to find her because she can lead us back home theres some kind of way that isnt one of the regular doors that the army of the ten billion spiders blocked youre sure youre not reading into this exactly what you want ruth asked with her we can find our way home ruth flashed a brief disappointed look that stung him you still want to run away its not like that oh forget it why dont you just trust me tom exhaled a cloud of blue smoke its a good job im not embarrassed by your pathetic domestic issues ruth and church turned and snapped at him at the same time shut up he shrugged unmoved lets get the others together church said were moving out within the hour in the dead heat of the morning they departed the court of endless horizons past the steady stream of refugees seeking shelter in the city after the packed sweltering noisy streets the blank rolling wastes were a welcome relief stilling the tense chatter of the mind and allowing them all to breathe a little easier casting a threatening shadow across the ochre sands the black cloud of the morvren followed them their cawing a jarring sound in the stillness that lay all around whenever the wind dropped lest they be lulled into a false state of overconfidence by the peace of the desolation the scarlet orange and gold shape of the burning man loomed up ahead of them against the silverblue skyline the outline now smudged black with greasy smoke the closer they got to it the more charged with dread the atmosphere became what do you think it will look like when the void fills the space ruth was surprised to realise she was whispering i do not think we should worry about that shavi replied once the void materialises everything is over soon the gleaming towers of the court and the dark line of jungle disappeared from view and there was only the rolling dunes scarred with the line of their footprints they sipped sparingly from their water bottles all of them aware of the dangers of getting lost leading the way rachel pointed to a formation of glassy volcanic rock rising from the sands about three miles distant i remember seeing that i came through somewhere near there i think laura sighed loudly eliciting a cautionary glare from church veitch joined church shortly after his gaze fixed firmly on the horizon you sure this is the best plan have you been talking to ruth its just none of us can see where this is going you could trust me a pause i do course i do but everything thats happened since we got here has pushed us all to the limit i know im not thinking straight i hear what youre saying ryan so did you draw the short straw to come and get me back on the rails its not like that because thats a little funny not so long ago they were all afraid youd kill them in their sleep now youre the voice of reason and im the bad guy thats not fair church regretted his words instantly veitch had been trying his best to make up for his past actions when he had been destabilised by the void he deserved better than that and church had to do better if he was to be the leader they needed youre right im sorry he said i dont want to tell any of you what im planning in the halls of the drakusa when we discovered that one of us is helping the enemy that really hit hard once we got back together i never thought wed have to deal with a traitor in the group again even after tom got his warning from the boy on the train now im not taking any chances even though virginias dead im not sure it was her veitchs silence was pointed im not saying it was you im not saying its anybody im just thinking its wise not to allow any opportunities for our plans to leak out to the enemy he added i dont like to think this way mistrust is corrosive maybe thats all part of the enemys plan letting it eat away at our relationships and the ties that make us stronger as a group but i cant see another way to deal with it veitch appeared satisfied with this and they fell silent again as the heat began to take its toll skidding down deep dunes and then climbing up through the shifting sands on the other side made their leg muscles burn and for a long while the rock formation appeared to be drawing no closer but then they crested a steep incline onto a hardpan plateau scattered with boulders where a stronger wind blew and they saw colours shimmering in the sky like the aurora borealis here and there drifted strands of the pearly mist that rachel had described this is it rachel said turning slowly what now laura asked everyone looked to church we go home he replied from a distant dune the libertarian watched them make their way across the plateau into the mist with the morvren swirling overhead they had been easy to follow but with each step his anxiety had grown more than anything he didnt want them to pass through those mists although he did not know why another of those annoying blank spots in his memory he had been so sure that his manipulation of tezcatlipoca and church would reap the final rewards he desired but now his control of events was slipping through his fingers like sand when the heat haze shimmered and church and the others disappeared from view he broke into a desperate run stumbling and sliding down the dunes cursing he vowed to let them know that the more desperate they made him the more he would make them pay on the plateau he didnt slow his pace and plunged into the mists after them stay close together church ordered as they moved through an area of bright swirling colours wow trippy laura said this reminds me of okay you had to be there aware of the fear in rachels eyes shavi took her arm reassuringly is this how you remember it i dont remember much at all but it feels familiar do not fight the sensations you are experiencing shavi said if you allow yourself to go with them it is not unpleasant thats easy for you to say tom what are you thinking ruth asked seeing toms serious expression im finding this both familiar and unfamiliar too he replied anxiously twisting the ring freyja had given him i have moved through the medium of the blue fire many times across our own world between nodes of power and between the worlds but this is different yet the same yep you lived through the sixties old man laura said for once tom ignored her ive heard talk of this somewhere that bleeds around reality around all the worlds and the connective tissue of the blue fire that joins them some occultists i encountered in san francisco believed if you could find a way to this place you could access all places and all times you could run away for ever ruth said eyeing church askance or you could fight a constant guerrilla war church countered no one would know when or where youd pop up whats that veitch pointed to a place where the colours appeared to have thinned so that it felt as if they were looking through a gauze onto the world the sun was just disappearing below the horizon casting its dying golden rays on a stone circle surrounded by trees beyond were welltended fields figures moved in the circle hazily coming into view thats caitlin ruth exclaimed but she looks younger more innocent and that teenage thug mahalia veitch noted and crowther the past shavi said perhaps when she was just beginning as a sister of dragons tom and rachel hung back but he flinched and stepped forward when he glimpsed the young boy he had encountered on the last train who mahalia had sworn was dead eerily the boy appeared to be looking directly at him and smiling knowingly as if he was aware of all that was to transpire caitlin looked directly at them too but didnt recognise them and then the colours swirled back in and the scene was lost i have a feeling we could have gone right there if wed carried on walking church said caitlin wouldnt need us ruth said confidently whatever happened back then i bet she dealt with it no problem they moved on through an environment that felt both timeless and placeless the hallucinogenic colours giving the sensation that they were floating for the briefest moment church once again felt as if he was lying on a table locked inside his own mind with the odd belief that a group of people were observing him dont investigate that notion a voice deep in his head told him what you have is better it will always be better scenes came and went celts fighting a furious battle a world war ii pilot standing beside his downed spitfire a thick semitropical jungle through which barely glimpsed beasts moved a castle under siege a victorian funeral several times veitch witnessed himself committing some atrocity in service to the void and turned away unable to look once he had to be restrained by church from leaping through the veil to right the wrongs he saw there when laura glimpsed hunter fighting a furious battle with the lamentbrood in a past time she broke down in long juddering sobs nothing the others did could console her im concerned we might get lost in here for ever tom said the rhymers voice sounded oddly distant and when church turned tom was fading into the swirling colours it felt like only a step or two away but when church dashed back tom and the others were nowhere to be found there was little point searching in a place that appeared to have no dimension putting his trust in fortune church continued to walk in the direction he had been following if they were meant to reunite in the world he was sure it would happen if this was a road he had to walk alone that was fine too go with the flow tom would have said followed by some rambling tale of the west coast in the sixties but church felt it was an important lesson he had been taught many times during his long journey in the colours any sense of time passing was lost it could have been five minutes or an hour when he heard a voice saying what is the point of the world it was the same voice church had thought came from deep in his head when he had the impression of lying on a table but now it appeared to be coming from all around him where is the meaning in life the voice continued who are you church asked what is real you dont sound like tom but youve mastered his degree of irritation church muttered these are the only important questions the voice said once you consider them all else flows from them the answers may seem impossible to find but it is the same as with any story the author embeds keys in the text to help the careful reader decipher the true meaning the rules that apply to the tiniest thing also apply to the greatest the flower dies but grows back the next season energy cannot be destroyed it simply changes shape what does this say for death and is man a random collection of atoms like a tree or a rock even though his nature is so very different from everything else in the world in that nature the key is writ large for all to see if they will only look the nature of a being is the purpose of a being if man has the capacity to find meaning then there is meaning to find is this for my benefit or is everybody getting the travelogue church recognised a quality to the voice once again it appeared to be coming from within his head is reality a model of a town laid out on a tabletop with each house representing an adjoining world is each world a school for souls as john hicks proposed and as it was taught to the knights templar in the fortress of salisbury how is a world created by a powerful being a god or in the head of a man lying on a table in the last seconds of his life church flinched what are you saying that all this is my dying dream that its all meaningless and so i return to the three questions what is the point of the world what is the meaning in life what is real church fought his annoyance at the barrage of questions and considered them for a moment a long time ago i was told that i couldnt be given all the answers i had to earn them because only by doing that would i become the person able to utilise that information is this part of that more teaching but work out the damn answers for myself he walked on a few paces in ringing silence and then the voice said nothing is fixed in the fixed lands everything is fluid yes i changed reality i brought tom and niamh back what is real he thought he made a new reality and then energy cannot be destroyed it simply changes shape other voices began to echo all around some familiar some unrecognised we are all stars that sounded to him like niamh love turns fragile creatures into gods niamh again so this is a puzzle he said before adding everything ive been through is a puzzle right like those complex traps that guarded the four great artefacts the sword the spear the cauldron the stone we had to solve them before we got our reward the rules that apply to the tiniest thing apply to the greatest so the keys are embedded in the text of life of my life theres another story behind everything ive been experiencing the colours shifted and for the briefest moment he felt as if he was in a room with opposing mirrors so there were images of him reaching out to infinity yet each was slightly different in dress or in whatever action they were engaged in it was swallowed up by another flash of him lying on the table what is real he muttered again what is real is whats on the inside not whats around us thats where the truth lies where the meaning can be found is that what youre saying we can create our own realities which are as real as what we perceive to be real around us we are all stars we are all gods so we dont look to the world for answers because its fake and its real at the same time its just not important we look inside a transcendental sense of revelation overwhelmed him and while he still couldnt grasp the immensity of what he was discovering he was sure there was enough there for him to piece it together later he was rocked from his contemplation by the sound of running feet out of the colours emerged his timelooping double that he had first witnessed in edinburgh and most recently in the great pyramid in cairo as on their previous encounters the futurechurch wasnt shocked to come into contact with his old self is this it he said is this the right time you have to listen to me this is a warning confused he looked around is this the right place am i too late frustrated church said to his futureself youre not giving me enough information even though he knew his double was locked in some constantly repeating cycle in the warp zone that made him appear at various points in churchs life when youre in otherworld and they call heed it right away theyre going to bring him back theyre the futurechurch became gripped with fear in panic he yelled too late and raced away into the colours for the first time the double was close to his current appearance suggesting that whatever point he originated at was in the near future okay he said to himself when they call ill heed it and then well sort out whatevers scaring you all right church had a brief sense that someone else was nearby he considered waiting to see what would turn up until some deepseated instinct warned him to keep moving breaking into a jog the colours streamed by him am i dying he thought is this just some reality ive created to soothe myself in my last moments that question is not important remember the three questions they are all church was surprised to hear the voice answering him directly for the first time before he could respond the colours around him began to thin and he saw that he was finally running into the world the voice floated to him one final time barely audible and he realised it was his own voice good luck it faded away with the colours and then he was jogging through a thin mist and out into a balmy summer night grass lay beneath his feet and there were trees nearby silhouetted against a sky alive with thousands of stars and a butterscotch moon full and round that lit up the field as if it were day church came to a halt and filled his lungs with the rich cool countryside air revelling in the aromas of hedge and field as he looked up at the great chamber of the night he felt an overwhelming sense of peace home in a way he couldnt quite understand every sensation that came to him in that beautiful evening setting reinforced what the voice had told him his unconscious mind made connections that waited to reveal themselves fireflies glinted in the long grass and as he looked out across the rolling countryside to where the lights of villages glittered he heard the haunting call of an owl nearby here was everything he ever needed every answer the scent of woodsmoke on the wind disrupted his reverie and he turned to glimpse the flicker of a campfire in the middle of a dense copse the soft buzz of amiable conversation drifted through the night and by the time he pushed his way through the trees he knew what he would find sitting around the campfire on which a spitrabbit was slowly being turned were all the others ruth jumped up the minute he stepped into the circle of warm light and hugged him tightly we were starting to worry you were gone for good she said church caught the brief shadow crossing veitchs face at ruths show of emotion but he quickly flashed an honest grin what are you talking about its only been a few minutes church said its been a week ruth said time moves differently in that place just like in the otherworld you idiot tom muttered as he stirred a bubbling pot of aromatic herbs and hedgerow plants we have been waiting here patiently for your arrival shavi clasped churchs hand warmly despite what ruth said we never doubted you would catch up with us experience tells yeah bad news just keeps on giving churchdude laura grinned at him lazily hands behind her head as she lay in the shadows just beyond the firelight besides youre the man with the plan we couldnt move on because no one knows whats rattling around in that tiny brain of yours unless it really is just running away and burying your head in the sand which i still think has a lot going for it realising how hungry he was church sat between veitch and rachel and stirred the pot you stayed in one place with the spiders everywhere do you think were fools tom snapped were on a major ley here and weve seen no sign of them or wed be far away and youd be damned church laid one palm on the ground reaching deep down he could just feel the faintest hint of buzz not much of a ley the blue fire is pretty dormant just like it was before the fomorii invaded that is the job of the army of the ten billion spiders shavi said we awaken the blue fire they exert all their power to reassert the mundane spell and stifle the lifeblood of existence so that it has little effect on the people who live here so thats us right pointless laura snorted we wake the blue fire they shut it down we wake it they shut it down we do all this suffering and get nowhere underneath her irony there was a troubling bleak note thats why we have to stop the void once and for all church said that way we change things for ever yeah stop a god laura laughed coldly then rolled over so no one could see her face youre all funny rachel laughed you talk about the strangest things they all exchanged glances but no one felt it necessary to illuminate rachel on some of the harsh realities they had encountered but youre good company ill give you that she continued and you saved my life im never going to forget that she wiped away a stray tear the strain of her recent experiences still evident her gratitude was touching and only added to the warm mood that pervaded the campsite with the soundtrack of the fires crackling the breeze in the trees and the calls of the owls church lay back and watched the stars amongst the branches he would have been happy to stay there for ever with his friends and the woman he loved in the beating heart of nature theyd all kept going for so long with the promise that such peace would finally await them at the end of their long hard road but perhaps this was the last moment they would ever have his lambent emotions must have played out on his face for he caught ruth watching him with concern he gave her a reassuring smile lets make the most of this night he said to the group whats out there isnt important whats here is real all that matters lets celebrate just being alive being together because tomorrow everything starts in force in the heat of the night amidst the thick odour of petrol fumes and the regular buzz of traffic heading west along the a the libertarian waited on the fringes of the stark garage lights for every car or lorry that trundled in for refuelling he carefully searched the faces of the drivers filled with barely contained anger that he had no idea what he wanted to find but convinced he would know it when he saw it and that it was important this time this place why his memory was increasingly and frustratingly patchy at the point when he needed it the most he halfrecalled a distant memory of sitting around a campfire and drove its unpleasant taint from his mind too haunting too destabilising a sleek silver bmw rolled onto the forecourt music blaring from the open window the driver was slim tanned with wellcut sandy hair wearing an opennecked lightblue shirt at first glance there was nothing out of the ordinary about him but then the libertarian caught sight of something subtle that was instantly recognisable something in his eyes perhaps a hardness too long between blinks or the way the muscles of his face fell in an unguarded moment he knew he had his man marching over he held out his hand simon he boomed scott the driver responded unsure of course scott youre looking for your girlfriend flighty type ran away left you in the lurch the information was so precise scott was too taken aback to question the stranger i might be able to help the libertarian said with a tight smile at the first light of dawn church led the group across the rolling grassland towards stonehenge the landscape was still the rumble of traffic that blighted the ancient site for most of the day not yet rising from the constricting network of main roads the first light gave a silvery newminted sheen to the countryside with a hint of the warm golden sun that would soon follow as they made their way down a slope summer mist briefly turned the world back in time to the raw poetic age when the stones were first erected there was only the grass beneath their feet sparkling with dew each step muffled by the soft drifting mist for a while no one spoke their steady breathing and the gentle melody of birdsong their only accompaniment shavi breathed deeply peacefully that moment held all the reasons for the joy he felt at being back in the world give you a bit of nature and youre in heaven arent you shavster lauras tone was gently mocking but her expression remained unusually solemn there is heaven in every aspect of this world not just in the countryside if you look with the right eyes in music heard from an open window on a city street in the play of light glinting off the windshields of cars speeding down the motorway in the rainbows of oil in puddles on a building site youre weird in the long pause that followed her words he felt she was desperately seeking something from him though he had no idea what it was finally she said are we just wasting our time here given all i know of church i would trust him implicitly and follow him anywhere what we initially see may not be the true picture thats the point exactly maybe were just a bunch of deluded woollyheaded losers and what we think we see is just us fooling ourselves all this powerintheland magicintheheart bollocks say it out loud listen to it it sounds like one of those rants you get from the cideraddled dogonastring people you find sitting on the pavement begging for money in glastonbury you have seen the evidence with your own eyes ive seen stuff sure but whos to say its right what if the void is the right one for our world her voice had a faintly glassy quality that suggested unrevealed stresses deep within it is not right but what if just having a little peace getting a tiny bit of enjoyment out of life before we take the dirtnap whats so bad about that nothing except there is the potential for a lot of peace and a great deal of enjoyment in life the void wins by giving people just enough to keep them content a little less and they would all rise up and change things a little more and they would see the true potential of what we have and rise up and change things the mundane spell is very skilful but why do we get to shake things up sometimes i feel like were those revolutionaries who start out trying to make things better and end up consumed by the cause and blowing up babies on a bus we have not hurt anyone yes we have she lowered her voice and looked down when veitch cast a suspicious glance at her weve turned peoples lives on their heads all their little happinesses that everyone around here laughs at so much weve seen people hurt and killed and weve carried on regardless because we believed it was a necessary price to pay because we thought we had the moral high ground weve not given them anything better to make up for their loss just the promise of heaven around the corner you could say there wouldnt have been any fomorii invasion and worldturnedonitshead if the void hadnt been afraid the pendragon spirit and its champions of existence werent going to upset the apple cart i would say you are considering things too closely the big picture cant be seen yeah yeah thats our great getout clause so we dont have to face up to the consequences of our actions think of all the misery and suffering thats followed us around how can we be the heroes were not revolutionaries were terrorists laura wouldnt meet shavis eye but she couldnt hide how close to tears she was it is all right to have doubts he said gently slipping an arm around her shoulders all of us have doubts at some point even you even me when you do not know the rules of existence and when you cannot see the greater patterns all you have left is faith in yourself and faith in your friends the words were meant to be comforting but they only upset laura more stray tears ran down her cheeks and she wiped them away angrily before accepting a brief reassuring hug then marched off to be alone with her thoughts the mist turned into a dense fog as they drew towards stonehenge colours glinted in droplets of moisture all around and veitch asked uneasily are we back in the warp zone or what i dont know but somethings not right church slowed the pace as they attempted to orient themselves someones here ruth said i dont see anyone veitch responded i feel it youre using the craft church asked i thought it didnt work so well here when the blue fire is dormant i dont know it feels stronger somehow i was using it instinctively like i learned to do in the otherworld lurching out of the dense fog a figure brought them to a sudden halt his long hair tied in a knot at the side of his head he wore a fur cape over a woollen tunic that had been dyed brightly with berries they bristled for an attack but he grinned broadly and waved before hailing them in a musical language that only church understood with a flourish he disappeared back into the fog what the fuck laura said iron age celt church said recalling with a pang his time in carn euny almost two thousand years ago in wiltshire now ruth said something is strange here tom muttered and we are still not alone footsteps circled them ebbing and flowing through the muffling shroud of the fog so that it was impossible to pinpoint their location but they could all tell that whoever was making them was following with caution perhaps even a hint of threat they drew into a tighter knot unsettled by how fast the footsteps moved at times they wondered if they were mistaken and it was really an animal prowling around just beyond view the fog folded and briefly revealed a dark shape that did not assuage their doubts it was long and lean moving low so it could have been rising from all fours or falling from two feet it loped back into the fog as soon as their gaze fell upon it church drew caledfwlch and was shocked by the whoosh as the blue flames leaped around the blade that cannot be right tom said in the times when the void has been most dominant the blue fire in this area has always been more dormant than at other sites human encroachment the roads and the abuse bled the land of its sacred quality maybe church said thoughtfully the void isnt as dominant as we thought the figure erupted from the mists in a whirl of limbs brandishing a weapon that moved too fast for them to see a blow creased churchs forehead another upended veitch and the final one came to rest at the skin of ruths throat her gaze ran along the gnarled wooden staff to the just as gnarled figure holding it arms and face mahoganybrown from the sun and wind greyblack greasy hair hanging lank around his head a stained cheesecloth shirt and mudspattered trousers and the fiercest eyes ruth had ever seen familiar eyes wait shavi called exuberantly it is us the bone inspector eyed them suspiciously then slowly lowered his staff these are dangerous times he growled upheaval constant change damned spiders coming and going and now this he nodded around him were going to have all hell on us in no time his steely gaze scanned every face until his eyes rested on tom and a small smile sprang to his lips id heard you were dead it was overrated i came back they hugged each other briefly like old friends two grumpy old bastards together laura muttered this is hell in stereo wed also heard you lot were gone from this world the bone inspector said to the others i wanted to be sure you werent some trick of the spiders a trojan horse who is he rachel whispered to shavi youve got nothing to fear from me the bone inspector said not unless you get on the wrong side of me i watch over the old places the burial mounds the wells the stone circles the cairns make sure no one interferes with the treasures theyve held since the old times from shetland to scilly neath to norfolk im there always have been will be till i die you said we church rubbed the bump on his head youre not alone if youre here then i suppose you need to see this he turned and loped into the fog and the others hurried to keep up after only a few yards the fog began to thin turning back into the low drifting mist now golden in the light of the dawn sun and within a few moments that too was gone behind it lay a landscape that took their breath away so ancient and wild that it appeared as if they had walked two thousand years into the past but when he squinted shavi could see pylons in the distance and the air still had the taint of petrol fumes stonehenge was no longer a ruin eroded by centuries of wind and rain and mans poor stewardship the megaliths stood tall and proud the lintels complete and all around the outlying stones were erect their surfaces gleaming and smooth as though they had been hewn by the stoneworkers only recently a sprawling crowd faced the rising sun in silent adoration the reinvigorating dawn rays shone brightly along the precisely aligned avenue the people wore the iron age clothes of the man they had encountered in the fog and there were young and old men women and children strong and frail all side by side in the solemn congregation the sun hit a point where it was framed whole and round between two stones and a man some kind of priest shavi guessed raised his arms and called out to the sky as one the people raised their heads loud drumming began instantly a perfect complex rhythm but within seconds shavi realised there was more to it than a simple celebration the peculiar alignment of the stones created strange acoustics that amplified and distorted the pounding so that it appeared as if the stones themselves were singing to the heavens the sound rolling and muffling then growing louder as it shifted around the circle like a living thing it was hallucinogenic transcendental though he was well away from the ritual he was transported and he wondered what awe those at the henge would be feeling when the drumming reached a crescendo it stopped suddenly the ringing silence was just as potent but it only lay over the circle for a second before there was a soaring whoosh as blue fire burned in lines along the paths of the ancient leys in the distance they interconnected to create the fiery network above the stone circle the sapphire flames rushed up to create a structure that appeared to reach towards the stars a cathedral of fire that made their chests swell and brought tears of awe to their eyes for a moment they basked in the wonder of the display and then the blue fire washed back into hiding but the effect it had on their emotions did not disappear a cheer rose up from the crowd children whooping and playing adults hugging each other or kissing as they turned from the stones and made their way towards the shimmering line of the river as the congregation dispersed shavi was surprised to see several people in modern dress following the throng their faces as alight as their ancient ancestors theyll make their way back to woodhenge for a feast that will go on till tomorrow the bone inspector grunted this is the summer solstice a celebration of life and death and how the two are tied together he glanced at tom nothing ends there is always something higher always something beyond the horizon whats happening here church asked those iron age people the megaliths all time is folding together the bone inspector replied dont ask me how but i hear this is how it is in the otherworld rachel wiped the tears from her cheeks if anything she had been more affected by the sight than the others i never guessed she whispered so much potential all around us and we never saw it it wont last long the bone inspector said the army of the ten billion spiders wont let it things like this could destroy the mundane spell in a minute once youve seen this why go back to your offices we cant let that be destroyed rachel said desperately then you need to get busy the bone inspector said because you lot are the only people who can stop that happening the brothers and sisters of dragons you mean rachel enquired humans he turned back to stonehenge come on there are people you need to meet as they passed through the fringes of the crowd streaming towards the river the mood of exuberance was infectious once their dress was forgotten church could have believed they were all from the modern world enjoying the festivities of some summer carnival many hailed him and the others as they went by and entreated them to join them at the feast the bone inspector was untouched keeping his head down he marched past the last of the crowd towards stonehenge electricity filled the air as they walked between the megaliths of the outer circle and into the heart of the ring amongst the stones ten men talked quietly most were in their fifties though a couple were very elderly indeed they wore grey robes tied with a cord at the waist and on their heads were circlets of oak and ivy church recognised their dress from his time in carn euny the culture he said referring to the secretive society that had guarded the knowledge of nature and the blue fire since ancient times i thought most of them were wiped out during the roman invasion you and me both the bone inspector growled i always thought i was the last of them but then a few days ago they reappeared one of them came over eagerly the moment he saw them he was in his sixties tall with piercing grey eyes a totemistic staff indicating he was the leader of the group brothers and sisters of dragons he said shaking each of their hands in turn we never expected to see you here my name is matthias leader of the culture he nodded to the bone inspector brother you were wrong sometimes i am and this time im glad walk with us matthias said join the feast weve got work to do church began but tom interrupted him not so fast you might learn something a note in toms voice suggested the rhymer had some hidden knowledge youve seen something in the future church said tom nodded slowly ive seen a lot of things this is the last step of the journey dont go rushing to finish it up too quickly savour it besides its the solstice the blue fire swirling around beneath stonehenge is at its peak you dont want to be going down there until its abated a little at least tonight will be fine you want to go beneath stonehenge ruth said church couldnt answer he looked briefly from face to face searching for any hint of potential betrayal and finally his gaze came to rest on tom who recognised what was going through churchs head and looked away disgusted come on tom said im hungry and i need a rest and a smoke they joined the tail of the group processing along the river towards the durrington walls henge and the nearby woodhenge it was going to be a beautiful day the sky was a clear blue and an ageold peace lay over the fields copses and hedgerows five thousand years wrapped up in one moment church wondered briefly if the magical transformation that had come over the site had something to do with the power infused into the land through generations of reverence a store of sacred energy that right at the end of time had started to transmit his thoughts were brought to a halt by their arrival on a ceremonial path leading from the river into a bewildering chaos of noise and activity for thousands of years the site unlike stonehenge had been buried beneath the rolling wiltshire countryside now temporary roundhouses and ramshackle huts stood side by side specially constructed for the solstice celebrations of life and death as they had been in the distant past within a week they would all be dismantled the tribes that had gathered there returning to their homes across britain and even across the sea to mainland europe it reminded church of the glastonbury music festival families and friends gathered in small communities amongst the larger sprawl of their people campfires everywhere the smell of cooking food impromptu music performances with drum and voice and a general sense of celebrating life the contemporary people church had witnessed earlier wandered around the camp in a dream welcomed by their ancestors and called to the fireside where they were offered meat carved from the roasting animals shavi beamed if only it was always like this while shavi took rachel ruth laura and veitch to explore the camp matthias and the other members of the culture guided church and tom to a peaceful enclosure slightly removed from the chaos allowing himself one backward glance as veitch took ruths arm church fought a pang of jealousy in a roundhouse beside a fire a warm herb infusion was served in wooden bowls while the culture sat on the straw church was increasingly concerned about tom and couldnt shake the feeling that the rhymer was receiving visions he didnt want or couldnt bear to share occasionally he would drift into a reverie jerking himself alert a moment later with tears in his eyes it is good to be back in the world matthias said when all had received their drinks our society has existed since the dawn of mankind you knew of us true thomas before you were stolen from your home but by then we were only spoken of in whispers i could have done with you then we all could have over the last few centuries tom said we were left alone without teachers that made us children trying to find our way in a dangerous world if we could have found a way to survive here we would have matthias replied but it wasnt gods or beasts who tried to destroy us it was our own kind fragile creatures the seekers of power the warmongers our work was to cater to the spiritual needs of the people to guard the knowledge they need to grow and prosper and to stand as sentinels and guides to the invisible worlds that cluster close to our own we were a tremendous force for good yet we were seen as a threat by those who wanted control the void saw you as a threat church said those who bought into the voids philosophy were just the tools that carried out the dirty work driven from our groves hunted to the point of extinction we fled to the otherworld where we survived on an island in the dismal marsh unable to tend to our people we were dissolute and broken in spirit he bowed his head it took time for us to renew our purpose but then we became aware that the brothers and sisters of dragons were active once more and that knowledge brought the blue fire back to our hearts if you were fighting to oppose the void how could we remain in hiding see tom said pointedly to church you keep thinking of yourselves with your own shallow perspective only looking around the tiny sphere of your immediate influence you dont realise that simply by moving through the world you are changing all of existence the connections ripple out altering the pattern he sighed how am i supposed to drum some sense into your head step back and see the big pattern and all your petty little concerns fall into perspective its hard to believe everything happens for a reason when youre wading through lifes little miseries church snapped thats the point tom took out his tin and methodically began to roll himself a smoke one other thing was responsible for our return to the world at this time matthias continued the first called to us church was shocked the first called to you the oldest and greatest fabulous beast was the recipient of the full power of the blue fire and church had been convinced he was the only one who shared a link with it even then when his mind intertwined with the beasts he saw with its eyes and felt what it felt but he never gained any sense of its consciousness they were always together and separate we were as astonished as you brother of dragons we protected the first in the far lands when it was most under threat and during all that time it made no contact with us indeed we thought it was incapable of communication with humans but it summoned us back here to this place to help empower the land and through that to empower the first our ritual today at the dawning of the solstice focused the full force of the blue fire in this land on the greatest of the fabulous beasts thats why im here church said to take the first back to the far lands to help us in the battle hmm tom mused do you think there are any coincidences when all the brothers and sisters of dragons gathered in london i hid it close to the city so it could make its way here to stonehenge when the void was looking elsewhere church said there is a secret you must know matthias said the first has two forms it is a fabulous beast and it is the purest form of the blue fire that speaks through a human avatar a force for life and a force that can be used for destruction both interconnected the first told us that this is important it is a mystery that is also a key to what comes next you need to think about that tom said is that one of your subtle hints time is running out for subtlety i havent been able to tell you anything because its important you learn all this yourself were never going to get to heaven if you havent learned how to find the path church was puzzled by toms odd choice of words it prompted another flash of himself lying on a table being observed and he rubbed his temples forcefully to drive it away its not all about me he said with irritation actually it is and it always has been the weight of toms gaze upon him was almost unbearable and so much lay behind it a sucking vacuum that he had to resist or be lost in it for ever i dont want to know he stood up suddenly and marched out of the roundhouse and into the crowd where he lost himself physically in the celebration but he couldnt escape his thoughts which increased in gravity during the course of the day until he became filled with dread about what lay ahead everything was about survival in the face of the void but somehow in a way that made no sense to him it was really about even more than that towards the end of the day he found matthias standing beside him as he watched the sun moving down the sky the mysteries will never be revealed to you they can only be discovered by your own contemplation the leader of the culture said my mystery all mysteries we are all stories unfolding the author be that your unconscious or some higher power depending on your point of view will leave clues for you to decipher the meaning beneath the chain of events but no good author would make everything plain revelation is passive and easily forgotten discovery is active and imprints on your mind and soul for ever breathing in the woodsmoke and the smell of cooking meat and listening to the sound of jubilant voices church realised how much of an outsider he felt ive had enough he said of the mysteries of the struggle the heartache i want it all to end a happy ending like they have in the stories happiness is found in the strangest places matthias said for some people it can only be felt by seeing it ignited in others i dont want to be a hero either but you are it is in your nature you could not be anything else you have risen above your flaws you have kept travelling along the road when the obstacles would have driven others to the wayside as you will keep travelling now even though you feel this way am i right church nodded dismally not far away ruth made her way through the crowd the spear of lugh resting jauntily on her shoulder she looked at peace and that made church happy to see she caught sight of him and came over giving him a kiss on his cheek as she slipped her arm through his i cant believe how well the craft is working for me here she said ive been practising it makes me feel so alive to use it if only it was always like that its inversely proportionate matthias said if the mundane spell is working strongly using the craft getting closer to nature bringing the blue fire alive is harder if not impossible the two are different faces like the void and existence but theyre linked one pulls one way the other loses ground and vice versa for the majority of human existence on this planet everything pulled in existences direction the blue fire thrived and humanity was better for it after the industrial revolution everything changed the mundane spell got a grip on the land and the blue fire went into a long decline eventually magic disappeared from the world it was always within the power of humanity to keep the blue fire alive but the mundane spell is very seductive it speaks to the worst instincts of human nature and good men and women are required to overcome it people should have taken a stand long ago they did not and so the mundane spell whispered in the night and gradually draped on them responsibilities and needs that did not make their lives better but which seemed at first glance attractive by the time humanity recognised that it was too late but that is how the other side has always won not by direct confrontation but by an arm of a friend around the shoulder the foolish the unthinking the tired and worn down they always listen only now as it sees its control ebbing away for good is the void turning to destruction a black cloud passed briefly across the setting sun swirling up and then back to circle around the camp the revellers stopped what they were doing and faced the sky as the morvren settled on the trees all around an omen matthias said church felt a shiver of darkness touch his heart hes here he said his comment was underlined by a scream rising up on the edge of the crowd the libertarian will go all out to stop me reaching the first church said he knows it could be a turning point you do what you have to do ruth said ill round up the others and try to head off the libertarian before she could move veitch ran up that scream i think it was rachel i cant find her anywhere shes under our protection ruth said if the libertarian has hurt her hes going to pay she reluctantly dragged her gaze away from church and left with veitch before any questions were asked about what she was thinking church decided he didnt need to ask increasingly they were seeing the libertarian as him not as some other character shaped by an asyetunrealised crucible but as him his thoughts his motivations his hatred and perhaps they were right matthias grabbed his arm as he made to leave you must ensure no harm comes to the first or else all is lost church gave his assurance and then ran off towards the long fingers of twilight reaching across the landscape behind him the sounds of celebration continued unabated but night was falling fast chapter nine ice and fog beyond the marshes the grim lands reverted to rocky shale for a few miles before the ground descended along a steep slope to a desert of grey dust that had the same texture as ashes occasionally blackened twisted trees stood in lonely vigilance on the desolate wastes giving the impression that the entire area had been swept by a massive conflagration that destroyed even the tiniest particle of life dont you see caitlin said to mallory when he raised this thought that everything we pass through is just a different symbol of death and decay i dont think any of it is real its just what we project onto it her voice had the clipped tones of the morrigan her eyes dark and unblinking as she searched for any threat in the folds of the dense fog though it was still unmistakably caitlin mallory missed the warmth of his friend when the morrigan was riding her he had even grown to miss her separate personalities as irritating as each of them was in turn even calm the morrigan cast a frightening shadow there was always the sense that violence could erupt at any moment ahead of them etain and the other brothers and sisters of spiders roamed through the mist searching for potential danger the wayfinder continued to point its path ahead but they had no idea if they were any closer to their destination or if the shifting quality of the grim lands would keep them wandering for ever their own brand of purgatory for the sins they had committed in life and somewhere at their back was the hortha never wavering eternally vigilant driving forward until he could take their lives that too was part of their personal purgatory as frightening in symbol as it was in reality there would be no rest for either of them and only death at the end bitterly mallory wondered if that was a metaphor for life cruel fingers of wind plucked up the ashes and swirled around them stinging their eyes and pitting their faces choking they wrapped handkerchiefs across their mouths and noses put their heads down and continued in silence for another mile fighting against even more limited visibility howling the gale increased in intensity the further they advanced as if attempting to hold them back thundering hooves brought them up sharply as etain skidded from the mist to a sudden halt next to them do not take another step she yelled the moment she spoke the wind died and left an eerie silence that reminded mallory of a justvacated room leaping from her mount etain took mallory and caitlins hands and led them forwards a few feet to the edge of a sheer drop plucking a pebble from the ashes mallory dropped it into the dense fog there was no sound of it hitting the bottom the abyss etain said caitlin took the wayfinder from mallory and held it aloft the flame continued to point ahead across the gulf after exploring in both directions along the edge for several yards but finding no immediate sign of an end to the drop he said this makes no sense tannis owein and branwen dismounted and continued to explore while caitlin and mallory conferred with etain what do we do now she said we never thought it was going to be easy caitlin said whoever or whatever took the trouble to hide the market of wishful spirit out here was never going to set up signs for us to find it so we climb down that could take for ever mallory said everyone in the grim lands knows there is no bottom to the abyss etain observed so its on the other side mallory said there is no other side this is the boundary between the grim lands and the unknown nothing passes beyond this point ask hal caitlin said the blue fire has little strength here it might weaken him if he has to manifest himself mallory weighed his options then peered into the glass panels of the lantern hal you there he glanced at caitlin i feel stupid talking to a lamp caitlin couldnt suppress a smile you telling me your life hasnt prepared you for that thats right mock me he unhooked the hinge and opened the door that gave access to the wick the familiar burnediron odour of the blue fire drifted out with a fizz the flame flickered larger and licked out of the lantern but there was none of the surging whoosh and crackle of flames that mallory had experienced before and hal was no longer the searing figure of raging fire he resembled a ghost so intangible that his form flickered and guttered to reveal the grey dust behind the only sign of the blue fire was a thin halo limning him you survived callows attack mallory said just it took nearly all my reserves im barely hanging on now he gave a wan smile not much use to you any more if i ever was what happens when the reserves go caitlin asked he raised his hand and waved almostfingers gently towards the abyss gone gone gone he saw her face fall and added hastily dont worry im ready for it the time ive spent in the blue fire which to me feels like alltime has been he laughed quietly theres no point me trying to explain it lets just say ive seen all there is to see experienced all thats on offer and know the answers to every question i ever considered even the big ones a few tips wouldnt go amiss mallory said itd be like cheating in an exam youd get banned all right if you work out the answers for yourself but no insider dealing hals face grew serious and a little sad dont worry mallory really dont worry can you help us now caitlin asked we cant see what were supposed to do next yeah the wayfinder flames a bit of a blunt tool he replied i cant get it to point down thats it we climb down not all the way youll see what i mean a crackle like static disrupted hals indistinct form not much time left for me the words broke up then get back in the lantern mallory said were going to return you to the world with a nod of thanks and a smile hal faded away mallory fastened the wayfinder to his belt before inspecting the drop and after a few moments preparation he eased himself over the edge feeling for hand and footholds under the deft fearless control of the morrigan caitlin came next followed by etain and the others progress was slow and soon mallorys joints were aching from the strain of clinging on to the rock face while reaching out all around to find nooks that would support his weight from time to time they had to go back up to take a different route when the footholds disappeared one good thing about this fog you cant see the bottom he gasped saves me blacking out from the vertigo after each few feet mallory paused and checked the wayfinder when they had descended for about half a mile he realised he had passed the point of no return for his exhausted limbs but just as he began to worry the direction of the flame moved from upright to the left relieved mallory edged horizontally across the cliff face mallory the timbre of caitlins voice had changed to the rasp of her cronelike brigid persona danger approaches from deep in the fog a highpitched screech emanated etain he called out what threats have got the words caught in his throat as something swooped out from the fog passing so close that it ruffled his hair before disappearing in a flash a bird he guessed but he had an afterimage of something bonewhite and nearskeletal as big as an eagle bracing himself he clung on with one hand and drew llyrwyn just in time as the thing burst from the fog again missing both eyes what little skin it had was pale and desiccated wrapped tightly across bones that were visible all over it looked as if the carcass had been left out in the sun for weeks with the wild flapping of enormous wings it attacked him with beak and talons lunging and snapping again and again mallory lashed out with his sword but each swing threatened to pitch him off the cliffface caitlin arrived behind him just as two more of the birdcreatures emerged from the fog balancing so precariously on her toes that mallory was sure she would fall caitlin lashed out with her axe and chopped one of the attackers neatly in two as it plunged down into the fog they heard the screech of more arriving bringing his sword up sharply mallory despatched one bird but the other had dug its talons into his shoulders and was driving its beak into his head as it attempted to tear out his eyes struggling to defend himself from the birds frenzy his fingers detached from the cliffface and he began to lurch out over the gulf as his stomach flipped caitlins hand snapped tightly around his wrist and held him fast blood streamed down mallorys face from the birds furious assault then as he fought and failed to get a purchase on it the creature was torn away above his head etain clung to the cliffface like a spider gripping the thrashing bird in her left hand she snapped her teeth onto its scrawny neck and tore its head off both parts flew down past mallory but by then he was wiping the blood from his eyes and moving as fast as he could along the cliff before any more of the creatures attacked their shrieks made his skin crawl and he could hear them swooping just beyond the limit of his vision circling as they looked for the right moment to strike before they made their next move he located a narrow fissure in the rock from which a cold wind blew he dragged himself in quickly with caitlin and the others pressing close behind the fissure opened out into a dark tunnel just big enough for them to walk upright caitlin resisted mallorys attempts to keep her away and tended to his wounds stop being such a man she said at least you didnt say its just a scratch her voice had all the warmth of the real caitlin free of the morrigans hardness in the middle of that cold miserable place it touched him deeply and he gave her arm a quick squeeze she smiled back after what callow did to you i have the feeling theyre just trying to whittle us down a bit at a time once the wounds had started to dry they set off along the tunnel after several yards they became aware of a subtle change the grim lands had a claustrophobic feel as if the very environment was pressing in on all sides but that had lifted mallory found he was breathing easier and the air had richer odours vegetation he guessed and was damper than the dry atmosphere they had been breathing for so long this is weird caitlin whispered etain have you any idea where were going when there was no response caitlin looked back to see that the brothers and sisters of spiders had reverted to the same mechanical movements they had exhibited in the far lands their staring eyes swivelled to lock on to caitlin but they registered no sign of any intelligence uh mallory she began hush he hissed the tunnels coming to an end they emerged near the foot of a hill it was dark and there was a forest all around but ahead of them chinese lanterns glowed in the trees surrounded by fluttering moths an autumnal chill hung in the air and the aroma of ripe fruit damp leaves and fern i dont think were in the grim lands any more mallory said quietly cautiously weapons drawn they made their way down the remainder of the hillside the brothers and sisters of spiders walked steadily behind the lanterns cast a peaceful ambience over the forest setting not far away high in the branches an owl hooted and was answered immediately by another how can we be in the land of the dead and somewhere else at the same time caitlin asked some kind of pocket mallory suggested if the market was tucked away here to stop anyone stumbling across the extinction shears the people would need some kind of atmosphere in which they could thrive because only the dead can exist in the grim lands exactly who has the power to do that mallory he had no answer for her they found themselves on a track that wound into the forest where more of the lanterns clustered in the soft golden glow they could just make out the shapes of the first market stalls and as they neared they could see that it spread out far into the trees ahead why is it so quiet caitlin whispered deserted mallory suggested but as they reached the first stall he could see he was wrong skulls crystals candles mirrors and other magickal items were loaded onto the table under a darkgreen awning behind it stood the owner a man in a broadbrimmed black hat and dark coat he wasnt moving pearly glistening trails of spider webs covered him reaching from the brim of his hat down to the table mallory edged closer to him and touched his hand still alive he said sleeping give him a kiss see if he wakes up sure and if we come across a spinning wheel you get to play with it first the scene was the same at the next stall where books and maps were loaded on the creaking table the dusty webcovered owner was a squat old woman with a warty nose and a scarf holding back her grey hair hesitantly they advanced through the market but everywhere the owners were locked in a deep sleep that appeared to have struck them where they stood at least it keeps resistance to a minimum mallory said we just have to search through all this weird shit try not to get our hands blown off by stuff that looks perfectly normal but is totally lethal find the extinction shears and do it before the hortha gets here okay ticking clock i get it you look over there ill do here he glanced at the brothers and sisters of spiders watching them unmoving no point asking them you keep guard he added with a shout he was surprised when etain and the others obeyed him and shuffled back along the path mallory moved quickly along the stalls he had no idea if the extinction shears would be out in the open or hidden away although his knowledge of the market suggested the owners had scant regard for the dangerous nature of the items they sold caveat emptor was the sole motto the wonders on display were so dazzling that he had to fight not to be seduced by them some he guessed were entrancing him magickally on some level beyond conscious thought and he kept his attention skittering across the objects to prevent them from hooking him in everything he could imagine was available sometimes when he returned to a stall for a second look the objects on it had changed adding another disconcerting twist to his search there were weapons of all kinds swords magic axes hammers daggers poisons and potions to achieve any outcome maps of every place hed heard of and many he was convinced only existed in stories stuffed animals statues whose eyes followed him as he passed musical instruments flutes made from human bone lyres skincovered drums medical instruments implements of torture mysterious creatures in cages that slept just like their owners tarot cards playing cards talking greeting cards curse cards hats cloaks belts some magic some perfectly normal and in the main a host of artefacts that mallory couldnt begin to comprehend behind one stall a beautiful voluptuous woman stood with one hand on a cobwebfestooned cat at the front of her stall was a crystal ball mallory gave it only a cursory glance but it snared him instantly mesmerised he peered into its depths where he saw not the distorted reflection of his face but the skull beneath his skin the more he stared the more it drew him in whispering this is who you are he was thrown roughly to the ground caitlin hauled him to his feet and shook him until his sense returned sorry but ive been trying to rouse you for ten minutes she said you were gone thats not all it was as if you were trying to pull the flesh from your face the skin around mallorys jaw was sore to the touch even so he found himself irresistibly drawn back to the crystal ball until caitlin shook him again and dragged him halfstumbling across the path to the stalls she had been inspecting ive found them she said at least i think i have this is the only thing that comes close tucked away incongruously behind a pile of rags was a pair of shears with ornate gold handles and though they appeared to radiate no light mallory saw a white glow wash over caitlin and himself as he examined them mallory had the impression that he wasnt looking at a pair of shears at all but something infinitely larger and more mysterious several potential images an intricate clockwork machine a crystal skittered across his mind but it always came back to a pair of shears what do you think caitlin asked mallory had the strange impression that he had seen the shears before as though in a dream he decided it was instinct but he was much surer than he ought to have been thats them as he reached for them a silver candlestick on the table in front of his fingers moved he cried out and leaped back what the fu the candlestick flowed like mercury rolling itself into a silver egg and then sprouting legs it scurried across the table to the edge and dropped to the ground a caraprix caitlin exclaimed i thought they were all in that room at the court with jerzy not all of them apparently all across the market the tables became alive with objects moving changing shape glowing with a silvery light as the caraprix scuttled to the ground and streamed towards the far side of the market mallory saw in them an eerie reflection of the army of the ten billion spiders delicately plucking the extinction shears from the table mallory was unsettled by how warm and yielding they felt under his fingers hastily he slipped them into the bag at his belt then turned his attention back to the caraprix the stream of shapeshifting creatures led to a point where the forest came to an end and only rock walls lay beyond a glassy quality to the air right along the boundary gave the impression that they were standing in a bubble the caraprix spread out along the boundary and came to a halt exuding a bright white light that slowly spread upwards into a tenfoothigh rectangle as the quality of the light changed mallory and caitlin realised they were looking through a window onto the terrain of another world where steaming jungle came up hard against a vast golden desert the far lands caitlin said in the hardedged voice of the morrigan a doorway back mallory noted so we dont have to go through that ritual math forced us to learn im not even convinced he was sure it would work so the caraprix brought the market here caitlin said looks like it the perfect hiding place caitlin slipped her hand into mallorys and gave it a squeeze he was troubled by how quickly she appeared to be flipping back and forth between her true self and the part corrupted by the morrigan as if she was assimilating the goddess into her being then thats mission accomplished she said lets go caitlin was interrupted by the sounds of fighting behind them racing back the way they had come they found the brothers and sisters of spiders in fierce combat with the hortha which was just inserting one extended thorny finger through tanniss forehead with a dry cracking noise it burst through the rear of his skull and tannis crumpled to the ground the dim light in those dead eyes finally extinguished instantly it turned its rustling papery face towards mallory and caitlin nowhere to run now it called drily owein and branwen attacked it with their swords hacking through the dense blackthorn body only for it to sprout and grow back almost instantly etain glanced back questioningly and mallory shouted can you hold it off till we get away for the first time mallory saw deep in her eyes the merest hint of the sister of dragons she had once been it brought a pang of conscience but he reminded himself that her time had passed yet she continued to stare at him with a hint of desperation and he realised she was trying to communicate with him he knew instinctively what she wanted to say ill tell him he called branwen fell as the hortha avoided her strike and punched the twisted spike into her forehead as mallory and caitlin ran they glimpsed owein dropping too and then etain was fighting alone sacrificing herself for the people she had once been driven to destroy the atmospheric conditions of the forest setting were altering fast it was warmer and mallory and caitlin felt as if they were running through treacle spatial dimensions distorted and time itself came in stuttering fits and starts so it felt as if they were speeding towards their destination then frozen as the world around them moved trails of light flowed from the chinese lanterns swinging wildly in the branches the market began to compress and stretch towards the door created by the caraprix the view across the far lands was now much clearer and they could feel the tropical heat of the jungle and the dry wind blowing across the desert pausing mallory grabbed caitlins hand you ready he asked weve come this far together why stop now she gave him a warm smile of deep affection back to life he said back to reality of sorts they took the great leap together though the small campfire burned continually in the cave it couldnt dispel the bitterness of the unending winter outside nor the chill in millers heart he had tended to hunter jack and virginia night and day but had now reached the point of ultimate despair their decline had accelerated and he was forced to accept the impossibility of keeping them all alive surviving on occasional birds and rabbits he trapped in the snow while constantly evading the roaming fomorii had taken its toll both physically and emotionally drawing on his healing force so often was also sapping his own powers of recuperation the futility of it ate into his bones much more deeply than the aching cold while there was life he had to keep on trying but now he had to make the choice he had dreaded sacrifice one in the hope that it would leave him strong enough to save the other two tears froze on his cheeks hed been crying on and off for most of the afternoon while he wrestled with the arguments and his own corrosive guilt but finally he had made the decision hed known he would have to make all along crawling over to where hunter lay eyes closed as if he were sleeping miller laid one hand on his friends barely beating heart choking on the words he whispered i dont know if you can hear me i hope you can im so sorry hunter he took a deep breath ive thought long and hard ive prayed i cant see another way out every life is equal to me hunter but not every life is equal for what church wants us to do youre a brother of dragons youre important but jack is one of the two keys him and me were needed somehow if were ever going to stop the void and virginia if i can ever get her back to church she knows a way into the fortress shes vital to us striking right at the heart of the enemy and that leaves you we need you of course we do but not as much as we need the other two laying his head on hunters chest he whispered why do i have to make this choice its not fair after a moment he sat up and dried his eyes no im up to this thats whats expected of me hunter im going to have to stop keeping you alive and transfer all the power ive got left to the other two in the hope that i can cure them completely if you can hear me please forgive me there it was done taking a moment to steady himself he went to virginia and drew up the searing blue light inside him once that was done he moved on to jack and then flopped exhausted against the foot of the cave wall and cried some more his eyes had barely dried when he noticed blood trickling from his nose it was accompanied by the sickening sensation of a heaviness in his head as if something was moving around inside his skull faces of departed friends and family flashed across his mind but it was hunters that came back repeatedly looming larger each time leave me alone he whispered scared now the deathimages came harder threatening to destroy his sanity bring him out the voice rolled in from the wilderness beyond the cave mouth colder than the winds of winterside no miller whispered defiantly my brother my deathbrother bring him out miller was too weak to fight with a last great effort miller dragged hunter into the swirling snow further down the slope stood the giant that hunter had freed from its prison far beneath the halls of the drakusa he still wore his hood but although miller had never seen him before his brain crackled with images of the devastated meltedwax face that lay beneath as the cold alien intellect teased and probed dread consumed him so deeply he thought he would die from the weight of it but the giant would not let him his thoughts were too weak to resist its control i am eldigahwislor the final judgement of the drakusa the dark at the end the breath of the grave the giant said i am death and i bring death brought to being for one purpose to end the plague of the caraprix i was not allowed to fulfil my destiny but now in that one i see another purpose you cant have him miller croaked futilely he whispers on the edge of death i hear him now when i could not hear him before his whispers ring out across the mountains of this place and deep into the darkest places beneath the mountains he is death and i am death and we share a destiny he can teach me he can give me purpose miller realised that a connection had been forged between the giant and hunter once the healing had been withdrawn give him to me no give him to me and i will give him life so he can join me in the pursuit of death you you can save him that i cannot do but i can give him life hesitating for just a moment miller stumbled through the thick snow to the giant without a thought for his own safety the giant took hunter from his arms with surprising tenderness and turned back down the slope miller followed in the lee of some rocks there was a large cave entrance that miller had not come across before in his random searches for food striding into the dark the giant continued into a tunnel large enough to accommodate his height it drove deep into the heart of the mountain through a series of forgotten chambers once occupied by the drakusa their floors now covered with shattered masonry and discarded weapons for what felt like miles the tunnel sloped down sharply until miller became convinced they were going to the core of the world finally they entered a chamber in the deepest part of the complex it stretched far into the dark on all sides the echoes so dim it could well have gone on for ever fear gripped miller when he saw that the chamber was filled with an army of fomorii warriors waiting silently in ranks their black skin gleaming over shields and weapons grown from their own bodies they could have been glorious obsidian statues except for the humming waves of power that washed off them miller trembled as he followed the giant amongst the horde but they never even acknowledged his presence can the giant control so many ferocious beings he wondered how powerful is he the giant came to a halt before a large stone well more than twenty feet across blue light radiated from the depths shimmering like the sun off water miller could feel the rejuvenating force of the blue fire long before he neared the lip what is this he asked in awe the well between worlds standing with his head bowed and his body tense the giant remained in the shadows just beyond the pool of light this was the last desperate act of the drakusa their last great act while they created me to destroy the caraprix they also constructed this conduit to the very heart of existence itself why they thought if they could not destroy the caraprix they could return them to the source the caraprix come from existence the caraprix are existence but i i thought they were a danger they destroyed the drakusa didnt they how can they belong to existence if they go against life after a moment of humming silence the giant said the well shows that the drakusa were capable of miraculous things yet they were given over to war and destruction this to reach into the very heart of all there is how great is that achievement so many have tried to touch existence even to begin to approach it and in their last desperate hours the drakusa did what no other had an odd note of regret laced his voice bring hunter here then miller said excitedly i can use this to heal him i cannot approach the blue fire is anathema to me i am death miller took hunter from the giants arms and staggered towards the well his head reeling from the tremendous sense of wellbeing that rose up from it as he rested hunter on the small stone wall he had a moment to reflect on the irony of the situation death giving life to the dying and then he placed one hand on hunters chest and thrust the other into the aurora of sapphire light his instant invigoration was overcome by the sensation of the currents of power moving through him the cold touch of the giant in his head disappeared and in its place he heard warm whispers though he couldnt make out the words he felt reassured and at peace he looked down into the brilliant light and thought he saw things swimming there deep down whatever they were they uplifted him too hunter spasmed and coughed and slowly the paleblue tinge of his skin flushed a healthy pink his eyes flickering open he looked into millers face hunter youre going to be okay hunters lips moved so weakly that miller couldnt hear what he was saying he pressed his ear close i said bring me wine and a woman ive got some catching up to do the warm midsummer night was filled with the exuberance of the feast but ruth pushed her way through the revellers with mounting frustration were never going to find rachel in this chaos she said the campfires blazing amongst the makeshift huts only illuminated the milling bodies and beyond their light the shadows were deep i do not understand why she is of any interest to the enemy now shavi replied in the far lands yes she was the key to our returning here but now i dont even get why they wanted to stop us coming home veitch said youd think theyd be happy with us running away tom muttered something acerbic under his breath shavi came to a halt when he saw laura was falling behind keep up in this crowd it will take all night to find you if you get lost laura smiled didnt reply with an exclamation of irritation ruth stopped outside a roundhouse keep watch outside she said at the doorway im going to fly puzzled shavi began but you do not have any of the balms and the ritual takes i dont need any of that here her eyes blazed you need any help veitch said hesitantly ruth smiled ill be fine just watch over my body i dont want the enemy attacking it while im out of it in the cool of the roundhouse she sat crosslegged against one wall and closed her eyes letting her breathing become measured as the sounds of the revelry receded reaching deep inside herself she became still concentrated focused she was surprised and a little scared by how easy it was becoming to use the craft when she was being tortured in the court of endless horizons she had put her ability to fly down to the pain and the fear disengaging her mind but now she knew the truth she was getting stronger she was getting better but the power was seductive once before it had almost consumed her could she control it now even though she was older wiser honed by experience she reached down even further through her body and into the earth where she could feel the gentle reassuring pulse of the blue fire her fears faded and were supplanted by the rightness of what she was doing in the cool cavern of her mind the primal sanctuary of the human against the terrifying dangers of the unknown beyond she envisaged the symbol that had come to represent both the ritual of flight and a word of power it was a blazing blue mandala that was image and word and will and act rolled into one a second later her essence rushed up out of her head through the roundhouse roof and into the night sky in the first hallucinogenic dislocation she felt a wave of affection for shavi laura veitch and tom waiting anxiously by the door and then another wave of love for the wild feasting throng she didnt know any of them but she was linked to them all individually and as a group on the deepest levels rising up higher she saw the campfires and the village in the context of the broader landscape the dark canvas of fields the strips of roads the lights of salisbury and the subtle lines of blue fire connecting it all her chest swelled as she took it all in and understood deeply for the first time in a long while why they were fighting so hard with an effort she wrenched herself from the revelation and swooped down low over the camp seeing everything hearing all systematically she searched until she reached the fringes of habitation where the lonely countryside eventually lapped up against the welllit aroads the full moon painted the grassland a magical silver against which lay the charcoal strokes of trees and hedges flying low over the ancient grasscovered monuments of the ritual landscape ruth scanned for any sign of movement in a dense copse her attention was distracted by a large owl seemingly watching her from the low branches in its huge eyes she saw echoes of her own familiar slaughtered by the libertarian in greece a companion if not a friend whom she still missed acutely she was not surprised when it spoke to her sister of dragons you know what i am ruth floated an inch above the ground in the centre of the clearing not exactly more owls flapped down to settle on branch after branch and there was constant movement in the grass as a flood of cats rats hares frogs snakes and mice drew near to observe her with eerily intelligent eyes our kind are as old as time the owl had developed unsettling human characteristics during the time her attention had been on the other creatures we have always shepherded the sisterhood of the craft guiding and teaching and punishing where necessary every sister needs a guide on the dangerous path you walk this is the role we have been given and some of our kind have even developed a fondness for those we shape some we have demanded little in return save obeisance to the weft and the weave when all is connected to harm one harms all ruth shivered at the weight behind the eyes that lay upon her in her spirit form sometimes when she looked askance she could almost glimpse their true shapes but it was too frightening for her to give it her full attention you of all our charges understood that you of all have proven yourself the greatest and the most deserving of our guidance after the death of our cousin your companion you were left bereft the bond unfulfilled that slaughter the first in long years struck at the very heart of our kind and so the council of yekyua was summoned ruth was now surrounded by people with the characteristics of animals squatting like beasts yellow and green and red eyes ranging fur and talons and fangs this world is in peril this magickal land that we have helped protect for so long this crucible for existences greatest force in the long war and so we must act sister of dragons you no longer stand alone you do not have one companion on the hard road you have many the blue fire burns in the craft the blue fire burns in our hearts know this world will be protected come what may silence fell across the assemblage ruth was surprised and empowered by the clear respect she could sense they held for her thank you im grateful the brothers and sisters of dragons need your help now more than ever she paused looked deeply into the faces before her seeing endless possibilities then i have a request for you not long after as ruth returned to her body the moonwashed countryside was alive with wildlife sweeping out into every hidden nook and cranny overhead the owls flew majestic fierce with eyes that could see an insect a mile distant beneath the turf the blue fire pulsed and grew stronger rachel regained consciousness on a public footpath winding across salisbury plain to where a silver bmw was parked on the side of a quiet lane dragged across the turf by her wrist every joint in her body burned her left eye had closed up blood ran from her nose and into her mouth from her pulped lips one tooth was chipped there was a sharp pain in her ribs and her right knee had ballooned please scott she began but it hurt so much to talk that her voice was little more than a rasp what the fuck did you think you were doing he growled he was angry bloodstains spattered his neatly ironed blue shirt not so long ago she would have cried and begged for his forgiveness offered him her body promised he could do whatever he wanted i can do whatever i want he stopped and kicked her sharply in the side pain shot up her spine bringing hot tears but she hid her face from him im not going back with you she blazed he punched her on the side of the face why do you keep opening your stupid mouth cant you see every time you say something moronic it hurts you dont want pain you keep quiet im not staying quiet any more she gasped ive got a right to be who i want to be letting go of her wrist he grabbed a handful of her hair dragged her a few more feet and then threw her down on the turf standing over her he said with conviction you need me you cant survive without me i can thats the way its always been women need men we have to do all the things youre too weak and pathetic to tackle you try to drag us down but were the real power he bunched both his fists i dont want to do this i love you rachel despite all your stupid ways i love you but youve got to learn that you cant carry on like this or well never be happy as he prepared to swing his fist he realised rachel was looking past him with an expression of awe the first thing he saw were the roiling clouds and jagged bolts of lightning dancing wildly across the grassland though the rest of the sky was as clear and starsprinkled as it had been all night thunder boomed and then out of the tightly localised storm walked a woman her hair flowing around her like snakes her face blazing with an inner light she was a ghost a demon she terrified him on either side of her a carpet of animals undulated towards him their eyes glittering her face he thought i cant look into her face as she rushed across the landscape towards him an unaccountable feeling of dread filled him rachel was forgotten and when he saw that the woman was floating an inch or so above the grass he wanted to turn and run but his legs would not respond youre going to get it now rachel croaked with a note of glee old instincts surfaced and he cursed and ran towards her ready to punch and kick a blast of wind smacked him in the chest with the force of a car flipping him up and over he heard a rib break as he had heard rachels crack earlier his fear obscured any pain and he scrambled to his feet too late the woman was upon him her eyes filled with fire he swung out but she ducked and brought the staff of the spear she was carrying up hard against his chin my name is ruth gallagher her voice appeared to be echoing from the bottom of a well the rules have changed now no man gets to do what youve done here dont hurt me he pleaded ruth examined the mess he had made of rachel barely recognisable as she attempted to heave herself up to her feet and when ruth looked back at him there was no hint of compassion in her gaze your kind cant be taught she said you cant be socialised or have the violence drained out of you its who you are people like you youre the ones who give the void the power it needs to keep ruling this place scott whimpered and shook his head pathetically just as ruth thought he was about to fall to his knees and beg he lashed out at her with a short kitchen knife hed pulled from his belt the knife lanced towards her belly and came up hard she watched his bovine expression as he tried to force it into her then the flicker of fear when he realised he couldnt withdraw his hand either the libertarian brought you here didnt he she asked when scott didnt answer one of his fingers uncurled from the knife against his will bent back and snapped he howled in pain yes he cried yes he wanted you to hurt rachel he wanted you to mess her up badly yes scott shouted ruth snapped another finger for good measure scott howled again as the knife fell to the ground ruth thought of callow slicing laura in the back of a van so long ago of demetra and the women in greece brutalised but trying to carve a life for themselves of the pain shed suffered in the court of endless horizons and she said simply ive had enough rachel hesitated but ruth nodded to her to make her way to the bmw limping she set off and never looked back even when she heard the screech of the owls the spitting of the cats and the fierce rending of claws and fangs even when she heard scotts scream highpitched and reedy going on too long briefly the violent sounds paused and there came a terrifying voice she didnt recognise you gave no one any chances but im giving you one ill leave you with an inch of life a slim space where you can choose to make a difference or not crawl away in your own blood learn a lesson keep it for the rest of your life because if you ever backtrack ever these creatures will be watching you wherever you are and theyll act with all the fury of the natural world and none of your pleading will do any good the birds and the beasts resumed their attack and the cries rose up once more perched on the top of a fivebar gate the libertarian watched the churning fur and feathers and the little black storm moving back across the grassland towards the distant campfires sometimes justice comes red in tooth and claw he mused wryly manipulation sometimes involved big gestures and sometimes only a little shove particularly when one knew the subtle motivations deepest fears and heartfelt hopes of a person the kind only voiced to a lover in the dark he was growing increasingly desperate as events moved towards the final reckoning without the clear outcome he required but here he felt success ruth knew he had guided the vile boyfriend to the woman purely so that the welldressed thug could beat her until she bled but the libertarian knew ruth would not blame him for that oh no unconsciously she would draw connections between church and the libertarian she would know church had passed on the knowledge of scott and rachels relationship had brought the two together so that sickening violence could ensue for if she believed that the seeds of the libertarian were already in church it was only a small step backwards from the terrible monstrous libertarian arranging for a woman to be nearbeaten to death to the current love of her life what lurks in churchs mind she wonders he laughed what hidden hatreds what ability for abuse what contempt and violence perhaps he doesnt even recognise it himself but is it there ticking away ready to explode a small thing the thin end of the wedge perhaps prising her apart from her love pushing her towards veitch a simple man but always a protector of women and thereby pushing church towards the libertarian yes he thought a fine outcome for a nights work church stood just beyond the outer ring of stonehenge high above the megaliths the moon cast intricate shadowpatterns across the surrounding grassland it was still and quiet and it felt to him as if there was magic everywhere how long it felt since tom had first revealed to him the secret of the blue fire at these stones and he had become a willing supplicant to the numinous spirituality that pervaded these sites across the world a few rocks roughly shaped and proudly raised towards the stars millennia ago yet they provided a window to the heart of existence breathless after his run from the processional river path he approached the stones as any supplicant would have thousands of years ago looking from the dark silhouettes to the stars and the moon breath held in awe and feeling the charge of wellbeing rising from the earth this is our land he thought defiantly this is who we are this is why we fight the seemingly random connections and coincidences that had brought him back to earth to recover the first had served another effect renewing his purpose in the far lands the libertarian had done everything in his power to break his spirit and drive him off the path but here he could see clearly think breathe he moved into the circle electricity buzzed around his fingertips as he stroked them along the megaliths in passing and once out of the direct moonlight he could see the faint blue light limning every stone narrowing his eyes he let the pendragon spirit drive his perception after a moment he saw the serpent amongst the stones as his ancestors had done so long ago a sinuous trail of blue fire forming a spiral pattern that had so entranced the celts they had carved it into stones and worn it on their jewellery a symbol for the path a human takes through life which was also a real manifestation which was also a symbol for life itself did it have other meanings too he walked to the centre of the spiral death and rebirth into a new life and drove both hands palms down onto the turf blue sparks flew and within seconds the ground trembled and a large area rose up to reveal a tunnel leading into the depths the womb from which all life emerged quickly he scrambled inside the tunnel led to a large cavern the glistening rocks overhead washed by a sapphire light emanating from a lake of blue fire one of the reservoirs that fed the searing leys crisscrossing the land scattered all along the rocky shore was treasure beyond imagining gold coins chalices plates jewellery ornaments silver artefacts weapons helmets chain mail ritual offerings to the great power from across generations beneath the waves a dark shape swam sinuously the liquid fire cascaded off the fabulous beasts head as it surfaced in front of him as majestic and aweinspiring as the first time he had encountered it scales tines and horns glimmered in the blue light and the leathern wings gradually unfolded from beneath the fire behind it he could see smaller newer beasts swimming the creature towered over him the heat from its breath enough to bring him out in a sweat but he wasnt afraid looking it deep in the eye he let their consciousnesses merge coping with the queasiness of processing two images in his mind him looking at the fabulous beast the beast looking back at him i know theres more to you he said to the creature to himself what are you existence a deep masculine voice rang out strong and clear across the cavern but when church turned he saw the same woman he had encountered with the fabulous beast in the cavern under boskawenun in cornwall more than two thousand years earlier pale skin black hair eyes burning with the blue fire i gave you knowledge and purpose the last time we met the woman continued although her lips did not move as the fabulous beast moved beside the woman its scales and bone and tissue changed until it appeared as if it was made of the blue fire two of you church said two faces theres that duality thing again another of those patterns that keeps repeating through the universe the dark and the light are spread throughout all there is in every fibre every atom the woman said but to enable direct change the two powers must focus upon one place one time the devourer of all things has chosen the burning man and existence manifests in this form church interrupted youve been influencing things directly all along there is a reason why all things have happened from the very smallest to the greatest in your own personal story there is a reason you have been shaped schooled prepared for everything that lies ahead you were chosen brother of dragons the first and the last the once and future of all the brothers and sisters of dragons only you can join your consciousness with the essence of existence in this corporeal place only you the words stung church as he began to understand their deeper meaning the murder of my girlfriend marianne necessary being torn apart from ruth and hurled back in time having to fight my way back to her seeing her torn between veitch and me all necessary all part of the shaping of the hero the king who will save the land the libertarian there was a long pause before the rich deep voice continued there is always a risk death is a powerful catalyst the experience of it shapes the soul but its potency can sometimes lead to corruption and despair the other factors in the transmutation should mitigate against that love friendship support but in the final account the landscape of a human heart and a human mind is unmappable so i could still ruin all your careful planning the fate of everything rests with you jack churchill shavi was right the pattern church said to himself his head spinning as he tried to accept the weight of what he was being told how much has been manipulated everything in every life sometimes fragile creatures make choices against the direction of the plan choices with unforeseen but enormous consequences and other changes must be made to reaffirm the pattern but essentially everything everybody plays a part the person they choose to hurt the one they choose to help the work they do the things they create the words they pass on which then get passed on to others everything the pattern materialises in seemingly random events and coincidences in ancient tales and contemporary stories and music and works of art in the patterns in nature the patterns on the landscape the patterns men make in life numbers are key the hand of existence is clear if one only looks with care but we always dismiss it church said the human brain has evolved from the earliest time to see patterns in everything but we dismiss it as a quirk a throwback in the same way we dismiss random events and connections as coincidences there are no coincidences his thoughts raced the legends the old stories are the key to the pattern the king shaped by events to be a great hero who waits in some symbolic underhill to be called back in the worlds darkest hour with his knights to beat the forces of darkness the king who represents both a man and the blue fire the same story repeated over and over in different legends even in modern religions in a slightly different form theres the pattern in its biggest form theres me you are the legend you are at the heart of the pattern church looked into the womans face and then into the shimmering features of the fabulous beast and was convinced he saw a glimmer of something important that was unspoken if this was all the creation of a dying brain then i would be the heart of the pattern because i created everything id be the true god of this world what is life what is death what is real what is not church could see he wasnt going to get anywhere with that line of questioning and this pattern thats been building its designed to overthrow the void yes and it began when at the beginning and it will end at the end deep in the lake of blue fire the dark shapes swam closer some large some small tell me he began how the pattern developed then maybe i can work out how its going to end in the beginning tiny shards of existence were placed in every fragile creature hidden in plain sight from the devourer of all things these sparks in some would eventually fan into the blue blaze of the pendragon spirit and in everyone over time church added thats part of the gnostic secret and the key to humanity reaching the next level thats why the tuatha de danaan were so afraid we would equal then surpass them fragile creatures gradually ascended shaped by their experiences and the spark inside them flickered into a flame still beyond the perception of the devourer of all things forged by the many challenges in the crucible of life the pendragon spirit became stronger and fragile creatures became stronger and more able to face the demands that would be made of them existence set everything going from the start church realised the good and the bad a cascade of events each one impacting on the next the woman smiled everyone has been manipulating everyone else the tuatha de danaan and the fomorii manipulating humanity but you and the void were manipulating them and us and each other nothing is clear its all movements in the fog and you only find out the consequences much later he considered this the tuatha de danaan used the fomorii so that the brothers and sisters of dragons would bring about the golden ones return and the fomorii god balor was supposed to stop humanity rising up the ladder but but because we got involved shavi ended up getting killed and veitch went to the grim lands to bring him back and that break in the rules of the universe attracted the attention of the void and brought it back here and thats exactly what you wanted his thoughts raced away with him and he had to steady himself existence arranged for the brothers and sisters of dragons to play a part in all of this and you directed the tuatha de danaan behind the scenes because you wanted the fall to happen the fall removed your brothers and sisters of dragons from the heart of the pattern so that a new five could arise who would also play a vital part mallory caitlin hal hunter and the forgotten one brought together with particular skills so they could operate for a time beyond the perception of the devourer of all things so they could bring their peculiar skills to this time this fight at the end this was all present right from the start the golden ones had legends of this happening so did humanity the final pattern was fully formed at the beginning and embedded in everything from the smallest part to the greatest there to be discovered if you only had eyes to see he repeated so right back in the iron age me setting up the brothers and sisters of dragons the rise of the culture who are here now protecting this site and you the formation of the watchmen you directed all that with a subtle push here and another there his proximity to the reservoir of blue fire soothed him but there was still a dull spike in his gut all the pain we suffered all that terrible heartache you caused that indirectly or not to a definite end that doesnt make it any easier steadying himself he tried not to think of all the awful things he had gone through to become the force that existence wanted it felt so unfair he could have lived a quiet life untouched by strife lived and died and left no mark by his passing but he could have been content is being content enough the woman said reading his mind in the final reckoning do you judge the value of your life by what you had or by what you could have had his head knew the answer his heart dragged him in another direction that is the eternal dichotomy of the fragile creature the woman said perceptively the curse and the gift what happens at the end when we can all see the final pattern that is up to you how did i guess he said bitterly for a moment the ringing cavern was filled only with the faint hiss of the flickering blue fire and then church said i came here to take you to the far lands with me and i have been waiting for you to come for me brother of dragons we are joined inextricably for alltimetocome and alltimegone then lets go his thoughts were still swimming but everything that had been planned for so long was so close to a resolution that he could put his doubts and fears to one side it all came down to him whether he was capable of navigating what lay ahead whether he had learned enough and whether he was prepared to make the final sacrifices that would be demanded of him church strode from the cavern behind him he could hear the tornsailcloth sound of wings growing louder not just one pair but more and more joining every second until the sound was deafening and the cavern shook emerging into the summery night in the moonshadow of the ancient stones church was surprised to find the morvren waiting for him in an eerie crescent of blueblack feathers unmoving every beady eye fixed upon him they had always appeared as a portent following him in a detached manner this was different as he looked around the semicircle he felt a similar connection to the one he had experienced in the cavern they were a part of him now this symbol of death joining him at the same time as he had raised the spirit of life two sides two faces i am the raven king he said quietly i can do anything he smiled the heavy beat of a different kind of wings grew louder far behind him tearing out of the hidden caverns of the soul and into the harshness of the real world underneath his feet the blue fire surged into the land it was now so powerful in the leys that he could see it glowing through the grass battle had been declared bleedin hell would you look at that veitch pointed beyond the circle of campfire light to the wild dark countryside beyond a swarm of spiders seethed towards the celebrations and stonehenge but they had come to a halt in a vast arc around the ancient sacred complex swirling around an invisible wall that sent them spilling in all directions as they searched for ingress the blue fires holding them at bay toms faint smile was lit by the hot coal of his rollup and thats not all look the reignited leys burned across the landscape and where they crossed the stream of spiders there were flashes of blue light as the spiders burst into flames never seen that before veitch said in awe neither has the army of the ten billion spiders ruth had arrived behind them veitch and tom could both see she was changed in some way they couldnt quite define she appeared to be carrying a great weight this place is crackling with power like it was before the mundane spell took effect the spiders have lost their grip yeah veitch said this is our turf now dont get too wound up tom said every time you have reignited the power in the land the spiders have changed everything to reinforce the mundane spell and drive the blue fire back into a dormant phase this is still different ruth said its never been this strong something has changed this is what were fighting for veitch said this here now they were interrupted by a breathless shavi laura has gone shes probably just on the lash with that homebrew alcohol this lot are swilling veitch jerked a thumb towards the revellers singing loudly amongst the huts i do not think so shavi appeared devastated whats wrong ruth slipped a comforting arm around his shoulders she was last seen walking back towards the warp zone i am afraid i am afraid she has gone to warn the enemy of our plans i am afraid she was the traitor amongst us he wiped away a stray tear nah veitch said shes a bitch all right but a traitor no chance her heart was always in the right place shed never sell us out he could see shavi ruth and tom were not convinced whats church going to think ruth said if she has done it i mean betrayed by someone we all put our faith in someone church was once really close to does it destroy hope in the pendragon spirit tom asked does it breed despair hope is what keeps the spirit alive before they could consider it further the night was torn by the thunder of wings an awed silence fell across the camp as all eyes turned to the sky glimmering in the moonlight the fabulous beasts moved steadily towards the warp zone their scales glinting like jewels occasional bursts of golden liquidfire illuminating the land beneath them he did it tom said smiling to himself bloody hell veitchs strained voice reflected the wonder that was heavy in all their faces yes ruth said yes this is it veitch grinned broadly this is where we take the fight back to the bastards chapter ten towards the fortress in the dead heat a stifling desolation choked the blasted lands the dry ochre dust of the hardpan licked up to jagged rocks and dead twisted trees reaching blackened hands towards the bleached sky in the craters pools of foulsmelling rainbowstreaked oil attracted clouds of fat lazy flies droning constantly this was the land that the void had built just visible through the haze hanging in the distance was a structure so large that at first it appeared to be a part of the landscape a soaring bluff stretching across the whole length of the horizon its brown granite charred here and there by great fires above it black birds swirled like gulls scavenging a refuse tip but as the eye adjusted to the perspective jarring details emerged in opposition to natural law disturbing angles unsettling proportions materials with the gleam of plastic or metal or the sickly resilience of meat and the birds could not be birds much larger than any known living creature their scavenging took on a menacing air it was the fortress of the enemy known by some as the house of pain a complex as large as a city constantly under construction with no end in sight as it crept relentlessly across the landscape exuding a potent atmosphere of black depression for all its artifice there was still a sense that in some way it was alive the burning man towered above black smoke pothering from the flaming outline scrambling down the scree of a steep hillside the first sight of the fortress brought church ruth shavi veitch and tom to a sudden halt they told themselves it was the imposing sight that affected them so deeply and tried to ignore the unsettling alien whispers that insinuated into the back of their heads big veitch shielded his eyes against the sun what he didnt say told them more about his feelings swarming with lamentbrood redcaps and god knows what else ruth said i mean how many of them must be inside a building that size are we expected to fight past every one yes go right up and knock on the door tom said tartly virginia could have shown us the secret path into the fortress church noted but shes not here so weve got to find another way we know the path exists if we could find it tom snorted derisively stumble across it perhaps veitch flinched and church steadied him with a subtle nod whatever if laura is in there theyll be ready for us he felt the skitter of quick glances upon him he knew why he could barely believe laura had betrayed them and the more he allowed the concept to settle upon him the more despairing he felt they needed to be five united as one for the pendragon spirit to be most effective every new development destabilised them a little further causing fissures to spread throughout relationships he had considered solid he felt the hand of the libertarian upon it sickeningly his own hand he had underestimated his alter egos capability for subtlety the brash theatrical exterior of the libertarian had been a distraction and now looked clever and carefully designed they skidded down the remainder of the scree and raised clouds of sticky yellow dust as they trudged across the hardpan towards the fortress after ten minutes shavi brought them to a halt movement he whispered subtly indicating a crumbling rock formation that resembled a finger pointing at the sky that eyes a bloody good deal mate veitch said veitch and church kicked up a large cloud of dust which allowed veitch the cover to approach the rock on the blindside of where shavi had seen the movement when he disappeared behind the outcropping they waited for the sound of a fight but within a few seconds veitch was hailing them from a ledge on the side of the rock they found him with his arm around a ruddyfaced brother of dragons with a thatch of wiry blond hair who was grinning broadly john baker was a seventeenthcentury farmhand church had discovered him lifting a cart to mend a broken wheel a remarkable feat of strength that was matched only by the depth of his good humour never thought id see the day he said in a broad cornish accent the rest of the army of dragons is here veitch said ar whats left of em the grim note in bakers voice was quickly replaced by the grin ive been out on patrol for a day and night orders were to find you and bring you in but we were afraid youd already gone inside there and thatd be the last wed see of you we wouldnt leave you out of the fun veitch said lets go and get everybody tooled up this is where it all kicks off an expanse of rocks dust and haze gave way suddenly to a colourful camp as they passed through the boundary of the glamour with a pang of regret they saw it was smaller than they had hoped but the cheers that rose up the instant they were seen wiped away any dismal thoughts for a while a knot of about ninety brothers and sisters of dragons were suddenly swallowed by a significantly larger crowd of jostling gods the commotion quickly devolving into a number of fights and arguments church was pleased to see lugh a wan smile lighting a face that had grown too grim he shook churchs hand heartily welcome back brother of dragons i knew you would not be deterred from your mission how are your people less than a tenth of the army survive the court of the soaring spirit was destroyed many fled how many survive across the far lands i do not know lugh accompanied church and the others into the leaders tent church expected to see decebalus planning strategy around the large wooden table in the centre of the tent but instead it was ronnie his first world war uniform giving him some gravitas but his face showing the weight of expectations upon him aula was with him decebalus is dead she said bluntly he sacrificed himself to prevent the enemy gaining the caraprix he will always be remembered as a great hero she held her head proudly but her grief was clear im sorry church said he was a good man i was proud to call him my friend aula nodded curtly and restrained a sad smile pleased to have you back sir ronnie said relieved i presume youll be taking control of the forces now youre going to have to keep that responsibility ronnie were entering the fortress as planned we need someone on the ground to marshal the troops youre the best man for that with your experience i was afraid you were going to say that sir ive heard it once already today the explanation for his comment was revealed as mallory and caitlin marched in throwing themselves into unrestrained hugging and backslapping mission accomplished mallory said though not without a few minor hiccups he handed church a package tightly wrapped in purple velvet church could feel the buzzing energy of the extinction shears even through the material id like to say it was nothing caitlin said with a smile but it really was something mallory turned to veitch tentatively etain is gone and the other three she sacrificed herself to save us that sounds like her i think she loved you in her own way veitch nodded slowly she was a good person who had a raw deal we found a lot in common ill miss her he hesitated thanks for telling me no problem i was wrong about her maybe im wrong about you too everybody deserves a second chance right cautiously with a brief nod they came to terms with each other for a few hours everyone exchanged details of the battles they had fought the ones they had won and the others they had lost mourned friends who had fallen and drew up plans for the fight to come most of all they enjoyed being reunited with old friends and new ones men and gods together at peace in each others company it was a bittersweet time for though they had overcome all odds to be together once again they knew it could well be the last time that knowledge generated a heightened mood where deep emotions thrived once dark had fallen church led the others through the camp in each little enclave the gods sat around campfires telling stories in grave voices or drinking and feasting fighting having sex whichever were the peculiarities of their own particular group the norse were the most raucous followed closely by the greeks in an adjoining camp and at times they appeared to be in competition with each other as to who could revel with the most abandon the chinese were measured and introspective weighing the lessons of the past before considering tactics for the following day in some of the groups the rituals were alien and unsettling the brothers and sisters of dragons were welcomed by all the gods they encountered church declined offer after offer to join this group or that and once they had toured the entire camp he led the others back to the tuatha de danaan where they felt most at home around the fire stripped of their arrogance and facing the harsh reality of their position in the universe the golden ones appeared smaller in stature but somehow more noble than church had ever seen them the mood was restrained but positive and after a while they began to sing the songs stirred the emotions in ways far beyond the simple arrangements of music and words evoking their yearnings for the four lost cities of their homeland gorias finias falias and murias the only places where they would ever feel at peace when they had finished church saw tears in ruths eyes i dont know your homeland but we all long for the same thing she said to lugh we just give it different names a place or a relationship where we can be who we really are somewhere we can put aside the constant struggling and the fears and the anxiety and find peace we will all find our home one day lugh said he turned his attention to church never in our long existence have the tuatha de danaan known hopelessness but now we all feel it pressing tight against our backs the devourer of all things has haunted us since the earliest stories told by my people in our hearts we know it is the end should we fight this battle or would it be best for us to walk away and seek out our homeland attempt to find at least a little of that peace before all falls away every one of the assembled tuatha de danaan turned their attention to church he could see this was a question that had been troubling all of them over the last few days ive been forced to consider a lot of big questions why we are here and what all this around us means he began slowly and ive learned to study life in the smallest detail to find the big answers i dont know if i believe in an end the science of my people suggests there is no such thing the universe starts with a bang expands collapses and then restarts a constant cycle of life and death and thats what we see in nature the big answers are written small he looked to shavi who was nodding all the information encoded in every aspect of everything like every part of a hologram contains all the information possessed by the whole there is no end we can see it around us in the turn of the seasons we can see it in the tarot cards where the fool goes on a journey of enlightenment and when he thinks hes learned everything hes back to the start as the fool again learning once more lugh nodded then the end may be a new start but for the devourer of all things and his followers not for us fair enough but i think the void can be beaten church said the void loves the mundane the normal for all its spiders and its weird army it hates magic and that essentially is what the blue fire is look around you here we are in the heart of this landscape devastated by the void and magic is still here everyone shifted their intense concentration from churchs words and looked around and they saw that he was right the campfire crackled and sent golden sparks swirling upwards in the fragrant woodsmoke tiny stars shimmering with beauty high overhead the real stars shone like ice in a glacial sweep across the black velvet sky as one their breathing slowed and they listened and they felt there was silence in their tiny circle of light and the peace that only came where magic lay we have to use the magickal lessons we learned on our long journey church continued but now he was talking directly to the brothers and sisters of dragons the secret knowledge that kids know and adults forget because its encoded in their stories their books dont stray from the path trust your heart three times is the charm say the name three times call three times and the rest that information comes from the far lands this place is the receptacle of that knowledge for our world to tap into so we learn it for this time this battle the magic is in here church rested his fist against his heart thats what weve learned isnt it on the road after we all got together that first time he looked ruth directly in the eyes on that long trek i made from the iron age back to our time she didnt look away church saw the campfire reflected in her eyes and himself and the past as the frostiness he had sensed since stonehenge slowly slid away friendship she said then hesitantly love it sounds sickly sentimental simplistic she looked to shavi and veitch and then to tom but thats what we learned isnt it five forged into one thats where the magic is and we dont stray from the path she felt for churchs hand out of sight of the others and squeezed it tightly we dont stray from the path she said quietly to herself a low mournful call rang out across the camp that sent goosebumps up churchs arm gradually the tone changed until it became uplifting growing louder a roar of defiance the tuatha de danaan jumped to their feet as one our brother lugh exclaimed peering into the dark beyond the campfire churchs eyes gradually became accustomed to the gloom he could just discern a large figure circling the camp occasionally throwing its head back to roar into the night at times it appeared to be an animal with horns silhouetted against the lighter night sky on other glimpses it appeared to be nothing more than vegetation cernunnos ruth said quietly the green man hes here that should give us hope hes a god one of the oldest things in the land and hes so closely linked to the blue fire church looked up at the spray of stars this could be the last time we see this he put an arm around her shoulders lets make the most of it ruth folded into his arms and rested her head on his shoulder sometimes everything feels such a mess church everything between us should be perfect but im scared that theres some real darkness inside you the libertarian waiting to come out yes i was all ready to keep you at arms length but what you said at the fire about the magic it made me realise what we had and what weve got to fight to keep weve come a long way from beneath albert bridge to this godforsaken place and everything feels as if its been trying to tear us apart but here we are it just shows how fragile everything is we cant take anything for granted you and me what we feel for each other theres always a threat waiting beyond the path in the forest he kissed the top of her head closed his eyes and indulged himself in the warmth from her body i think youre right there is a darkness inside me and you we know what happens when you get caught up in the power of the craft right she stiffened realising the truth of this for the first time and thats how it should be because without that darkness we wouldnt be able to fight wed be useless thats where we find our anger our drive ive been thinking more and more about the rules hidden in life about us and particularly in that whole duality thing its everywhere in every aspect of life two faces light and dark summer and winter even cernunnos has two faces his light side and his dark side the erlking we need both the trick is not to let that darkness dominate i we have to fight every day to keep it under control because theres always a chance it could break through i could become the libertarian you could destroy everything but we can fight and we can win we just mustnt stray from the path of you and me and what we believe in she was silent for a moment he couldnt see her face in the dark to judge her mood then she said but doesnt that mean existence is wrong to destroy the void we need both of them i dont know i do know that the void is going to destroy us and existence if it gets its way this battle has been building since the beginning of time who knows what the outcomes going to be she kissed him deeply im sorry she said for almost making a mess of things thats what we do right behind a tent away from the buzz of people returning to the campfire she pulled him down and kissed him again within moments they were deep in passion an act of love that was also an act of magic the world flashed by the sounds of the camp and the jubilant roar of cernunnos all lost to the rhythm of their bodies and the beat of their blood when they were finished they held each other in silence and remembered what they had overcome to be there neither of them thought about what the following day would bring in the hazy halfworld on the edge of sleep church had an impression of someone circling them slowly close to the ground he saw bright eyes and a wide grin filled with mischief the voice rolled out rich and wry the merry wanderer of the night looks after fools and lovers dream on sweet children and dream the world aright dawn came up hard on the blasted lands the red sun turned the desolate landscape to blood and within an hour the heat was unforgiving the remnants of the army of dragons gathered to see church and the others off church felt undeserving of the awe he saw in their respectful faces but he understood their need for inspiration and moved through them shaking hands and exchanging comments with the ones he knew personally finally he came to ronnie who gave him a formal salute sir youre going to be fine ronnie i miss decebalus sir we all do he glanced at aula in the crowd who had swapped her white roman gown for black armour her face was scrubbed and her hair cut short but youre a brother of dragons ronnie and youll be a better leader than most of the others here youve seen what heartless leadership can do i hope i can do you proud sir just watch out for the fabulous beasts youll know when to make your move church was surprised to see that many of the gods had turned out too tyr clapped him hard on the back and roared with laughter freyja seductively kissed his hand to ruths annoyance and leigong bowed formally the thunder and the lightning are at your disposal brother of dragons he said church was increasingly disturbed to see the other gods watching him with hints of the same awe that had gripped the army of dragons before they had viewed him with contempt or humour was he that changed finally on the edge of the camp the tuatha de danaan waited in gleaming ranks lugh stepped out and took churchs hand and then shook the hands of each of the brothers and sisters of dragons and toms too this may well be the last time we meet he said i am proud to have known you fragile creatures no more you are the equals of the golden ones you are prepared to sacrifice all you have for our race we can do no less for you and if this day the golden ones are eradicated keep us in your hearts and remember us fondly jack giantkiller for we were spoiled and arrogant but we brought joy and magic to the lands and that should be our monument it will be church hesitated and then gave lugh a hug the god appeared surprised at first but accepted the bond as they moved out into the blasted lands church and the others could feel the eyes of the tuatha de danaan on their backs and the attention of the other gods and the army of dragons despite their best intentions it felt like an ending her face streaked with tears her clothes filthy with the sticky ochre dust laura staggered across the blasted lands she had no idea where she was going just that she had to get away away from the consequences of her terrible betrayals and the lies and the guilt if she had stayed with the others she knew she would only have betrayed them again and again until they were all dead like hunter and the dreams of the blue fire and the hopes of all those who believed in existence were ashes she would do that she would destroy anything friends strangers entire worlds she wouldnt stop until there was nothing left she was pleased the blasted lands were so free of moisture shed cried herself out and her abilities needed her to be hydrated to work properly if she kept walking she wondered if she might finally dry up and die like any plant left too long in that place im not human she muttered to herself the girl i was is gone whats here is nothing it doesnt matter any more if i die who would care right her rambling was disturbed by a long low call rolling out across the hardpan through her daze she thought it sounded familiar glancing back at first she saw only the dust and the haze but eventually a dark shape emerged from the glare bulky moving fast towards her she watched it for a moment as her skittering thoughts coalesced and then recognition surfaced from the murk shit shit shit drawing energy from depths she didnt know she had she broke into a mad scramble cernunnos the god of the green the power in nature itself was her patron and her guide he owned her and now he was coming to destroy her for her grand betrayal choking on the dust laura dived behind a tower of rock hoping it would hide her from view long enough to decide on an alternative course shed taken only four steps when the ground shifted under her feet and a hand snapped around her ankle bastard get off she kicked out only to be thrown roughly onto her back by a brutish hairless figure rising quickly from where it had been lying hidden in the dust it was the colour of the rocks with skin like a lizards and doublelidded eyes that would protect it from the duststorms that blew across the blasted lands before laura could fight back it had clamped one large rubbery hand over her mouth and pulled her up under its arm as if she were a doll then with a lurching gait it loped rapidly across the hardpan lauras struggles were quickly contained with a few hard punches and by the time her senses had stopped reeling they were below ground level on a dry river bed rounding a bend laura saw a force of around two hundred lamentbrood redcaps and many more like the brutish creature that held her tight the ranks parted to let her captor run deep into their midst and then closed behind them laura was thrown roughly onto the pebbly bed dazed she staggered to her feet cursing loudly not caring if they turned on her and killed her there and then well a sister of dragons the voice was rich and mocking and familiar holy shit laura snarled bitterly as the warriors parted again niamh strode out to stand before laura a sadistic smile twisting her lips despite the heat she wore black armour and the black horned headdress that emphasised the beauty of her features here i truly am the queen of the waste lands bitch of the waste lands laura snapped so bitter and you have helped us so much now i think you can help us some more she nodded to the brutish creatures and said hurt her a little when she is more compliant we shall return home and see what else she knows though they were still a mile away the fortress of the enemy loomed up high above their heads casting a long dark shadow across the blasted lands above the walls the flying creatures swooped and soared calling out harsh mechanical cries the air smelled like stagnant ponds on a hot day church and the others had spent half the day seeking an alternative path that had allowed them to approach with a modicum of cover a crevice cut through the hardpan towards the walls and though it was not particularly deep it allowed them to get close without discovery so they could search for some point of entry church brought them to a halt at the point where the crevice narrowed and rose over boulders crawling on his belly with veitch beside him he reached a vantage point where he could scan the remainder of the approach a towering door of beaten black iron was set in the wall but there was no other sign of access see there veitch indicated rows of small windows on the upper storeys theyll be able to pick us off with arrows before were halfway to the door theres no way wed be able to slip through anyway theres probably an army of guards on the other side theres no point trying a frontal assault church replied well get nowhere its got to be subterfuge or nothing youre using big words again what are you saying we sneak in in disguise or something or something youre a crazy suicidal fucker better idea shielding his eyes against the glare veitch looked along the length of the wall i saw you sneak off with ruthie last night he said incongruously this isnt the time ryan yeah it is were not all coming out of this in one piece we probably wont have another good time church sighed we dont want this getting between us when were inside veitch bristled you think id let it i know my duty i didnt mean to imply yeah you did nobodyd think youd do that but me im just the thug the righthand man the psycho who always lets his emotions get in the way of business what do you want ryan i want to be the good guy i want to be the hero like you i want everything youve got respect just people thinking well of you i want ruth i know you do and i know im not going to get her i can see that and wishing doesnt make it all right fairytale endings theyre for people like you not me dont do yourself down youre as good as any of us youve always stood by me i know that makes me feel even more of a stupid bastard for the fucking awful things i did and there it is youre better cause you think things like that and im worse cause i think things like i did and do things like i did youre the hero deep inside and im the fucking psycho you always do the right thing cause thats who you are and i do the wrong thing give me two choices and ill always pick the wrong one youre here now you came back to us you didnt have to yeah but did i do it for the right reason or because i wanted ruth to think i was a big man a good man thats all ive ever wanted to be since i was a kid and i want it even more now ive been such a nasty vicious wanker i want everybody to know that deep down im all right that i can do the right thing that im the hero the emotions were so raw that church didnt know how to answer him ive had a bit of a wakeup call these last few days i dont know where itll take me yet but im going to do my best not to be a selfish bastard i wont try to steal ruth away from you however much i want to not that i even think i could but im not going to try i want you to know you dont have to worry about that about me ill have your back in there im trying to learn from you because youre the best fucking example ive got in this world im a mess ryan yeah but you get over it and i dont and thats the difference between a hero and a wannabe i dont want to be a wannabe i want people to know im all right and i want you to be the first im going to be better than i was i trust you ryan you dont have to worry about that stop being so fucking noble you cunt jesus im never going to live up to your standards a grin broke through his troubled expression and church realised how much he liked him its you and me together buddy the last gang in town is going out fighting well do our best and if we dont win well still have done our best that sounds like a better motto than mine whats yours no happy endings thats crap at least im better than you at something breathlessly mallory slid in next to them you need to see this they crawled back on their bellies and pulled themselves up on the wall of the crevice where they could see a column of the enemy approaching across the hardpan at the head niamh rode on a black reptilian horse just behind her laura trudged head down she is with them church said i tried to believe there was some other explanation still might be veitch replied things arent always how they seem i should know church was distracted from his mounting despair at lauras betrayal by the sight of mallorys knuckles growing white where he gripped the rock that bitch mallory blinked away a tear of rage a shudder ran through him laura church asked niamh mallory steadied himself i dont know why i feel so bad but i see her and i just want to get out there and kill her he looked away i dont understand whats wrong with me at the moment i keep feeling really strong emotions but i dont know where theyre coming from in contrast church felt a damp sense of dismay when he saw what had become of niamh allpervasive like the cold of a midwinter day he recalled her on their long trek across the years together on a warm night on the road from rome or in a new england autumn when she had been consumed with love for him he had never felt the same depth of emotion back but her attention and care for him had been endearing and had kept him going during his darkest hours her transformation was baffling and he fought to comprehend it the answer came when he saw tom crouched down at the foot of the crevice lost to his dismal thoughts not the tom he recalled either but one who yearned for death i made her that way he said quietly devastation descended on him i turned the axis of existence and altered events saved tom and niamh and probably a load of other stuff i dont even know about but every change has unforeseen consequences he chewed his lip in dismay every bad thing shes done in this form its my fault the confession hit mallory hard staring at church he struggled with the mysterious tides of his powerful emotions then unable to comprehend or contain them he gave in and with an anguished roar drew his sword and halfscrambled over the lip of the crevice church and veitch dragged him back too late a cry went up and the ground vibrated with feet running in their direction thats torn it veitch wrenched out his sword the blue and black flames surging entwining sorry hell whats wrong with me mallory raged church gripped his arm steadied him forget it fight blue flames whooshed as they drew their swords together all three of them were stunned by the way the fire from the three blades funnelled together twisting in complex shapes interacting throwing out bolts of crackling energy it echoed within each of them feeding the pendragon spirit so they felt unbelievably stronger more confident the three great swords of existence they heard an awed tom exclaim behind them in use together for the first time in generations three become one they had no time to consider what it meant the first brutish creatures appeared at the lip of the crevice weve got to get out of here veitch yelled theyll just pick us off one by one trapped down here church scrambled back along the crevice with ruth shavi caitlin and tom close behind and mallory and veitch protecting the rear scrabbling for footholds church propelled himself up the opposite wall of the crevice and out onto the hardpan the roar that greeted him from the enemy was deafening at the same time he saw activity along the rows of windows in the fortress wall in the midst of the action his attention alighted on two things the delight that came to niamhs face not that of someone who spies a former lover but something cruel and sadistic and the devastation that marred lauras battered features battle cries that sounded like the roars of hungry animals filled the air the enemy streamed across the narrowest gap in the crevice and within seconds church was fighting for his life the brutish creatures moved with the speed and strength of gorillas using their long arms to propel themselves forwards before slashing in a frenzied manner with short serrated swords bracing himself church hacked with caledfwlch but each collision was so bonejarring that he was almost thrown from his feet within seconds veitch and mallory were at his side and he felt his strength and stamina increase proportionately the air was red with bloodmist and lit with the electric sizzle of the blue fire dancing around them as though it was alive nice one mallory veitch shouted between attacks why didnt you send up flares while you were at it i didnt want you to get lonely doing all the screwing up mallorys templar swordsmanship was more controlled than the other two and he carved through two for every one church and veitch took down with their selftaught skill for several minutes the world was just the hardfought few feet around them where the dismembered bodies piled up and their own lives were challenged every second but then they each became aware of activity beyond their sphere a gap in the attacking bodies revealed ruth transformed into a furious elemental force her hair whirling about her head blue fire crackling off her and the spear of lugh which she wielded with brutal efficiency attackers she didnt even touch flew back from the force of invisible hands others were turned inside out or had their eyes boiled in their heads bleedin hell veitch said youre not going to want to get in a fight with her beyond ruth caitlin was a force of nature too her eyes blazed as she carved a path through the brutish creatures with her axe which whirled so fast it was barely visible heads split in two limbs were cleaved and while she was striking with one arm she was tearing out throats with the other when one attacker broke through her defences caitlin effortlessly clamped her teeth on his jugular and ripped it away blood drenched her hair and face but she never missed a step the savagery of her attack was counterpointed by the eerie calmness of her face were the ateam veitch said gutting another attacker as the waves of brutish creatures thinned out church dared to hope they had survived the onslaught but then niamhs shrill laughter echoed nearby and the attackers came to a halt through some trickery niamh had got the better of ruth who now slumped in a daze at niamhs feet a knife at her throat my rival of the heart for so long through all those years of my awakening to the pain of human existence and here she is finally at my mercy niamh laughed oh how different things would have been if i had cut the life from her all those times ago niamh looked directly at church no hurt in her eyes just cruel glee and now she is here i have no true need of her death for i have already got you my sweet in a form that is better than the one you now occupy stronger more attuned to me i have won and she has lost because i will have you for ever and she will not though she no longer matters to me one jot i will kill her anyway because i can because it will drive you into my arms soon now just a little way along this road church froze was this it the moment of shattering devastation that would transform him into the libertarian he looked at ruth the knife at her throat and his heart broke nothing mattered more than keeping her alive not the destruction of all existence all his friends his sanity his soul nothing at the great fortress wall the enormous gates rattled open slowly the black gulf grew wider like a monstrous mouth and then light flooded in to reveal a sea of misshapen creatures poised to spill out across the hardpan mallory let his sword drop to his side this is starting to look like game over church turned his attention from the reinforcements back to niamhs hard smile and then to the knife poised a fraction of an inch from destroying his world and then ruths eyes snapped open her lips moved and after the disconnection of a second a word of power boomed out a bolt of blue fire seared across niamhs face and into the silver sky where it exploded like fireworks screaming niamh staggered back clutching her face one side of her shimmering golden features was seared black the sun being eaten by the moon caitlin grabbed ruths arm and hauled her towards church veitch and mallory in the lull shavi and tom clambered out of their shelter in the crevice and faced the oncoming horde hundreds of them veitch said the bleak edge to his voice stung them all no point running mallory said got to die sometime i always planned on picking my moment veitch said fuck the bad news never stops coming tom was facing away from the fortress looking out across the hardpan the others turned to see what had caught his attention glistening like oil a black wave washed across the hardpan on skittering insect legs the fomorii came their forms changing as they moved plates clanking into place spikes bursting from the gleaming carapaces wings unfurling thousands of the shapeshifting beasts converged on the fortress gates they found their way through the groghaan gate church said this is just overkill mallory turned slowly to take in the full weight of the forces ranged against them on the lip of the crevice the tiny knot of brothers and sisters of dragons was at the eye of a hurricane of savage enemies amidst a deafening fullthroated clamour the voids army continued to surge out of the fortress like the flow from a disturbed anthill the fomorii were almost upon them too the low rumble of their call and response now resonating in the pits of their stomachs church felt for ruths hand and they exchanged one brief painful look of regret we always knew it would come down to this right veitch said people like us we were never going to win speak for yourself mallory muttered he eyed caitlin wishing his friend was there but seeing only the grim face of the morrigan laura ought to be here shavi said we should all be together at the end searching the swelling ranks shavi finally glimpsed her casting one desperate look his way before moving towards the fortress gates of her own accord his heart sank as church prepared for the wave to break over them he realised something odd was happening the fomorii had moved into a crescent formation the twin horns bypassing the brothers and sisters of dragons his first thought was that they were completing the circle but they continued with mounting speed until they crashed with the force of a tsunami on the disoriented ranks of the enemy church had forgotten the sheer ferocity of the nightwalkers the fomorii ripped through the brutish creatures the lamentbrood the redcaps as if they were sheep razorsharp limbs and snapping jaws churned up a fountain of body parts bones and blood as if the enemy had been put through a giant mincer a red haze came down making it impossible to see more than a few yards ahead the unthinking enemy army put up a fierce resistance seemingly oblivious to their own impending destruction by sheer weight of numbers they bought down several of the fomorii but soon paths were being carved through their ranks and the flow from the gates was reversed the retreat had been announced church and the others shielded themselves from the wild bloody storm in the reaches of the crevice but as it moved towards the fortress wall they clambered out to witness the carnage a red slurry lay across the ochre hardpan along the walls some of the fomorii harried the last of the enemy left out in the open after the gates were closed while others threw themselves at the walls attempting to break through or scale them what the hell mallory said never saw that one coming i i think that may explain it ruth gasped making his way across the hardpan with a piratical swagger was hunter behind him trailed miller jack and virginia all in the bizarre shadow of a hooded giant stunned church and the others could only gape as hunter offered a broad grin and a wave missed me he said we thought you were dead shavi replied all of you takes more than a fewhundredfoot fall to kill me im a hard hard man he nodded towards miller besides when youve got doctor miller here with his healing hands anything is possible church shook his hand forcefully its good to have you back hunter whos the big guy veitch asked my new brother yeah probably wouldnt be a good idea to antagonise him he gets under your skin and into your head and not in a good way ruth looked towards the fomorii how did you him too while mallory hugged miller then virginia and clapped jack on the back with honest relief shavi said with cautious sensitivity we feared you had been murdered by laura she has not been herself you always did have a way with words hunter said noncommittally his grin remained broad did she attack you ruth pressed not something we need to think about right now its something you need to think about very shortly tom said sharply shes working with the enemy shes inside the fortress with all she knows about us and our plans she could cause untold damage ill deal with her hunter said he removed the balor claw from his backpack and slipped it on whats that church asked suspiciously nice isnt it hunter turned it so it caught the harsh light i think it adds to my flamboyant appeal got to look good going into battle hunter i know how much you cared for laura ruth pressed i know you must be devastated by what she did to you its okay to let it out nothing to let out beautiful just just dont hurt her whatever shes done shes still one of us ruth said unsettled by his calm demeanour dont worry ill be gentle virginia can lead us inside the fortress church asked theres a dry river bed about a mile that way hunter indicated east it runs close to the walls somewhere along it theres the remains of an underground tributary follow that and itll bring you through runoff channels to the lowest levels of the fortress apparently its pretty deserted down there so we should be able to move quickly to a good proximity of where we need to be i dont think we should travel together church said i agree are you mad ruth said havent you seen a hundred horror films where the team splits up only to get picked off one by one we need to maximise our chances of somebody getting through church said if were all travelling together were easy to find and to kill if you want my advice you should lead your original lot hunter said mallory and caitlin work well together looks like theyve still got hal in the lantern that makes a team ill take miller jack the two keys and virginia weve got a good rhythm going mallory can take the extinction shears so we havent got all our resources together church said ill look for laura first hunter said neutralise the fact that she could upset the apple cart then ill head for the reunion he ignored ruths searching gaze how will we know where and when to meet up shavi asked my new pal hunter indicated the giant who was standing motionless on the fringes his head cocked to one side hes some kind of mentalist reads minds talks to you in your head weird as hell but it works hes the link for group communication and he can also perceive any potential threats upcoming on our routes and guide me to laura sounds like a plan the relief in churchs voice was palpable i thought we were done for now were back on course ill tell the others veitch and hunter were left alone you and me were alike veitch said gently clanking his silver hand against the balor claw same basic abilities same psychoskills for killing youre smarter by a long way and im not going to be copying your fashion sense but were on the same wavelength right hunter nodded wondering where veitch was going with this line of thought i might be a thickheaded git from south london but that doesnt mean i dont learn from my mistakes veitch continued so whatever youre planning for laura give her a break things might not be how they seem i know how you can end up doing stuff that youd never normally do her and me weve never seen eye to eye but deep down her hearts in the right place for her sake and for yours dont do something youll regret for the rest of your life thanks for the advice they nodded curtly and separated veitch hoped hed done enough hunter was impossible to read but veitch was afraid they really were too much alike while mallory and caitlin examined the unnervingly weak flame in the wayfinder and hunter regaled the others with a brief but dramatic version of his journey from winterside church and ruth returned to veitch everything is going in the right direction now ruth said weve eased the tensions amongst us weve turned you away from the libertarian no we havent church said bluntly a shadow crossed his face if everything was going fine hed be here making our lives a misery every step of the way but hes not hes sitting back somewhere and that means he still thinks things are on course but what can go wrong now ruth said were together she squeezed his hand tightly you said that it was something to do with you and me that tips you over to become the libertarian were not going to let that happen the defiance in her voice failed to move him a black mood welled up in church all his fears laid bare and ruth realised how much he had been suppressing it she couldnt bear to see that raw emotion etched in his face we dont know whats ahead he said we can mitigate against it as much as possible but we dont know one things for sure i will never let myself become the libertarian ive already seen some of the misery my stupid thoughtless actions have caused im not going to have any more on my conscience ill do whatever it takes to make sure the libertarians future doesnt come to pass grimfaced church marched away ruth watched him go her heart breaking were going to keep an eye on him all right veitch said ruth cast a quizzical glance his way nah its not some ploy to win your heart im a simple bloke i dont do things like that he watched church kneel and hug virginia tightly as much to find comfort for himself as for her our lives are like some bad soap most of the time but here were right down to the wire and everything has to change weve passed the point where we can indulge ourselves with little games its about survival now and we all need to look after each other because were friends more than friends maybe family in a stupid screwedup kind of way from here on in were looking out for each other watching backs carrying the weight whats come over you ryan you know us workingclass boys were hard as nails but were sentimental as fuck he paused i love you ryan dont say anything you stupid tosser i love you and i want you to be happy all the time ever after and if that means youre with church well thats the way things are meant to be he glanced after church and i love him too like a brother hes blood the bloke i admire most in the world thats why i was so desperate to kill him make sense only in your strange warped world ryan she tried to make light but she felt all her emotion on the point of bursting out too much stress she told herself calm down were all hes got you me shavi tom he needs us to look out for him to keep him safe to stop him doing something stupid and thats what were going to do right were going to look after him and keep him safe whatever it takes because he needs us youre rambling ryan yeah sorry i love you too she surprised him with a kiss on the cheek and then went after church he knew what it really meant and he wasnt disappointed it was quite honestly the best moment in his entire life better even than the mermaids swimming beside the boat on the way to caldey island he didnt need anything more now along the great fortress wall the fomorii swarmed some climbed and ripped out chunks around the windows ignoring the clouds of flaming arrows that emerged from within others crashed against the great gates it was only a matter of time before they broke through the defences death is all around brother said eldigahwislor the final judgement of the drakusa blinded by his hood the giant saw everything i feel it circling shifting the patterns of this world leaving marks and symbols that tell of its passing a shadow where none should be a cloud in the shape of a skull random grains of sand that spell a dead lovers name the others do not notice these things but they feel it sometimes a shiver a moment of emptiness a question on their lips yep this time were bringing death on a grand scale and youre helping me do it hunter said ive always hated my strength but sometimes youve just got to recognise what youre good at and go with it he watched the fomorii in action i hope theyre enough to get things moving they will suffice for now there are more things on the way yeah hunter shrugged funny how things turn out all these little coincidences me stumbling across you you saving my life your presence saving the lives of the others now this there are no coincidences brother maybe youre right the giant turned and looked into the sky behind him what do you see the opposite of us brother beyond the deafening rending and tearing of the fomorii hunter could just make out another sound drawing nearer wings from the far horizon came the fabulous beasts he counted seven there could be more behind the one at the head was larger and even more magnificent than the rest the steady rhythm of its leathern wings like a heartbeat its jewelled scales gleamed and the myriad colours and the sheer wonder that it evoked deep inside him made the desolation of the blasted lands insignificant a grey shadow that would fade in the first rays of the sun hunter watched the beasts pass over and for the first time in his life felt at peace the downdraught from the wings ruffled his hair and the shadows passing over were cool and refreshing sinuously the fabulous beasts arched and then drove down towards the fortress performing an intricate breathtaking ballet in the air above it the greatest one was the first to release a blast of liquid fire that sent a geyser of rubble blasting into the air and set alight a large area of the fortress soon the others were diving and releasing their terrible flame the fortress shook and large sections of the wall fell away to reveal the swarming insect life within the glorious blaze leaped up to the sky pouring thick black smoke that for the first time obscured the shape of the burning man the heat was so intense that hunter could feel it on his face a mile distant game on he said chapter eleven the great hour of destiny as the glamour faded the world rushed in to greet them overseeing the hellish scene with a sick fascination ronnie recalled the somme with a clarity that made him shudder the carpet of bodies so thick you could walk across it without touching earth the pall of choking smoke the plague of rats and the rainlashed trenches ronnie you okay doctor jay shook his arm yes of course fine as a fiddle the sky was black with greasy sulphurous smoke the harsh red and gold glare of the blazing fortress like a dying sun in the depths of space in the gloom all around the army of dragons and the ranks of the gods waited patiently for ronnies order bitterly he recalled haigs plan that could not fail a sevenday bombardment to destroy the german defences and then the order to advance to pick off the disoriented survivors so terribly flawed fiftyeight thousand british troops dead or mutilated in one day alone the machine guns cutting bodies in two was haig haunted by his failure ronnie wondered how could he possibly live with himself after that war demands the best of us aula was at his shoulder calm and steady in a way that he had never seen her before there was more of decebalus in her than she liked to reveal we fight for the right reasons and it demands sacrifices she continued and sacrifices of our own souls for we are forced to give up a part of ourselves that we would never have relinquished before it destroys the person we were and we can never recover but we do it so that others can live the lives we cannot im prepared for my own sacrifice maam and everyone here has signed that compact too trust yourself never forget why we do what we do never forget the humanity of the people who fight with those two things in mind your decisions will be true ronnie took a deep breath doctor jay aula thank you for your counsel were all in it together man dont forget that the doctor said ronnie strode out along the lines and gave the order there was only a briefest tinge of selfdoubt and then he turned his attention to the battle thor tyr and ares raced ahead with insane glee the japanese war god bishamon was more measured but those who marched into the fray with the greatest dignity were the tuatha de danaan lugh at their head glowing like a sun there was a great sadness about them but also a fierce determination for the first time ronnie thought they truly did resemble gods as they neared a thousand thousand flaming arrows erupted from the fortress windows the stars coming down to earth the final battle began even far underground the tremors reverberated from the constant fusillade dust and fragments showered down until the brothers and sisters of dragons feared that the rock overhead was on the point of collapse they had made their way along the dead riverbed and through virginias network of crawlspaces into the lower reaches of the fortress with speed their parting of the ways had been swift with nods and hugs none of them knowing if they would ever see each other again now hunter climbed steps that had the sickly texture of meat with the whisper of his brother giant in his head following in his footsteps came virginia seeming to carry a great age with her now that she was back in the place of torment then jack serious and intent and a frightened miller at the rear the steps opened onto a narrow corridor running along the fortress wall overlooking the battle the heat there was intense charred bodies lined the way and thick smoke rolled in through gaping holes a few lamentbrood fought mechanically with fomorii warriors clinging to the outside wall the balor claw sang as hunter moved swiftly down the corridor taking apart any enemy he met a branching corridor led them deep into the heart of the fortress at one point the route was blocked from wall to wall by a solid column of lamentbrood marching towards the front line the balor claw reduced them to nothing in minutes hunter pushed on relentlessly jack who knew him best could not read his mood anger desperation grief something of all three mostly he appeared impassive as though the enemy warriors he was despatching were little more than a distraction and for the first time jack felt chilled by what he saw there they emerged into a courtyard where a carpet of bones covered the flags in the centre stood a wooden post from which several chains hung when virginia saw it she began to sob sucking in huge mouthfuls of air jack and miller tried to comfort her but she broke free from them and raced towards a low building on the righthand side of the court hunter cursed loudly thats the wrong way you cant leave her alone in this place miller protested without hesitation hunter raced in pursuit of the young girl fleet of foot she moved rapidly through the low building to a dark stinking room on the far side hunter caught up with her standing in the doorway still sobbing she flinched when he placed a hand on her shoulder as his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom hunter saw that the room was filled with people wearing clothes from many periods of earths history they were dirty bloody beaten down some had lost eyes limbs some had been so hideously scarred they didnt lift their faces from the floor the room was thick with their own filth and around the edge many decomposing bodies lay who are these people breathless on his arrival miller quickly came close to tears people the void stole from earth to work here in the fortress jacks grim face resembled a skull in the halflight hunter knew he was remembering his own kidnapping from his mothers side and his long agonising incarceration in the court of the final word are your people here hunter asked gently virginia was rigid it was somehow worse than her crying virginia the voice was barely more than a croak rustling out from the depths of the dark mama virginia started and then hurried into the room she came to a halt next to a woman who could have been in her forties but looked thirty years older kneeling amidst the filth she had lost half her hair and her forearms were so badly scarred they were pink and raw virginia buried her face in the womans neck whimpering virginia why did you come back here her mother said you were free of the pestilential torments inflicted in this place mama mr hunter is here to save us the woman looked up at hunter with eyes that scarcely dared believe you are here to deliver us from this place whispers leaped from person to person spreading rapidly around the room desperate hands clutched at hunters legs others tried to stand or dragged themselves towards him no pressure then hunter muttered to himself yes im here to help he announced that noise you hear is this place being taken apart brick by brick therell be no more suffering stay here a while longer its dangerous out there but dont worry were going to free you anguished cries of relief were joined by loud prayers of thanks dont worry mama virginia said stroking her mothers head mr hunter and his friends are good and true our saviours god has answered all our pleas her mother began to cry silently hunter crouched down and said to virginia reassuringly you stay here and look after your mum okay ill be back for you when this business is finished smiling for the first time since hunter had met her virginia nodded eagerly out in the courtyard miller said see mr hunter everyone can see youre a good man shut up miller or ill be forced to slap you around miller winked at jack just like my friend ryan the giants whispers returned to hunters head guiding him quickly through a maze of buildings corridors and stairs until he reached a tower of gleaming obsidian barely able to keep up jack gasped is this where laura is on her way to the top you stay down here racing into the tower hunter took the steps two at a time the balor claw scraping loudly on the stone as he rounded the spiral footsteps echoed from above the stairs opened out into a room covering the entire floor of the tower with large windows ranged around the circumference through one hunter could see part of the burning man unsettlingly close figures writhed in agony within the outline through the others the fortress blazed the fabulous beasts sinuously riding the air currents the beat of their wings was deafening her face tearstained laura stood in a daze near one of the windows she started when she saw him and then lurched on the brink of a faint im not a ghost or the walking dead stunned her fear subsided and she gulped for words that wouldnt come hunter rapped his temple indestructible solid bone her shock passed quickly and she moved rapidly to the window and clung on to the frame i should have guessed i cant even kill someone properly when hunter took a step towards her she placed one foot on the ledge ready to propel herself outside get away from me she said flatly come away from the window what so you can cut me to pieces with your killer glove im not going to hurt you right her laugh was laced with bitterness i tried to murder you god all this time i thought i had you and jack and miller and and little virginia theyre all fine a sob broke through her expression was shattered you loved me youre the only person ive ever met who loves me for who i am not what i can give you and i betrayed you of course youre going to kill me and youre going to make me suffer first and why the hell not i deserve it she pushed herself fully into the window glancing at the dizzying drop what are you doing laura what does it look like im doing you think i can carry on the words caught in her throat i still love you laura flinched as if shed been slapped ive never said that to anyone before she gulped back a sob whats wrong with you you crazy bastard i tried to kill you i know you i know how your mind works i know how your heart works i know every tiny twisty turn of your mazelike personality and i know that once you peel back all the protective layers youve wrapped yourself in deep down inside youre a good person i believe in you whatever you tried to do to me thats not you laura began to cry its the end of the world out there and were having a boyfriendgirlfriend talk for gods sake get a grip youre supposed to be the hero laura hovered on the brink for a moment and then collapsed onto the window ledge hunter pulled her up holding the balor claw behind his back looking deep into his eyes she said you always were a good liar hunter do it then i wont stop you hunter pushed her against the wall and ripped her tshirt down the back embedded in her shoulderblade was a shiny black spider as he watched it dug its legs deeper into her flesh with relief laura began to cry silently youll never get it out she said how long has it been there after you saved me from the court of the final word and i went back to earth no one asked how i found the others so easily in new york everyone takes so many coincidences for granted nobody questions any more they caught me and fixed that bastard into my flesh i was their failsafe every time things looked like they were going in the wrong direction i was forced to give a little shove make a comment do whatever it took to destabilise brilliant wasnt it because thats what i do anyway hold still hunter deftly manoeuvred the balor claw so that he could plunge it into the spider without touching lauras flesh with a sizzle the spider was wrenched from existence gasping for breath laura clutched at the wall for support it was whispering in my head all the time it wouldnt let me speak do anything to show it was there i let everybody down you couldnt help it why couldnt i fight against it i gave veitch such a hard time when the caraprix controlled him and now im so sorry for how i treated him hush slipping the balor claw into his backpack hunter held her tightly she remained silent for a moment and then said quietly you bastard how could you believe in me now ive got no excuse you never had any you were just too dumb to see it he kissed her on the forehead hmm i guess this isnt the right time for sex we have a bit of a job to do first you up for it laura pulled herself away from him gradually finding her equilibrium so who do you want killing from the parting of ways in the lower levels of the fortress church ruth veitch shavi and tom were guided by the hooded giants whispering directions to take the most direct route to the location of the burning man at the heart of the sprawling complex they stayed in the network of sewerlike tunnels vaults and natural caverns that formed the base of the fortress where they were sure they would meet no resistance all right veitch said theyre going to send their reinforcements to the walls to hold back our forces but that doesnt mean theyre stupid theyre not going to leave an open channel right into the most sensitive part of their operation they dont know were coming ruth argued why waste troops when they could be putting them to good use church what do you think i agree with ryan caledfwlchs flames provided church with just enough illumination to pick his way through the oppressive gloom he was distracted increasingly brooding the deeper they progressed into the fortress at the very least the libertarian is going to be shadowing us he might not remember everything that led up to his transformation but theres a chance he recalls how we got into the fortress tom too was increasingly introspective and he compulsively twisted the ring given to him by freyja when the corridor led into another cavern in the bedrock beneath the fortresss foundations they came to a slow halt unnerved by what lay ahead the previous caverns had been bare rock but this one resembled a cemetery with jumbled mausoleums and crypts and graves in the grey dust floor lanterns hung from some of the houses of the dead the pinpoints of illumination stretching out far into the dark ahead an autumnal chill hung in the air and there was an odour of damp vegetation although none was visible now this is strange church scanned the cemetery for any sign of movement it was still and silent its like the grim lands ruth whispered this is just how mallory and caitlin described it whats with all this death stuff veitch asked grim isnt the word we become brothers and sisters of dragons when we experience death we keep getting topped then coming back some more than others and people keep telling us its in the air and all about us death is the key to everything shavi said it always has been it is just that we have been unable to see it because of the way we have been brought up to consider it we think of death as grim terrible the ultimate harsh reality but anyone who has experienced death knows there is magic circling around it it is almost as if death clears a space in reality in the mind and allows magic to enter because death is not mundane anything but it is the opposite of mundane it is quite definitely the key to everything change transformation we only fear death because we think of it as the end but if it is only a doorway the entrance to another room another house another street another town what then what then after searching the entrance to the cavern church said no way around it well have to go through it what is this were all going on a bear hunt ruth said cautiously church led them into the cemetery the dust soft underfoot the air growing damper the further they advanced try telling that to someone whos just lost a loved one veitch said to shavi magic no chance of course we feel grief at those times shavi replied and that emotion is so potent it often crushes our senses so much that we fail to appreciate what else is happening before i left home i had to drive my aunt on an emergency trip to the specialist spinal unit at a hospital in sheffield my uncle was dying he had fallen downstairs a few years earlier and paralysed himself from the chest down from that moment on it was a constant fight against infection one that he was losing the antibiotics were not working my aunt received a call at midnight to say he did not have long left shavis calm voice soothed them and though veitch knew it was one of shavis kindly acts to keep them at ease during a time of tension he still appreciated it the m was deserted shavi continued the hospital was immense but completely empty too when we arrived at twothirty am and i could tell the moment i stepped out of the car that there was something special in the air a stillness a sense of the infinite peering in to see us in our glass tank i swear there was magic there and in the ward too devoid of the usual bustle of waiting relatives there was a completely different feel it was buzzing with a power that made my heart beat faster the occasion was so desperate so sad so grim but yet so different from the life we knew i loved my uncle my heart went out to my aunt who had not been separated from him for forty years but in that moment we touched an aspect of life we never experienced in our normal days it had a charge like electricity and we felt so strongly not just emotions but the quality of the light and the sound and the stillness and there was meaning all around us so powerful we could touch it shavi grew animated there was magic ryan magic is meaning a lack of meaning is mundane once you have the meaning anything is possible you can change the world yourself those around you you can make things better if there is no meaning you are locked in a world without feeling where everything is as it is nothing can be changed those who advocate no meaning are sealing themselves inside their own cell locking the door and throwing away the key he fell silent but his eyes gleamed veitch dwelled on his words they had touched something deep inside him although he still could not work out exactly what so youre saying we shouldnt fear death the deep rumbling laughter may have been in response to veitchs question but it made goosebumps rise on all of their arms i just knew it tom muttered who is that ruth whispered the laughter came from just beyond the large mausoleum ahead of them two figures waited in the warm yellow light of a lantern on a tomb sat a caribbean man in a black tailcoat shiny top hat and sunglasses and carrying a silverskulltopped cane his face painted white to resemble a skull he clutched a cigar between two knuckles and blue smoke drifted from his pearlywhite grin the one behind him had more of the grave about him than elegance grey desiccated skin baleful red eyes a necklace of human fingerbones and grey hair tufting from a scalp showing patches of the yellow bone beneath bearing the taint of the anubis box they were both under the voids control church and veitch advanced swords drawn the one in the top hat laughed louder no worries boys we are no threat to you that lies ahead we just watchin over our domain makin a little place for you awhile from now who are you church asked we got names and names boys but on the island they called me baron samedi and my silent partner is baron cimetiere he is me and i am he i am head of the guede family of the loa we stand at the crossroads to watch the souls of dead humans pass church shivered is this the crossroads then baron samedi grinned wider were not dead yet veitch said defiantly maybe you are and maybe you not i am a wise judge boy even with these marks upon me i say you pass now and so says he baron cimetiere leaned across the tomb to inspect each of them in turn when his gaze fell upon them they each felt a cold breeze tapping his nose baron samedi added i am also loa of sex and resurrection ring any bells time is slipping away brothers and sisters baron cimetiere said in a whispery voice the devourer of all things is nearly come any moment now any moment dont let them distract you tom shouted move on amongst the mausoleums and the crypts something someone drew near dont look at it tom cautioned too late church was caught by the sight of a familiar face and was suddenly flooded with recollections the smell of her hair the softness of her skin lying in bed on a sunday morning slick with sweat after sex marianne he said i deserved to live church his longdead girlfriend said and i would have if you hadnt been chosen to be some stupid hero why couldnt someone else do it why did i have to die to set you on this path its not fair her words resonated with his own doubts so many people had suffered because of the manipulation of the great powers in their sprawling millennialong campaign were all just pawns church the gods manipulated veitch to kill me the void manipulated the gods and veitch existence manipulated everyone none of them can be trusted so why play their game why follow their rules you have the power to walk away do it and save someone else from having to go through what we both suffered she was right it wasnt fair he could see fault on both sides and strength on both sides and it was always humanity caught in the middle if he walked away what would the powers do then only dimly did he feel the blue fire when his hand went to his sword he could throw it away a symbolic gesture church tom was shaking him roughly where marianne had stood there was now a hideous yellowing skeleton with staring eyes its clawlike hands clutching long tendrils of mist that reached to the heads of ruth shavi and veitch the one that had been fastened to him was now breaking up and drifting away lee shavi mouthed ruth muttered the name of her dead uncle tears streaming down her face a queasy guilt was carved into veitchs features at the memory of all the people he had killed i am mictlantecuhtli god of death and all who walk the cemeteries are my servants in your arrogance you raised a sword against my little brother tezcatlipoca and now a balance must be struck the skeleton intoned choose one of your comrades to join me here for all time in service to the devourer of all things as church made to draw his sword baron samedi laughed heartily with a flick of his wrist mictlantecuhtli drew the tendrils taut and shavi ruth and veitch crumpled to their knees their faces drawn as if the life was being sucked out of them your grief for your lost loved ones traps you mictlantecuhtli said you cannot see that they are inside you and around you for ever you cannot break this thing it sucks the life from you church continued drawing his sword until tom stopped him theyll be dead before you can do anything the rhymer whispered you want me to choose one of them to die i cant do that and theyd never let us go anyway stay calm think this is the land of death what has power here choose now mictlantecuhtli ordered why dont you just tell me what youre thinking church snapped because i cant dont you understand he showed church his ring the deal i did with freyja was that i would not help you at any turn as my power of prophecy returned after you dragged me back to this life i could have helped you so many times lives have been lost lives will be lost and i could have prevented it i see them so clearly and i have had to live with that knowledge tears sparked in his eyes but that witch didnt want me to aid my friends the only people i have ever cared about because that way youd be truly tested why if you were weak the void would have won easily she wanted to know you were strong so she could decide if she should side with you now mictlantecuhtli drew the tendrils tighter wait church said give me time his mind raced as he turned over toms words why didnt you tell us this before you would have spent all your time wondering what i knew he looked away i would have been even more alone power in the land of death church repeated he looked around examining the symbols of death on every mausoleum and crypt in the cemetery and then he had it closing his eyes he whispered i am the raven king i can do anything it sounded like a storm approaching across a great plain the thunder rolled closer magnified by the echoes along the network of tunnels and caverns through which they had walked within moments a black cloud rushed into the cemetery the swirling tempest of black wings bringing darkness and chaos the morvren attacked with one mind tied to churchs consciousness as strongly as the fabulous beast in the confusion church and tom managed to drag shavi ruth and veitch free and they scrambled across the cemetery beneath the cloud of swirling birds fighting to repress the memories that had been torn free veitch turned in a rage sword drawn im going to cut that bastard to bits forget it wed never beat three of them church said wed be lucky to overpower that aztec one on his own the morvren wont hurt them but it should keep them distracted until we get away ruth too was altered by her experience the dredgedup memories of her grief and whatever lies her dead uncle had told her had left a deepseated anger rooted in her eyes spits and crackles of blue fire flashed around her and church could see she was struggling to maintain control he went to comfort her but she turned away he noticed tom hanging back and said quietly you took on a huge burden to help us i wont forget that tom nodded sullenly but his relief was apparent they said the void was nearly here have we run out of time ruth wiped away stinging tears i dont know church replied but i do know that now weve been discovered every rogue god the void has under its control will be trying to stop us reaching the burning man and probably every single warrior in this entire fortress bring em on veitch growled they got me mad messing with my head like that theyre the ones who should be scared we are not safe she comes doubledup caitlin clutched at the wall the crackling ancient voice of brigid echoing from her young mouth every switch in persona always caught mallory offguard throughout the journey from the parting of ways he had been dealing with the cold brutal efficiency of the morrigan who gave little response to his attempts at warmth and friendship who is coming he asked dazed caitlin shook her head i i dont know brigid is scared shes hiding so are the others she shook her head again and her eyes darkened the morrigan looked back at mallory move quickly she said we need to find a defensible position mallory sighed with frustration any chance you could stay with one personality for more than three seconds he drew his sword the sound of many running feet coming their way was already clear instinctively a protective hand went to the bag containing the extinction shears they were in a section of the fortress that appeared to be constructed entirely of the spoiled meat gloomy and foulsmelling the floor spongy underfoot nowhere to hide snatching her axe from her back caitlin ran along the corridor when the morrigan was riding her mallory had difficulty keeping up she was stronger faster her reactions more finely tuned and she was more savage the best person to have at your side in a fight but mallory valued the companionship of his friend more the caitlin he knew always reminded him of the real reason they were fighting she kept him going when things became too bleak the corridor came to a dead end at a large doorway leading onto a stone and metal balcony beneath them the fortress stretched out for mile upon mile an insane jumble of forums towers grand halls industrialscale factories obelisks barracks and many other structures mallory couldnt identify the sky was scarlet and black from the fires blazing everywhere the air chokingly acrid creatures that resembled pterodactyls but with skulllike heads swooped overhead screeching as they attempted to fend off the fabulous beasts occasionally the pall of smoke would shift to reveal the burning man looking down ten storeys below was an extensive forum paved with white stone across which the enemy streamed as they reinforced their defences or scattered to avoid the fiery blasts from above how many of them are here millions mallory gaped another balcony could just be reached with a leap across a gulf and there were other balconies in a line alongside the building they were in before he could point this out to caitlin she had turned and was swinging her axe at two of the sallowskinned brutish creatures who had approached silently two heads flew off the balcony to the flags far below but before the bodies had crashed to the soft sticky floor the corridor was already packed with the rest of the pursuers in the middle of the throng stood niamh the charred half of her face emphasising her fury mallorys blood ran cold why did he hate her so much in the depths of his mind recollections shifted ratcheting up his anger but no solution to the mystery surfaced overcome with the desire for revenge he gripped llyrwyn and prepared to attack the brothers and sisters of dragons have broken into our home niamh shrieked sound the alarm leave the walls here is the real threat thats not good mallory said were going to have to cut our way through every bastard in here to get where were going the air was filled with a deafening siren that sounded like the cry of a tortured animal across the fortress others began in sequence mallory and caitlin darted forwards at the same time as the hanging wave of their enemies broke within seconds the corridor was filled with furious battle without room for delicate swordplay mallory hacked and slashed his way through anything that appeared before him his blade sizzling through flesh severing limbs and unleashing geysers of sticky black blood despite the frenzy he was aware of caitlin beside him hypnotic in the fluid rhythms of her savage ballet sidestepping ducking and pirouetting at the same time as she whirled the axe in glittering arcs she removed heads and limbs crashed through shoulderblades and tore open guts within a few seconds she had carved a path ahead of mallory as two of the creatures fell she rammed her fingers into the throat of another and ripped it out blood soaked her from head to foot the axe came up instantly into the jaw of another rending through its skull and out of the top of its head mallory kept his focus on niamh standing cold and aloof at the rear of her guard his blazing hatred was a distraction and he made two errors of judgment in rapid succession one of his enemys short razorsharp swords broke through his defences and ripped open his chest another caught him a glancing blow on the side of the head and he pitched backwards instantly they were upon him through the crush of bodies he had a brief glimpse of caitlin striking out towards niamh the cold unfeeling eyes of the morrigan flashed briefly upon him dismissed his plight and moved on and mallory realised his last chance had passed a sword cut through the top of his ear another tore open his temple but their weight upon him made it difficult for the enemy to strike a killing blow stupid bastards he thought obliquely just as he had given up hope the weight pressing on him eased as bodies were torn off had their throats cut and were discarded caitlin looked down at him with eyes that contained only a hint of the morrigan i couldnt leave you she said with a smile as she offered a hand to pull him up a sword burst out through her left shoulder a look of startled incomprehension crossed her face she glanced down at the protruding steel and watched the blood gush not again mallory raged he hacked through two more attackers then grabbed caitlin as her legs gave way her axe slipped from her fingers ill be all right she gasped it missed the artery just look out for yourself leaning her against the wall where she slid slowly to the floor mallory turned his attention to the few remaining attackers this time his hatred and anger became fuel he cut through warrior after warrior until only niamh was left she showed no fear pathetic fragile creatures your time has passed she spat you taught me to feel emotion and defiled me for life you deserve to be eradicated from existence for the poison you have inflicted on all wondrous things love fury filled her love see what it has done she indicated caitlin who was attempting to staunch the flow of blood from her shoulder it has destroyed you too though you do not realise how or why it has destroyed me in the end it will destroy jack churchill the vile and deceitful last chance of humanity with a flourish she tore a dagger from her belt and attacked at the last moment mallory turned and it tore open his upper arm instinctively he brought llyrwyn up and with a sizzle of blue fire he separated niamhs head from her shoulders after a second the body exploded in a wild flurry of moths their brilliant gold corrupted by black as they swirled up to the ceiling and through it when they had gone there was nothing left of niamh mallory had thought his mysterious urge for revenge would be sated but he only felt deflated and strangely sad he hurried back to caitlin who gave him a forced smile she was deathly pale blood streamed from his own wounds but he was certain that given time the pendragon spirit would heal him of caitlin he was not so sure im afraid to remove the sword it might cut the artery he said dont worry lets get out of here find somewhere we can rest a while as he lifted her in his arms she added you can go on ahead with the extinction shears come back for me later when its all done no he said denying the practicality of her suggestion you and me were a team weve travelled across earth the far lands and the land of the dead were not going our separate ways now he added i need you with me no you dont yes he said firmly i do bracing his foot on the edge of the balcony he propelled them across the gulf onto the next balcony landing hard they spilled onto the ground caitlin cried out as the sword twisted dont worry she added hastily you did great carrying her into the adjoining corridor he laid her at the foot of the wall her clothes were sodden with blood a good infusion of the blue fire could turn you around quick as anything mallory said he unhooked the wayfinder from his belt and examined the flame which flickered even more weakly than the last time he had scrutinised it doesnt look too good does it caitlin said for me or hal dont be so negative hiding his despondence mallory wondered where else he could find another source of blue fire in that godforsaken place taking his hand caitlin appeared to read his thoughts you mustnt worry about me there are more important things to deal with right now i can wait she saw his face and smiled and even if i cant im proud ive played my part im ready mallory no ive buried my husband and my son ive seen so many people die theres been so much suffering but so much good too friendship like i never imagined and love everything thats happened has made me see life and the world in a completely different way its not mundane at all theres so much wonder everywhere its just so well hidden but once you find it everything really is magickal she smiled and then theres you will you be quiet mallory tended to her wound but the blood pumping out around the sword was not diminishing life was dark after grant and liam died but you made it worthwhile for me again youve been a good friend mallory my best friend she took his hand and squeezed it tightly he didnt like the way she appeared to be drawing an end to the story of her life stop it the pendragon spirit is all about hope and while your hearts still beating thats what there is no more talk like that her smile was sympathetic she nodded as if she agreed but that only made him feel worse a noise from further along the gloomy corridor disturbed them as mallory drew his sword the shadows retreated from the blue flare but he still couldnt see who was there no ones going to get past me he said youll be all right the darkness unfolded to reveal a blue light way down the corridor drawing closer puzzled mallory held his breath and watched it was blue fire he was sure of it but it moved like a person as it neared he saw it was indeed a man in a column of the sapphire flames is that hal he asked quietly flicking open the lamps glass door he saw only the faintest flame guttering inside it is caitlin said thats why the wayfinder flame was dying he was taking on form hal mallory called sheathing his sword he ran to greet their friend come on caitlin needs your help the burning blue figure was a beacon of hope in the grim fortress but as mallory skidded to a halt in front of him the blue flames licked out the figure beneath didnt resemble the hal mallory had seen in the flames but even as he struggled to recognise the face the features were growing fluid changing a moment later the hortha stood in front of him before mallory could react the hortha extended an arm and plunged the rapidly growing spike of blackthorn through mallorys chest caitlins voice was so weak her scream barely carried in his shock mallory felt nothing he staggered back a pace as the spike withdrew and examined the hole in his chest from which blood now pumped dazed he scrabbled for his sword but the hortha rapidly punched another spike into his gut this time the agony lanced through him and he yelled fighting to stay conscious his hand twitched and thrashed but couldnt reach llyrwyn and so one of the great swords of existence is consigned to search for a new master the hortha said impaled on the spike mallory was lifted off the ground and carried back to caitlin where he was dumped unceremoniously on the floor and for a moment he did black out when he regained consciousness the hortha was crouching beside him and caitlin was crying weakly the pool of blood around her had spread too far and her eyelids struggled to stay open mallory could tell from the position of his wound and the speed at which his blood was rapidly joining caitlins pool that he could not recover you had to trick us mallory said id have hacked you to pieces and kept hacking and then dumped you over the balcony if id known it was you i know the horthas crumpled paper face showed no emotion your resistance has been strong i needed a small seed of information to get through your defences and i found it your attachment to the genie in the bottle how did you know about that uninterested the hortha waved his comment away this end was fixed the moment i tasted your blood in the court of the soaring spirit it was only a matter of when the hortha said you could never outrun me you can kill me but youll never win mallory coughed up a mouthful of blood and ive got a whole bagful of cliches where that came from stick around ill bore you to death i have fulfilled my commitment to the devourer of all things and now i will wait until i am called again the hortha took the bag containing the extinction shears mallory was too weak to prevent him without these your cause is lost the hortha continued never mallory said the others will find another way the hortha glanced at caitlin who was fading in and out of consciousness she is gone too and now there is only this one to eradicate he plucked up the wayfinder and prepared to snuff out the dying flame blue fire erupted from the lantern and engulfed the hortha a highpitched wail leaped from him as he staggered backwards flapping madly to extinguish the flames but they burned so furiously that mallory couldnt bear to look at them and soon the highpitched wail was consumed too after a moment the flames sucked back into the lantern and there was nothing left of the hortha but a few charred twigs and a pile of grey ashes mallory spat more blood thatll teach you you bastard we win we always win he croaked beside him a shadow was moving across caitlins body it took a glimpse of red eyes in the umbra for him to realise it was the morrigan vacating her host the gaze fell on mallory and for the first time he saw a hint of warmth within them dont leave her mallory pleaded he knew if the morrigan left the body it was a clear sign that it was too late for caitlin the goddess would move on to another mare to ride please stay here shell live really the shadow hovered for a moment and then slipped away once it had gone caitlin stirred and gained a degree of alertness but she appeared oblivious to mallory and was staring into the dark as if she could see something the knight hes here and and she gave a warm smile which lingered for a while and then her life slipped from her mallory stifled a sob and reached out for her still hand his own life was draining from him fast but he didnt feel sad it would be good to expunge the one terrible thing he had done in his life to rest finally free from the struggle and the worry his only regret was that he wouldnt be there to help church and the others win but he still had the extinction shears and soon one of his brothers or sisters would find them and use them as they were intended he had no doubt about that he closed his eyes listening to the slowing beat of his heart steady easy finally but after a moment he realised he was no longer alone standing beside him smiling fondly was the young boy the others had discussed the one who had died but hadnt who was now one of the oldest things in the land he searched for the name in his fragmenting mind carlton thats right mallory the boy said you can read my thoughts mallory said weakly thoughts arent as ephemeral as you might think he laughed thats a big word for a kid im not a child never was really what are you then carlton only smiled so what youre an angel here to take me by the hand and lead me to the promised land you ought to know i dont believe in god i know you dont believe in anything thats served me well why are you here because youve reached the end of your story i know that im ready and youve accounted for the thing that troubles you the most how would you know youre a kid but thanks anyway carlton broke into a grin i like you mallory you were always a lot of fun weve never met before oh we have many times he waved gently to catch mallorys fading attention i want to show you something that no living person ever gets to see carlton motioned towards caitlin she was still dead the dark pool around her had become a sea and he realised that much of the blood was his look closely darkness pressed in around his vision he peered at the still form of his friend and saw a hint of movement not in caitlin but on her and a strange light in the vicinity of her belly that had no clear source the light coalesced grew harder became solid a silver egg emerged from caitlin as though it was insubstantial and passing through her it lay on her for a second then ran like mercury into a new shape before moving quickly away into the dark of the corridor mallory knew he had seen such a thing before he searched his memory thought of miller and salisbury and a strange yearning in the office of steelguard securities and then it came to him a caraprix he said what what was it doing in caitlin theres one in you too mallory indeed in all humans carlton knelt beside mallory and brushed the hair tenderly from his brow before you go i wanted to let you into a secret a big one part of the huge pattern that nobody ever gets to see while theyre alive youve earned it theres a caraprix in all of us like the gods the caraprix is in you the gods only get to be friends with them for a while what did you think they were mallory where do you think they came from no idea dont care the pendragon spirit is an amazing thing a shard of existence lodged in every human being a reminder of their potential and their potential all wrapped up in one but its even more than that its a seed waiting to be nurtured every experience a human has in their life is sunlight and water to that seed it grows and develops and becomes something wonderful the pendragon spirit becomes the caraprix humans tend them and grow them and then at the point of their death set them free and if theyve done a good job in their life the caraprix thrives and moves off to its destiny thats the point of life mallory thats the reason for the tough road the hardships and the suffering and the misery as you fight to overcome them youre growing these wonderful brilliant things but what do they do what are they for youll see mallory youll all see and then youll understand why human beings and their fragile hard lives and their loves and friendships their troubles and strife their passing irritations and great achievements their lows and highs their fears and wonders and awe are all so absolutely vital and so amazing and so much more important than you ever dreamed while you were going through them theres one in me theres one in you mallory itll be emerging soon and itll be a remarkable thing because youve nurtured it so well itll be one of the strongest and it will have a part to play well thats weird and unexpected and i still dont believe in stuff but carlton laughed the world had grown dark you close your eyes now mallory and be content youve done a great job everything that was expected of you and more youre a hero mallory you wont be forgotten ever mallory died carlton watched him for a moment studied the growing light and then gave a satisfied smile he had been right afterwards he picked up the wayfinder and blew on the dying spark that burned at the end of the wick it winnowed into a small flame and then grew larger and stronger until finally it burst from the lantern as it had when hal attacked the hortha with the last of his strength this time the flame folded in on itself and disappeared with a zzzzip leaving a bemused hal staring at his hands in incredulity he was human exactly as he had been up to the moment when he gave up his body to enter the blue fire what he said dazed im here im sorry to pull you from the blue fire hal i know exactly what youve lost but you had it for a while and thats more than anyone else of course hal said but i thought i was dying id given up every part of me exactly like every brother and sister of dragons youve been on your own personal road to enlightenment and transformation everything youve experienced has been preparing you for this moment and your last great sacrifice was the final exam i suppose you passed yeah hal thought for a moment and then said i miss it but in a way im still part of it i was a part of it for all time exactly what now carlton handed hal the wayfinder existence needs a caretaker hal someone to walk the boundaries watch over the fabric close some doors open others someone to turn on the lamps of hope in the dark of the night and extinguish them when dawns light touches the sky will you accept hal took a moment to assimilate the magnitude of what carlton was offering him and then he beamed of course i will carlton grinned i knew you would now pick up the extinction shears and lets be away everything is coming to a head and youll want to be there at the end chapter twelve once and future when church looked back at the cemetery cavern it wasnt a cemetery at all just bare rock covered by a thin grey dust lost in the shadows of the upper reaches the morvren flew calling to each other in voices that reminded church of griefstricken mourners at a funeral the three gods were nowhere to be seen a distant roaring was revealed to be an underground river that lay at the end of a short tunnel their path continued along the bank dont go near the water its poisoned tom cautioned as he examined the oily foulsmelling flow church took him to one side and asked i understand you cant tell me any details of what your visions are showing you but is there anything you can give me that might help everything hangs in the balance it could go either way if i choose to become the libertarian yes the void wins for all time existence wont recover weary toms shoulders sagged im sorry it was always my role to be your guide i was supposed to help you become the person you were always meant to be but im not much use you made the right choice in norway when you did that deal with freyja we wouldnt have the two keys ryan would probably still be a threat to us and ruth could well be dead it might be better if she was dead church flinched how can you say that love has two faces it gives us the power to do remarkable things and it can turn our minds from the right choices and damn us for ever church gripped his shoulders let me teach the teacher ive learned a lot of things since i found myself back in the iron age its not about good and evil its not that simple everything has two faces like janus like cernunnos like me with the fabulous beasts and the scary carrioneating ravens of death different views of the way forward one always influencing the other the trick is walking a fine line between the two it all comes down to how skilful we are at staying on the path it sounds odd what wisdom coming out of your mouth ive got one more question church steeled himself is anyone else going to die tom hesitated then replied yes dont ask me any more he walked quickly away before church could pursue that line of questioning its getting hot ruth said a mist rolled across the river and the walls dripped with moisture does that mean were getting closer to the burning man there is movement ahead shavi came to a halt two fingers resting against the bottom of his alien eye as he searched deep into the dark a low mournful wolflike howl rolled along the rocky walls i know that sound church recalled a smoky london night in the middle of the blitz bounding from the shadows on all fours came a lithe figure that could have been either man or beast grey hair trailed behind it pupils glowing golden in the gloom snarling lips curled back from rows of gleaming fangs loki church called to the others trickster and shapeshifter dont trust what you see as veitch braced himself sword drawn the god barrelled towards him shifted onto the rock wall without missing a step and then continued forwards along the tunnel roof wrongfooted veitch clumsily swung his blade upwards but loki had already passed overhead he dropped behind veitch lashed out with a long muscular arm that sent veitch flying towards the rivers edge and turned instantly on shavi shavi dived beneath raking claws that would have taken his head off rolling along the ground he helped veitch to his feet as church attacked loki flashed a lupine smile and disappeared baffled the next thing church saw was a golden eye mere inches away from his own and then pain erupted in his chest as claws raked upwards staggering back he saw blood spread across his ragged shirt loki lashed out again and though church pulled back at the last he caught a glancing blow that made him see stars his vision cleared when he was on his back loki hunched over him ready to tear out his throat the blast of blue fire blinded him blinking he saw lokis smoking twisted body lying on the rivers edge the god was still alive but he had lost control of his form it oozed like melting toffee into turrets and sticky strands the golden eyes still rolled in a head filled with holes ruth moved towards him though it took a second for church to recognise her so altered was she by the raw power of the craft her eyes all black her hair snaking you wont hurt him she raged the transformation had been so rapid that church was stunned how close to the edge was she if she could become so elemental so quickly she reminded him of the ruth who had almost been consumed by her power during the battle of london the same erosion of rational thought the same passion for the sheer coruscating force she wielded clutching at his stomach wound church sat up and croaked ryan shes losing it talk her down ruth darlin youve beaten him all right veitch ran to her side she turned her fierce gaze on him and for a second both church and veitch thought she was going to kill him on the spot after a moment some connection was made and her power receded her eyes returning to normal oh bravo the libertarian stood further along the rivers edge clapping mockingly what a fine fighting force you are a conflicted leader a psychopath a woman on the edge of a breakdown and he glanced curiously at shavi and tom not quite sure what you two are irrelevant i suppose with mounting unease church saw the crackling force around ruth begin to grow more intense again her face darkened her eyes glared oh look the trickster has torn open your true love the libertarian said to ruth mockingly why its a miracle he still lives ah but then wait and see what little surprise i have waiting for him next in her anger ruth lost control once more eddies of blue fire crackled above her head as she levelled the spear of lugh and released a blast of energy that the libertarian avoided easily is that the best you can do hell be dead before you know frankly you all will ruth church called he wont kill me if i die so does he filled with fury ruth didnt hear floating an inch above the floor she raced towards the libertarian who stood arms folded unmoved church couldnt understand what the libertarian had planned until he saw emerald clouds unfolding rapidly further along the river channel rushing forwards churning the clouds were accompanied by the sound of doors being slammed open lurching to his feet church called ruths name as janus appeared from a door in the air beside the libertarian his dual faces shifting between black and white as ruth bore down on the libertarian janus used his key with a flourish and another door opened in the air directly in front of her she disappeared into the gulf and after a brief mocking wave the libertarian followed shouting i really do need a new queen that last one got a little damaged and now i have one within a second janus was gone too and the only sound was the door in the air slamming with a terrible finality time passed though ruth was no longer aware of it her eyes rolled back so that only the whites were visible behind her mictlantecuhtli extended a skeletal hand to draw the misty tendril that would play with her memories of grief and loss corrupting her thoughts with their toxic load the libertarian watched with a faint mocking smile as bogus as everything else about him inside he was in turmoil the peaceful equilibrium he had achieved since he had accepted his transformation was gone apart from the odd stray memory he had thought that every part of his old life had been wiped away but ever since he had been compelled to kiss what he thought was a justdead ruth in greece he had felt incomprehensible stirrings apparently love crossed more barriers than hed thought he didnt want to believe that was true for it would set up a disturbing sequence of selfanalysis that could destroy his reassuring sense of what he had become better it meant he was still grounded in all that had gone before it meant he was still corrupted by the foul stuff that eventually destroyed humans yet now he could see a certain symmetry niamh and ruth the opposing faces of his former romantic life one had come and gone and now he could have the other finally by transforming her to become like him they could be together and the past could once again be eradicated and as he had long believed it would be the final act in his becoming if church could not have ruth as a human and could only gain her as the libertarian it was a choice he would always take the future was sealed all hope was gone church mate youve got to get a grip veitch urged theyd raced along the bank of the stinking river until the roof had become too low to proceed further and then had been forced to take winding roughcut steps back into the fortress the entire citywide building appeared to be on fire choking smoke swept through the gloomy corridors and the heat was rising by the minute they had to shout to be heard above the noise of warfare the blasts of fire from the fabulous beasts the collapse of massive buildings that shook the ground the constant jarring rise and fall of the siren church was consumed by his fears for ruth all thoughts of the destruction of the burning man now gone with caledfwlch drawn he ran ahead of the others moving inexorably towards the heart of the complex veitch eventually caught up with him and dragged him to a halt church rounded on him on the brink of striking out until shavi interposed himself between the two church we will rescue ruth dont you get it church raged this was the libertarians plan all along my plan ruth will be consumed by her dark side and join with the libertarian i wont have lost her to you he shook his sword at veitch ill have lost her to the worst aspects of myself the only way ill ever get her back is by becoming the libertarian tom and veitchs briefly exchanged glance was not missed thats right church continued the only way youre going to stop me is by killing me weaving through the corridors ahead of them he emerged from a large door into a vast circular area in the centre of the fortress it sloped down to an abyssal pit from which emerged the burning man a wicker structure towering so high that the top was lost in the pall of smoke within the flaming structure the bodies of gods writhed their essence fuelling the focus of power that would soon attract the void the portion of the wicker structure church could see was already filled with flames the moment of arrival could not be far off overhead the fabulous beasts released random blasts of flame before they disappeared back into the smoke everything was painted with the hellish red glare of the fire surging into the arena from every door on the perimeter was the army of the void thousands upon thousands of lamentbrood marching with their mechanical undead step redcaps roving like packs of wild beasts and a tidal wave of the sallowskinned brutish creatures okay then veitch had arrived at churchs shoulder we just need to get through that lot and were on course to give the burning man a bit of whatfor shavi searched the surrounding buildings no sign of mallory and caitlin with the extinction shears or hunter with the two keys above the milling army the air boiled and amidst a thunderous sound of slamming doors that drowned out all other noise janus appeared floating in the air he brandished the gold key and from another door emerged a figure whose image eventually coalesced into that of a rotund oriental man at least ten feet tall with a white moustache that drooped down to his feet he was naked apart from a loincloth but strands of human skulls hung down his body clattering every time he shifted his bulk whos that git veitch asked his appearance suggests he is yenlowang the chinese god of death and ruler of the fifth level of hell shavi replied a very powerful god with an aptitude for tormenting souls as yenlowang raised his arms the chaotic army became instantly silent and fell into step as though he were a puppeteer pulling their strings as one the army turned to face church and the others ragnarok tom whispered this is it all the prophecies lead here shavi was distracted by the white stone flags of the arena something is not quite right here deep in concentration he caressed the flesh around his alien eye before he said beneath the flagstones there is a force like the blue fire but opposite black as the flames on veitchs sword the libertarian calls it the bad blood veitch said uncomfortably it comes from the void like the blue fire comes from existence normally theres not much of it around but its been getting stronger the closer the void gets you step anywhere near that youre dead how are we going to get across there church said there is some kind of pattern shavi said hesitantly but i cannot see it the army of the void moved forwards holy fucking shit veitch said what are we going to do now we fight church said i thought i had a bleedin death wish i think i can beat you all on that front hunter was sitting on the edge of a balcony above them behind him laura stood sheepishly with miller and jack hanging back where hunter had ordered them to wait come on a little applause at the very least ive fought my way through ooh thousands of these neerdowells and i got the girl that amounts to epic win in my book shut up and get down here veitch said he nodded to laura you better now better enough to give you a good kicking she clambered down with hunter close behind and immediately gave shavi a hug and then surprisingly veitch whats that for he asked taken aback i thought you needed to know what a woman felt like you know final treat before you die distracted and on the edge of sanity church said harshly we can trust you now stung by his tone she forced a grin scouts honour churchdude slipping on the balor claw hunter turned towards the advancing army and pretended to count heads ill take the first hundred thousand split the rest up as you like you people are going to die what is wrong with you tom snapped but there was a hint of pride in his voice youre going to die too old man laura replied im going to be running back through those corridors as fast as my arthritic knees will carry me while theyre turning you into mulch tom said oh come on hunter said its not about winning or losing its about dying in such a spectacular manner that it becomes high art actually it is about winning for me veitch said shut up church gritted his teeth and raised caledfwlch over his shoulder and fight the tidal wave broke against them church fought like a fury with veitch barely a foot from his side one troubled eye always on his friend noting with each passing moment how quickly church was moving down the road towards becoming the libertarian it was etched in his face in the brutality with which he despatched the enemy in his cold unflinching focus but soon both were left behind by hunter who moved through the ranks with the balor claw bodies falling apart with every sweep of his hand no one got near him blimey where can i get me one of them veitch shouted sorry one of a kind hunter responded just like me he moved with the easy grace of a fieldworker scything through long grass but with every death his lips moved as he consigned the face to memory theyre too efficient veitch said its that bleedin god controlling them they should be going crazy with us ploughing through them like this leave that to me while the battle raged around her laura achieved a moment of absolute calm her attention focused on yenlowang floating above the skulls hanging from him appeared to move with a life of their own as he controlled every thought of the advancing army and directed them towards one purpose death plucking a seed from her pocket laura tossed it into the air as it spun towards yenlowang it sprouted shoots its momentum increasing yenlowang did not see it until the last inches from his face a woody tendril burst forth and prised its way between his lips an expression of surprise flourished on his face and then laura let the blue fire rise up within her and shift through the spectrum towards green growing at an incredible rate the tendril searched the intimate byways of yenlowangs body filling every space as it passed when it reached its limit laura gave one burst of concentration and the tendril doubled in size a loud pak accompanied the explosion of yenlowangs corporeal form a wave of disorientation ran through the ocean of bodies church veitch and hunter renewed their attack so many dismembered corpses piled around them that they had built their own defences nice one darlin veitch said but were only scratching the surface here the glance he exchanged with hunter expressed more clearly his fears that they would be overwhelmed in a very short time hunter brushed his forehead as his mind felt the gentle touch of his brother cavalrys coming maybe its not the alamo after all from the rooftops the fomorii swarmed dropping into the arena their gleaming black bodies snapped shifted mutated sprouting wings fangs armour razorsharp cutting spikes crablike claws barbed blades hooked drills crushing jaws efficient machines they plunged into the middle of the packed bodies and were instantly lost in a whirl of activity that sent limbs and blood spraying high into the air the utter confusion they caused was only the beginning close behind the fomorii came the gods gleaming gold in the hellish gloom the tuatha de danaan burst from doorways around the arena with lugh at their head and set about the enemy fiercely behind them were the others wielding hammers axes spears filled with the hopes of different cultures but all connected by the same threads of blue fire viracocha burning like the sun come down to earth ogoun surrounded by the heat and smoke of a furnace as he wielded his machete benten the sheer power of her beauty forcing the enemy to lay down their arms after a while they became like flashes of light reflected off burnished metal flitting through the darkness soon the army of dragons raced from the maze of corridors to join them their power limited to the courage in their hearts but no less for that the blue light that surrounded the brothers and sister of dragons dimmed as church lowered caledfwlch oblivious to the others around him concentration turned his face to stone an instant later he was looking at the churning army from the perspective of the fabulous beast while at the same time facing the ranks of the brutish creatures struggling to get over the mound of bodies down he dived swooping low over their heads and then released a blast of purifying fire that gave him a shudder of pleasure a smoking blackened path scoured through the enemy towards the burning man as church returned to his body the morvren flocked down to form a swirling black cloud around him cawing and shrieking with voices that sounded almost human and gleeful veitch was forced to back away a step he eyed tom and shavi uneasily and weighed his sword in his hands neither gave him the guidance he needed churchs angry voice broke through the deafening wings i can do anything and the birds rushed as one towards janus the god disappeared in the storm cloud and when the birds dissipated he was gone veitch caught churchs arm as he prepared to advance down the smouldering path you gotta watch out for the black fire mate one wrong step and its game over when i was up there a minute ago i saw a pattern church replied weve had prophecies of this day tied up in the old stories for millennia but theres also been clues hidden in it how so spirals carved into rocks from neolithic times spiral patterns in celtic artwork their story of the spiral path as a journey through life those things were put there so wed remember them and think about their meaning the spiral path marks how the blue fire runs in the land but its also the way through the maze of black fire those clues were left for us to read now church you have to prepare yourself for the possibility that ruth may already be dead shavi said the libertarian may be tricking you with hope church glanced at tom who gave nothing away if shes dead if shes dead and you let yourself become the libertarian you killed her laura caught his hand dont go down that road churchdude you can fight it thats why youre the big old chosen one and not the rest of us losers church turned and moved away along the spiral path before any of them had the chance to see if he had accepted lauras words they followed him as they always had as they always would cutting down any of the enemy that attempted to impede their route around the arena they raced always moving closer to the acrid smell of burning that was worse than any of the other fires raging across the fortress the feet of the burning man disappeared deep into an abyss separated by the bridge that ran between them beneath it a tunnel plunged following the line of the bridge church knew he would have to descend into it even before he reached the yawning entrance the vision he had received in the forbidden city was as clear as if he had lived it broken on his knees before the libertarian in the dark beneath the arena with the abyss on either side and the legs of the burning man turning the cavern into hell despair gripped church as he realised he couldnt see any way that that future would not come to be steeling himself he raced into the dark with the shrieks of the morvren echoing in his ears anxious hunter laura shavi and veitch paused briefly at the entrance nearby tom held his head with both hands this is it hunter said we cant hold back any longer if it looks like hes going to become the libertarian one of us has to stop him and by that you know what i mean ill do it veitch said its my responsibility you cant laura said desperately hes the king thats what you keep calling him the king throughout history when the land has to be saved or renewed the king has to be sacrificed tom said shut up you old git laura glared at him im just saying if you can find another alternative if not tom looked to veitch a roar echoed above the clamour of battle shivering laura watched a figure silhouetted against the flames on one of the rooftops partbeast partvegetation oh god hes come for me she whispered cernunnos the green man bounded into the throng he was not alone a flash low and lean on the edge of vision signalled the arrival of the puck a glimmer of blue light a small figure filled with a power that dwarfed the world time appeared to stand still there was silence and a cold cold wind as the oldest things in the land drew rapidly closer never in plain sight and then cernunnos was towering over laura and all she could see was his eyes filling her vision im sorry she said do not be afraid daughter his voice boomed i harbour no ill feelings you played your part well and bore your own personal pain like a true sister of dragons a tear of relief sprang to lauras eye cernunnos turned to the others this road is nearly done your parts played out an end fast approaches but its outcome is yet in doubt existence holds its breath and here in the heart of the final battle all is still the shimmer of the pucks grin there then gone fools and lovers all the clock has turned the final moment beat stay your hands now only three that magic number can stand cernunnos towered over veitch you have learned of death brother of dragons that was your role go now and put into practice all that you know veitch nodded and raced into the dark after church lovers the puck added in a quiet enigmatic tone and fools it was dank and dark for the first section of the tunnel but eventually it opened out onto a broad stone bridge framed by the glare of the burning man whose arms reached down into the abyss on either side when church glanced over the edge it was impossible to see more than a few feet into the darkness as though some quality of the place was draining the light away the strip of rock overhead appeared to be pressing down upon him adding to the claustrophobic atmosphere torches flickered all around in the gulf caledfwlchs flames danced as church advanced across the bridge but even the blades light was dimmed this is where it all happens church thought be ready now red eyes glimmered in the gloom ahead and he realised the libertarian was there wheres ruth he said why do you care the libertarian mocked shes moved away from you shes with me now which is you oh what a strange and sweet paradox if shes attracted to you shed be secretly attracted to me i dont know why you never thought of that ruths stronger than me and you whatever she might feel for us shed walk away rather than pick the wrong side shed sooner see us both dead and suffer a broken heart i love it the libertarian exclaimed the romanticism a broken heart its like listening to yourself as a child all that innocence all that ignorance ruth was nowhere to be seen but church knew she had to be close at hand you see both you and the lovely ruth have been on a learning journey the libertarian continued she has seen the real you not the good decent purehearted hero that legend would have us believe in within you lurks the seed of me and without that knowledge she would not have been so easily turned what do you mean the libertarian gestured flamboyantly behind church at the entrance to the bridge ruth stood in the tightfitting black outfit that niamh had once worn consumed by the power of the craft bolts of energy crackled around her as she floated inches above the floor her eyes on fire shes mine now the libertarian said the only way you can get her back is by becoming me you see even though ive moved on i still understand the human heart and its many many weaknesses despite all the battles and the great adventures that in essence is what its all been about love it means more to humans than saving the world it means everything theres a reason for that church said it really does mean everything thats what you dont get the libertarian laughed still playing the innocent with your syrupy philosophies life has harder edges than that church looked from ruth to the libertarian weighing whether he could reach either one before he was struck down this moment right at the end of time is fluid the libertarian said it will already be deviating from the vision you had in the forbidden city because your knowledge of your destiny now alters your choices but without changing the outcome you were never up to doing what needed to be done to prevent me coming into being because of love his words dripped contempt youve reached the end of the pattern and found that its a maze that always leads back on itself the only way to prevent me defeating you is to kill ruth and then kill me ruth is my key the key to your heart your hopes when i toss your bleeding body into the flames of the burning man it is her power that will help you be reborn as me kill her and end this now church glanced back at ruth and knew the libertarian had won ignoring the futility he turned and raced towards his futureself with sword held high the blast from ruth came just as he had anticipated hurling him up into the air blood splattered all around from a score of wounds next to him caledfwlch lay shattered the blue fire extinguished the outlines of the sword blurred and changed continually not a sword at all church tried to pull himself to his feet spat a mouthful of blood and collapsed on the stone his body felt drained of energy in the distance a pack of dogs howled their voices joining to become one gutwrenching mournful cry for what was about to be lost the libertarian cupped his ear the hounds of avalon he said every time the world ends they get to sing it out in style and the void has ended it many times pressing the reset button and starting again but this is the last the ultimate the end so let them howl their hearts out one final time the libertarian caught church by the lapels and pulled him up three minutes to go brother of dragons three minutes until the final absolute victory of the devourer of all things the end of all hope for existence that is what you have thrown away with your stupid love you never realised how important you were to everything or you wouldnt have made so many stupid mistakes you were always the key to existence succeeding both as a man in the things you did and as a symbol of everything that existence is but when i throw you into that abyss you will be wiped from existence no one will remember you you will not have existed you will never have existed and reality will reshape itself around the vacuum you leave behind with me without you without the very symbol of existence nothing can ever change again existence is destroyed the void wins for ever no church croaked im not that important you always rattled on about the power of symbols and failed to see how crucial you were the king the power in the land the hope of all reality in its darkest hour with you gone with you never having existed there is no hope and without hope there is only despair the libertarian hauled church to the edge of the bridge i should say something poetic like prepare to come to nothing like all your dreams but i think ill settle for die you bastard die and be gone so i can forget about you finally from the dark veitch watched ruth launch her attack on church in the dying flare of the light he dashed forwards and threw himself at ruth clamping a hand over her mouth as he dragged her back into the dark the shock of the attack prevented her from using her craft and by the time she had recovered he had his sword at her throat across the bridge he could hear the libertarian mocking church as he talked about wiping him from existence but he kept his focus on ruth her eyes crackled with power but he continued to whisper her name and slowly the subtle manipulation of mictlantecuhtli ebbed away to reveal the ruth with whom he had fallen in love right then he understood his role in the pattern if he and ruth had not shared affection she would never have responded to his quiet words would have fought him and probably killed him there was a reason for his heartache and that made it a little more palatable its all right darlin youre back church hes still alive veitch could see she was aware of everything that had transpired you have to stop church becoming the libertarian ryan tears flooded her eyes if you kill him church cant be wiped from existence hell always be a symbol hell always have the power to affect things even from death and the libertarian will never come into being veitch glanced over at the libertarian counting out the seconds as he held church close to the abyss theres a better way he said you cant take any risks he gave the cocky smile that she had always loved theres always a better way yet she saw in his eyes something deep and mature and very unlike veitch and it troubled her deeply what are you planning he whispered it in her ear you cant ryan gripping his arm she fought to stop herself becoming distressed i dont matter here he said church matters you matter i was always along just to make sure you two made it through to the finish line and thats what im going to do now my last act ryan if you go into the abyss youll be wiped from existence no one will ever remember you he grinned not the end of the world but that was all you ever wanted for people to remember you as a hero yeah that was all i wanted he glanced back to check on the libertarian and church a minute to go the fires of the burning man were growing more intense the void was coming ive learned a lot from church and you and the others im a better man now i know whats important its not whats out there or what people think its whats inside ive got a whole world in here in the past i could never look inside myself it was too frightening but now if i know im going out a hero well thats good enough thats important dont do it ryan there isnt any other choice darlin this is the whole reason im here i know that now he wiped a tear from her cheek a kiss he said wont mean anything i know you love church and thats right ive got my head around it now but it would be nice she pulled his head down and kissed him deeply when he broke away his smile melted her heart i can die easy now theres nothing else i want he tore away from her grip as a roar began to fill the cavernous space the heat from the burning man increased sharply the flames turning a deep scarlet dropping his sword veitch ran he thought of his father and his mother of the mermaids swimming by his boat and the tiny people with gossamer wings who always instilled such peace and he thought of the woman he loved more than anything else in the world more than life itself hitting the libertarian full force they both went over the edge of the bridge while church slumped against the side clinging on at the last veitch thought he saw relief in the libertarians red lidless eyes his adversary had time for one word ryan and then they plunged down into the dark ryan church yelled as he watched veitch and the libertarian fall ruth scrambled to his side remember him church dont let his memory die dont the words died in her throat they stared at each other in incomprehension for a moment and then church dragged himself to the centre of the bridge what just happened ruth shook her head i dont know she looked around we we must be the burning man we have to destroy it church nodded although he instinctively knew that was not the correct answer where are the others on cue miller and jack ran in accompanied by shavi and tom hunter and laura are guarding the entrance shavi said but there is no sign of mallory and caitlin we do not have the extinction shears yes you do walking along the bridge from the opposite side the wayfinder held high so that the blue light lit his path came a cloaked figure hal church said baffled by his human form the caretaker hal said with a smile the new one theres no time to explain here he handed over the extinction shears what do we do church asked you use the two keys to destroy the holding matrix for the void and then you use the extinction shears to untether him from reality the void will be lost for ever the roaring became deafening the burning man glowed so brightly they could barely look at it a deep dread closed in around them and a feeling that a terrifying presence was only a room away no time hal stressed the wishhex in me wont be enough to destroy that jack peered over the edge of the bridge into the fire i can help miller said calmly of course i can see why im here now as the wishhex starts to destroy you i can heal you so you can keep releasing the power you can do that i i think so jack said keep the chain reaction going miller looked around the others we always knew it was going to come to this dont worry about us but if you go into the abyss youll be wiped from existence ruth said no one will ever know you existed just like no one knew of a name began to come then faded rapidly good jack said then mahalia wont feel any pain she can get on with her life his maturity brought a swell of pride to ruth and church i wish hunter was here jack said he was the word choked in his throat never mind jack stepped onto the edge of the bridge and miller wrapped his arms around him tightly the roaring was so loud they could barely hear themselves speak go church yelled jack and miller threw themselves off the bridge instantly a white light washed out and a moment later a blue glow the two intertwining merging a burst of the white light rolled upwards and the bridge shook and then cracked huge chunks plummeting down into the abyss as church ruth tom and shavi ran back the way they had come church snatched up a sword it wasnt the shattered caledfwlch and he had no idea who it belonged to but it felt right in his hand he sheathed it the caretaker was nowhere to be seen as the bridge fell into the abyss and the white and blue light continued to roll out in waves the structure of the burning man began to break up and fall apart the scarlet flames leaped out with a life of their own no longer able to maintain any shape we did it the matrix is breaking up church opened the extinction shears and felt their pulsing energy rush up his arms and into his heart he knew he wasnt really holding shears on the edge of his perception images shifted constantly hinting at something much bigger something that reached across worlds now we just need to get rid of the void for ever as the frame of the burning man plunged into the abyss and the flames roiled out of control a voice rang out far behind him church stop them use the shears stop them he didnt turn his concentration was fixed on the flames he was convinced he could see a face in them that would haunt him for the rest of his days part of him knew the voice was hunters that the warning was important but he didnt turn crying out in shock ruth thrust church to one side as a seemingly endless army of spiders streamed towards the furiously churning flames their metallic bodies glinting in the ruddy furnace light stop them hunter called closer now church glanced back to see hunter and laura racing behind the flow of spiders beyond them cernunnos carlton and the caretaker all looked on with deep concern he realised too late that it was the moment his future self had warned him about so many times when youre in otherworld and they call heed it right away the spiders flowed around the weakened essence of the void lost in the flames carving through reality to create a door in the air leading to the superstructure behind everything where the spiders moved freely across all time and space as church raced to the edge of the shattered bridge the swirling flames were sucked through the gaping door falling through the spiders worked rapidly to seal the opening behind them they had taken the void to another place perhaps another time they would be bringing it back from the doorway behind reality coloured lights leaked out and church felt the very nature of the cavern alter mists rolled all around and suddenly he was in the warp zone again and there were numerous versions of himself at different points in his history wandering baffled determined scared fighting desperate to send a message to himself to change what had occurred he raced from one to the other calling is this it is this the right time you have to listen to me this is a warning but of course he knew it was futile that didnt stop him confused by the shifting reality of the warp zone he added is this the right place am i too late to the multiple churches he insisted when youre in otherworld and they call heed it right away theyre going to bring him back theyre suddenly he glimpsed the spiders closing the door in the air and remembered where he was too late he yelled racing out of the colours to the edge of the abyss with only a sliver remaining church brought the shears together there was a moment when everything seemed to hang and church felt as if he was floating in a brilliant white light but with a sound like the crystalclear chime of a bell he was snapped back into the harsh reality of the cavern and flung head over heels in a rushing wind his head hit stone and he blacked out will he be all right silence please come back to me please dont worry its nearly over therell be peace peace surfacing from disturbing dreams church found himself lying out in the wastelands surrounded by his friends on the horizon there was a smudge of scarlet gold and black where the fortress of the enemy burned and above it the fabulous beasts swooped majestically caught in the rosy light of the setting sun we did it he asked still dazed i dont know what you did exactly but the enemys army lost all heart for the fight squatting beside him tom looked more at peace than church had ever seen him he pulled off the ring freyja had given him and tossed it down a dune into the ochre dust looking up into the darkening sky church said the stars are coming out ruth brushed a hair from his forehead i never thought id see that again levering himself onto his elbows church asked are we all here yes ruth replied you me tom shavi laura and hunter five brothers and sisters of dragons one hangeron she smiled at tom but it was gradually replaced by a puzzled sad expression church understood strange it feels as if somebodys missing shrugging off a sharp pang of grief he clambered to his feet nearby the army of dragons and the gods celebrated loudly the brothers and sisters of dragons moved amongst the knots of strange beings surprised by the camaraderie and the hugs and backslaps from ones who may well have tormented them only a few days earlier not far away virginia and the other refugees stared at the sky in mute disbelief lugh saw that church had recovered and made his way up the dune with rhiannon close behind brother of dragons you have the thanks of all of the golden ones indeed of all living things in all the lands he shook churchs hand warmly the void isnt gone for good church said yes and no lugh said enigmatically this is the dawn of a new age a golden age you will soon understand it is a new age too for the brothers and sisters of dragons rhiannon added you were forged to prevent the victory of the void this day you will have a new role now and in that spirit we the golden ones have a request equals to equals go on church said the great sadness that lies at the heart of our people is the loss of our homes gorias finias falias and murias lugh continued his eyes blazed with a hopeful excitement help us find them help the tuatha de danaan return to their ancestral homes and bring joy to our hearts again it would be a quest that would live up to the great legend of the brothers and sisters of dragons the filid would sing songs of such an achievement until the stars came down church glanced around the others and saw the silent answer we owe you for your help and sacrifice he said once weve rested well start to plan lugh and rhiannon could barely contain their joy they thanked the brothers and sisters of dragons profusely and then hurried back to the ranks of their people to spread the news soon their celebration dwarfed even that of the army of dragons and the other gods in the growing gloom a blue light gleamed across the wastelands wait here church said to the others ill be back in a while as he set out towards the light he was distracted by the strange but familiar sight of a puppeteer standing alone on the blasted terrain eight feet tall wearing black robes and a white mask with a nose that arched like a birds beak he looked just as church had seen him in venice in the sixteenth century his hands moved rapidly above five dancing puppets though there were no strings the puppets lifelike faces were exactly as church had guessed church approached him and for long moments watched the silent show then he reached up and removed the puppeteers mask without any resistance his own face looked back at him though that too resembled a mask its true then church asked the puppeteer only gave an enigmatic smile realising he would get nothing more church headed once again towards the light and when he glanced back briefly the puppeteer was gone no marks in the dust to suggest he had ever been there soon all thoughts of what he had seen faded to be replaced by the unexpected sensation of a great weight lifting from his shoulders could it be all over after so long he scarcely dared believe it night came down quickly in the desert hal waited for him the wayfinder a blue beacon of hope in the desolate landscape his cloak was wrapped about him against the plummeting temperatures youre the new caretaker how did that happen church asked long story its a big job an important job someone needs to do it and i guess i passed the entrance exam dont do yourself down you deserve it walk with me hal held the lantern high to guide their way across the wastelands its not over is it no im sorry church its never over never never churchs heart sank on the bright side you get to spend eternity with the best friends you could ever wish for you get to be a tremendous force for good in the universe shaping the lives of untold millions and you get to be king now and always so we didnt win today despite all the deaths and the pain we didnt win church said wearily oh you won the wayfinders sapphire glow gave hals smile a strange transcendental quality you won bigger and better than you ever dreamed hals words resonated with what lugh had said about the void and the new age and church had a strange sensation of something of incomprehensible magnitude drawing around him he shivered although he had no idea why on the crest of a rise hal indicated the shifting colours of the warp zone ahead thats still here church said i thought it was some bizarre side effect of the void its going to stay here and itll be your new home hal laughed when he saw churchs baffled expression in a way its time i told you everything they sat together on the ridge in the chill desert night under the lamp of the full moon across the heavens the glorious sweep of stars brought a shiver of magic and a feeling that anything could happen hal set the wayfinder in the dust and watched the blue flame dance destroying the burning man weakened the void immensely if thered been time to use the extinction shears the void would have been cut from this reality for ever i dont know if that would have been such a good thing everything needs two sides two faces one to define the other and to give it value we need the void and existence its just a matter of balance hal nodded slowly they said you were wise so is this how it was meant to have turned out all part of the pattern who knows i dont what i do know is the spiders took the void to safety in the past that dark force can reappear at any time in earths history to try to change things so that what happened today never happened watching the drifting colours of the warp zone church thought he understood its the job of the brothers and sisters of dragons to oppose the void wherever it appears hal said in the renaissance the seventies the norman conquest the jurassic era for all i know whenever the void starts to exert its influence calling on new allies creating new threats trying to shift the pattern you and your brothers and sisters will be there to stop it through the warp zone we can reach any time and any place exactly it was always going to be this way you read all the legends the old stories the king waiting across the water the ocean of time and space at the darkest hour when the call would go out and he would return with his knights to vanquish evil and save the land the brothers and sisters of dragons become the urmyth yes i know that story church drew the sword he had picked up near the shattered bridge after caledfwlch it had a strange feel but it felt right as though it had been held by good people despite the way the blue and black flames appeared to fight along the length of the blade so we dont get to rest you get to live for ever with the people you love the most because time never passes here in the far lands or there in the warp zone always young always strong the greatest hero existence has fighting the true fight for all time does that not feel good church considered it for a moment and realised it did it felt in a strange way like heaven the best reward of all lugh and the tuatha de danaan have asked for our help he said youll have time for that after all youve got an army of dragons to help you out and more gods than you can shake a stick at if you really need them he laughed quietly so we keep repelling the void at every turn but we cant destroy it because without the void we would never have been challenged enough to grow and become what we are today we needed that dark side to learn how to be good that was part of the plan too right existence needed the void to achieve its ends theres irony in there somewhere hal began to say something about the caraprix but then caught himself and would only shake his head enigmatically when church pressed him but something happened when i used the extinction shears i felt it church said something amazing you severed the voids connection to the warp and the weft it escaped into the pattern of the past but from this day on it has no connection the void cant exist in the future you freed all the worlds church the voids influence will always be felt through the infinite connections but it can have no control there is no mundane spell what lies ahead is the kingdom of the serpent existence will rule the balance for the first time since time began it really will be a golden age the possibilities were too vast for church to comprehend the future hasnt been written yet hal said theres still a very important job to do but thats for tomorrow right now enjoy the knowledge that every sacrifice has been worthwhile you won church they sat in silence watching the moon make shadows across the desert and the stars glinting like jewels in the vast chamber of the night and church felt at peace for the first time he felt at peace epilogue happy ever after after church had explained what the future held he took ruth away into the desert and left shavi tom hunter and laura sitting around a large campfire drinking a potent brew that some of the norse gods had brought with them so an eternity of fighting could be worse laura said its going to play murder with my plans for a caribbean holiday hunter prodded the fire and sent a cascade of sparks shooting towards the stars laura saw shavi smiling to himself as he looked around the circle what are you thinking mr enigmatic seer laura prompted or is it more of your weird sex fantasies i am thinking that this has ruined churchs motto for his tshirts no happy endings he said and here we are this he gestured expansively is more than i could ever have hoped for the best of friends a family even we faced death we faced heartache and we moved beyond them together by relying on each other and we built bonds that have enriched us all i am very very happy nobody spoke for a while as they reflected on shavis words and realised the depths of those bonds but then laura glimpsed toms face in the firelight in it were fears and doubts she recognised dont think youre getting away you old bastard she said tom flashed a suspicious glare her way youre one of us if i havent got you who am i going to torment i am not a brother of dragons tom said no you are our guide our wisdom our conscience shavi responded jiminy cricket we need you thatll teach you old man laura said youre going to have to spend an eternity listening to shavi ramble on about the philosophic connections between the fluff in his belly button and the way a bumblebee dances we can all wallow in our misery together laura saw the relief on toms face as his fear of loneliness drained away and she felt a sense of satisfaction that she had secretly helped him they were more alike than either of them would have cared to admit then i will accept my miserable responsibility and attempt to drill some sense into all of you he grumbled have pity my life is over he took out his tin and carefully constructed a rollup from his dwindling supplies a smile playing on his lips laura stood up stretched like a cat and took hunters hand sex he said like you stand a chance with me its only been charity didnt you realise that she hauled him away from the light enjoying the feel of his hand in hers youre not inviting your friend over for a drink laura indicated the silhouette of the hooded giant away in the desert hes not a great socialiser he going to be joining us in the great beyond itll be like having children without going through the whole childbirth thing thats how i always wanted children in the shadow of a dune they held each other and kissed ive got a question hunter said after a while whats your name you know my name not that dusantiago bollocks thats for the idiots you wrap around your little finger this is me privileged information ive never trusted anyone enough to tell them that once someone knows your real name they have power over you dont you listen to any of churchs crazy ramblings he waited smith she sighed laura smith you see the reverse is actually true he said now you have power over me they kissed again and it felt as if it would go on for ever hand in hand church and ruth walked out of the warp zone into a misty morning just before dawn familiar comforting smells of exhaust fumes damp vegetation and the heavy deep aromas of the river reached them they breathed deeply soothed by the silky sensation of the mist on their faces the city breathed slow and easy too it dreamed good dreams where are we ruth looked from the hazy street lamp to the parked cars covered in dew dont you recognise it come on as they walked along the road the trees eventually revealed the lights of albert bridge and ruth smiled london where we met she said with a smile god that seems so long ago we were different people then if we knew what lay ahead do you think wed have carried on down that road youre joking arent you they walked to the railings and looked down at the slowmoving river miss that chance to peel back the boring real world and see the magic that lies behind it i remember a fabulous beast swooping out of the night over the lights of the motorway stone circles still and peaceful under the stars hidden doors in crumbling castles secrets encoded in the landscape thousands of years ago old knowledge shining new light on life the craft flying magic swords a boat that sails between worlds a welsh night and a being as old as time eyes burning in a face made of leaves ushering her into a new life with a brand on her hand friendship love and the blue fire burning just beneath the surface of the land and in the stones and in hearts the world is better than it seems and so are people she said weve been allowed a glimpse into the biggest mystery of all the knowledge that theres so much more i wouldnt trade that for anything the voids influence is still here its going to take people a while to open their eyes and pull themselves out from under the effects of the mundane spell but once they have therell be no going back this is the start of something big and new and a fox trotted out of the mist and paused when it saw them in its eyes was a light church hadnt noticed before it was filled with secrets the fox looked them over as if greeting fellow travellers and then moved on in that moment was a strange magic that neither could explain why have you brought me here ruth asked i wanted to remind myself what was important before he looked around at the trees and the lights and the still dark houses whatever lies ahead he was interrupted by a splash in the river below them glowing with a dull golden light a low long boat drifted slowly in the flow and aboard it were the seelie court returning once again to the land they loved each mysterious member looked around in awe at the scenery but the queen caught sight of church and gave a slight enigmatic bow once they had passed ruth slipped her arm around churchs waist and rested her head on his shoulder since we met here things got so complex weve been through cynicism darkness weve become more troubled but in the end innocence wins out she said that was always the message in the circle of misty light beneath a lamp tom waited its time he said it was always going to be you wasnt it church said of course im your guide can ruth come after a moments hesitation tom nodded shes the one who kept you on the path looking around one final time church glanced up and thought he glimpsed a brief light somewhere through the layers of fog so high so fleeting it would have been easy to miss it a burst of fire ive been here before church said of course you have we all have at some time tom replied we leave here and we return here a cavern a space deep in the earth the smell of damp and the chill of the dark a blue light guided the three of them forwards until they encountered hal holding the wayfinder aloft i am the caretaker hal said i keep a light burning in the darkest night i serve all who come to me whether their hearts are filled with hope or tainted by despair church recognised the words and now understood that it was a ritual greeting beyond hal lay a cave where a cauldron bubbled over a small fire poised over it was a man with wild grey hair clutching a long staff and an old woman in a black dress who could have been his twin her face smeared with dirt or grease so that her eyes stared with a terrible intensity look into the cauldron the woman said uneasily church ventured beside her and peered into the depths he saw himself lying on a bed eyes closed with people watching him there was an air of uncertainty to the image is that the truth then he asked am i really dying the real question is does it matter the wildhaired man said nothing is true except what you make it the old woman cackled church wanted to see more to try to understand but tom gently pulled him away where are we going church asked you have learned the ability to alter much the wildhaired man shouted after them as hal led them along a tunnel there was a flash beside them a fleeting grin mischievous eyes fools and lovers are the greatest heroes the puck said this merry wanderer of the night will wander alone no longer he gave a flourishing bow and disappeared a feeling of dread fell across them as they approached another cave cernunnos waited outside it his eyes glowing within the vegetation of his face he indicated that church should enter you have something that belongs to the daughters of the night he said inside the cave three hooded women stood their faces hidden they were the source of the dread that made churchs flesh crawl one spins threads one measures them cernunnos said and the other from the small bag at his belt church pulled the extinction shears they sang as he brought them into the light when the third woman reached out a bony hand and reclaimed the shears church took care not to brush her fingers with his own at the side of the cave a silvery thread stretched from the shadows above down to the floor the third woman opened the shears around the thread and waited slowly she turned to look at church he bowed his head afraid that if he looked into the depths of her cowl he would die what is that thread he asked unsettled you dont need to know that hals tone was sympathetic youve returned what belongs to the daughters of the night lets move on outside the cave carlton waited beaming he shook churchs hand and then ruths and toms were nearly done now he said but i wanted to let you know that what you have achieved is no more than what was expected of you and in the final reckoning remarkable youve earned the faith that was placed in you church what do you want me to do church asked destroy the world destroy all the worlds what church said incredulously turn the axis of existence as you did once before i dont understand carlton smiled destroy whats out there church do what the void could not do church gaped remake the world as you would see it made remake for a long moment church tried to comprehend if there was some hidden meaning in carltons comments but the honest innocence in the boys face told him the truth thats insane i cant do that you are the only one who can how long are you giving me seven days im not god the insanity of what was being proposed left church reeling why church ruth took his hand supporting him everything that has happened to you has been preparing you for this moment carlton said im not prepared how can you say anyone is prepared to change the world church looked from ruth to tom tom rested a reassuring hand on churchs shoulder during my travels i read the story of the pilgrims progress he said and that is essentially what you have done youve journeyed around britain across time around the world and across the dimensions meeting humanity and life in all its forms learning valuable lessons from your experiences you know what it is to be human to feel to love that is what has prepared you for this moment destroy the world and remake it i cant do that its too big im not up to it then leave it just how it is but maybe with a few slight changes tom prompted slowly what tom was saying dawned on ruth her eyes gleamed yes she breathed think of it a world thats about magic not money thats about friendship and love not power and youre the best person to do that how can you say that church tried not to feel betrayed nobody should have that kind of power the ultimate power i could be as bad as the void what if i didnt like i dont know people who walked with a limp so i made sure they didnt exist in this brave new world because i know you a quiet confidence suffused ruths face i know in any given situation you will always do the right thing youve proven that over and over again i trust you too tom said is that why they brought you along my mentor to convince me they could have brought any of the others they all would have said the same thing im not the person you think i am youve never had confidence in yourself tom said youve doubted at every turn but your actions have shown the truth on the long road you were presented with numerous opportunities to go the wrong way you could have given it all up to pursue your love for ruth the sole defining factor in your life but you kept going you kept true youre a hero im not church snapped im nobody im just an ordinary bloke and maybe thats whats needed here ruth said quietly somebody who knows the right thing when he sees it somebody who understands simple uncynical easily mocked concepts like love or innocence or duty sacrifice her admiration for him was so powerful he could barely look at her we need a better world tom said everybody on the planet wants that they dont want a world ruled by those desperate to make money or seek power they want something true and honest and its your responsibility to give them that dont say that its your duty tom insisted quietly the words hung heavy on churchs shoulders desperate and isolated he lowered his head and closed his eyes wrestling with his answer after a moment he sighed how does it work come with me carlton took churchs hand and led him to a large cavern filled with a brilliant light it took church a while to realise the cavern was filled with caraprix all of the mutating creatures in a state of flux amongst them stood jerzy blankeyed but alive god you manipulated that poor bastard church said you made sure one of those shapeshifting things was stuck in his head to call all the others home the mocker will live carlton said hes been a good servant how are those things going to help the caraprix are like the spiders if you will carlton said they are the agents of existence they can unpick the weft and the weave and then weave a new reality they are machines of creation church watched the silver creatures continually change shape so theyre like angels carlton laughed i decide what the worlds going to be like and they go out and make it a reality something like that where do they come from thats not for you to know right now but they destroyed the drakusa church said they were a real threat the drakusa did everything they could to wipe them out but the caraprix committed genocide the drakusa had the potential to become agents of change but they chose to direct all their abilities to their own ends they ignored the greater good they desired power for themselves they crushed other races that fell before them if they had been true to who they were perhaps the golden age could have been ushered in a long long time ago so you destroyed them me no the oldest things in the land are agents just like you church we worked and strove and failed sometimes but did existence wipe out the drakusa yes they chose to work for the void though they didnt understand it in their terms innocence does not mean weakness how many races fell like the drakusa every race has a choice act for the greater good bring magic back into the world or support the aims of the void carlton said free will church there is a pattern but everyone has a choice the only rule is they must accept responsibility for their actions if you seek out personal power and lay others low do not be surprised when a higher power decides to do the same to you sounds very old testament to me church watched the caraprix change and for the first time felt awe he could see something wonderful in the very essence of them everyone has a choice fragile creatures didnt fail you didnt fail church steeled himself theres no point talking lets do this youre ready no but ill do my best thats all anyones ever asked of you church and youve never let anyone down carlton led church back to ruth and tom who waited by the cave he thought he had visited in a dream when he had been in the sleep like death whatever lay inside made his perception skew wildly he saw a network of lights a mandala a rotating crystal and then the image his mind found easiest an enormous machine of cogs and gears with a protruding lever just like before pull the lever itll be easier this time carlton said symbols church whispered to himself before announcing this could be the last gasp of my dying brain the final shape of the hallucination pull the lever and its all over is that what it is the lever is death its whatever you believe it to be carlton said ruth kissed him on the cheek just remember whatever happens weve won against all the odds weve rid the world of corruption its been a long hard struggle but weve won what kind of world will you make church carlton asked a good one church replied i hope jack tom caught his attention youre a good man dont forget that church placed both hands on the lever and steadied himself he looked to tom and then ruth and drew strength from the absolute trust he saw in their eyes every happy ending is a new beginning come on church pull the lever ruth encouraged he hesitated for a long time her final words were a whisper a prayer a promise from the depths of her heart you can do it church i trust you i love you ill love you always and for ever he pulled the lever
